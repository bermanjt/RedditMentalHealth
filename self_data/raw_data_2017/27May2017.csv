1,"We got the call an hour ago.  We're so ridiculously excited right now.  He's a perfect, healthy baby boy.

However, she has until Monday evening to change her mind so we are *supposed* to be cautiously optimistic so we're not telling siblings, friends, or extended family.  What I really want to do is shout from the rooftop so, reddit, celebrate with us... cautiously.",27May2017,25
3,"So I'm 18 and up until today had never properly kissed a girl. It kind of bothered me but in the back of my mind I always thought at least I'll save it for a girl I actually like. I'd look back on it fondly and cherish the memory when it came. Today me and one of my friend went to a bar and ended up meeting a group of girls we're quite friendly with. A couple of them have kind of flirted with us overtly before, hell they've even kissed him, but it's kind of in the spirit of fun and never taken too serious.

Anyway, today all the girls had left expect one who was waiting on her cab. This girl is one that's always jokingly flirted with me, and while I kind of joked back, I always thought it meant nothing and I was never attracted to her at all. She's also very well known amongst my friends and others for being the most sexually open out of all those girls. As she left she made out with my friend who kissed her back for a few seconds. After that she came and said bye to me and told me she would only give me a small peck on the lips. For some reason my slightly drunk ass took her word for it, but when she went to 'peck' me she full on made out with me too. I kissed back out of instinct for a few seconds (can't say I enjoyed it tbh), but my brain kicked in and realised what was going on and kind of pulled back. She laughed and went home.

But I feel so bad. All that build up and it was just wasted on a stupid moment where I wasn't even thinking enough to realise what was going on. To make it worse it was a girl my friends are just gonna roast me constantly for as she just kisses like every guy she sees, and who I've just never been attracted to in the slightest. To top it off one of the girls she's friends with actually kind of had a thing for me, and I had a slight idea of it, and yet after this I think she won't even want to look at me. And even though I don't really like her back all that much, she's still a good friend and I don't want to have made her angry at me off of some stupid kiss I didn't even think about and wholly regret. Like fuck this man.

**TL;DR:** Never kissed girl, always imagined I'd make out with someone I cared about. Quickly and drunkenly made out with girl who I'm not attracted to today who has kissed all my friends. Fully regret it, and think I might have upset a girl I'm friends with who kind of has a thing for me. Feel like utter shit now.",27May2017,2
4,"I often watch the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It brings out a lot of deep emotions in me, and lets me sort of embrace my mood. 


I also listen to albums and songs that have remind me of times in my life where I felt the same as I do currently. It lets me reflect on my emotions some.

6,"Every time I talk to my dad, it feels like...

you know when there's a really prestigious lab at a university headed by a well-known professor, which has all the resources you could wish for, but when you don't do something miraculous you've disappointed everyone, including the professor? And people wonder how you couldn't possibly reach the greatest heights with that professor? And that professor doesn't really care about you except hoping you produce some amazing research and publications for him?

I feel like his trophy kid, and people around me say I should be lucky to have him as my dad, but I feel none of that. I never have. He treats me like I'm some subordinate person in his office, and I think I'm pretty useless maybe that's the reason. I'm not worth spending time and effort on maybe, and there's a point when he realized that his lottery ticket is a dud.",27May2017,2
7,"You're either just about done with high school or already out, and regardless of whether you go on to college or enter the workforce your childhood is essentially over. You will be expected to act like an adult from now until the day you die...and even when you're not sure how an adult should act in a given situation you'll be expected to 'wing it' convincingly.

I am by no means a religious man, and I rarely quote the Bible unironically, but 1st Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse 11 is incredibly relevant to young people entering adulthood.

""When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.""

It's time to put away childish things and figure out who you're going to be for the rest of your life. The person you are at 18 isn't the person you'll be at 21, and that person will be vastly different from the person you'll be at 30, so if you don't control the transformation the transformation will control you and you may not be happy with the metamorphosis.

I hope that you are able to get through the current turmoil plaguing this country and the world unscathed, and I wish nothing but the best for your future...because YOUR future is OUR future. Eventually it'll be you and your peers running things and I firmly believe that your generation has the potential to be the best one yet in spite of the insults and rhetoric lobbed in your direction. Please don't let us down because there are a lot of people depending on you living up to that potential and fixing the shit that is wrong with our societies, our governments, and our planet as a whole. I know you didn't ""start the fire"" but you will be damn sure responsible for putting it out because if you don't, your children will have to and I don't want to see you do to them what's been done to you.

The best advice I can give is to always strive to be better than those that came before you, learn from history's mistakes and successes, and leave your mark on the world in one way or another.

I wish you the best of luck!

Sincerely,

Someone with hope for the future",27May2017,4
14,"I'm a guy and I work at a football stadium and yesterday was on the stairs to the stadium with 2 new guys and 2 spectators  guys came up to us to fund their seats and one put his arm around me and the ore had his phone held like he was going to take a picture, so I moved away as I hate cameras (I honk I looked miserable doing it the way as I did) he then said so thing pic ting at me to the 2 guys I was working with and then they laughed, he put his arm around my shoulder again and said  ""you're a decent looking guy by the way"" (he looked more serious saying it with a sat right face etc) he then went on to ask me what I think the score will be and how it will go etc, and en he was talking to the other guys I working with and pointed at me and said ""he looks a nice trustworthy guy him doesn't he"" and then in the middle of it he said ""I'll go in. Minute because he probably want to punch me face in"" which he said in good humour, he then pulled his card out and asked where he was sitting to which I went and scanned the card and he said 'good lad, thank you'. Was this a bad thing personally towards me? Idk",27May2017,0
15,"So I've just began my nurse training, I had my second shift yesterday and I can't stop thinking about one experience I had. There was a man with terminal cancer who's carotid artery was haemorrhaging and was expected to bleed out on my shift. I was called in to observe his procedure, removing a clot from a major vein above his carotid artery. It was easily the most gruesome thing I've seen in my life, he was missing a good half of his neck and a section of his head but was still totally conscious and able to have conversation. I handled the gory side okay, I felt. What really shook me was half way through the procedure the consultant pinched off the vein and had to turn away from the patient to collect himself and then turned back to the patient and said ""I don't mean to worry you but I'm going to have another go and... it can go one of two ways"". The procedure was unsuccessful, the vein was ""too necrotic and kept collapsing"" whenever the consultant tried to tie it off but he managed to pinch it with some scissors in the meantime.

I was alright the whole way through but it was at this point I started losing my vision and hearing a ringing in my ears so I had head outside for some air and a drink. Before I could head back into the room I caught the sister who told me the guy was heading into theatre but ""he needs a miracle"" and was essentially going there to die, still I asked if so could observe because I wanted to see it out I guess. This is what really stuck with me from the day and kept me up at night, I then had to chat with this man for an hour and the whole time all I could think is this is likely going to be his last conversation. He was only in his 50s and a really nice man, we chatted about his kids, his childhood holidays, his tattoos and his time in the army.

Then we went down to theatre, the atmosphere was so intensely morbid and the surgeon warned me that it might get to a point that they need me out of the theatre. It might sound dramatic but I actually sincerely prayed for the first time in my life before heading in, for the man and for the surgeons. 30 minutes later the procedure was done and a total success, I went back up to the ward with him and the sister told me she still expects him to bleed out tonight. 

So that was like 3 hours of my 12 hour shift, outside of that I did lots of obs, made lots of beds and saw a leg amputation. I just felt like letting people know about this because it's literally all I can think about today.",27May2017,3

18,"Found out a friend from high school died Thursday night.


It's that same old story about how I hadn't seen him in years, how I regret not reaching out to him, how this was so sudden and he was only a young man, I think he would have been 26 or 27. I heard afterwards that he'd moved several states away with his mom, had been in and out of the hospital. But remembering the times we spent together I came to realize exactly how much he had changed me.


In a time when I had very few friends he was one of the best friends I had. We actually dated briefly, but our friendship lasted much longer than that. He was a weird kid. That's for certain. Big into computers. Super smart. He taught us how to use Linux and how to use packet sniffers, the difference between a router and a switch, how to wire computers to a network and send messages through command prompt.


There was one month where he disappeared for a week, and came back from Pennsylvania with a schoolbus he'd bought online. He pulled out the seats and tried to make it into a camper. It didn't work. It was so much fun. I didn't know anyone who did anything like that.


He always drove suburbans - big old beasts with solid steel bumpers and the child molester sort of tinted windows. We would all pile in - six or eight of us - in the back and go to someone's house to play with old computers. He taught us to be nostalgic about things we'd never experienced.


There are so many other memories I had buried - for the last few years I just remembered high school as a place of misery and loneliness, as a social outcast. I can't remember being sad with Will. I remember a lot of things - curiosity, amazement, wonder, a sense of adventure. Who else would buy an antique Mercedes with the fabric ceiling falling down, a hole in the back floor and a collapsed bench seat? Just because nobody else had it. He wanted to buy a decommissioned fire truck - because nobody else had one. He wanted to break into the closed mental hospital and live in a school bus and build a supercomputer out of late 1990s parts because nobody else had done it.


I've grown up a lot since we last saw each other, but he stayed the same to me. A tall, gangly, goofy kid with a silly impression of his grandmother, driving a weird car he got off the internet, who taught me how to be curious about the world and everything in it.


Thank you, Will.",27May2017,1
20,"Hello! I like to sing and I've studied it for some time, but I regularly feel like I'm just wasting my time doing it. I never really believe when friends tell me I'm talented because well, they're friends. So I thought ""why not expose myself in the internet and let some people I don't know tell me what they think of it"". Well, here it is, be honest (although I know I don't need to ask for this here) https://youtu.be/4TJjejzt2bQ",27May2017,1
24,"**TL;DR on the bottom.**

I'm going to be regarded as legal adult before 2018 comes along, and I'm hoping to move out by then. Living with my mother is becoming more and more stressful as the weeks pass by, considering that she doesn't have a job and we're relying on child support and her friends to pay for our utilities and rent money. Our apartment is usually in a mess as well, even after I try to keep it clean for just one day. It's tiring. Family issues have become more intense this month due to my slightly anti-social behavior, and that energy keeps inviting itself into our home. 

Since I was a kid, I've suffered from depression due to a traumatic past. My condition has improved bit by bit over time, but it's returning again, and worsening my anxiety. In its relevance, my family keeps turning the past against us once more. I want to get out of this house -the area, overall. 

However, considering I'll be working part-time and I'll begin my online college studies by August 2018 or January 2019, I've been determining which one of my friends could become a good roommate, so there would be financial aid -as well as a social adventure- in the matter. My only ""certain"" option is my best friend (starting his second year in college soon), who I dated nearly two years ago for a little over six months. Yet, he has been a wonderful familiar before the relationship, and he returned to that position after a lengthy period of silence. We share many things in common, and he's already gained experience in a flatting situation. Yet, I believe he still has feelings for me. I am not aware of any reciprocated emotions of my own towards him, but I understand it's a risky situation.

**Update:** Rooming with strangers is a no-go for me, due to the fact that there are many drug dealers/addicts, delinquents, and lazy brats where I'm at. Meeting new people is an obvious solution, but it's very difficult for me to maintain friendships as much as its complicated for me to approach anyone with ease. I don't know how to socialize correctly, to put it plainly.  

**TL;DR:** I don't have many suitable friends to bunk in with me as roommates. My ex-boyfriend has only really been a great friend to me for almost three years (dated for only six months), but I'm just looking for rent assistance and companionship. I am too shy to make new friends and too distant/(seemingly ""complicated"") to maintain friendships. If nothing else, is it even emotionally safe to consider my ex, even though he's a good friend?",27May2017,1
25,"I don't believe that to Putin, simply influencing how the citizens vote would ever count was ""Undermining US Democracy"". He didn't just influence votes, he set Trump up for the long con. 

The true goal of undermining democracy would be to setup a politician from the beginning, get him in office, tear him down with leaks, rumors and other negative press.  It wouldn't just stop there, they would have worked from the beginning to influence potential cabinet members and essentially, the top 3 or 4 people in line for the presidency.

If you are able to do all of the above and end up putting the 4th or 5th standing member in line to be president, in power as the president, you have fully and entirely dismantled the system. The peoples votes no longer matter, the Electoral College no longer matters, and a person who never would have been elected to the office is now inserted.  Now, you have fully dismantled the fundamentals of US Democracy.

I may sound like a Trump sympathizer.  I'm not. I do believe the Putin is working to unravel our system and there is a good chance we are still seeing his long con, in action.  Trump (and much of his cabinet impeachment) might be Putin's end goal, not just ""who the people in the electoral college states vote for"". At the end of the day, the people still voted for the person in office. The broken system, still functioned in that broken manner.",27May2017,2
26,"The only reason I want a job or a college degree is so that I can become independent and never have to deal with them again.  

I constantly feel like I'm in the middle of a war zone when I'm around them. They're always arguing amongst themselves and talking shit about the others to me, and yet they wonder why I never want to do anything with them. My dad really values having dinner together as a family but I don't think I can recall a single family dinner where there wasn't a big argument.  

Yeah, we're a great family unit dad, if by ""great"" you mean ""dysfunctional."" I am so much fucking happier when I'm not around any of them. I just want to move out as soon as possible so that they can no longer force me to interact with them or do shit I don't want to do because ""if I don't like it I can go live somewhere else.""  

Just to clarify, I don't hate my parents. I'm just tired of being around them and all the fighting constantly. I would visit them after moving out, *on my own terms*. I think we would have a better relationship if I didn't live with them.",27May2017,3
28,"I wouldn't have normally done this because it's retarded and I know that the only depressive episode I've ever had in my entire life was because I saw a picture of her that said ""bad"" on it. For a frame of reference I'm 23 and she's 20. She wanted to be an actress and I wanted to make movies, I still do. This is all irrelevant information kinda, I'm just using it as filler because as I type this my hands are shaking from some sort of residual anxiety from seeing her now, reading her tweets, and seeing that she got her nosed pierced, which I kind of like actually but that's beside the point. 

I suppose I'm writing this because I have no one to actually talk to about me doing this. My best friend is sleeping right now, my roommate's at work, I don't have another meeting with my therapist for 2 weeks, and I can't talk to me family about this because A) it's my family and who ever wants to do that and B) They're a huge reason I left her. To be fair I wanted to for a variety of reasons but I also didn't. I'm not sure how to explain it other than I loved her when she was feeling good and enjoyed her company while we were friends for 5 years and I enjoyed her company after she moved in with me.

Some background story; I was raised to be a muslim and in some menial I suppose I still am, it's just been drilled in my skull. Anyway, she was pretty hard core protestant, going so far as to write me a letter while we were just friends explaining that she loved me and I was such a good friend and that's why she was scared of me going to hell for being a muslim and after I read that part I was so shocked, hurt, and all around caught up in the situation that I couldn't get myself to look at the characters on the page and form coherent thought. Plus I was angry because this was a friend of mine and I've never once thought that God would be human enough to something like that. It's doesn't make any fuckin sense, but I digress.  I'm going to start from the very beginning simply because I need to and I'm doing this for myself, and if I get any comment's that'll be nice I hope but yea, worst case this is just for me. Also, I'm going to get to religion again later and talk about just my feelings on the matter. One final note for anyone who may, but likely won't, read this; She was married during this. I feel like shit about it but I'll get into my justifications later and they got married when they were 18 so they could have sex and they'd never lived together so they were ""married"" and even then it was only a legal marriage, they didn't even tell their parents, alright time to start. 

Okay, so. Her and I were friends in highschool, in school I remember our mutual friend Matt telling me that she would totally date me and that I should I ask her out. I said no because she was even more religious back then and I didn't want to lose a friend, funny how we can be more wise and self controlled when we're young then when we're ""grown ass adults."" Fast forward about 5 years and her and I are hanging out, we go and see a movie, I think it was the Adam Scott Christmas horror movie whose name escapes me at the moment, we decide to go back to my place, because she left her car there. We pull into the driveway of the condo and the whole way she's telling me about how she's going to move to Virginia with her husband and she doesn't know how to do dishes or laundry and some other random household stuff that you just need to know how to do if you're going to be a remotely functional human being. And so, even though I didn't want to(I sort of felt obligated, she was my friend, I cared about her a lot and I didn't want to let her move away and kill herself. I just realized that I didn't mention that so I'll do that in the next paragraph.) I offered to let her stay with me some weekends the month before she left so she could learn to do these things. When I offered that though she got all excited and said ""I can move in now!?"" and she gets very loud and I said ""ye...yea I guess you could."" and then she went home, packed up her shit and moved in with me. For more context, I had recently been put in a position where, at 22 years old, I was going to have to work monday through friday with my mom and my dad at our family business. I was very ready to move out because I was 22 and because the prospect of going to work with my parents and then coming home and living with them sounds fucking atrocious, but that's a-whole-nother can worms. 

So she moves in and everything's okay for a while. She sleeps on the couch, we hang out and watch movies like we used to and then one day I had an extremely shitty day. This time period in my life was one of the hardest and so I was feeling hopeless and for my friends the idea that I would feel like a failure and that I was bound to amount to nothing effected them hugely. I recently found this out and I have no idea why the think that highly of me, I've never really done anything of merit or anything really impressive, I've always regarded my self as ordinary if not sub par. Anyway, I was saying the typical depressed bullshit, ""what's the point, I can't succeed, yada yada yada,"" and this was we were driving to rent some movies. All the sudden she bursts into tears and starts mentioning how everything hurts.

Now I'm caught off guard because she seemed relatively okay before this. So I decide that we'll just drive around for a bit, I very quickly decided that was a bad idea and so we went back to the condo I was staying at (I lived at the condo alone and was in a position where I didn't have to pay nearly what a condo really costs but I'm not going into those details because they are hardly relevant). We sat down on the couch next to each other and she revealed that she was really sad a lot and that she wanted to kill herself almost every single day.

Now this is very concerning to me because she told me that she wrote a story about a girl who marries a guy in the military who, as far as I remember (and I could be wrong on this detail it's about 2-3 years since she told me this story) who she didn't love, and she had a really close guy friend who she cared a lot about and loved and ya'know, book shit happens and the girl moves away to a part of the country where she doesn't know anyone and she's alone. In the end of the story she tries to hang herself with a belt while the husband is away for the military and I think she failed and decided she wanted to live or something like that. I was a little more concerned with the ""hangs herself with a belt"" part, especially after what she had just told me. Now I care a lot about my friends, I see them as extensions of my blood family and I refuse to allow someone I care about to suffer alone. I just can't do it because I know how shit it is and I can't allow that to happen without at least offering my hand. In this moment I don't know what to do though, I was trying to keep my cool so I thought about all the behaviors I see from actors and ways that I learned in my psyche courses that are meant to help someone feel better. 

I put my arm around her and hugged her and what happened during the next couple of minutes is a bit of a blur but she somehow ended up crying into my chest while I held her tightly with one arm and, for lack of a better way to explain this, ""petted"" her head to try and comfort her. And then she told me about what happened to her. Because this was a moment of unfathomable vulnerability, because I will always love her to some small degree, and because it's a matter of her privacy I am not going to disclose the intimate details of what happened to her but I will say that she was almost raped twice, once but one assailant and again by the same man and a small group his friends when she was in the 8th grade. Now, I grew up in a house where my father was extremely masculine so my first reaction to hearing something like this is extraordinary fury, I wanted to taste the blood of fucking cunt who would have the audacity to attempt something not only to a little girl but to my fucking friend. I would still slaughter that fuck if given the chance. 

Obviously I'm not going to allow her to see my fury and I was so emotional I didn't know what to do. So I kissed the top of her head as she cried and I told her that everything was alright and I was there and I'd die before I let something like that ever happen to her again. This went on for awhile. Eventually we calmed down a little bit and it was very late, which would become a common theme of our relationship, and we needed to sleep. But I wasn't comfortable with her sleeping alone on the couch because I was afraid that she may get up in the middle of the night and sneak out and kill herself so I said something like 'I'd feel more comfortable if you slept with me tonight, I don't want you to be alone.'

I will take this moment to say to anyone reading, and more importantly to myself, that I had absolutely no intentions of having sex with her that night. Sex was one of the furthest things from my mind at that moment. But good intentions coupled with two people who have a romantic interest in one another but have never discussed it sleeping together inevitable ends up in relations with the other person. 

We didn't have sex, not for a while at least. The next night she slept with me again, I didn't mention it earlier bur she had 3 night terrors the first night and the second night where I had to restrain her and stroke her head again to relax her. I told her ""I'm here, nothing's going to hurt you. It's just me."" How fucking ironic. 
the third night she only had 2 night terrors so I thought it was helping. Plus I found it relaxing to hold someone as I slept and I've always had a hard time sleeping. After the first night neither of us really said anything about her sleeping in bed with me. We never mentioned it in the beginning because, I later found out, that she wanted to continue sleeping with me. And to be honest I didn't want her to stop. Yes she was married but it didn't matter in the moment, it almost felt like she wasn't really married. 

Time passed her and I got closer and closer, eventually she kissed me(which was fuckin awesome I might I add), then making out but she wouldn't let me touch her sexually until she told her husband that she wanted a divorce. She went to florida, where he was at the time, and told him. She came back and not more than a day or two after that our relationship became sexual. To be clear, it was just dry humping feeling through clothes but I think that it's sexual since because our goal in that was to make the other person orgasm. I realize that this is very intimate detail and may be gross to some of you but again, I'm recounting this for my own sanity and the process of making love is something very holy to me. I've only had sex with her and that was because I truly loved this woman. I truly thought that I would be with her for the rest of my life. Eventually we did move on to actual intercourse and we decided to make it official for the two of us, she was my girlfriend and I was happy.

As I tell this story I see the red flags but there's a quote from Bojack horsemen that perfectly represents my view on that situation and I'll leave that to you to find. I want to establish that I am no ""perfect"" man"" as if that being could exist; I was not happy with myself being a virgin at 22 but I didn't want to lose my virginity to someone who I didn't love and who didn't love me. That said we were both young and sex was very frequent in our relationship I don't know how long after our first time that I told her that I loved her. But I do know this. I told her I loved while I was still inside of her after we had finished, I was the first to say it in our relationship, and I meant it to the fullest extant. 

I'd love to keep going but I am tired, I'm hungry(it's ramathan and I'm fasting), I'm not anxious anymore, I'm just bummed. That's all. Just bummed. The longer I go on with this story the more I know that it wouldn't have worked out between us, but the person she seems to have become after we broke up isn't the person who I loved enough to throw my life away and it makes me sad. That's all. I know I have no right to think that way but I can't stop it. I loved her. It hurts me to think that she likely actively wants me to be a failure. I stand by my decision to leave her both times but that doesn't mean I wanted to. It merely means that I needed to. 

After this all happened I was talking to my mother and she said that classically repeated phrase, ""It's better to love and lost then to have never loved at all."" But I would challenge those who find solace in that statement. I would ask that they consider this, are you sure you have ever truly loved someone?   ",27May2017,5

My first lasted four years and my second two months. I feel as if I did not get a chance to really show who I am but was just flat-out ignored. My first was monogamous and my second I gave polyamory a try. Apparently I am too lovey and affectate; what is wrong that? I only want to share love and affection for a significant other. Has everyone decided that guys like me are to be left in solitude? I am barely able to focus, most of my thought is just me trying to wrestle with being alone and without a future partner. Bars are not good no more. The mall is only good if you are still in high school and I don't go to church because I just don't fit in, period. I have left my comfort zone plenty but nothing came. I am wondering if this isolation is better than having anyone because I wouldn't have anyone to lose? I wanted to say something because in person it seems to be taboo if you talk about negative life events. I am sorry if this is jumbled I just feel super super down and left out to dry. ",27May2017,1
33,"A little back story: I was once fat, lost 70 lbs, and gained almost all of it back. I just started the trip back down today.  

Running fucking sucks. And it's worse when you do it in a public place. The gym is usually where I went before I dropped off the wagon, but I couldn't bring myself to go back yet, so I went to the park. This group of teenagers showed up. I didn't think anything of it, but I didn't realize I was worried about what they thought until one of them stopped me.   

He stopped me to congratulate me on running and told me that I was doing a good job. God damn that felt so good, and I really needed it.  

If you happen to Reddit and see this, thank you so much.",27May2017,382
35,"Dad has been sick for a long time. But then something happened in the last week and they found the cause but the risks of surgery may not outweigh the benefits of what the surgery will fix... but they need to fix it. Which is a paradox, I know... but my friends... I don't know what to think or do or... I don't know anything anymore.

I'm sorry for this being a downer. I just wanted to tell someone who doesn't know me.",27May2017,9
37,"As a person (17 Male) who wasn't born with the best of looks, I have found through time that having long hair is a good way to hide some of my face so people don't look at me. However, the exact opposite has been happening to me lately.

Not a lot of guys have long hair these days (mine is probably longer than 18 inches long), so I am constantly finding people looking at me. I constantly get people asking me why I don't cut my hair, and I just say that it's because I like it that way. Everyone from strangers to people who I guess I would consider to be my friends tell me that I need to cut it, but my hair is one of the only defense mechanisms I have. And since I don't dress very masculine, I am always being called ""ma'am"" and ""lady"" by people, which is always so embarrassing and awkward, especially when a lot of people are around. And since nobody in my real life knows that I'm gay, my friends always laugh and joke about it. My long hair looks stupid, but I'd feel too exposed without it.

Sorry if this isn't the right subreddit for this. I just need someone to express myself to, and since I can't find myself talking extensively about anything with anybody, I thought I'd become as vulnerable as I can make myself, and give Reddit a shot. If this post isn't supposed to be here, sorry. I can delete it.",27May2017,2
38,"So I was driving home yesterday and I get to this intersection moving really slowly. There's two lanes, and I'm in the left lane behind a cop. We all want to left turn, but only 5 cars, at most, move per green light. There's an intersection light specifically for left turns, and another for straight and right turns.

I get closer to the intersection. The non-left-turn light turns green, but the left-turn light stays red. Cars start moving on my right side, and so does my lane as well. After all, the other side of the intersection isn't moving, as if they have a delayed green light.

-------------------------------

The car that is two cars in front of me turns left, and immediately the cop between that car and me flashes his lights and catches him. I drive up to the intersection - there's a gigantic line of cars behind me, the left-turn light is red, the non-left-turn light is green. Most cars in this lane have been left turning when the non- light is green, because the non- light hasn't turned green at all since I got into this traffic. However, the most recent car to do that was stopped by a policeman.

I make the split-second decision to drive forward instead. I'd rather take the detour than risking official action. Maybe it seems obvious to you guys, maybe I'm just a bit lacking in common sense. But I feel good that I saved myself some potentially big trouble by doing that. And sometimes, I wonder - what if I had been a little faster getting to my car? What if I was the one in front of that cop, and I had made the bad left turn?

---------------------------

It was like the old question

    If all your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?

And in that moment, I almost did. When you've been sitting in the left-turn lane for 15 minutes, watching the left-turn light stay red while all the other lights turn green several times, turning left would've taken no more than a couple of seconds and you would've been out of that jam. But I'm just so glad that I'm not in hot water, that I was behind and not in front of that cop.

I'm being too dramatic, aren't I?",27May2017,2
40,"My state of mind has been in a downward spiral for a long time now. And just last night I had a fight with the one person I thought cared about me &amp; that gave me reason to keep going through all the bullshit. 
I'm tired &amp; I'm numb now. I don't want to be around anyone but I am becoming increasingly agitated being alone. Maybe this will be the day, maybe I'll finally love myself enough to tap out.",27May2017,5
41,"I lost my dad yesterday and it was easily the toughest day of my life. I've cried more than ever and my chest still hurts today from doing so and it hurts even more when the tears come back. 

I know my dad wasn't the best, but at the same time he was. He was my friend first and a parent second, and I know people will say that's not the way it should be, but it's the way it was. He helped me hide stuff from my mom when I was in grade school so I wouldn't get in as much trouble as I normally would, but he'd still get me back on the right track. We used to smoke cigarettes and have coffee every morning when I was figuring out my life and dropping out of college to find a career in fashion, now I'm a technician that works with satellites. 

He was sick for a while, in the past 10 years he's had 3 major heart attacks, got hit by a car (like his body was struck and his foot exploded) lots of medical problems. On top of that he smoked a lot of cigarettes and dabbled in every drug under the sun in his lifetime. Now I'm not saying his death completely caught us off guard, but what did catch me is how much I'd miss him. He'd always greet me when I visited with a big hug and had a nickname only he would call me. 

I know it's only the second day and things will get 'easier' or 'better' but for now it still sucks. When my GF and I found out we were pregnant. He was the only one who wasn't disappointed, or shocked about it. He just hugged me while he cried and said ""you're gonna make a great father"". And I hope I do, but now I can never ask him for advice on how to do stuff. I know there's YouTube and the internet and my mom, but it's just different, I don't want their advice, I want his. 

I'm gonna look for signs of him hanging around. Thanks for letting me post here. Thanks for letting me vent about missing my dad. Thanks for just listening. ",27May2017,5
