0,"So my 19 year old cat who lives at my parents house because my significant other is allergic and we have two dogs. Is currently dying he started last night. Now I've had this cat since I was 10 years old and it appears as though the cat is waiting for me to be with him for him to pass. My significant other has started a fight and would not give me a ride because we currently only have one vehicle to my parents to go see the. So I had to have a cousin come pick me up and she has not messaged me or spoken to me since. Is she being selfish am I wrong what do you guys think?

Edit.... forgot to add

Her and I have been together 8yrs not the first time she has made me choose between family and things I care about or her..... She wanted to go shopping that was her Major issue

1,"This is not a post for /r/SuicideWatch .

But hear me out. I'll try to be short.

I make more than anyone in my family combined. This includes cousins/aunts/etc. I don't come from money, but I started to make this amount in a very short period of time (<5 years). From zero.

I grew up poor. So all my hobbies are low cost: fishing, hiking, biking, gaming. All my friends came from more or less the same background.
All my life I wanted to make a comfortable living, so now that I have achieved it more or less - I'm not sure what do I want to do.

Travel doesn't excite me, neither do sports cars. Even spending money on myself fill me with regret afterwards: ""Did i really need that $5 shirt?"". Charity sounds cool, but i don't have  enough resources to make much change. Actually, probably the thoughts of not working and doing charity is what keeps me going at this point. 

The problem is that I feel down. I don't have a clear goal, nor do I have ideas for any. There's no ""Master-plan"" for my life anymore. 
Tried talking to friends and relatives - hoped for understanding, but they project and tell me that I should do what they want to do (go travel, buy a bespoke suit, buy a cool car, fuck models).But i don't want that crap. Some laughed at me for having this problem. 

I wish someone who was in a similar situation could tell me what they did. 

Thank you for listening.",13Aug2017,4
3,"I don't have words to express how useless this all feels. I really thought the people in my country were beyond hating each other based on skin color, based on sexual orientation, based on political affiliation. Today, I saw a video of a Dodge Ram crashing into a group of people in Charlottesville.

How am I supposed to watch something like that and feel anything but despair?

I'm a thousand miles away. There's nothing that I can physically do to end the hatred and violence that's taking place in my country. I wish that I could change people's minds, challenge their prejudices and the way they think. But it seems that when people's beliefs are challenged, they only hold on to them tighter.

I don't want to live in a world where identity is based around politics.

I hate this.",13Aug2017,16
4,"Ever since school started two weeks ago I've been literally incapable of not thinking about girls at every moment. I now find almost all of them at my school so attractive and it's so insanely distracting and embarrassing like in math class I didn't even realize I was staring at this girl sitting across from me and my teacher called me out and she laughed at me. I've never felt like this before about girls, this came out of nowhere and it won't stop. 

Why are girls so cute? It causes me physical pain. I hate myself and I wanna die now because when I talk to them and they show interest I get turned on and have to find an excuse to walk away. Like this really pretty girl I've been talking to went out of her way to pick up a pencil for me yesterday and and I was so choked up I couldn't even say ""thank you."" WHY AM I SUCH AN IDIOT!? She literally won't leave me alone and everytime she comes up to me she has this laugh that's just so perfect I die. 

She's my partner in art class so it gets worse. She was reaching for something on one of the shelves today and the way she stands on her toes to get something high up kills me it's so cute I don't know why. I just can't get out of my head the thought of kissing her and her having to stand like that to reach up to me. She's so cute and perfect and I just want to  kiss her to the point I can't even pay attention in class. It's so awkward we had to trace eachother's hands and she asked why I was so ""nervous"" to paint and my heart was beating so freaking fast. Today she asked for my number AND I WAS SO CAUGHT OFF GUARD I FORGOT IT! 

I literally have never forgotten it before I can't believe this! When that happened she said ""that's ok! Give me your arm"" with this beautiful smile and I just rolled up my sleeve for her and then she painted her's below my wrist. I was so flustered she had to have noticed my heart racing because she held my hand with her other one to steady my arm so she could paint it. I COULDN'T EVEN HOLD STILL it was so freaking embarrassing!!! I STILL have her number painted on me and at soccer practice it was so embarrassing when people asked about it! I never noticed until i was changing for practice that she painted a heart next to it and IT WOULDN'T COME OFF IN THE SINK!!!!

I need help I don't know what to do everytime a girl talks to me I get so freaking turned on. Like at the morning assembly there's this insanely hot Asian girl who sits next to me and I was thinking ""oh Gosh please don't talk to me"" but she started complimenting me on my tie again but this time RIGHT BEFORE the pledge of allegiance and I couldn't stand up because I got so hard! F*CK! I HATE MYSELF! I hate this ITS SO HUMILIATING I need help does this ever stop am I broken?!?! Should I tell them how I feel? 

TL;DR
Girls are ruining my life because I'm suddenly really attracted to them. Some of them have expressed interest in me and it's lead to some awkward moments and I just don't know what to do at this point. Please help!? ",13Aug2017,139

13,"So two years ago I had a septoplasty to fix my deviated septum, afterwards everything was pretty peachy. I could finally breathe out of both nostrils, yay! That didn't last. I'd say about six months after I started getting nasal congestion, but I kind of ignored it and it didn't bother me too much.

Now it's two years after my surgery and my nose is driving me up the fucking wall. My nose is constantly dry on one side, and sometimes both sides. It feels like I can never get enough air. Whenever I lay down or sit down my nose feels stuffed, but only one side. 

And before anybody says this is the 'nasal cycle'. It's not. It feels like the side that's congested is super swollen, but all I have to do is turn over and the other side is now congested within a minute or two. Before my surgery I used to be able to blow my nose and get mucus out, now I just don't even have mucus really. I don't even have boogers anymore. I can't remember the last time I had a booger. It's fucking weird. It's so dry up there and nothing helps.

Generally when I'm standing I get a bit more relief, I can breathe out of both nostrils mostly okay, sometimes it will feel like it does when I'm lying down, and sometimes I'll get this magical time where I can breathe out of both nostrils perfectly and I crave those moments, but they're so very rare. 

Over the past five or six months I've been on a mission to find out what can help. I'm becoming obsessed to where it's taking up my every waking thought. It doesn't really help that I had anxiety about not being able to breathe before this, so I'm pretty much manually breathing 70% of the time when I'm awake, which makes me notice the congestion even more, which makes me anxious and so on and so on. It's a fucking nightmare. 

I've tried everything I can at this point. Saline nasal sprays, saline washes, the 'flip turn sinus rinse', flonase, nasacort, claritin, zyrtec, ayr nasal moisturizing gel, breathing in hot steam, taking hot showers, sudafed, mucinex, breathe right strips, humidifier, pounding glasses of water throughout the day, cold and hot compresses, pretty much fucking everything at this point.

Some of it gives me mild relief and occasionally I'll get a lot of relief like when I tried sudafed for the first time, but I never know if I'm just having a good day or if it's actually working. Sometimes I can take nothing for days and I'll breathe just fine. It doesn't change depending on where I sleep or anything though. If I go outside it's a little bit better, but not much, and sometimes it's worse. I just don't know what to do anymore. I've tried everything at CVS, and nothing helps. 

I wish I could afford to go back to an ENT, but I just can't. It's too expensive without insurance, so I guess I'm going to have to live with this hell until I can find a job and get insurance. I just needed to vent, and if you have some crazy method that maybe I haven't tried hit me with it I'm willing to try anything.

Edit: I guess I forgot to say I'm having no symptoms outside of the congestion while lying down and the dryness. No sneezing, runny nose, pain, swelling of face, itching, abnormal mucus color, nothing like that. Well there is one thing I guess, but I couldn't find anything about it online. Sometimes I'll snort out some mucus that's incredibly thick and sticky, almost like a piece of wet cauliflour in consistency, but really sticky and stark white. Not sure wtf that is. ",13Aug2017,13

17,"Normally, I would have written this on my profile, but this subreddit has a lot more readers. My message is as follows.  
  
1. Not everyone who are right wing belongs to the alt right. There is a current push by the left and the mainstream media to identify everyone on the right as members of the alt right. For example, Stefan Molyneux and Dr. Jordan Peterson are mischaracterized as alt right. These two men, along with Donald Trump, Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, Mike Cernovich, Bill Mitchell, Steve Banon, and most Trump supporters are not alt right.  
  
2. The alt right was coined by Richard Spencer and it specifically means the promotion of white supremacy and white identitarianism. The alt right believes that the United States should be a white ethno state. Everyone on the list in the first point is not a part of the alt right since they don't believe in this kind of stuff. In fact, Richard Spencer hates Paul Watson.

18,"I hate watching the news. I hate politics. I hate discourse. I hate debates.

Well, not really. I hate what those things represent--that something's wrong and it's my civic duty to fix them before a totalitarian government takes away another one of my freedoms. 

Paradoxically, the urgency makes it harder to get myself to do it. It's like I'm catatonic. Ashamed as I am to say it, calling my representatives is something I can only rarely be arsed to do. Watching the news makes my eyes glaze over. I force myself to do it. Policy and politics make me want to hurl. I want to say I don't care. 

I really don't fucking care, but I have to care! Because I'm a minority and I don't want to fuck my own life and the lives of others like me at the hands of some policy or some hate group that I could've helped thwart. 

I don't want to have to do things. I mean, realistically, I don't have to do anything. But I can't, in good conscience, not do anything. But I also don't want to do anything.

So I'm sitting here anxiously, forcing myself to read BBC articles (and please don't fucking chime in about how the BBC is biased one way or another, I dunno if I could stomach intelligently contrasting the information with another source, even though I know it's important and I can't for opinions with biased source material).

I know I have to be informed, be active, be loud, fight fight fight, but I don't want to. I know I'm a bad American and a bad citizen and should be shamed or worse, I'll have what's coming to me when policy I didn't vote for and groups I didn't condemn lynch me. 

Maybe I'm too idealistic and believe that it could never happen to me in my country. Or maybe I'm just lazy and believe that others will fight for me. I don't know, but I want to know what inspires those who are fighting to fight the way they do.

You'd think seeing the mistreatment of people like me would be enough to make me angry. And in a way, it does make me angry. Yet, I still don't really want to pick up the phone or dig deeply into a piece of news. 

Do those that fight just ignore the ""want"" and just force yourselves to fight? I don't have that willpower. I know I should, I know that if I don't, it's partly my fault when things I don't like eradicate me and my kind from the planet. 

I don't know. If America decides to have a second civil war, I apologize. I was too busy skipping out on my civic duty.",13Aug2017,1
19,"Hi Reddit. This is my first post and I have no idea what I am doing and if I am even in the right subreddit but I needed some help and this was the first place I thought I could go. I know many of u may ask why I don't just ask my doctor about my situation but my physician is one of those doctors that completely disregards their patients and seems to flat out despise the earth and everything on it. 
A little bit of backstory to explain my confusion.
So I recently fractured my left arm (radius and ulna area just under the wrist) mountain biking. I had a long arm cast for about 3-4 weeks and I was recently changed to a short lower arm cast about a week ago. My injury was a bit atypical I guess because I was referred from my family doctor to a orthopedist to a hand specialist with all of them saying this was one of the first cases of my injury they had seen. 
Although my injury was to the area just under my wrist, I find myself having extreme difficulty straightening my arm. I have looked online and have found that your muscles will weaken/atrophy and your elbow will hurt after a long period in a cast, but I was told my elbow was fine (no fracture/break) and moving it not only causes extreme pain, but results in a huge cracking pop when I extend my arm beyond about 90 degrees. 
I know I may be overreacting but I am only 17 and very much enjoy taking part in outdoor activities and hope for a speedy and full recovery. Thanks! ",13Aug2017,5

28,"I have this mystery I can't solve. This is actually more appropriate for r/relationships, but since the friendship does not exist anymore I'll post here.

A few years ago I had this girlfriend, but I didn't love her. I think we were both feeling alone so our relationship worked for a while. This story is not about her, but you'll need this information to understand the rest of this story.

I also had this friend, who was not only gorgeous but very, very sexy. I can't describe, she had this ""thing"". The way she talked, her smile, her accent, her intelligence... I was honestly very attracted to her. She didn't show any attraction to me, apparently. So we remained friends. I always went looking for her just so we could talk. She was very smart and our conversations were always great. Her attractiveness aside, I had an honest friendship with her. She was different, in a very intrigue way.

She had this kind of boyfriend at the time. But he was strictly religious and they didn't even kiss. I saw both of them together just once. They didn't kiss, but they rubbed each other's neck.

She always talked about him and how he was the right man for her. And they were waiting until the marriage (she was also very religious, but I doubt she was as strict as him, as will be clear in a second).

One day. though, I was talking to her after my class and she asked me to go have a walk with her. We walked for a while, she wanted to show her favorite place on our campus. She brought me to the biology institute in our university, which is full of trees everywhere. We went inside the ""woods"" and got to this huge water tank. Really huge. The tank was surrounded by trees and no one was there.

She climbed the tank and I went after her. We lie down at the top of the tank watching the stars and talking.

Her boyfriend became the topic of conversation at one time (I didn't know him at that time, so I asked about them), but she changed the subject to talk about some of her ex boyfriends. And she gave me details that I wasn't expecting. She told me how she was naked to one of them at that one time... and how she had intense sex with another one. Like ""we almost broke the bed"" intense, or ""we just left the room to buy food, for one whole week"". I can't remember if she said she missed all that sex, but I'm certain that they were enjoyable memories for her.

My penis was screaming. My mind was full of thoughts. For me, in my head, I was certain she had needs and I was there to give what she seemed to want. I know I wanted her, this is the certainty I've always had.

But for some reason my then girlfriend popped on my mind and I couldn't make any move after that. I knew I didn't love her, I wasn't attracted to her as I was to this friend I'm telling you about... but we had something, even though it was not truthful, and because of that I thought it would be wrong to cheat on her.

So at the end of the night me and my friend didn't do anything, I did not make any move and neither did she. We talked and after one or two hours we left. So the mystery will always haunt me. Did she really wanted to have sex with me at the top of the biology water tank?

It would be definitely my best sex...

Or am I imagine things?",13Aug2017,2

31,"This is a list of things that my sister did that has pissed me off and made me not trust her.

Anytime she needed a babysitter for her kids either my wife and I watched them or my daughter babysitted them. We helped her get them off the bus. Her kids are not behaved at all. Every time they were over the kids destroyed something. Everyone agrees in the family that they're out of control. My sister and her husband simply sit there and watch as the children go insane no matter what location you put them in.

But it gets better. My sister enjoys talking to my son and brother about our parenting skills. She also enjoyed starting major trouble for no reason. Telling my son that if he gets a job she will help him get to work and help him with rides. She also claimed she would help him get a vehicle which no one told her to do or even asked.

So he gets the job even though we wanted to help him get through school first. We didn't want him losing focus on school due to the many hours job required. We also didn't have good transportation so getting him back in forth would be a nightmare. More stress. So he gets job and she never helps him learn to drive and refuses to help him get back in forth.

She also tells him that it's all his money so he doesn't have to do anything for his mother and father. We wanted him to save up and had no interest in taking his stuff but my sister put this into his head anyway. She repeatedly put shit on us while pretending to be helpful and caring. But in the end Dawn and I ended up having to do it all.

It's a juggling act getting him to work and soon he will be transferred to another location far away.

But there is much more. Everytime I go to my grandfather for advice or help he babbles on about how she screwed him over in some way so now he won't do shit for anyone based on her and others not doing what they say...which might I add has nothing to do with me at all. 

My sister has lied to me and my children. If her husband knew the shit she said about him he would puke and most likely leave. She has told her friends horrific stories about the family that are not true. This is why she reminds me of my mother. My mother made promises she never kept. Made up shit about people causing Hell on Earth.

There is tons more I could go on about but I'm not inspired enough to write a novel this morning. I hope the best for my sister but my life has been so much better now that she is not in it any longer.

35,"This is gonna be a super long crush story. And I just want advice or an opinion

Alright so I was at Six Flags in June. For an end of the year school trip. During the later part of the day, I was on line for a sky car, to take me to the other side of the park. I was with my best friend and I was in a bad mood. Cuz I hadn't eaten yet and was getting tired. So me and my best friend are on line, not talking to each other.

I was just looking around and when I turned my head to the left was a freshman (I was a junior btw, well I'm a senior in 3 weeks) that I had never talked to before. I didn't know her so I didn't say anything. But then she smiles at me and says hi. I was still in a pissy mood so I looked away. 

But because I'm not an asshole, I looked back at her and said hiya. And she just kept looking at me and didn't say anything. Then went back to talking to her friends. I thought maybe she's just really friendly and wants to greet upperclassmen that she recognizes. But then why didn't she also say hi to my friend? So as I worked my way up to the front of the line, she started talking to me again. It was super random, but she started complimenting me. 

She said that she really likes my voice. And that every time she heard me talk throughout the school year, my voice sounded ""soothing"" to her. She told me my voice was ""refreshing"". But as far as I remember we've never spoken before, so apparently she listens to my voice when I pass by her. But  I've never noticed and have hardly seen this girl in school. 

So like the big dork I am I just started smiling and blushing and said thank you. Then I told her that I really like her sunglasses and her aesthetic. I asked if her hair color was natural (it was auburn ish), she told me it wasn't and I told her that it's really pretty. 

Then we stopped talking again and me and my friend got into the sky car. I wish I had invited her to ride with us though. From then I kinda developed a crush (after a 2 min convo lol) and she's really pretty, but I have no way to talk to her over the summer. And the last day of school was the very next day and we had a half day assembly. 

And so I kept looking at her. She was in a group with her friends and was getting an award, so we didn't talk at all. But I absent mindedly applauded when I heard her name being announced, even though I had only known her name for a day. 

 I've been following her on instagram for a long while, but I had no idea it was her (cuz she doesn't have selfies on her ig, just photos she takes), but I guess I followed her cuz we had mutuals. I'm seeing that she's liking a lot of Kpop posts, specifically Exo and BTS. So now I'm thinking I should get into kpop and listen to their music and just randomly bring it up if I ever get the chance to talk to her. But I kinda don't like kpop now that I've tried listening to it. 

I go back to school on September 7, and want to get to know her, maybe even ask her out. But I'm kind of shy and anxious. Especially because we're both girls I don't know if it was just complimenting or flirting. But yea I have a crush on an almost stranger and I don't know what to do. Thanks for reading my ramble!

38,"Honestly, while the website might have a liberal bias, it's common and easy to find thoughtfully written contrary/unpopular opinions where people are engaging meaningfully and having discussions not based around hate but around sharing ideas and conversation. 

Plain and simply, I think there are more people on the right who have shitty reasons for their opinions than people on the left. And to be clear, when I say ""shitty reasons for their opinions"" I am not referring to the content of their opinions, but instead to how they came to the conclusion that created their opinion. (Though full disclosure, I do think there are several opinions on the right that are flat out wrong and incorrect, like those that involve non-whites being less deserving of respect). Of course when someone on the right says nothing more than ""hurr durr snowflakes"" then they are going to be down voted. it's not necessarily because they are on the right; it's because they're making dumb, substanceless, non-contributory comments about opinions that they can't actually defend. And there are lots of people on the right who proudly do it and wear it as a badge of how oppressed they are. They're not being oppressed, they're purposefully making shitty, substanceless comments and then insisting that they are being wrongly down voted for opinions that they can defend **instead of just posting their opinion and it's defense.**

The echo chamber only really comes in because substanceless comments from the right suffer more than those on the left. It's easy to find substanceless left leaning comments that have plenty of up votes. But importantly, I rarely see right leaning opinions on reddit which are substantive and thoughtful being heavily down voted. 

I'm probably going to regret posting this, but I think there are a lot of people who have degraded the value of discussion on reddit by simply dismissing it as biased just because right leaning comments are more likely to end up down voted. If you're only considering the absolute value and not looking at the proportion of thoughtful right leaning comments to low-effort value signaling right leaning comments, then you're not getting the whole picture.

45,"Idk why I have hotel dreams, but I do sometimes.  So I was lost in this hotel, trying to find my room.  I ran into my dad and he was having a very forceful conversation about how my grandparents are the reason why I have my degree and I should be hanging out with them instead of this random girl in my dream.  So it ended with my screaming ""I love grandpa ""name""!  I love grandpa ""name""!  I love ""name""!"" To get my dad off my ass, I kept saying that and when I woke up, those words were so forced that now I feel crazy from my nap. 

I still feel myself trembling, screaming with forced joy when all I wanted to do was cry.  Idk why this dream fucked me up, maybe because they did pay for my college, I'm not blood related to them, and now I just don't care about those people anymore.  Maybe it's the fact my dad was annoyed I was hanging out with a girl in my dream, exploring my sexuality.  He did slap me in my dream when I was shushing him to go away.  Or maybe i felt bi-polar in that conversation when, as far as i know, I'm not (tho my bf thinks i am?)  Idk, I feel mentally unstable now, whatever it was -_-",13Aug2017,2

48,"But I have nowhere to stay and I live in Washington state. Even if I had the money, I'm a 17 year old college student and I legally can't rent a hotel room or anything of the sorts. I have willing family, namely my mother, in my life whom previously assured me (to an extent) I could go with them with a place to stay, but every option unfortunately failed due to unforeseen circumstances and I understand anyone else wouldn't be able to step away from their life that long, however short the timeframe. And to top it all off, I only have two weeks to figure it out or lose out on this opportunity. I have to hope something basically falls out of the sky, just as the opportunity did it the first place. I'm feeling pretty helpless. I feel like all I can do is wait. It sucks for me but it sucks more because it doesn't just suck for me; there's another side to this story. I know I'm not entitled to anything and I'm not blaming anyone else for their inability to drop their life, time, and money for mine, in fact, I rather do this all on my own, but I am not in the position to make those kinds of things happen yet. I'm close, but not yet.

LA is where my favourite person in the whole world will be during this time and I won't get to see her again until December, otherwise: My classes start again in late September. It's worth noting this feeling of favouritism, among all others, is mutual and the desire to be with her isn't hasty either: Meeting up together there when her and her family are is mutually established between her family and mine on the condition I'd have a place to stay.

We're extremely close so waiting to be together again won't hurt us in the greater sense by any means, but it doesn't mean it will be painless. Together we can't figure out any more solutions and I don't want to put any more pressure on her to help find one. Her mother, whom my special someone is staying with at a family member's house, trusts and admires me a great deal, but between me and my beloved, we can see that, reasonably and understandably (albeit not for reasons or fears I personally would ever attempt), most people, particularly her father, would not go for staying in the same house. We haven't asked but you don't necessarily have to grasp the laws of rocket science to know the odds are astronomically low.

Above all else, she is my best friend, I am hers, we get each other on every level and have endless, unfathomable similarities, even with our differences; she's everything that I ever needed or wanted in life. She gave me a purpose that I truly albeit acceptably never had. ""Oh but you're so young, you're just being naive and clingy! There's lots of people in the world, you know!"" Well, we aren't the only people who think so nor are we seeking validation. It's a sight best seen with your own eyes; a story best written your way. We say we're soulmates, but you can call it what you like. It's far from impossible to find solid compatibility in this world and it would be naive to think that you can only find it with one person, but there's certainly a best person, especially from a mathematical standpoint. So add unconditional commitment, too, and you get a soulmate.

I can wait more. I know that. As can she. I also know that. We just want to be together. Simple enough, right?

If anyone needs clarification on anything or a left out detail, I'll clarify up to a point where I retain at least some privacy and security.",13Aug2017,1
49,"This shit hole today is nothing but the insufferable transparent irony of the same wastes of human intelligence who scream how one individual does not represent a group any time a Mohammad Bin Dogfucker blows himself up, exploiting the actions of one asshole to fan their hate speech against the entire right and right-wing subreddits. In the real world meanwhile, I'm hanging out in the middle of the most liberal state in the union, and a) nobody gives two bits of shit about yesterday's rally or is discussing it, and b) if they did/when they do, nobody appropriates Nazis, calls for the culling of right-wing speech, or says any of the idiotic shit this website is shilling on its front page. In summary: if you are someone with Nazi memes in your past 24-hour post history, I sincerely your hope you and your family die tonight.",13Aug2017,0

52,"While the title may sound like something a teenager would write, I'm actually a 32 yo guy living with his parents again after going back to college later in life, finishing the program and now job hunting.  It's shameful to be living with them at this age but hey, at least I'm not going into further debt during this lean period.   
While my parents have been critical and nosy about what I've been up to, one behavior that I admit (to them and to reddit) that I have a problem with is my internet usage.  I admitted to them that I sought addiction therapy and now that I'm living with them, every time I'm on the computer, whether it's for useful stuff (job hunting, applying, contacting people about rooms to rent, etc.) my dad seems to want to know what I'm doing.  I had a period where I'd go to the library more often but since school's still out for summer, I find it quieter and potentially more productive at their house.  

The problem is that after they go to bed around 10:30-11pm, that's when I feel ""free"" and usually spend a few hours on my laptop surfing reddit, other forums, looking at video clips, you name it.   I'm sleeping in a bedroom that's on the same floor as my parents' bedroom and unfortunately the door is partially opaque, so they can see if I still have a light on, the TV on or my laptop.   Lately I've been having trouble falling asleep because of a neighbor's loud heat pump/ a/c unit that drones on until 1am nightly, then shuts off.  My parents don't want to do anything about it like talking to the neighbors and why should they if it doesn't bother them?   

The other night I was using my laptop because I wasn't tired enough yet at 2am and to my surprise I suddenly heard my dad taking a leak in the adjacent bathroom.  He didn't knock on my bedroom door so I figured he didn't see me.   But he did.

At dinner he shamed me in front of my mom and said I was still a net addict, saying I should stop using at 11pm.  Then he had me list everything I used it for during the day and said I use it enough.  I feel like he treated me like a child.  Yes I've been getting up later in the morning and explained the noisy heat pump/ a/c but he doesn't care.   Should I let him talk to me like he does / try to control me?  I'm 32 not a teen.

53,"Sorry if this doesn't belong here, it was hard to find a sub that looked like it would allow me to post something like this.

I consider myself to have a pretty high tolerance for bullshit, I try my best not to let the actions of others get to me. But after the horrific events in Charlottesville yesterday this website is really starting to get to me.

I'll get back to Charlottesville in a bit but I would first like to make a statement and talk about the overall issue I want to get at here.

I want to tell the subs that lean left, I'm worried about saying names but you know the ones, the ones that have taken advantage of a terrible event to push an agenda. That from an outsider's perspective, someone who likes to stay away from politics on Reddit you are just as pathetic and childish as r/The_Donald. Both of you guys are the biggest fucking babies, pointing fingers and crying whenever your feelings get hurt. Both of you guys are the ""triggered cucks"" you call each other. Both of you flood the frontpage with one sided ""discussion"" where any opposing opinion is  downvoted into oblivion. Rather than talk to eachother or have ANY form of meaningful discussion, your sole intent seems to be to slap labels on the other side. Really that appears to be the only reason for your existence, to call each other ""SJWs"" and ""Nazis"" (don't worry I'm getting back to that). This pathetic display of refusing to have any sort accountability is the biggest problem in the world today in my opinion and I just feel as though I have to say anything about it.

Now back to that events of yesterday. 

I'm not a Nazi, I don't like Nazis, they're bad, Nazis are bad. That's something we can all get behind right? WELL THEN HOW ABOUT WE STOP CALLING EACHOTHER NAZIS ALL THE TIME. I've never met a Nazi, I've never seen a Nazi and I'm even gonna go out on a limb here and say that I've never seen someone defend a Nazi, not even on Reddit. I've tried to give even amounts of shit to both sides in this post but this is going to go mainly towards the left leaning subs. You've got to be stone cold retarded if you actually think that any sizable majority of the conservatives in this country are white supremacists or Neo-Nazis. I grew up in a very conservative area, I've talked about politics with plenty of very stern conservatives (and we don't yell at each other or call each other names, we just talk it out and agree to disagree [or admit that we're wrong and this is the first time I've ever gotten to use brackets and I'm really excited]) and not a single of them is a Nazi, or a white supremacists, or really even a racist in general. The point I'm trying to make is that these people are out there, but no one is supporting them. People want to distance themselves from them, especially if they have some mutual political views, you know why? BECAUSE THEY ARE NAZIS AND EVERYONE HATES NAZIS. So just calm the fuck down guys, I'm tired of it, I think most sensible people on this subreddit are, and if you keep it up then it's just going to spawn more and more hate, because that's what it does. Hate + Hate = More Hate, and hate is bad. We can learn to get along, we can learn to have different opinions than other people and not look at that as some sub-human parasite. And we can stop lumping people in with the bad apples, you shouldn't look at all conservatives as Nazis just like you shouldn't look at all Muslims as terrorists. This is basic stuff people, behavior we should have learned when we were. Can we just try? Can we just put in the effort? Because we all hate Nazis, but your fellow Redditors are not the Nazis (at least not in literally 99.99% of cases). So just take a chill pill, stop being so goddamn mean and grow the fuck up.",13Aug2017,0
