2,"**TL;DR; So my gf and I are a lesbian couple who’ve been together almost 3 years. I'm 23 and she's 27. We have always had a great, loving relationship up until this incident. We don’t live together but we’re always together. So when this incident occurred, she was over my place. We got into a stupid, petty argument over some girl commenting on her Instagram pics. Anyways the argument escalated and I said “Go kill yourself like your pathetic mother.” A little background info on my gf is her mom suffered from severe bipolar/depression, and drug abuse and killed herself a few years prior. So anyways after I said this, I immediately regretted it, but it was too late my gf punched me in the mouth. I tried fighting back but she’s much bigger and stronger. She basically beat my ass. I was crying and screaming until she stopped and left.
I haven’t seen her since this incident but we’ve talked on the phone. She keeps apologizing saying she doesn't know what came over her and it won’t happen again. I believe her cus she’s never shown signs of violence in the past. But I still don’t feel like I should just forgive and move on so easily. Please help. I’m at a loss.**.",24Sep2017,6
3,"seriously. I see other people saying they don't but it's gotta just be virtue signaling? like it's hilarious for me and has been same as long as I can remember.

like the earliest example I can think of is when I was in maybe 6th grade this girl had a huge crush on me, and I knew she did so I'd make fun of her for her weight. I knew it hurt her and probably made her insecure but it was just funny to me. Ended up making her cry during a passing period and a big scene was made about it which wasn't good because obviously I didn't wanna be exposed. 

anyways it's just such a common behavior I see that people denying they enjoy it have to be virtue signaling in my mind.",24Sep2017,1

9,"I'm going to university not too long from now.
What will I do there?
Obviously I'm going to study math. I'm not particularly fond of pure mathematics, but I know that it's good medicine. A strong understanding of mathematics will give me a lot to build upon in whatever field I end up.
But what else am I going to do there?
In my dreams, I meet someone cute in my real analysis class and we spend all our time together perfecting our mathematics knowledge, talking about philosophy, and going at each other like rabbits.
That is unlikely to happen.
It seems more probable that any people with whom I interact will lead my astray from my studies.
So where does that leave me?
I've always been told that most people meet their significant other at university. With so many people of roughly the same age in one place, it's easy to see why.

But I'll just meet someone later, right?

When does later come?

At work (sexual harassment)?

At a store (creep)?

At the library (shh!)?

Perhaps I'm being rather pessimistic here, but I guess I just don't understand where people meet their significant others. Online dating is definitely off the table because of the inherent flaws in the system and the poor selection. 
I suppose that I will remain pretty much alone until I accept that any effort on my part to begin a relationship with someone (even someone who is interested in me without any maneuvering on my part) will take away from ability to do other things. While I idealize romantic partners as being a source of inspiration and comfort, I know that relationships are a lot of work and that one will likely detract from my ability to get work done.

I like sausage, but don't like making it.

I feel like I'm letting the kids down and I signed a 1 year contract, but my original jobs pays more and doesn't want to let me fit this morning job into my schedule. Fuck.

I'm a shitty person and I'm going to burn in hell. I'm going to miss those little kids so freaking much.

Initially I wanted more time off, but I realized that saving for my future plans is more important (need 10k to study in Germany).

I'm so pathetic.

11,"I also posted this in r/mentalhealth, but not sure where the best place is for this.
I wrote this today in response to a very emotional fight I had with my partner today. I'm overseas at the moment and on my own, so I can't just go see one of my friends... if anyone has advice on emotionally distant partners, feel free to comment.


""Today you broke me down, again. You make me feel hopeless and isolated and no matter how hard I try, I feel as though I can't get through to you, and I try so hard. I feel as though you don't take me seriously and you think I'm being overdramatic and it's so damaging to my mental health. I can't expect you to be everything I need, but this is the one thing I expect in a partner, to be there for me emotionally. I try my hardest to empathise with you, which is why I think you can't be there emotionally for yourself as well. I mean it when I say it hurts, it starts off small, but the constant rejection and lack of support drives me to the point where I have to completely break down before you listen to me. I am not someone who can close myself off emotionally and I need to be able to talk my emotions and feeling through. This is who I am and if you want to be with me you need to accept and work with that. I know it might be difficult for you, to go against a lifetime of emotionally shutting yourself off or backing away from a situation, but that's what it will take if we are going to work. You call me emotional and point out I ""make mounds out of mole holes"". I am human and it is normal to feel and want to express emotions. Before I was with you I never broke down the way I do with you, I know that we both have a role to play in it. You make me feel like I am emotionally unstable, yet before I met you I was confident in my stability and emotional intelligence. I'm afraid it is slowly crumbling away, and with every event where you shut me out and push me to my extreme, I feel as though large chunks of myself are being ripped from my core. I love you so much, which is why I am driven so passionately because I just want you to love and understand me. I want for us to work and continue to grow as a couple. Every time you brush me aside or tell me ""you are busy"", you are making me feel small, rejected and isolated. But most of all, you make me feel like the care and love I have for you is one way. I know I could deal with this better, I need to learn the best responses for both of us in these situations, but sometimes the mental energy it takes to simply get you to comfort me when I'm upset is too much and worsens the situation that I was trying to seek help for. Every time we have a fight, afterwards, I am more determined to repair what was damaged because I am determined in us to work. But I'm honestly feeling defeated and these events are now taking their toll. Since the last fight we had, I have not been able to shake off the shame, emotional instability, isolation and rejection you made me feel from how you treated me. I have rushes of anger at you, and then sadness. I sometimes lay in bed at night contemplating the hopelessness I feel over this issue. I've realised that I can't ""fix you"" and I can't teach you without your help. Honestly, I don't think you are aware of what you are doing and the very severe tolls they are playing on my emotional health. Emotional intelligence is something I think you are lacking, which is strange because it seems like you are so good at it on the outside. If this doesn't change I'm afraid that there will be damaged beyond repair. I don't want to sound dramatic, but I'm now developing anxiety over you not ""taking me seriously"" and that I am the one who is emotionally unstable. For my own health I can't do this forever, I know that this will be the thing that breaks us if it continues. I'm already feeling as though I can't go through it again after today. I hope for your sake that you can change, for the sake of us, but also for the sake of your future relationships. I couldn't imagine this being healthy for a child because I fear that is where it starts for most people. A vicious cycle that continues to be passed down generation to generation without ever being corrected. If we don't make it, I hope you can change so you don't push all your future partners away from you… because you are so special and so wonderful in every other aspect of your life, it's just this one thing. I guess no one is perfect. I don't think you will ever read this, but this is for my own mental health, I need to write this down as a reminder. I'm terribly scared because I doubt my ability to communicate this to you. So I doubt our future. I love you.""",24Sep2017,5

16,"I have no clue what to do.

I am unemployed right now and it sucks. I've been unemployed for over 3 years now. I've had jobs (5 to be exact) and none of them lasted any longer than a month. One of them lasted 4 days. I was at my old job for 4 years. Even then, I transferred to like 3 different stores. I don't know what it is, I just get bored, frustrated or anxious and end up leaving. At one of my jobs I had earlier this year, I had a mental breakdown. By that I mean my mind just went to shit. And I stopped coming to work. I no called for a whole week and then I was just off the schedule. It's just when I get into those mindsets I loose any and all care and responsibility. My image also is different. I got my old job when I barley graduated high school and was in the best shape of my life. I looked good, I felt good and I was a smart ass/funny guy who everyone liked. My game with the ladies was also on point. Not too sound cocky but I was the shit back then. And the I got a second job, and a few weeks after that I got a new manager at my first job and he didn't like the idea of me not working certain days unless I had a valid school schedule. And refused to work around any other work schedules. It got to the point where I quit my second job because I couldn't actually go to work as my boss was very unreasonable. After that I hated going to work because that boss was a complete chode and hated everything about me and made sure I was miserable. According to others, he was trying to get me to quite, by giving me horrible hours, minimum hours and no chances to take any other shifts. I ended up transferring, but the damage was done. I grew to resent the company as a whole and my work went down. I became defiant, lazy and bitter. Also I gained some pounds. Like a lot. And then I quit. I quit because I knew I had overstayed my welcome at that company. But I made the mistake of quitting without having anything else lined up. And then I got even heavier, started smoking a lot more weed and drinking a lot more. And it's led to here. I'm obese, unhealthy, even more socially awkward than ever.

The thing is i know exactly what I want to do with my life. But it isn't very realistic. And EVERYONE I know is always repeating that to me. I want to be an actor... and then delve more into the filmmaking world. The problem is that I have 0 acting experience, 0 talent (FYI I think I'm a horrible actor), my looks are bad ATM, and I wonder if I can ever be that handsome dude again.... I'm also very very shy and shut in that even the mere idea of taking acting classes makes me very uncomfortable. Also it's very expensive. I want to take baby steps and maybe start as an extra... but even that makes me anxious. And scared. I'm 26 with literally nothing... nothing. Everyone is graduating college or beyond and have careers and families. And I'm here.... alone... single... shut in and very hopeless for the future.",24Sep2017,34
17,"So after almost a year of sobriety something has became much clearer then before in my life. I have always felt like I do not belong where I am or even like this is not where I am suppose to be in life. Well years ago from 2005 to 2011 I served in the U.S. Army. Which lead to all the drinking and from 2011 to 2016 I was in college and got my degree in Environmental Sciences. But during that I felt like I half assed everything, just doing enough to pass classes. Well now I sit here in a small town in upstate New York working in a factory and I can't help but wonder is this it? I mean I have three beautiful kids and a wife, but yet it feels all wrong. Sorry if this is all over the place but I am lost and I am not even sure if it makes sense to myself.

20,"Two weeks ago I took in my sister's cat. She and her boyfriend broke up, he ran back to Nebraska, and left her with the cat. She couldn't take the cat to her parents' because my parents' cats got territorial and crotchety. I used to live with her boyfriend, and I knew our cats got along, so I agreed to take the cat (I was looking to adopt a second one anyway).

Week one goes by, my cat is a general pest to the new cat. Not like aggressive, but overly curious. The other cat, anxious and upset at being at three homes in less than three weeks, wanted none of it. Eventually I set up a space for her on my sun room, so she could have freedom from my cat, with the plan being to eventually flip flop the two in about a week.

Middle of the second week I noticed the new cat has stopped drinking, and hasn't touched her food. I provided her with a variety of foods, thinking maybe the stuff I set out for her wasn't to her liking, so I gave her the old Meow Mix she had been eating, and some wet food. As the end of the week approached I got worried, since we were going into a bizarre heat wave, with heat indices as high as 100F.

Friday I took her to the vet, and they noted her fatty liver tissues were elevated. Their recommendation was hospitalizing her, and they'd put her on an IV drip and see if she started eating.

Saturday she wasn't eating, and they wanted to put in what they described as a ""long-term feeding tube,"" which would be surgically implanted, as they expected she might need to be tube fed for a few weeks before she's fully back on her feet.

This morning the vet calls back, and her lethargy is worse than ever. We opted to have them re-run her blood work, but the two options they presented us were send her to a specialist, or have her put down. I had just finished rebuilding her Furrtress of Solitude, so she could hide away from the prying eyes of my cat, but now it seems that effort may have been for naught.

I'm waiting on the blood work to be called back, and in the meantime we reached out to a specialist, who gave us a ray of hope: for cats that are very anxious about environmental changes it's not exceedingly unusual for this kind of situation to come up, and she may be so far gone that she would need several days of tube feeding before her energy levels started to perk up.

Either way, this weekend went from hopefully optimistic to ""sucks out loud."" My sister is quite distraught, and blaming herself for this, but the truth was the cat always bonded better with males, and I had her trying to get her stink all over me pretty quickly.

**Update:** Vet consult: poor, wretched, furry kitty lives to fight another day. Her blood work didn't show signs of improvement, but it showed only slight signs of getting worse, indicating that the treatment is doing something, and her white blood cell count shows she may be fighting off an infection. Medication and clinical monitoring/feeding is going forward.

**Update 2:** Spoke with a friend who's in getting a Doctorate in animal medicine, she thinks we're doing the right thing by moving forward with this treatment.

**Update 3:** She's not making platelets. Vet is worried she has Feline Leukemia.

Throughout this whole process she moved in with me and I supported her as much as I could. I didn't have her pay rent only to help around the house as I was always busy studying. Things were going well, I convinced her to come back to school this year and after switching majors she agreed. We signed a lease for an apartment together thinking we would last forever. School started and she seemed to be doing great. She enjoyed being back at school and enjoyed hanging out with her friends again.

29,"Everything was going great until a year ago. That was the time that my long-time girlfriend and I broke up for good. Six months prior to that, she had broken up with me; dumped me after a largely successful, 7-year relationship. Right before we got together with a bunch of our friends, she stopped me before we left the car and said, ""I don't love you anymore"".

A few weeks of silence after that, she came crawling back to me.. Telling me how wrong she was and that she really did love me. I was pretty wounded but decided to give things another shot after we promised that we would each work hard to improve ourselves... I tried really hard to change, but noticed that she gave practically zero effort to improve herself, so after the additional 6 months of effort, I decided that things needed to stop. 

It was a terribly difficult decision, and was largely mutual to try and spur both of us to change... But it was hard; she has depression and anxiety and I was her main source of support for so long; I felt like I was abandoning her. My friends spent a good amount of time convincing me that I needed to have more faith in her and trust that she'd be okay. And as far as I'm aware, she's doing just fine.

Fast forward a year. I've been doing good for myself, I've lost weight, I've taken to volunteering, and I have a lot of ambitions. My job pays decently, and I'm facing no problems with paying off my car. I still live with my parents, which is a source of anxiety in itself considering I'm in my mid 20's, but I'm saving money and I'll have enough for a down payment eventually.

The problem for me lately is that I'm surrounded by the success of my friends; a GREAT thing, definitely, but it's highlighting my overall stagnant progression in life. One of my buddies just got married last week, another is moved out and is fully independent... My sister just had her first child... I had plans for all of these things with my ex, and they were all blown completely out of the water when our relationship self-destructed.

I've tried meeting people. I go out routinely to try and meet people. I had a blind date - disaster. I met a different woman who I was pretty infatuated with, and she met someone else right before our first official date, told me to cancel all our plans. I've not been meeting a lot of success, you could say.

I'm discouraged and losing a lot of hope for ending the constant void I've been feeling. 

I don't write this post to ask for advice; I've done enough of that with my friends and colleagues. My hope is that one day I can look back on this post, and think to myself: It was difficult at the time, but it was worth it to strengthen and improve my character.

But until that time, it's simply wishful thinking... and the nagging pain in my chest is ever present. ",24Sep2017,7

Do not go back to your ex.

You have other priorities now in life.

They are so, so much more important than having him right now.

Please focus on these other priorities. I PROMISE that this will be so much more rewarding than anything else.

YOU NEED THIS NOW. TAKE THIS TIME FOR YOU.

No matter how much you love him. No matter how much you think that he is the right one. No matter how much you believe that if you stay, it is going to be the thing to make it work. NO. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO. DO NOT GO BACK. NOT NOW. It is NOT the time. WHATEVER YOU THINK IT IS. WHATEVER YOUR TRAIN OF THOUGHT IS. WHATEVER.

DON'T GO BACK NOW. NOW IS NOT THE TIME.

Once you have solved all of your issues and given your priorities and your personal wishes full blown first priorities, then we can discuss about adding someone in your life.

And if he cannot wait, it is HIS problem. NOT YOURS. He is not ready and willing if he cannot wait for it. He has to learn that things can be hard to get at times. Sometimes WORK HAS TO BE DONE. And HE HAS TO UNDERSTAND THIS. That this is not the time. That I HAVE THINGS TO DO ARE TRULY IMPORTANT. AND THEY DO NOT INCLUDE HIM.

It is not about seeing if you can go through this with him now. NO. You risk failing your goal and making everything fail. YOU WILL REGRET THIS IF YOU GO BACK TO HIM AND DO IT WITH HIM. You will fail.

On your own, you can fail. You know this. You will fail. But you have tried. Really. All by yourself. With all of your energy. Your own energy. And you truly did this. Of course, you can fail. And it is okay, if you truly try.

He has to wait. If he learns, he can go for the long haul with you.

DO NOT GO BACK. NOT NOW.

WHATEVER THE REASON IS.

EVEN IF HE SAYS THAT HE DOES OR DOES NOT WANT ME, IT IS NOT THE TIME FOR ME TO PURSUE HIM IN ANY WAY.

GET OUT.

DO NOT GO BACK NOW.

JUST SORT YOUR STUFF AND GO THROUGH THINGS.

AND IF YOU HAVE TO LOSE EVERYTHING, IT IS OKAY. I PROMISE. I PROMISE BECAUSE IT IS WORTH IT. FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR OWN PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT. DO IT FOR YOURSELF.

TRY AND ACCOMPLISH THIS. WITHOUT HIM.

JUST A REMINDER NOT TO GO BACK. NOT NOW. NOT EVER.

WAIT UNTIL YOU DO IT. LIVE IT AND EXPERIENCE IT. ALONE.

DO NOT GO BACK.

NOT NOW.

EVEN IF HE ASKS TO BE INCLUDED IN MY GOALS OR MY DREAMS, DO NOT GO BACK.

YOU HAVE TO DO THIS ON YOUR OWN.

IT IS THE BEST BEST BEST CHANCE THAT YOU HAVE.

DO NOT DO THIS WITH HIM.

DO NOT SPEND ENERGY ON THIS.

My question for Reddit is... how the heck do people feel okay in the down times? I live for the next event or plan or thing to do, but in between I usually feel pretty lonely and boring. I resent the time spent at home by myself. It seems like productive or enjoyable hobbies are the way a lot of people cope with the in between times but I don't really get enraptured with art or working out or really anything like some people do. 

I think I would use traveling as a coping mechanism for a while. When things got stale or hard I'd just leave on some trip. I think because it is a way to have novel and stimulating experiences every day and in that space I am so much more open and feel like myself. But I want to be able to put down roots. I want to be able to optimize my life no matter where I am and not need something as expensive and drastic as traveling to keep me satisfied in my life. Upon reflection, it kinda feels like those trips were me running away from my life. 

I guess what I'm saying is, I like spending time with other people and I like doing things for entertainment, I like traveling but I can't be doing that ALL the time. What do y'all do for yourselves and how do you spend time with yourself comfortably?

37,"I saw you on the side of the road on the way home from a buffet. You had on a tie-dye shirt and shorts and carried all of your belongings in your book bag. If it had been up to me I would have stopped but we all know parents aren't the most understanding of people. We shared a look as our van whizzed past you. It was one of understanding between two human beings. Not one charged with anger. Or distrust. Not a look that saw the difference in our skin or in our nationality. It was one that saw the other as a human, one as a man asking for kindness, and the other wishing nothing more than to oblige. You were at the mercy of the world on that exit. And you didn't care who picked you up, what their politics were, or what kind of car they drove. Because none of that matters. What matters is the relationship between two people. I hope you found a way to your destination, fellow traveler. We're all in this together.",24Sep2017,28
38,"Yesterday, my SO and I performed at an event in my hometown. After we finished, a guy came up and introduced himself to us, he said he worked for a talent agency and would like to work with us. The only catch is that we're not 18 yet, so that kinda sucks, but I've been really happy about it for the past while. 

Thanks for reading this, I didn't have anyone to tell, so I figured I'd post it here.",24Sep2017,131
40,"I'm curious as to what makes a person care about politics, so much, or at all for that matter.  I don't care at all,  any big shooting, national disaster, Trump being elected, none of these effected me in the slightest. I felt exactly the same that day as any other day.  Even though there were people balling around me.  I go to a liberal arts school in the US and I feel like everyone else here cares about politics except me, and I don't know why.  I feel different but I just don't care about them.  I don't understand how politics effect people so much.  IS it just negligence as it doesn't really effect me as a white person?  Am i just lying to myself because I don't want to become invested in caring, as stupid as that sounds writing it down now?  Idk

If you care about politics, what's your motivation?  How does it feel when something bad happens in the nation(US) and why do you feel that way?

Thanks",24Sep2017,1
41,"Two examples. 

-Fort Minors ""remember the name""; the percentages all add up to 100. I found this funny,  husband didn't. 

- there's a country song, ""drinking problem"" that has the line ""they call it a problem/I call it a solution"". After a quick Google, I confirmed that yes, chemically speaking, alcohol is a solution. I crack up every time I hear that damn song now. Again, husband didn't think that was funny either.
