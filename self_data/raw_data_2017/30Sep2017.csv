1,"I mean, I've always hated myself. I remember having to hide my diaries when I was a kid because I knew it was wrong to write that I wanted to kill myself, I just didn't understand why. But then I went to Iceland. 

It was actually to two places, the Netherlands first. Then a short stay in Reykjavik. So I spent time walking around Amsterdam. Then I flew to Reykjavik. It was a Friday night/Saturday morning... maybe around 5 am. People were laughing and drinking and eating out of food trucks that were still open. So I sat there and I watched. They all looked... happy. 


Then this... feeling came over me. It was the purest, most intense feeling I've ever had. Just abject loneliness. Knowing that no one will ever care about me. Knowing that I'm going to die alone. I write ""knowing"" because there was no doubts in that moment. I saw my future clearly. I cried for a few minutes, then made out with a stranger. Didn't help, obviously.


Last week, I got meningitis. The doctor told me they would do a spinal tap and a asked if I had anyone to sit with me while they did it. And I didnt. A nurse came in a held my hand and stroked my hair while i sobbed. I'm still not sure if I was crying because of the pain or because I had no one to sit with me.

I'm going to die alone, hopefully sooner than later. It hurts too much to keep doing this.",30Sep2017,165

7,"A few years ago, I used to have those late-night conversations with penpals and long-distance friends. Sometimes I'd skype with these people to talk to them, and I thought I was helping them. They were all around my age, plus or minus two years, and I'd met some of them at high school by coincidence.

I'd made the mistake of trying to be a therapist, with my stupidly innocent mindset. Staying up till 3-4AM because the conversations are going, even if they're going nowhere. Even if I had something to do, I found comfort and some sort of solace in this. This was an unusual social life that I shouldn't try again. I felt like I was helping people, like I convinced some to step away from the edge, like this was the only way I was doing any good. Some of them told me I'm helping. I don't know.

But the mistakes came in when I surrounded myself with poisonous people, and all of a sudden things got a little too edgy to still be ironic. I stayed away from it but there was only so far I could stay from a community or a group of friends I was so deeply invested in. You know what they say about putting all your chips in one basket? Things evaporated over the most childish of reasons. I thought they were stupid and I was handling this with maturity, but I was stupid too. There was too much fucking negativity inside of me, like I was to birth a baby demon. I ditched everyone who I had any sort of connection with, before entering, well, the real world and realizing this is unchartered territory, and that I had to start from scratch.

Sure it was pathetic, I was pathetic, but I found some things to do, ways to distract me from the giant lull. Suddenly in such a giant community I'd found that I wasn't really closely knit with anybody. I'd met two people during a particularly empty and lonely streak, and the poison resumed. And a decent while after I left them, rumors began to spread. To this day I don't know what they said, but it feels deeply unsettling to think about it.

I cut off contact with everyone I knew as a safety measure. This felt like the virtual equivalent of moving to Alaska. This hurts like hell, because I've seen the good side of a lot of these people. There's heart, but you add one truly poisonous person and things change. Whether this poisonous person was this friend I later met or whether it's me I'll never know, but I want to stay away from these people, and I'm happy if they succeed because they're also stupidly talented. Cutting off contact with some felt liberating; when all you do with a friend is crack jokes to try and make him laugh, you're soon talking to a living laugh track who sees no other purpose in your conversations.

This was a long while ago, and the paranoia's still in me. Maybe two or three of you seeing this are the people I'm talking about. I've got so used to being alone afterwards that the thought of someone else around strikes a certain fear in me. But I'm just sick of myself, and I want to quit this shithole I've buried myself in. I still want to help people, but maybe anonymity's the best thing in these situations. I frequent BlahTherapy and listen to people and try to advise them, but I'm not sure what else to do. I know for a fact that I probably don't know what friendships even are in the first place, but the want to help still lingers.",30Sep2017,3

9,"Drinking 6 beers a few nights a week has now become the norm. I have the magical ability to not get a hangover after that... My life is fucked I am drunk right now and I realize how bad this is but it's the one thing I look forward to. Why can't I be happy sober. I am miserable sober music doesn't give me chills. Nothing is fun. Everything is fun when you're tipsy. I'm only 19 this shouldn't be happening. I am supposed to be a good person I always have been but now I'm just turning into an alcoholic piece of shit like most of my family. Why did it have be like this I couldn't fight it. The 6 beers will eventually become 10 and then 12 and then who knows. 125 lbs dudes can get far with a 30 pack.

10,"Today in my sophomore year of college I saw a young eager eyed freshman who hated what she was. Because she was a freshman and therefore inherently worse. She expressed this repeatedly over and over trying to gain something from the surrounding upper class-men approval ? Respect. She drove herself down and they played on it. They laughed when she missed a shot in bear pong, and she laughed to. Still trying to be accepted. So she drinks.

As for me I think I know what this is, so I text my friend ""I'm not crazy right? I should totally prevent this?""

Yeah you should

But there are five of them and 1 of me. So I wait, I need to be in the room in order to open it. My friend races the entire length of campus as I try to figure out where we are. I get the dorm and the room number and tell her. She's there in minutes. She talks to the girl, the drinking stops and they bond over stuff. She stays their the entire time all the way until the freshman was back in her dorm. The freshman goes to bed.

11,"I’m at the point in my life that I want to give up. I’m not going to say I’ve had a hard life at. I’ve had a great family and grew up in a nice place. I just have no interest in anything. I have had things off and on that I’ve wanted to do but either didn’t work out or I lost interest in it. I’ve always been somewhat socially awkward, I have plenty of friends but I always seem to be the odd one out, same with my family. I think I’m the black sheep for the most part. I’ve always had a hard time liking my self, I’ve never felt like I really truly fit in anywhere. Im great at molding myself to a group of people and making them think I belong but I never felt like I have. I’m 29 years old and have had multiple failed long term relationships that I thought were going to turn into marriage and so on, it’s what I’ve always wanted. I enjoy having a women in my life to be with but it probably never worked out because I don’t like my self. Honestly I don’t really see the point in existing to just be here. The only real thing that I love is my dog, she seems to think the world of me. I have recently really stopped caring about trying to finish school and work towards a career because I just feel like it’s pointless. I have no interest is working forever for things thst I don’t really want. I just sick of being here really. I don’t want to kill myself but I also don’t care if I’m around.  I just keep thinking “what would really change if I wasn’t here”. I just can’t see the point to trying when it doesn’t mean anything to me. I’ve never seen my self growing old somewhere. Even when I was in high school I never imagined myself living to be even 40. Have I lived past the age the universe meant for me and for some reason I’m still here trapped? I don’t know.  I’m sure I could do things with my life to help others but I don’t actually really care about other people to much. I’ve loved people but not many. I just want to be done. 

Not sure if any of this even made sense but I don’t care. None of actually matters. I just wanted to put my thoughts out somewhere. ",30Sep2017,8

13,"I'm a girl so while I did have the coming of age experience of seeing my first naked person in one of my dads playboys, it wasn't what I would call an impactful experience in my life. But after hearing of his death I got curious and started reading about his life (I work 12 hour night shifts, so I end up going on some very long very strange internet journeys) and what an amazing human. I can't even begin to put into words how much of an amazing impact that man has had on the world.

 He had a huge hand in furthering gay rights, I was reading an article posted in playboy sometime in the 50s and it was about a society in which being a heterosexual was illegal, they even did away with cats and dogs and being a homosexual was the norm. I can't imagine how racy that would have been considered at the time! 

He also played a part in furthering furthering birth control and women's rights. Did you know that birth control used to be illegal in some states? The reason it's no longer illegal is in part due to Hugh. At the same time he was working on birth control he was working on pro-choice rights and from what I read had a hand in Roe v. Wade. 

He also worked towards integration and civil rights in the 60s. Contributed to environmental causes. And many other things, I probably couldn't name them all if I tried.

So Hugh here's to you. Thank you for inspiring me. Thank you for changing the world. You're a role model. He IS a role model, he's not exactly the traditional image that comes to mind when you think role model but hey that's another ways he's changing the world. I know this has led me to be more open minded, more.. just awed by the world. 

That's all, I hope that this maybe inspires someone else too, even just a touch. I won't say RIP because I don't know if peace is his idea of a good time, instead I'll say I hope you're having a hell of a good time up there (or wherever you are) and I hope they have pepsi, great cigars, and of course lots of good looking girls, you absolutely deserve it.

And so his voice also comes through here are two great quotes

16,"You know, occasionally I go through my old posts and delete stuff because I'm embarrassed or its really personal or whatever. The trend I've noticed is I deleted my more suicidal posts from years ago because I was embarrassed or scared that people would make fun of me.
I still have some left from a couple self harm subreddits and I think rbn.
I think I'll leave what I have now though, I'm really proud of how far I've come in the past three years. Used to be where I'd constantly post in self harm subs, mental health, I was subscribed to all kinds of suicide subs and I posted every time I was having a crisis (which was a lot back then.) Now I just enjoy the ones I have, look on here for entertainment and don't use it as an escape. 

What changed is I finally left my parents house and started transitioning after leaving high school and I've never been happier. I've had issues with an ex and I've been desperately broke and had medical issues but being in control of my body and any choices I make is healthier for me than being somewhat financially stable living in my parents house and wanting to die all the time. Occasionally I'll have depressive episodes because let's be real, I'm still recovering and I'll never quite lose my mental illness but it happens way less frequently in ways that are hard for me to deal with.

I'd say after everything I went through and going through and being reminding of where I was at by a post I remember making years ago, I'm doing pretty good for myself. I've got a job I enjoy, I'm going to school (though that's probably going to change too, I've changed a lot!!) I have benefits through this job, my roommates and friends are people who ACTUALLY care about me.. I can care about myself now. It feels really good to think about where I was and where I am. How the hell I managed to do it I have no idea but I did and I'm making it, even if it doesn't feel like it sometimes.

21,"I had a job as a busser for a broadway dinner theater. It wasn't glamorous but I took pride in it. When i first started working there all I got were compliments and praise from higher ups and it felt like things were finally going right for me. This changed when my boss used me as an example of what everyone should be like when they come to work. After this my co workers (16-20) started isolating me. It got to the point where no one would even look at me during my shifts. I put it behind me because im here to do work, not make friends. Besides, everyone here was very cliky anyway and I dont feel like dealing with high school bullshit since im graduating college this semester. I contined to do what I was doing before, finishing my pre service duties and picking up the slack fron everyone else so dinner/ lunch would go smooth. Then complaints started coming in, my manager refused to tell me what they were and just told me to stay at my stations (which I never leave) and to not worry about them since it was a new shift and a new day and keep doing what im doing. 

Some time comes by and my boss pulls me into his office. He starts to ask me if im feeling ok and I dont look ok. Now i appreciated the concern but assured him that im feeling A-ok and theres no need to worry. Some more time passed going (what I thought) smoothly. One day I caught a violent stomach virus and asked my manager if it was safe for me to come in since I handle food, at first she says stay home then turned it on me and told me i need to come in and its ""always something with me"" (???). All day my boss who knew I was sick was asking me if im ok and is this job too much to handle. I told him im just sick today but im doing what I can. He told me he can schedule me for one day a week if thats better for me. I again assured him im doing fine and im just sick. Another few weeks go by all with random ""are you feeling ok, you kinda look like your not feeling ok"" comments. That was until... the other day. 

My boss pulled me into his office again and told me there are even more complaints about me. Once again im refused to be told what they are. All im told is that during servive people cant find me. (Well no shit they cant find me im either in the kitchen, on the floor, or at the breakdown stations. If you find me not running somewhere im doing something wrong). He also goes to tell me hes confident im not ok and tell me that even customers are complaining that im not ok (how the fuck would they get a chance to determine what condition im in when im either swooping by to clean or deliver food. Im a busser, im invisible). Again hes pushing that im not ok and that he needs to know whats going on. I tell him im 100% when im here and I have no idea what he means by im not ok. He throws out that they dont drug test here and hes sure im not ok. It all clicks. He never gave a shit about how im feeling, he thinks im om drugs or drunk (I've gotten comments on my face before. I have a bit of a droopy face because my eyelids hang lower than normal especially my left eye which droops a bit more than my right. Its nothing major if anything I just look a bit tired all the time). I told him ill take a drug test right now and I cant help the way my face look but he wont have any of it. He says that hes going to have to keep an eye on me from now on and he may have to change my job because I cant be in front of the patrons not looking ok and looking like im in a ""fog"" all the time. So I quit.",30Sep2017,363
22,"Yesterday was my birthday, and I turned 37. For the past 6 months or so I've been really, really discontent. I always used to look forward to changes, seeing them as new adventures, and inevitably took the opinion of if things don't work out, you can always change your situation. I was married before and bought a house, and both times it was exciting. But I always knew that if things didn't work out, I'd land on my feet.

I met my second husband and we've been house hunting, and I'm just....not excited. This time, with my age, buying the house seems more permanent. It feels like we have to make a longer range decision because the house has to be in a good school system as we're planning to have a kid, and then we won't be able to move really once the kid comes. Plus, I feel more stuck with my husband. Up until this point I've always known I can find a new guy if I want to, but recently, I've noticed I'm looking older. In the past year I've gotten wrinkles and grey hair, and while I don't look like an old bag, I'm realizing I do look my age now. I didn't before. That plus I'm getting some random health problems, and I'm just feeling like the horizon is closing in on me. Buying a house with my husband just seems like too final, but I really do want to buy one- it's the best thing for us to do logically, and up until recently I really wanted to. Also it's not like I could go find a new guy at my age like I used to- I hate the idea of dating someone older than me, but I feel like I don't have the stamina to keep up with a younger guy. Plus I really do love my husband, it's not a fake relationship.

I've talked to a couple of people about this and they're sure it's his fault- that I'm getting cold feet about him or something. And maybe that's true, we are in an old married couple routine but generally I like that. I'm too old to go to the clubs and to parties now (although I was doing that up until last year, I am suddenly feeling out of place so although I would love to keep going, I feel awkward). Plus my friends who I did that with all had babies so that's out. Am I just in a rut with my husband? Are my cold feet a sign of something I shouldn't be ignoring about the relationship? People seem to think so since I was so gung ho about buying a house with the first husband, but I'm not so sure.

I also got a new job a year ago that allows me to support myself in an upper middle class lifestyle all by myself, and while that's been great overall, part of me thinks the brakes have been taken off in a sense. I mean that as in, I could now be alone or dating and not have to worry about money, which has never been the case before. When I was single before I was able to rent a 1 bed, pay my bills, etc, but I couldn't reach my financial goals. I now find myself thinking there aren't any guardrails now in terms of living situations, and that might be adding to the situation.",30Sep2017,2
24,"Awful sounding title right? So I'm going to put it upfront, we don't have a controlling or abusive marriage. We actually have a wonderfully successful marriage, with strong family, good jobs and finances, and lots of laughter, joy, support, and play! 

Yet her friends almost kept us from that.

Going back almost 10 years ago already, her friends met me for the first time, didn't like me and decided I was an invader. They thought I was rude, awkward, disengenous, whatever early hipsters might use to label someone unironically not fitting in. 

Now let me tell you how that meeting first went. I walked into a house party where they watching rent and signing along. They of course took offense that I wasn't signing and over exaggeratedly laughing and signing long. No excuses for a chill demeanor, I am nobody's hypeman. Through out the night there was stage dancing and many many insides jokes to which I was insulting them for not over exaggerating my reactions. Then at 1 point a girl who had just gotten a boob job invited most of the party to her bedroom to see the bags glow in the dark with a flash light. Being the new guy who wasn't on their level I wasn't invited and they were again insulted that my gf stayed with me in the living room.

Over all, yeah they knew how to have a party but were just very insular and didn't know how to interact outside their group to the point that being more regular and casually polite is insulting bc you aren't giving them the reactions they crave.

2 weeks later they invited themselves over her house impromptu to hang out with us. It was a play off football game. I thought oh great we'll get to chill on a normal level and setting, they thought this awkward dumb jock is ignoring us. They tried recreating the very same party they just had and were very upset that the football game stayed on and my wife never got the hint that it should be turned off. Once more while I never made any disparaging remarks about rent and showtunes, when ever they did pay attention to the game it was to make fun of the players than literally fall out of the chair to laugh about it.

They were theater kids, most likely Emo or screamo transitioning into hipster when that was still new. I was just a dude ina ball cap, very chill, fun playful, but not loud, dug my outdoors, southern rock, and play off football.

I never saw any of them again. My wife Hung out when we weren't together. Then 6 months later, she up and dumps me out of the blue. No real good reason, certainly no hints, and I didn't get much of an answer bc I just said ok and ghosted her. It hurt like hell, but I learned how to break up, you cut it off, tell yourself you will never see that person again and delete the number.

That wasn't what she expected and she kept trying to contact me. 2 weeks later we slept together and kept sleeping together but I wouldn't get in a relationship with her. She told her ""best friend"" she was sleeping with me again and she flipped out. The breaking up was influenced by the bff who really treated my wife like an accessory, and it was actually that bf that gave her the ultimatum. She could sleep with me or be a part of the group. This shocked the shit out of my wife and after a week of contemplating and reviewing past things, she had it out with her bff and that was it for the friendship. 

We kept dating for another 3 months before I was willing to trust it and make it official and serious again. She never hung out with any of them again. There's lots of reasons and motivations wrapped up in what went down like a male bff that slept with her on some dumb rebound with stupid reasons of not knowing what he wanted but seemingly didn't like that he couldn't come back around, and her bff being queen b and having her own troubles gettinga guy. The whole group on the girls side was a singles pact and a nose up to the ""basic"" life whic my wife was accessory to keeping that bs fascade up. They use eachother to convince themselves it's ok and we got the good stuff in life.

10 years later, none of them are married, none have kids, none own anything, and the bff is an other woman. While we have a beautiful family, a foundation, and great friends in the same boat.

Just wanted to share that sometimes unhealthy relationships can be friendships. There is always so much focus on significant others and ""friends"" get a huge pass, but friends can be every bit as selfish and controlling. Many groups of friends use eachother to commiserate. You see it happen on the male side with drinking buddies, where you realize you never did anything together without beer and you surround yourself with other alcoholics so you don't look out of place. I see women do it a lot on the family vs single life side, where some may legitimately want a single life and it does have its merits, yet they can't face it alone so they use other female friends and peer pressure them into similar circumstances.

Friends are fantastic, but friends aren't just people you have spent time with. Friends like a partner have to want the same thing for you that you want.",30Sep2017,39
25,"I've always believed quality is more important over quantity when it came to friends and family. However, coming out of my twenties and into my thirties I started to realize the fewer friends I had didn't automatically make them better.

I thought I was being choosy about who I spent my time with but I wasn't because while I cared about the people in my life and what happened to them and how they were doing, the reverse didn't necessarily apply.

Then a conversation with my mother made me realize this was a paradigm for how my life has always been. I told her I was planning on visiting relatives in Europe and she told me my aunt and cousins were thinking of doing the same thing at the same time, so maybe I should rethink my plans? I realized that her telling me I should change my plans to suit others was the norm - it was what was always expected of me.

That in turn made me realize that I adopted that habit myself with my own social life. My friendships started out fine but somewhere along the line, I subconsciously give people permission to disregard me.

I'm not sure how to break that cycle since I'm not consciously aware of when I allow it but I'm hoping it'll start when I stop disrespecting myself. ",30Sep2017,5

27,"One Saturday night my girlfriend, who basically lives with me and with whom I am madly in love, is out of town and I'm home alone. 10pm knock on the kitchen door, it's the hot Portuguese girl from next door wearing a shirt with a bottle of wine. 

""I thought you might want to try some Retsina.""  
""Uh, sure. Yeah sure, come in!""  

I'm puzzled. Why's she here so late? Did she just wake up? Looks like she's only wearing a shirt. Well maybe it's a European thing. The kitchen is filthy, like moldy glasses filthy, and so tiny that she has to stand by the door while I start to wash the crud out of a pair of glasses.  

""Don't worry about that,"" she says as she squeezes past me toward the living room, her boobs brushing across my arm. ""We don't need glasses.""  

Don't need glasses? Man, Europeans are weird. 

She sits on the ancient golden couch. She moves slowly, languidly. We talk about the wine, it's not bad.  

""I bet Amber would like this. She's not here, she went home this weekend.""  
""Yeah, I know,"" she says.  

She's tiny, with a tussled blonde light brown mane. She's a dancer, I'd filmed her in a friend's performance art piece in which she danced naked backlit behind a white sheet, the audience only seeing her perfectly proportioned projected silhouette. 

I'm kind of stumped, I seldom have guests and I don't really know her, and I don't know what to talk about, so I ask her about Portugal. She says it's old, and the people don't care, they just do what they want and they're happy. They drink wine, and they dance, and they make love, and they're happy. It sounds nice, I agree.  

""Do you ever think how people make love like dogs?"" she asks.  
""Uh...huh?"" I say.  
""Like dogs, people make love like dogs, you know? It's funny.""  

She is draped on the faded golden lion-footed couch, sleepy eyed but focused on me. I am focused on her bare feet, her lightly tanned calves, her smooth thighs. Is she really only wearing a shirt? Why would...   

It finally dawns on me. She wants to sleep with me! What an idiot I am. I roll my eyes and grin, a little apologetically.  

""Yeah, yeah I guess they do.""  
She looks puzzled and amused. ""You must really love her, don't you?""  
""Yeah. Yeah I really do,"" I admit.  
""She's a lucky girl. You should share the rest of this with her,"" she says standing up.

But, I just wanted to let them know how much this meant to me.  Replacing my driver's license would have costed about $30.  I've been kinda bummed about that.  Especially since lately, I've been more absentminded and clumsier than usual.

Anyways, much thanks to whomever person out there went out of their way to do this.  I really appreciate it!",30Sep2017,4

37,"Follow-up to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/725b37/have_a_good_weekend_well_its_official_im_not/). I meant to do this Wednesday, but now I'm lead on a website I didn't want to get roped in on when I was supposed to be just an assist. But, c'est la vie.

So we talked with some specialists, including a friend of mine who was a vet. On Sunday we decided to continue with the existing treatment. Things were looking bad, and I had to console my sister who was blaming herself for the whole thing. Not the break-up, but she felt that the cat had some kind of inherent trust in her to take care of her. I had to reassure her that this was all on me, not her. That when she left the cat in my apartment she became my responsibility, and that she had done nothing wrong.

The vet where she was at was very flexible in allowing her and my mother to visit, and they checked in on her, and kept her company when I couldn't. By Monday she had gone from ""can't lift her head"" to ""I'll climb into the litter box."" She was improving, but not enough to go home, not immediately, and I wasn't near ready to challenge that.

Wednesday morning I got the call: she was good enough to go home. I wasn't about to pick up a cat and leave her be in my apartment all alone for hour upon hour after her immediate discharge, so I opted to pick her up after work, but wanted to do some clean-up first.

I live in a studio apartment, with a three-season porch. It's basically an uninsulated room with a big bank of windows along one side, in this case facing west. So given that the heatwave has passed and we're moving into a proper autumn, the vet actually suggested we keep her in my bathroom. So I spent all this time cleaning up my porch only to find out the bathroom is the destination.

So Wednesday was in the bathroom, and quickly we realized that wasn't going to be reasonable in the long term. In just a little over a night the bathroom was stiflingly hot. So my mom and my sister, in my absence, finished my prep work on the porch, including procurement of a space heater with a thermostat (as crappy as it that thermostat is).

Over the past few days we've been feeding her, in conjunction with the vet's advice as we go along. The first day I goofed the creation of the food slurry the cat ""eats"" (is shoved down her surgically implanted esophageal tube). Too much water (though a flinch with an over-sized blender I had been lent) created an untenable volume (read: she puked after I fed her the first batch because it was too big).

Since then we've kind of dialed in the numbers and she's now being fed a more reasonable volume, and thanks to the help of my mother and sister we've set the poor wretched thing on the path of recovery. Three to four ""meals"" are fed to her, and so far she's gone from ""I want to hide"" to ""who's the cat on the other side of that door"" to ""floor is for plebs, I'll sit on the cat tree.""

**HUGE** leap from where she was on Sunday. Couldn't have done it without family, and I appreciate the encouragement from the folks here (who were encouraging; those of you who told me to kill her, you know who you are).

We're not quite at the point where her feeding tube should be removed, but according to the vet she's pissing out toxins associated with her disease, and absorbing nutrition from food. She's even crapping in her box, and hasn't vomited since my miscalculation.

Shout out to /u/lysslynnz and /u/moonskye, who each reached out to me for a follow-up.

Here's poor wretched mew mew when she was brought out for discharge and after I had brushed her in hopes of warming up her attitude: https://i.imgur.com/OBDoEJR.jpg

As you can see based on how drugged she was, she had very few shits to give. https://i.imgur.com/PiaJ27u.jpg

She was peacefully installed in my bathroom upon a nest of polar fleece, which she abandoned and ended up spreading kitty litter all over my floor and hiding behind the door. https://i.imgur.com/tYaWNRn.jpg

At one point my other cat, Deanna, thought that Kira was hiding out under my bed (as she had first done when she originally moved in, oh so long ago) https://i.imgur.com/w1kcMWf.jpg

Morning feedings looks something like this: https://i.imgur.com/CPksHji.jpg        
I've since borrowed some ramekins from my family to mix medications into the food, and have adjusted my feed-o-math to better accommodate her stomach and avoid making her gag and vomit.

[Here she is camping out along the door](https://i.imgur.com/rbs4qUA.jpg) of the porch. She's curious about what's happening outside the porch, and Deanna is being far less of a pest. They'll camp out and smell each other through the door. Note the syringe is in there while I'm switching from a flushing syringe of water to a ""meal"" syringe; if I remove he things begin to get regurgitated. The things that happen when a gullet isn't involved.

As a culmination of a week's worth of feeding, medication, love, and effort, [she's found the energy for a bit of a leap](https://i.imgur.com/sUf5Fcs.jpg), something she hasn't done since a couple days after I put her on the porch long ago.

She's doing **way** better, and based on the guidance of my vet friend, and the diagnosis of the vets who have seen her over the past few days, things are looking up. Apparently it's not too uncommon among cats who are fat, and undergoing great stress. I'd call three big changes in three weeks to be a great stress for a cat, so it kinda makes sense in hindsight.

38,"All throughout high school i basically had no friends to hang out with outside of school. Everyday I would go to the gym after school then go home. on the weekends I'd sit at home all day except for the 2ish hours a day I would go work out. Shit sucked but I thought that it might change once I move off to college. Once I came to college I made a small group of friends that were nothing like I was. I like all things sports and working out and rap music while they were all into board games and anime and not rap music. Also they were all pretty religious while I consider myself an atheist. We all played video games but I never played the types of video games they did. I only hung out with them because I was a loner and just really wanted friends. This lasted for three years. I'm now starting my 4th year and have decided to stop hanging out with them. The main reason is I don't believe they actually saw me as a friend, instead they just saw me as someone to recruit into there religious college group. After all these years they knew I didn't believe in any religion. I had told them straight up I was cool with hanging with them as long as it wasn't while they were doing religious things. Well every single fucking week they would ask me to join them in their small group which is basically a bible study. Every single week I would say no to that. I would put up with it I think because I was so afraid of being someone with no friends. The final straw was when I asked one of them to go to a baseball game with me last semester. He said he would only if I went to one of his bible study things. That's when it clicked that I wasn't really a friend to him. His only goal was to get me to be religious. Now this semester I've finally stopped talking to them. They still ask me every week to hang out and what not but I just say no to everything. I ran into one of them at our rec center the other day. He tried to start up a conversation but I just kept giving him one word answers and never actually looked him in the face. I'm sure they are starting to pick up on what I'm doing but I doubt they will stop asking me to hang out for at least this whole semester. Shit kinda sucks but I think I'll actually be happier without them always pressuring me to do something I don't want to do. Hopefully this semester I can make some new friends but I'm not really expecting that to happen as i have really bad anxiety when talking to new people but we will see. Anyways thanks for reading all this if you did and hopefully things start getting better for me.",30Sep2017,2
