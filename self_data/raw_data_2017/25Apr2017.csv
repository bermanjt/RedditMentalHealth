0,"I've made a lot of decisions recently that have been affecting my life as well as other things that set me back, withholding me from true freedom. One of those things is that I haven't come out yet as bisexual, to most of my friends and my family, and I can't find a way to be ""out"" as it is without being a better person, a more educated person and especially a more confident person. 

These past few weeks, I've just been more and more withdrawn, wanting to die a little bit, and seeing less hope in my current situation. I have no idea how most people would respond if I was out, and that terrifies me. I would have to wear that extra confidence of just not being heterosexual into school every day, in order to protect myself and not seem vulnerable. This may seem confusing for some of you who are straight, but this is the reality of closeted LGBT people every day. Maybe I'm letting it get to my head, but it's all I can think about when I go into school, another day I have to pretend I'm straight. Another day that I have to fit in. I pretty much always censor my words around other people, in fact, I have a tight filter so that what I say can please other people. But the words that I say don't represent what I think and there's a huge cognitive dissonance. To stem from that, most of the people I interact with outside of school are my own family, and I doubt they would be supportive. But for now it feels like a burden I have to carry on my own. What should I do to build personal confidence, and how can I extend my range of people and make real connections with other people? I would greatly appreciate feedback :)

I don't usually take my phone to the pool because I am paranoid about it being stolen when I am swimming in a direction where I can't see my gym bag. So does that mean for the heart rate monitor/distance tracker/calorie tracker to work, I have to start taking my phone to the pool with me so there is a Bluetooth connection? And if this is the case, what if I swim far enough away from my phone to lose the Bluetooth connection? 

Also, doesn't having the tracker on my wrist advertise to potential thieves that there is an unattended phone in a nearby bag? I really hope someone can get back to me ASAP about this. I have no idea how this thing works. TIA.",25Apr2017,1

12,"I'm an engineering student in Boston. Today I had a long day of final exams so I hopped on my longboard and fucked off to the Public Gardens, sort of our 'Central Park.' Loads of people were out and about. Folks clearly just leaving work in the financial district, families walking around, etc. 

It was a perfect day for cruising. The paths at the Public Garden are ever so gently sloped and perfectly smooth so you can roll forever before you need to push. Plus, it's illegal so there's some illicit thrill of defying The Man.

I came around a corner and saw a man lying face down towards the side of the path. His cheek was planted on the hard asphalt and his body position was that of a man who chose to lie down for a quick rest. His mouth was closed and he seemed to have a peaceful expression on his face.

He was much older than me, with worn skin and wrinkled hands laid on the ground in front of him, above his head. His baseball cap, T-shirt, and sweatpants were the nondescript, vaguely shabby kind that you'd see at Goodwill, but he was wearing unusually nice leather boots.

I bent over and tried to rouse him gently. No response, but when I got closer I saw he was breathing. I shook harder. Still nothing, but I felt his body tighten in response so I figured somebody was home.

My brother is 35 and lives with a variety of mental conditions and neurological disorders. Sometimes he gets into a *really* deep sleep, the same way that drunk people do. The brain just switches off for some reason I guess. When I need to rouse my brother I always tug on the top of his ear. I don't know why, but it always works. So I tugged this guy's ear and asked loudly if he could hear me.

It worked, he opened his eyes excruciatingly slowly and began to awake from his slumber, like an ancient robot that was powering up for the first time in a thousand years. At a pace akin to the sloth that works at the DMV in Zootopia, he rolled onto his back, and grumbled something unintelligible. His eyes were open but were focused on something a thousand yards away.

""WHAT? I DIDN'T HEAR YOU. ARE YOU OKAY?"" I pantomimed the universal 'ok' symbol.

""bhrera godrom ara horbo"" He mumbled.

""WHAT? DO YOU WANT AMBULANCE? DOCTORS OKAY?""

He sat up painfully slowly and looked at me for the first time in our interaction. His eyes were bloodshot. His eyelids drooped. His general affect was exactly the same as my brother's after a seizure.

""bhur uhhg yeh."" He nodded his head like it weighed fifty pounds.

I called 911 and asked for an ambulance. 

""Sure thing, the ambulance will be there right away blah blah blah."" 

While waiting, I sat on my board next to him and tried to make chit chat. What's your name? What was your day like? Why aren't you laying on the grass instead of this hard surface?

""brur it ismt ahy amp an am hur cant grass""

He only had one or two teeth, which was hindering communication. I couldn't help thinking maybe laying on your face is more comfortable if you don't have teeth.

I was pretty sure he was talking about the ""don't go on the grass"" signs, which were being freely disrespected by just about everybody within the confines of the park, aside from him. Maybe he was referring to cannabis. Hard to say.

The ambulance pulls up in like 200 seconds because Boston. In those 200 seconds two random people in blue scrubs asked if we were okay. 

One time I landed on my face while longboarding and won an ambulance ride from some concerned cyclists. After I was loaded in and the EMTs were ready to go, one of them asked what emergency room I wanted to go to. ""Um, there are choices? Why not the closest one?"" He just laughed at me.

Anyway, four guys hop out of the ambulance and roll a stretcher over. Two are brown-coat security types and two are white-coat types.

""Hey Ian, how are you doing today! Just hanging out?""

""hem an hurd an jerm""

Me: ""Do y'all know him?""

No response. The guys started doing their job as if I wasn't there, lifting him onto the stretcher and talking to each other about when they saw him last and stuff and how it was such a nice day. One of the brown coats finally acknowledged me.

""We're good here, you can leave""

Me: ""Well, uh, okay. Have a good day y'all.""

""You too""

So I skated off. Once I was out of the area, the mental dam broke and I started sobbing uncontrollably, overwhelmed.

My parents are wealthy. My brother has always had the finest medical attention, all the tests, all the latest expensive medicines. He's got an implanted pacemaker-esque thingy for his seizures that cost a gajillion dollars. They've tried a ketogenic diet. Essential oils. Chiropractory. Anything with even the remotest chance of helping him, they tried. 

The biggest thing my brother has to worry about on a day-to-day basis is whether he wants oatmeal with dinosaur eggs or cheese grits for breakfast. Those are the only things he'll eat in the morning and it's always a lengthy negotiation.

I couldn't stop thinking about the guy's teeth. My brother has knocked out a bunch of his front teeth, top and bottom, from falling in sudden seizures. He wore a helmet back when the doctors didn't know so much about mitigating seizures, when he was in his early teens. Today he has an absolutely perfect smile, which he displays frequently. He got the best implants money can buy. I wonder how the guy on the sidewalk lost his teeth.

With just a tiny tweak of fate, that could have been my brother there on that sidewalk. Without my parent's ability to devote time and money for his care, my brother could have slid into that position, if he even lived to be as old as this man: duhumanized, looked down upon by the productive members of society, and truly alone with nary a scrap of dignity in an endless kafkaesque nightmare.

It's not fair, that one human should be metaphorically allowed into heaven and one should be sent to hell, in this way. But, life isn't fair. The world keeps turning. On to the next thing in my day. I typed this out as therapy and it did make me feel better. Something about shooting off documentation into the ether of /r/self makes me feel better about stuff.

Appreciate your minds, y'all. A brain in good order is a remarkable gift.",25Apr2017,646
18,"**Monday, April 24, 2017** All of these calls are recorded on my phone

In the eyes of my father…

I am manipulative, a liar, and a disappointment. 

I called him today and we talked. I don’t know why I called him. He told me that I had manipulated the situation between him and my mother. He told me that I had orchestrated events so that she took him to court again. He told me that my mom was threatening to call his boss and tell his boss that he was an abusive father.

I told him that he was wrong, and that I wasn’t those things. I told him that I was too stupid to be manipulative. I told him that I didn’t want to fight with him. I asked him why I would push things in this direction, and make this happen. 

He told me that he didn’t know why I was doing it, but he knew I was doing it on purpose, because I’m smart enough to know better. I told him that I wanted to kill myself and I told him that yesterday I wanted to hang myself on a pipe in a bathroom and he told me that 
“If that’s true, you should talk to a counselor.”

 I told him that I tried to schedule an appointment, but they’re booked three weeks out, and the semester ends in two weeks. 
He told me that if I’m serious I should go immediately and ask for an emergency appointment, and I told him that I didn’t want to end up in rehab for the last weeks of the semester. He told me that’s not what happens when an adult asks for help, but he’s wrong.

Anyway, he told me that he didn’t want to hear about it anymore. Then we started talking about the car, and he told me that I was in the wrong and I needed to understand that. I got angry, and then I asked him why he thought I was calling him. He told me that he thought I was calling him so I could manipulate him into giving me the car. 

“Why do you think I’m calling you?”

“You’re calling me so you can manipulate me into giving you the car.”

I asked him if he thought a person like that should be around in the world. He told me that I should talk to a counselor, and that I can change as a person. I got off the phone after that. 

I went to my next class but I couldn’t focus. I went to Hamp after. On the way, I called a local counselor in BLANK but no one picked up the phone. Then I went to the bus stop at Southwest and sat down on the grass and called Grandpa. BLANK, my step-Grandma, answered the phone, and she seemed happy to talk with me and she told me that she loved me. 

She gave the phone to Grandpa and he was angry. He was shouting. He told me that I’d ignored his advice, and he said…a lot. He said that I made this happen, that I was rude and a disappointment and he didn’t want me in his family anymore. He said that I was rude in France, and he said that my father was right on this one, that even though my father was wrong about a lot of things he was right about this one, and he said…a lot of things. He said that I was manipulative, and when I told him that I wasn’t he said *“bullshit, don’t give me that bullshit,”* and I told him, **“If I was manipulating things, why would I logically want anything to be this way?” How did this help me? How did ruining my relationship with my father help me? How did losing my car help me? How did letting things develop like this help me? If I was manipulative why would I manipulate things this way?**

He told me he didn’t know. He advised me to call my father and tell him that I wanted to talk as an adult, and work things out. He told me that I’d probably ruined my relationship with my father, and that there was no coming back from this one, and that it was probably over, but the best thing to do would be to call him, and do what he told me to do, and hope things worked out.

He also told me that I should only do that if I really wanted to repair the relationship. 

I’d been counting time by the buses that went by. Every fifteen minutes the Southwest-Orchard Hill bus would run by, and a bunch of people would get off or on, all perfect people with beautiful bodies and big smiles, and then the bus would leave. Four buses went by while I was laying in the grass. 

I spent the whole day on this. I’d called dad at nine, talked to him for an hour, and then I’d gotten off the phone with Grandpa at three. 

I guess you’re wondering what I did wrong? (Like anyone gives a fuck)

Last night, I sent my dad an email saying this:

--------------------------------- 

Apr 19 
 
	
Son,

A parent plus loan application to cover the remaining portion of your spring tuition bill has been submitted.  You can follow up with the financial aid office.

Do advise when you will be returning my car.

Your Father
 
-----------------------------
 
	
Dad,

I tried calling you earlier. 

The parent plus loan was declined. The current outstanding balance is $2,216.00.

The car is in the shop. 
 
 
-------------------------------

Apr 23
 		 
 
to me
 
	
Son,

I have received no notification that the loan was declined.  I suggest you forward same if you received it.  My understanding is that it is being processed.

Where is my car, and what is your plan for returning it?

Your Father
 
 
-------------------------------

Apr 23 
 
	
Dad,

I did not receive notification. I found out the loan was declined by checking BLANK.

The car is located at BLANK.

Best,

blank
 
------------------------------
	
Son,

I do not believe the loan was declined.  I believe you are looking at a notification for a credit card payment, which I began to process but then changed as I opted to pursue a PLUS loan instead.  You should read the note fully and make sure you understand it as it should indicate credit card.  You should also contact financial aid when they are open tomorrow in the event there is something you need to do with regard to the loan.  It was my understanding that you had not completed the financial aid process for next year either, and you should do so.

Please provide an update as to (1) when the car will be completed (you indicated the other day that the work had already been done - which is apparently untrue), and (2) when you will be returning the car to me.

Your Father

to dad
 
	
Regarding the car - I will be unable to drive it to -------, but if you want I can leave it here at --------- for you to pick up.

---------------------------------------
 
 	Apr 23 (1 day ago)
 		 
 
to me
 
	
Blank,

You will have to drive it to --------------.  Your behavior has been extremely poor, and this is another example of self-serving and inappropriate behavior on your part.  Should you persist in going down this path you will quickly find that you will have no contact with any member of this side of the family.

You also owe me money that you have not paid over, and you need to replace a hubcap on the car.

Your Father
 
 
---------------------------------

Apr 23 (1 day ago)
 		 
 
to 
 
	
Dad,

I don't see why I'm legally required to drive the car to Salem. The only reason I would drove it would be because I cared about preserving my relationship with you - and frankly, at this point I don't, because you don't care either. I will leave the car in Amherst. If BLANK LIST don't want to be a part of my life, that is their decision, not yours.
 
 	
Apr 23 (1 day ago)
 		 
 
to me
 
	
(blank), 

You are legally obligated to drive my car to BLANK because you have possession of the car on the premise and condition that you would be responsible in maintaining it and would return it to me when asked.  You also need to return it in the condition you took it in - so you need to replace the hubcap.  In addition, you need to pay over the money you owe me for your toll charges and credit card purchases.  You cannot simply avoid your responsibilities because they are inconvenient or embarrassing for you to meet.

To be clear, you are making the choices that are resulting in the problems you have, and those actions have consequences.  You could have avoided all of this by behaving more maturely and responsibly.  You chose to avoid dealing responsibly with your tuition, financial aid, and the car.  You were well aware as to your responsibilities, and as you should be able to understand I cannot pay a bill I am not provided.  You didn't take care of your obligation, which resulted in the delay you now have.  You also chose to lie about and misrepresent all of those things repeatedly.  You very deliberately and maliciously acted out, and you chose to be repeatedly profane and insulting on the telephone. Those were your choices.  You had ample opportunity to avoid, and/or cease, behaving that way.  

With regard to the members of my side of the family - you are correct, it would be their decision.  However, I will state that your behavior and choices will result in no one having respect for you.  I will also state that you have made it very clear that you have no respect for me or my role as your father.  You are hardly a victim here.  You are behaving extremely poorly and it is unfortunate that you have chosen to act this way.  You should avoid compounding your error further.

In addition to returning my car, you will also need to retrieve your personal items that you have left at my home.  I will not keep them here for you.  You should also let me know if you would prefer me to transfer your mobile number to you or if you will obtain a new one as i will no longer be paying for your phone after the end of this month.  What you should at least attempt to do is handle this aspect of your decisions maturely.

Your Father
 
 
----------------------------------

	Apr 23 (1 day ago)
 		 
 
to Dad
 
	
Dad,

Whose law?
 
 
----------------------------

Apr 23 (1 day ago) 		 
 
to me

Son,

I am not going to argue with you via email.  You will need to satisfy your obligations, or there will be further consequences as a result of your choices.  I suggest you take some time to think through your decisions.

Your Father
 
 ----------------------------

Apr 23 (1 day ago)
 		 
 
to Dad
 
	
Show me a contract stating that I am required to drive the car back. 
 
------------------------------------

This happened because I’m an asshole. I am not proud of this or happy about this, but I got angry and that’s on me.

Beyond that, I’m angry at my dad because of the tuition bill. I’m angry because he promised to help with the tuition bill and he refused. He “lost” the Ferpa access code I gave him months ago, and then he blamed me for not creating one. He’s playing dumb because he doesn’t feel like helping with the bill. 

You know what that makes me in the eyes of everyone? A spoiled, entitled child. I’m demanding that my father help with my tuition bill, and that makes me a criminal. Which is why I want to kill myself, and it’s a good reason. 

I shouldn’t expect him to help with the bill. 

Here’s why I expect him to help with the bill.

When my mom and dad divorced, they agreed in the divorce contract that each of them would help with my bill after loans, scholarships, and federal student aid had been applied. They are supposed to assist 60/40. 

Reader, I know what you want to say. You want to say

“Yes, dude, there is a court agreement. But that doesn’t mean you should expect your father to help with the bill. Morally you should respect your father and do as he wishes.”

Okay, good point, reader. Wow, look, I know that too. Here’s the problem.

Mom is paying her 40%. She insists on paying her 40%. She is adamant on helping me pay for college. 

So, she expects my dad to pay his 60%. She believes that if she is abiding by the court document, he should also abide by the court document.

My dad does not want to pay his 60%. He makes excuses and makes me jump through hoops to get him to help.

They go to court over this issue every semester.

I continually get dragged into this issue. If mom yells at dad, dad hurts me by withdrawing support, which currently includes the car. If dad yells at mom, mom sends me angry text messages and denies me summer housing. I don’t like living with dad because when I was a kid he used to strangle me sometimes and I still have bad memories of that. It’s totally legal to do what he did, mom called child services and he is within the law. They told me that what he did was okay. But I still think about it a lot, and last spring he strangled me twice, and I don’t want that to happen again so I can’t live with him. I hate thinking about it.

If I make dad angry, he takes away my transportation.

If I make mom angry, she takes away my housing.

Each of them wants me to pick a side. 

I made it clear when I started college that I did not want to get dragged into this issue. The following email was written on July 30th, 2015, when mom and dad first started going to court over my college expenses.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**On College:**

It's become clear that both of you are confused about what I personally want from my College experience. This is my fault. A lot of the time I spin my words to make you happy because I'm afraid that you won't like me if I tell you something you don't agree with. This is a problem. When you two try to talk about what is best for me, you fight, because you're trying to advocate for two different (blanks). I'm sorry. I never wanted to cause conflict, I just wanted both of you to be happy. That's hard, because you're two very different people and I felt that the only way you could both be proud of me was if I wanted two very different things.

In this email, I am going to set the record straight. Consider this the definitive guide on what (blank) really wants from college.

First, I want to improve myself. I want to learn as much as possible and I want to use that knowledge to gain a better understanding of myself as an individual. This means getting good grades and becoming involved in extracurricular activities. I want to be more successful in college than I was in high school.

Second, I want to make friends! This means living in the dorms, getting my license so I can travel to events with friends, and attending the occasional party. I know dad worries that I might embarrass the family if I attend _______, but I will not. I know he does not trust me, and he has good reason not too. But please take my word for it. I will not embarrass the family if I attend ___________. I feel that I've made too high of an investment in Salem to do so. 

Third, I want to have fun! College is supposed to be a time when people experience new things and learn about themselves. Again, this means keeping my grades up, making friends, and living in the dorms.

Lastly, I want to become independent. It's a long road, but over the next four years my hope is to find steady work, rent an apartment with roommates, and really just become my own person. That means paying my own insurance, buying my own car, and doing all of the other things that make someone an adult, none of which I really understand at the moment. (But I want to understand!) 

**On Paying for College:**

Sometimes I feel that, just by existing, I create arguments about child support, tuition, and other costs associated with me. This is very stressful. Lately, with college and everything else, I feel like I am a financial burden to both of my families. I don't want to be a financial burden. Because of that, it's especially hard talking to you about money, because I feel like I'm taking advantage of you whenever I ask for help. I don't want to be the kind of son who uses his parents. But if you want me to attend college, I will need financial assistance. Even if I work part time during the school year and full time during the summers, (And I will), I won't be able to afford a college education unless I accrue large amounts of student loan debt and/or receive help from you. I do not want to put myself in a position where I will be paying back student loan debt for the next fifteen years. I will use loans to pay for some of my college expense, but if I cannot finance my education through sources beyond loans, I will not be attending college. If you do not want to help me pay for college, then please don't. I won't hold it against you, because I understand that each of you has financial obligations of your own and I'd feel guilty if helping me hurt you. I am eighteen years old. You are not required to help me pay for anything. I am thankful for every dollar of assistance you give me. I do not want to take advantage. Don't paint me as someone who is taking advantage. 

**On Child Support:**

It's none of my business. It might be an expense associated with me, but I never asked you to pay or receive child support in any amount. Too often I've made the mistake of getting involved in the child support conversation, and for that, I'm sorry. It's hard not too, because the topic concerns me and I love talking about myself. But the issue of child support forces me to choose one parent over the other. I love both of my parents equally. Because of that, I do not want to be personally involved in any conversation concerning child support. Furthermore, if I mention anything concerning my finances to you, don't use my words to justify your viewpoint in the child support argument. If either of you says ""BLANK said this"", the other should know that I didn't want my words to be used in an attack on you. Today, I called mom and bitched about how expensive drivers ed was. This lead to mom calling dad and arguing with him. This lead to Dad calling me downstairs and talking to me. This exact scenario plays out at least once a week. Afterwards, I usually feel like vomiting. Child support is none of my business. Arguments between my parents are none of my business. It's incredibly stressful for me to deal arguments between the two of you because I feel like I have to pick a side. I don't want to pick sides. If I talk to you about my money problems, please don't use our conversation in a conversation about child support. Please don't involve me in your arguments. **I cannot stress this enough.** 

**On Lectures and Advice.**

Although it might not always seem like it, I'm open to advice about how I should live my life. But I have trouble listening when I feel that I am being talked down to or told what to do. This is because I am a very hotheaded person and when I feel insulted it's very hard for me to hear anything. If you want to give me advice or tell me something, it would be easier for me to listen if we could sit down somewhere quiet and talk about it in a conversational manner, where I could feel comfortable offering my input and personal insights on the advice. For me, anger comes easy, especially when I feel like I'm not in control of a situation. It's sad, but at least I understand that being told what to do drives me to argue against what I'm being told. 

**To Conclude:**

I know that this might read like some great ""manifesto"", but please don't look at it that way. The point of this email is to give you both an understanding of what I want regarding college, and to explain that I do not want to be involved in any conversation about child support, or in any arguments between the two of you. I know that I'm not a perfect son, and I'm sorry that I'm not. But I want you to understand that I love both of you, and although I might seem weird sometimes, it's just because I am very stressed and confused about both my life and my future. A lot of the time I have no clear idea what I'm doing, and because of that it's easy for me to make bad mistakes - but I don't want to be a bad guy.

Love,

BLANK

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Now, obviously, some of my opinions have changed in the intervening two years. First off, I believe that I would be happier if I did not receive any financial support from my parents. I am tired of this fight. It has been two years of constant fighting. I am tired. I am so tired of this fight. 

Additionally, my parents are actually legally required to assist me. I just didn’t know that at the time. My dad currently owes my mom and I 1700 dollars because he refused to assist last semester, and my mom took him to court again and the judge said that my dad owes us that much money because he didn’t help.

How does this tie back to my earlier emails?

If I do not pay my college bill in a week I will be expelled from the University.

To this date, my father has not helped with my bill. I maintain that I gave him access to my spire account and my ferpa months ago. Access to my spire was given verbally and cannot be proved. Access to my ferpa was given via text and can be proved.

Until today, I believed that access to spire and ferpa are the only things necessary for a successful bill payment.

Today I learned that my mom had been forging my name on parent+ loan documents, so now I know that I am required to cosign on parent+ loans. 

Anyway.

I was angry because I believed that he was purposefully trying to make it impossible for me to succeed in college. So, I yelled at him, and I cursed at him over the phone. It’s all recorded. And now he’s done being my father. So that’s how all of the above connects. All of the stress and anger came out at once and I screamed at him, and now he’s done with me. 

So…that’s about it, I think. I mean there’s more. There’s more fights, and stuff, but this is it, really. The money fight is at the center of everything. It’s all about the money.

33,"This year, there's been a lot more controversy than ever, plus it seems the candidates made the stakes seem really high. The night when they were reading out their manifestos, one presidential candidate showed a compilation video of several famous musicians in my country urging us to vote for them. Of course, we cheered really loudly. Our principal stopped the candidate before their speech and said lots of things, half of which I didn't hear, but the gist of it is he implied we weren't going to vote for the candidate, we were only excited for the rappers and singers. And then he said Spirit Week (something the SRC implemented) was useless. He also blew up at his nephew who goes to our school, telling him to shut up in the presence of everybody, and said ""that's why you're unsuccessful"".

Manifesto Night is really showy to get our attention, because we are teenagers. The principal said all the displays were unnecessary and did not mean anything. He also added, ""And this adds to the problem of why our country has so many election problems.""

40,"Hey guys! 
I would appreciate some good advice here! 
So, here goes my story. I've just been ghosted for the third time so I'm clearly choosing the wrong type of guys to date. 
The first time I was very young (I was 22 years old) and didn't have much experience with relationships. We had been dating for a few months. We've had a crush on each other for years (since we where 16). He would never have time for me and he would just ignore me for hours sometimes days. One day he asked me to go spend the weekend with him. Things went south and long story short he left me with no money and no way to get home at the train station (he lived far). Never saw him again after that. A year ago he wrote to me in Facebook to appologize and asked me to go with him to a concert and stay with him at the hotel. I said no. 
Second time was last year. I was dating this guy and suddenly he just stops writing back. A month after I found out he has 4 other girls. One of them was my friend and she knew about it. Once we all found out, we got together to talk and went all to get tested after that (thankfully we where all clean). He was left with no one after that and I haven't talked to him again after recieving some very rude messages. 
Forward to this year, so I'm dating this guy for 4 months. Since the beginning I always have to go to him because he doesn't have time. I would spend the night and then I would see him again e 3 weeks when I would go to him again. This worked for 2 months because we would talk a lot when we couldn't see each other but after the first two months he started to reply less and less and would never pick up the phone. We started to argue and I told him I wouldn't stand for it because it had happened before already. Now I've just been ghosted. 2 weeks ago he said he didn't want to break up. That was the last I heard from him. 
I obviously need to stand up for myself more and value myself more as well. The question that brings me here is how does one choose. I keep hearing from everyone that I need to choose better dates. But how? ",25Apr2017,3

48," We're married lesbians. Our best friends are a married queer couple with a young child. We've been friends for a few years, which has gradually become best friends. They're much older than us, and for a while had no idea why we were hanging out with them. They claim to not have very many friends, but that doesn't really seem to be the case. We love their kid and try to help out any way we can, since they don't have family nearby.

But things have changed in intensity in the last year. They have on occasion introduced us as their kid's co-parents. We are making plans to go on a vacation together in the summer. We started seeing each other literally as often as possible.

And two weeks ago, half our home was destroyed. So we moved in with them. We spend all of our time together when we're not at work. They are happier. So are we. I haven't been this happy since my wedding. 

We can all cuddle on the couch or grapple on the floor or just sit and drink and laugh for hours. We love each other and say it all the time. We can be vulnerable and protective of each other. Our conversations are becoming something more intimate; these are things I don't think any of us share outside of this relationship. They're our people.

We keep making jokes about making this more permanent. It doesn't seem like any of us are ready for this to end.

54,"I considered posting this to /r/confessions but this is more of a realization than anything and I don't feel guilty about it (maybe a little).

I've always been fairly curious about sex ever since I was quite young. I figured out how good the showerhead felt when I was 7? 8? Around that age. Of course at the time I had no idea it was called masturbation, only that it felt good. I grew up in a fairly conservative household practicing a particular religion I won't name. But obviously religion being religion, masturbation was forbidden. 

At 13 years old I got together with a 24 year old guy who touched me and as much as I feel disgusted at the thought now, at the time it felt good when he did. I still struggle with these feelings because it doesn't feel right to me that I let him touch me. We had a huge age gap and honestly I felt like he was grooming me more than anything. 

During my teenage years I got together with several different boys who helped me discover some of my current kinks. I found out I loved really rough sex when I was 16ish. Looked more into it and identified myself as a sub.

Fast forward to now. I'm in my 20s living with my parents who are still under the assumption that I practice the household religion (I don't). We're in a conservative country and from the outside I look like a fairly normal girl who dresses modestly and conforms to the rules and whatnot. Goody two shoes if you will. 

But I've got a boyfriend I'm very very kinky with. And if it wasn't for feeling shameful and guilty for exposing my body (hard to overcome something ingrained in you since childhood), I would send so many nudes to him. Take lots of pictures and videos and tease him. I'd be really sexual, much much more than I am now. 

Which brings me to my next point. I feel like if I wasn't in such a restricted, conservative space I would whore myself around (and I mean that in the least demeaning way possible). I'd sleep with lots of people and explore my sexuality more. Be really slutty, dress how I want, show off and be sexy. Flirt with people and have one night stands. Obviously I wouldn't do this because I have a boyfriend and I'm very happy with how sexual we are with each other but God, if I was single I'd do a lot of exploring. Have a fuck buddy I can practice skills on to use with other people and shit like that.

I feel like it would be fucking awesome. I'm a little concerned that I'd be a sex addict, but honestly I just feel like I'd be very promiscuous. Which I feel a little shameful for, but growing up in a religious home does that to you I guess. I think about sex all the time and I crave my boyfriend all the time. He makes me feel really good and always leaves me hungry for more.

65,"Hello. Throwaway for reasons explained later. I should start by saying I'm 16 and from the UK.

For the last few weeks, we have been playing rounders in P.E. If you don't what rounders is, it is basically baseball with a smaller bat and ball. There are four bases. Getting to second scores your team half a rounder, getting to fourth scores you a whole rounder.

Now I'm willing to say I'm not the best at P.E, but I secretly have knack (nack?) for rounders, but nobody really knows about it, or, knew about it. In our class we have a pretty (un)popular kid who fucking constantly berates and insults people when they make mistakes/ are bad at sports. He is a cruel fucking bully who has no empathy for anyone. He shouts out these remarks to whole class and his fucking bully friends giggle about it. He has something against me, thus why the throwaway since he found my reddit and bullied me about it.

Anyway, we'll call him Charlie. I used to be good friends with Charlie, before he became a cunt, he was honest and friendly, then he started telling people shit about me that wasn't true. Some came forward and confronted me about it. That's when I found out he was a manipulative snake. All of this is important to keep in mind.

So, I'll set the scene, I'm batting and Charlie is fielding. He is near fourth base, spewing insults me as I step up as batter. He mockingly shouts ""OH BOYS BEST MOVE OUTFIELD FOR THIS ONE AHAH."" Bye this, he was sarcastically suggesting that I won't hit the ball/ if I do it won't go far. After 45 minutes of putting up with his shit, I was pissed. Bat in hand, I stepped up. Charlie dribbled out one last insult before the bowler threw the ball.

Oh it was gorgeous. The ball, thrown terrifically hard, while I, enraged by Charlie, unleashed a thousand metric shit tons of force upon the ball. I have never done anything so impressive in sports, the form was perfect, the swing was perfect. The bat collided with the ball. I heard a beautifully executed CRACK as they made contact. I ran to first base, not knowing how far it had gone, only to realise, the ball was still in the air, yet going furthest than anyone had hit that game. I laughed as people commented and shouted about the perfect hit. I had time to walk from first to third without anyone even being close to picking up he ball, I saw the ball moving in closer to the pitch, soon it was passed to Charlie, 50m or so away from fourth base, sprinting, terrified to try and stump the base to get me out.I wasn't five meters away. However, i didn't tap the base to get the rounder, I waited until Charlie was in diving distance of the post, and then tapped.

My batting team were screaming and shouting with glee, that me, the underdog, delivered such a beautiful shot, with elegance and class and mugged off some pompous idiot bully who thinks he is better than everyone else.

It gets better, on my batting team was a really tough kid. He is fucking hard and intimidating, but is secretly incredibly friendly, rallied up a football hooligan chant insulting Charlie for being a bad fielder. Charlie constantly tries to befriend this tough kid and bring him into his gang, he really looks up to him, except this intimidating kid hates his guts. Charlie's cronies were laughing at him. He looked incredibly flustered and paniced. He looked like his whole world collapsed around him. The snarky, smirk I gave him at the final base will stay with me forever.

Even in the changing rooms, he had the thousand yard stare. I like to think he is losing sleep over it.
