0,"There's not really anyone I can talk to that would offer me unbiased advice on this, so I decided to post here. I just turned 19, and about a year and a half ago I had never touched alcohol or drugs. I wanted to get the whole teenage experience though, you know? I always wanted to get out, party, have a good time. And eventually it happened. I started going to parties with my friends, who always laughed at my inexperience with drinking. I had a lot of great nights, and a few where my drunken antics would get the better of me. Same as any teenager I suppose. 

Anyway, for about a year that's all that we done. Just went out and got hammered. No drugs. We smoked weed a couple of times at a friend's house who's mom had some, and I really enjoyed it, but that was it for a long time. Until we started talking more to this guy my friends knew. He's a really genuinely nice guy, I can't state that enough. Insanely friendly and always looking out for us.

The problem is he sells cocaine. He's not some major drug dealer, and he's not involved in some violent gang or anything, he just sells to people he knows to make some money. When we first met him he didn't do it too much, and he talked about how he was gonna stop doing it soon cause it was too much hassle. Obviously, at this age when we've all been experimenting, getting some blow for a discount was a great idea. So we did. I didn't even enjoy it that much. I felt like if I had been out drinking it sobered me up too much, and I hate not being able to sleep after it. But some of my friends liked it, so it became a thing. Most of them would buy a gram or whatever whenever we were out. It's honestly insanely common around my town. Don't know if it's a generational thing, but it seems like almost everyone I know is on something when the weekend comes.

Now I'm pretty laid back. People taking drugs on a night out never bothers me. But as the months went on I realised some of my friends can't have a good night anymore without putting something up their nose. Those of us who aren't that reliant on it will say on Monday we're having a weekend free of it, but 9 times out of 10 we'll be snorting it again come the weekend. We're incapable of just going out for a couple of drinks or something. Some are worse than others. I'm one of the least affected. Don't get me wrong, I'd I get a few drinks in me I'll likely be right there with them, but I can still have a good night without it. It's just scary how I can see a couple of them getting kind of addicted at the weekend man.

Nowadays it seems like all we do is sit in someone's house and get as fucked up as humanly possible. That weekend I tried molly for the first time, and I really enjoyed it, but over the past few days I've started to think, is this it? Is this really the most fun we can have nowadays? Most would say if I was worried to cut ties, but I've known some of these guys for years man. I've grown up with them. And honestly it's not a massive problem. Nobody's so addicted that they're like fiending through the week. I'm just kind of scared that the possibility is there, you know? At this point the guy who 'supplies' us is a pretty good friend man, and honestly apart from the drugs he's an amazing dude. But it seems like he's not gonna stop dealing anytime soon, and our weekends will keep being absolute binges. I enjoy it to some extent, but I just don't want it to lead to larger problems. Am I being paranoid? When would this become something to worry about?",14Jul2017,1
1,"I just moved into my first apartment this summer. I've been really excited about this because I don't like being home and now I have a very strong purpose to not have to go home unless it's necessary. For most of the summer it'll just be me. My two roommates won't really be living here consistently until school starts. First problem, I get nervous being alone especially at night. Its something that has always bothered me no matter where I am but it's worse now that I'm in a city and in my own place and it's just not as safe as being on campus, or in a quiet neighborhood. The other big problem is that I'm worried I won't be able to afford it. I know that with my job during the semester I'll probably make enough but right now I'm working less and with utilities and food I'm just constantly scared I won't be able to afford it. I already needed help from my parents for the security deposit and that's bad enough. I also feel like I got screwed over. My other two roommates got better rooms than me, it's totally obvious. I'm not going to throw a tantrum over it (even though I want to) but my room is the smallest and it's an awkward shape and its slanted a bit so when I'm in my rolling chair it moves me away from my desk. I'm also mostly freaking out because one of my roommates said she's coming tonight and I warned her that it's still not totally cleaned because I'm still figuring out where to put stuff and we have a lot of boxes. She made a semi big deal about it with a whole ""arewe going to be a clean home or not because I can't live like that"" and I'll give her the benefit of the doubt she has a lot of anxiety issues and it's hard for her to not have things the way she likes them. But I just can't deal with either of them getting upset at me for not being perfect, it reminds me of home which is what I was trying to escape. I just feel like I'm not good enough for this and I'm scared but I don't know what I can do to make things better",14Jul2017,6

6,"I mean, I've known this for a while, but it really hits home when she has a death in her extended family and she can't even be bothered to send me an e-mail to let me know.

I haven't spoken to her in a few weeks and I assumed it was because she was busy - that's how her life is. But no, somebody died.

I e-mailed her yesterday, she didn't get back to me. I bet the next we speak she'll tell me that she did e-mail about it. And when I'll her she didn't, she won't believe me. Or some nonsense like that. 

Now I'm just sitting here feeling depressed because her and my relationship is hanging by a thread that's probably going to snap within a couple of years, if not sooner. And then I'll be left with one friend.

When do words and actions stop hurting?

Can I be like the Buddha, maybe, and detach from this earthly plane?

Imagine a lavish party with friends and balloons, if you want, and some mediocre food. I imagine a friend's wedding. It happened a few weeks ago. The stars are out. The building doors are all open, eight of them on two sides, a stage and a kitchen on the other two. The outside air is gentle and the guests are mingling and dancing. The bride fades in and out of view, floating through the crowd in her pearly white gown. She is a gossamer ghost and doesn't matter to us.

Our eyes are on one of the three best men. He's wearing a black suit with some sort of purple fabric on the back. It's silly, but his smile is wide and bright. He dances with another girl late in the night.

Imagine drinking alcohol with a friend, toasting to good health and happiness, finding excuses to misbehave. The polluted river wafts in humidity, but its waters are crystalline and black under the moonlight. In darkness, no one can tell.

Imagine tying down your foot with an anchor and jumping in.",14Jul2017,3
9,"I'm 17, and I work at my local Little Caesars. I'm really only trained on cash, and it gets so busy that they only need me on cash. But unfortunately that leaves me as the target to everyone's wrath when they don't get their pizzas exactly when they want them. 

So, as always I deal with the regular hustle of people, and anger from middle aged women when, during one of the stores quiet moments a lady and her (4-6 year old) son walk in. I take her order, and the little boy behind her asks what my name is. So, I tell him my name, and I ask for his In return. He tells me his name, and then asks me if he can give me a hug. I of course say yes, and he scurries over to behind the counter and gives me a big hug... it literally made my night. And helped me smile through the rest of the night  

His mom and I talked for a bit, and I complimented that her son was raised well. When I handed them their pizza, I gave him two bags of cookies just as my way of saying Thankyou. Then, as they were leaving I said bye to him, saying his name. Then to me he says, ""Bye Person."" (Which I thought was adorable). 

So, Drew. I would like to thank you for bringing a smile to my face. ",14Jul2017,3
10,"A year ago, (we will call her Jamie). Jamie showed up at my dad's business and started hanging out there. She became friends with my coworker (we will call him Stan.) She invades his privacy and will not leave him alone when he is working. When he bought his first phone, he made the mistake by giving her his number. She texted him every five minutes and when he didn't answer, she would show up and start yelling at him. That is when Stan took his phone back. When she started talking to my sister the same thing started happening but she is being sweet about it. A year ago my sister loved everyone for the way they are. Now she is a crazy double standard bi##h just like Jamie. Jamie is a vegan and now my sister is a vegetarian. My mom doesn't cook for the family anymore because of her change of diet. She is racist, homophobic, sexist against men, and she claims to be a feminist yet she called my friend's girlfriend ugly and destroyed the only true friendship she ever had and left me to clean up the mess. Jamie is repeating the same behavior to my sister. She may not be as bad as my sister but, her encouragement of self expression turned my sister into a monster. She likes everything my mom says on Facebook, she invites us to special events, came to her graduation, and shows up to work during business caterings and doesn't bother to help. She organized a vegan meal party at work and didn't even pay my boss. One day she confessed her feelings to Stan and he made the mistake to go out with her. Stan is her boyfriend and my sister is her best friend or should I say her property. My sister had surgery to remove a cyst and she has been at home for a month now. Jamie posted a status saying how much she misses her which caused a family argument. Without my sister to feed on now she is turning to me. She says ""I feel like we don't connect that often."" I try to kindly push her away from me and my family but that just makes her eager to see my sister. One day she asked to come to my house to bring my sister pop tarts. Seeing this as a red flag plus knowing what my mom thinks of her, I kindly declined. My dad stuffed a cot in the supply closet and likes to take naps in between shifts. He lets his employees take naps in between shifts when we get tired. I am guilty of overusing the cot and I end up over sleeping halfway through my shift. One day I was half asleep, she peaked in the closet, asked if I was ok, and told me she loved me. I mumbled I love you too so she can get away faster. I am tired of Jamie. I don't like the things she says to others on social media and the controversy she causes in our town, our business, and my family. She nose is always in everyone's business and she loves to pick fights with anyone who doesn't agree with her. She patronizes people to get them to do what she wants and she turns the best people into whining bi###s. Stan and I want nothing to do with it but we don't know what to do. The situation is so bad, my sister who lives all the way in Oregon, wants my sister to stay with her for two weeks because she fears for her safety. If this continues everyone will be hurt and my dad and I will be left to clean up the mess. ",14Jul2017,0

13,"I'm 27 right now and I would say I'm relatively content with life, but in all honesty I really have no desire to live past 60. Everything about getting old sounds absolutely awful. Your looks disappear, your health and body degrade, your friends and parents die and you are increasingly ignored and made irrelevant. 

I just don't think I have the strength and energy to deal with getting old. People say getting old is better than the alternative, but I'm not so sure. Once my parents die I think I'd be totally okay with just killing myself. I just look at my grandparents who are now alone because all of their friends are dying and it's just so sad. Nothing about your senior years sounds fun or exciting in the slightest.

I have a deep fear of getting old, to the point where it is almost debilitating. It definitely eclipses my fear of death. I'll enjoy my life and adult years, but I'd rather just die than have to deal with the heartbreak and pain of losing everyone I love and losing my health as well.

16,"My girlfriend of three years and I both got really drunk tonight and she passed out early. Out of paranoia (that I regret very much), I snooped through her phone to see if there was anything she was hiding from me.

Turns out my girlfriend is an even better person than I thought. Tiny  gifts I had completely forgotten about by now have their own photo albums in her phone. She'd even been looking at them lately since once was the first thing that showed up when I opened her photo gallery. Random outings I didn't remember had their own albums  with pictures of screenshots from the Notes app showing what we had being doing/talking about when the picture was taken. Random screenshots of Snapchats I'd sent her had additional hearts drawn on them.

I feel incredibly bad for looking through her phone and I plan on apologizing to her tomorrow when she's sober, even though she'd never know otherwise. I'm incredibly lucky to be dating a girl as great as she is. I don't deserve her.",14Jul2017,64

25,"I don't really have anyone I can talk with this about at the moment, and I'd really like to just unload somewhere so here I am. I'm a teen, still in school, just became 18 a bit ago. But I guess this ""story"" starts last year.

Early last year, I made a good friend, closest friend I'd had in years. It was completely unexpected to be honest, it wasn't the most likely of friendships. They were in the year above, completely different friendship groups, that sorta thing. 

And then just a few months later, they cut me off. I still don't exactly know what happened, but if it was something I'd done and I had to bet, I'd say I was too clingy. Oh well. 

Naturally, I was a bit fucking pained by the whole thing. I'd thought if there were any problems, there would be enough trust and care to talk it out. But anyways, to deal with it, I started writing lyrics and tunes about it (I'm not gonna lie, they were garbage, whiny and all that). Regardless, it was a good release. 

I'd been musical for a while, drumming in a band made up of my friends which performed at school, playing for the school musical, and I'd written a little bit of stuff for previous music assessments. But I started really slipping into music as my medicine, listening way more, playing way more, and doing that music composition stuff. For a few years, I'd been floating around, just going through the motions, not knowing what I wanted to do in life. But getting even more heavily immersed in music made me realise, hey, this is what I want to do. 

I had problems. This might sound like stupid logic, but at that point in time, I saw death as an exit from the problems I had at that time. And so even though I'm so scared about not existing, and I wouldn't do anything to cause my own death, I saw it as the only time I was gonna be free from suffering, and thus saw it as my end goal. 

So I thought, ""Once I'm dead, I won't need to worry about shit. But till then, what would make me happy?"" And then I knew. 

I want to perform, I want to make my own shit. I want to put my stuff on the internet on the off chance someone finds it and is inspired to do their own thing. There's so many small tiny decisions that led people to create the music they have, so many inspirations, and I could be a part of that. Cause music is fucking amazing. 

So I started making music around December last year. And I haven't put out anything yet, but I know I will. I'm still working on it, I have so much to do before I'm finished with what I want to do, but it's given me a purpose. And living with a purpose is so damn satisfying. 

Interestingly enough, it saved more than just me. I'd told someone who I was slowly becoming friends with about it early this year. We've become really close, and a few weeks ago they revealed to me that my passion for music made them think they could make a difference and stopped them from killing themselves. Unfortunately, it feels like they're drifting away, but if I can help it, it'll be a long, successful friendship, and I have music to thank for that. 

On top of everything, exams have become real important. I've been breaking down from the stress and from the fact that soon my life will probably change a heap. And it's taken me away from my music project, but it's also made me remember just how important my music project is. And I'll keep using it to deal with life. 

So how's music affected your life?

26,"I have just gotten out of a depressive pit. Since three days ago, when I cleaned up my room and started exercising, I feel great. But I'm also horrified.

I spent the previous two months eating, smoking, and fapping myself stupid. It's a shitty, hedonistic existence, every thought I had was miserable and many were suicidal. All it took for me to get out of it -- seemingly -- was cleaning up my room.

The problem is, I know it's not that simple. Why did I start cleaning up my room? Not because of an exertion of will. It just sort of happened. I was sick of living in filth, so I made myself clean it up. That made me want to exercise, since now there was room to do so. And now I feel great and so afraid that one simple slip of fate, just like cleaning up my room, will send me careening back into the darkness.

I don't want to go there. I look back and thank myself for suffering through it and I hope I never have to go through it again. But if I do, how long until my body again decides not to live in misery anymore? This is terrible. I am going to try really hard to keep depression away.

27,"It began as a purely physical relationship for about a month, but we ended up really liking each other. Since it was only a month and she's leaving for college in late August, we agreed to not really label it, but we would be exclusive. We had been hanging out every day since we stared our physical relationship; we  connect very well and I enjoy being around her.

I have mixed feelings about the whole relationship though. We both knew from the start that she's leaving, yet we both agreed to it anyway despite the fact that it will hurt. I'm really trying to stay in the moment so as to not ruin things by thinking about it ending all the time. We like each other, but I can feel that we are both holding back a bit. I don't want to get too invested in someone who's leaving so soon and I'm sure she feels the same or similarly.

I have a bit of anger at the situation, too, but I think it's mainly for selfish reasons. I've gone on a lot of dates and I've always had a lot of issues finding someone I can connect with. I just haven't felt anything at all with the women I've taken out in the past, but for the first time I finally have it-- but only for two months! I'm only 19 and I know there will be more in the future, but it's just so frustrating when you finally get the thing you've been working for, but only for such a short period of time after years of effort. I tried as hard as I could in high school, but it never went well. I was just weird and had no confidence. I spent a lot of time trying to to build myself up and find someone, I almost feel as if fate is laughing at me since it took so long to just be able to talk to a woman without having a panic attack (I had social anxiety issues for a long time) and now I'm getting cut off when I'm barely out the gate. I wonder how long it will take for me to find someone I can connect with again. I live in a really small town and only met her through mutual friends, so I'm not sure how things will go.

On the bright side, when I'm around her, I don't really think about those things. It's easy to get lost in the moment with her. So for now, I'm happy.",14Jul2017,1

46,"I've been really good for a year now, fair to say that I've actually had fun and enjoyed life however in the back of my head there's always that little niggle - something I've managed to keep contained and away from my life. I still get the odd bout of anxiety and 'oh crap I need to leave this place now and go back to my safe place (my bedroom) however I've been able to ride the storm and stop it from becoming reality. I'm proud of what I've achieved, it wasn't that long ago that I had laid on my bathroom floor ready to take my life and came pretty close to it.

The problem is even through all the positives there's still that negative urge - no matter what I do I'll always be able to put myself down and find a negative or believe my friends around me don't actually care / I'm not good enough etc.

Over the past year I've gone on multiple holidays - all of which have brought smiles to my face and found a job where I'm truly happy. Something that wouldn't have happened if I had gone ahead and taken my life.

The problem is though I still don't feel life I've achieved enough to warrant my existence and that boxed up part of my brain is really pushing to come back out again making each day harder. I'm trying everything possible not to relapse into my old state. I don't want panic attacks, anxiety or depression. I just want a life where I'm happy and at 31 when I look around my peers it's starting to look like I'll never reach what they have. I want that family, someone to come home to on an evening and I'd love to be a father. I may have achieved things that I never thought I could however trying to fight your issues when you're lonely and have no self worth is fucking hard.

I won't ever take my life, my last attempt showed me how bad of an idea that is. I was lucky in that sense that I had a second chance to do something, that second chance still feels a little wasted though. Having a career and a few nice things in your life doesn't remove the underlying issues.

The worst part is I thought this was behind me, I was one of the ones who had come out of the other side in a pretty good place without actually finishing the job. I thought I had boxed that little bastard up deep inside my head, far enough away from me that it couldn't come back and hit me. I'm wrong though, he's still there and it wants to come back. I could so easily just let me guard down and become the person I was again.

Honestly it's tiring and I'm stuck. I have nobody in a time where I really need someone. Sorry for venting, I just needed to write something, somewhere.
