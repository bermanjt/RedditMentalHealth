0,"I'm 2.5 hours away, on my way there now (not driving myself, I'm in the passenger seat). Having trouble processing this information.  She tried to overdose. Just got her meds filled. Four different kinds, I don't know exactly what all of them are, but I know one of them is xanax, one's a sleeping pill, and one is an antidepressant. She took all of them and then called her best friend, then hung up on her, then talked to my brother after her best friend alerted him. He talked her into pulling over and giving him the nearest mile marker. His wife called the police. Now he and I are both on our way to the hospital, separately. 

She was seriously abusive to us as kids. Got diagnosed with a rare, heavy mental disorder once we were all adults and had moved out. In recent years has tried with some success to patch up with us. She's still the same messed up person but at least now she knows. She doesn't make excuses for herself. She goes to therapy. Takes her meds. 

At this very moment I feel absolutely nothing. Not even a hint of anger, which is what I was expecting since anger is the easiest emotion to comprehend and usually how other, more complex emotions express at the outset. But no, not even that. And I can't tell if that's because this is complicated enough that I haven't started to process my emotions, or if I'm a fucking monster who has literally zero emotional attachment to the idea of its mother killing herself. 

Part of me thinks it's a cry for help thing. Another part of me thinks that first part is an asshole, because even if it is a cry for help thing, that's a pretty serious indication she *desperately actually needs help*. I feel bad for my brother, who burdens himself with everyone else's problems. She told him on the phone she thought he'd been mad at her for years. He is the gentlest person I've ever known. He wept when recounting this to me. Now that I'm typing it out, that *does* make me angry. 

I don't know. Word dump. I think I am also angry that she has found another way to manipulate our emotions. She's played games with our minds and feelings our entire lives -- stunting a couple of my siblings' development in some ways -- and has lost some of that power as we've grown older. I don't think that this was a direct attempt to fuck with us like many of her nonsense was as children, but the byproduct is the same regardless. ",21Jan2017,14
7,"Been many months and I finally know why I get the horrible acid reflux. I know why my esophagus is hurting so much. It should be a fairly simple surgery to fix it.

And I was hoping for something major. Let me explain. I have horrible, crippling depression. Meds don't work for it. Nothing I've tried helps at all. I feel like my brain is broken. I was hoping this health problem at least point to the cause of my depression. Or that I had some syndrome to explain it. All my life I have dealt with soul bleeding depression. As a small child I would cry and cry at night because I knew my family would eventually die. I feel like I'm completely removed from people. My 10 super awesome excited would be a 1 on most people's scales. 

By that I mean their crappy 1 is my highest of highs. When they are at 0 then I'm at -9. I don't enjoy anything I do. I always feel like I'm doing something wrong. I never am excited to do anything. I don't feel joy. I feel overwhelming sadness.

10,"Or just new. Either way I'm scratching my head. 

My wife and I pulled up to a restaurant and see a line out the door. Instead of working my way through the mass of people, I decided ""let me just call really quick and see the wait time so we can bail if it's long.""  So I call, get transferred twice to the hostess. Ask for the wait for two. She says, literally, ""Uhhh, I don't know."" Okay, maybe she's new or the place is slammed and she can't figure it out. I hear someone whisper to her to tell me to download an app that tells me the wait time. ""Oh yeah, download blah blah app and it'll tell you"". Fine, no problem, I like technology, I'll give it a shot. Not sure why you can't tell me but I've been there before, weird corporate policies make things hard. I'll play the game. Download the app, do all the necessary registering and selecting my location, etc. and it tells me 5-15 minutes for two people. Ok cool! But I can't put my name on the list, you have to go in and be put on the list first and then it shows your place in line. 

Ok, here we go, into the restaurant to get put on the list. Excuse myself through the wall of people, wait in line. Make it up to the hostess stand and it's the girl from the phone (saw her name tag, she had told me her name). Only a few minutes have passed since I talked to her. 

""Hi! Can you put me down for a table for two?""

And the split second I finish my sentence, she says ""It's a 45 minute wait""

16,"I am almost 30, am incredibly sex-positive, have taken mutiple university courses on human sexuality (one of which actually included watching porn in class), and I love my body. However, ever since I was young I have hated my labia. 

I remember wanting to cut them off with scissors when I was only around 14. 

I have always had a larger clit and labia. Nothing too extraordinary (though it took me years to really realize I'm only a little over average).  It's weird because I actually think it looks nice sometimes, but I have sat and cried and cried over it other times. My labia remind me of trying to take a selfie... beautiful some angles, a fuckin mess at others. 

When I was younger (and even now depending on my mood) I was never ashamed of my body. I was bangin hot, Britney Spears had nothing on me. I have always loved sex, anal was something I was asking for not the other way around. Bondage, yep. Whatever was good for me. Except for oral sex on me. 

I remember with my first few boyfriends I wasn't too concerned. Usually just a warning while holding my hands over my pussy ""just so you know, I have big pussy lips"". Then as I got older and suddenly no porn stars had anything except perfect lips (unless you specifically searched for large labia), and I started spending more time on the internet and got to read all about ""loose roast beef flaps"" and see all the nice pictures comparing bigger labia to gross looking images of meat... then I started to really dislike being eaten out or fucking with the lights on. 

Sometimes I think my labia were a good thing. I've always dabbled with the idea of exotic dancing or escorting. But then I would always imagine how disgusted men would be to have my petite, blonde self come up and lay down and spread my legs and they'd see ""beef flaps"". Or drunk guys at the strip club making fun of my pussy after they left. I honestly always thought I'd have a bit of fun doing some sex work here and there, but probably better for my professional career I never did. 

Anyway, the point is that after looking up the porn stars on this documentary literally none of them have labia or clits much smaller than mine or had some that were near identical. I think there is waaayyy more labiaplasty and weeding out larger labia than we realize. 

It's not like I care if people have preferences. I mean, I'm against circumscision 100% but don't see male pornstars with longer than average foreskins (or any at all). I just really wish people would think a little bit before they go around saying long labia are because someone is used up or they look disgusting and make stupid memes and shit making fun of them. I hate worrying when a guy is feelinf my pussy for the first time he is thinking ""wtf is wrong with her pussy"" or if he goes down on me he'll be doing it just because and will be secretly disgusted.

Just be careful with your words because the next girl you have sex with might be a sexy, kinky, fun girl who happens to have big labia. 

Also, I can't believe this name wasn't taken.

19,"I had a 'birthday' (an excuse to get together that my birthday happened to be the occasion for) party (gathering) for me, and a really overzealous friend of mine quieted down the room to acknowledge my birthday. We were really high. I never would have called the attention to myself. At the end of their rendition of 'Happy Birthday', I asked if I should make a speech. They said I should, so I made a speech with a few jokes and a sentimental point. President Trump have his inauguration speech today, and was pretty dry and soulless. 

I honestly believe that mine was a good speech.

23,"Typing on a keyboard and seeing words on a, non-spatial, screen does not connect with a physical reaction of recording my thoughts so I can see them in front of me and work with them. It's not even hard but I don't have the tools in front of me to record what I am doing so I look can review and put together my ideas in a new combination. Also, typing words is fast, but it seems that unless I disconnect myself from thping with my fingers and instead use my headspace as a way of ""speaking"" to the keyboard, I cannot fluidly record my thoughts, but then I end up feelihg connected to the keyboard, instead of processing additional thoughts that come along. Plus, having additional interfaces like switching apps, using eyeglasses, using a touchscreen, finding a subreddit all make relying on one set of focused thoughts, much more difficult. The more I move around in a vague space of whatever is on my two-dimensional screen, the less I can keep track of what I am doing. Yet, at the same time it provides so much more efficiency to use this technology, and it is sometimes the only way I am able to do anything. This could be because of limited training with my mental imagery while accumulating thoughts, and lack of functionality in technology to easily and physically act on issues when you see them.  
You can't modulate yourself when everything is so close. I figured that I can't do anything further with this typing, so it makes sense to not sit around doing nothing, and to spend time gaining energy from food. ---- So, I opened my living room door, and there is sound from my parents' computer with some video. There's no modulation because I walked a short distance, and all of sudden, I no longer had the sounds from outside my window and from my speakers playing a soft forest ambiance. Approaching a different group of sounds interrupts the way you were thinking, very easily, and now I feel it is difficult to keep my mind on top of things, while doing what made sense to me, which was to eat instead of sitting around, unable to continue working, using my internet device. :: it would be neat if I could slowly increase the volume of what is happening to the room next to me. Through walking long distances to more empty areas in my town, I've noticed that it helps to take time to let your body figure out the space of which it is approaching a new location or activity. The more you make sense of your environment, the less jarring and distracting it becomes. ; Not having a lot of input, ( or have conflicting input, in your near environment, can make it difficult to lose distraction. Right now, I feel so enclosed in the space of my tablet, in its screen and all the items I can choose to visualize in it. ) The only way I'm easily typing this all out is because the sounds around me feel like the environment that I am looking into, which is the ten inch tablet screen. In regards, to what i mentioned about thingssdgjl, its easier to stay not distracted by using what i can, so that is why you see some odd placement of symbols. The more I stay within the flow of this tablet environment, the easier I can think. However, unless I allow myself to think in a greater environment, I am limited by the tools available, to me. For example, I missed a word: ""thingssdgjl"" because I don't have a good way of looking back at my text and identifying exactly what I meant. It's in my head, but maybe I don't have good enough organization or identification of all the parts. Still, that is why I have started typing this out, to circumvent the issue about not being able to look at my thoughts. Plus, for some reason, I know that I could conclude this whole typing session, plus the several thoughts I had, into only several ideas, but when it comes to explaining them through words, it seems so much more complicated than what is in my head. I know there are ways to practice or do things better or have less distractions, but it just seems like too much preparation just to do something that I can easily think of. I'd rather get into it, without leaving my room and becoming distracted. By leaving my room, I am somehow leaving my rational thoughts without a purpose. A purpose that I will simply have to wait to figure out later, whenever my mind feels like it. But the problem with that is it can be more interesting to figure out things right now, with the tools you have, and the descriptive thoughts at hand.",21Jan2017,1

38,"Confidence is a really weird thing. It can’t be measured or quantified in any way, that I know of. The only way that we perceive confidence is from the signals that other people give off and based off of the things that we tell ourselves.

Just yesterday afternoon I was the most confident person in the world. I carried my head up high. My eyes focused on what was ahead and I felt extroverted, I wanted to meet and talk to everyone. I perceived every glance from oncoming strangers as one of admiration, not of judgement. I enjoyed that feeling of social security and happiness. Every conversation that I had went well, and if they didn’t, fuck the other party, because I know that everything was fine on my end.

 It only took a couple hours of uncertainty to make me realize how much my mood is dependent on the appreciation of other people. How little that my confidence was rooted in my own self-esteem, and how much value I placed on the perception of my peers. 

I went from nurturing a friendship that could have served as a potential “back-up” to my current romantic situation, to walking to class and running in to three people who asked if I wanted to hang out on the way there, to trying out for a local soccer team and making it, to texting the girl that I actually do like and getting one word or non-interested responses. 

Logically, I know that she’s really busy. She is taking Architecture at one of the most involved and intensive programs in the country. She just didn’t really have time to talk. I know that she likes me because she has outright told me, “I really like you.” But for some reason, her mundane responses to my texts triggered this odd downward spiral of low self-worth.

Now this next day I feel all the typical symptoms of my depression. I feel unmotivated, tired and drained. I struggled to go to class and I feel like a burden to everyone around me. If a conversation or an interaction doesn’t go well, its my fault. I somehow fucked up and annoyed or weirded out the other party.  

I have all this evidence, not just from the day before, but from the past few years, that I have the approval and the admiration of my peers. I know that I am a social equal and that I stand on the same footing as everyone around me. But it takes just one little event to bring my mood down so significantly.

Am I just being clingy? Am I a narcissist? I am so dependent on other people to demonstrate my own worth to me, because internally I feel like I have none. 

Whenever I start to feel this way the world around me, my memories, start to seem foggy. I feel like everyone can see me but I can see no one. Everyone is looking at me in judgement and disgust, and whenever I catch someone glancing at me I see my own insecurities and low self-esteem reflected back at me. I feel my posture droop, my eyes focus on my own feet and my thoughts all revolve around giving myself the smallest social profile that I can possibly maneuver.  

Whenever my depression attacks like this I need to be really careful and I need to be very proactive when it comes to controlling it. Fortunately, today is Friday and its relatively early in the semester. I know that my friends that know about my condition will probably be going out tonight. The social interaction can distract me from my own self-hatred and, sometimes, something good happens and I snap out of it and I return to being my normal, confident self. 

I’m not always so lucky though. Sometimes my depression hits me on, lets say, a Monday, the week before midterms. No one is doing anything social and no one has time to just hang out and distract me. In this situation I tend to turn to weed. Sometimes being high can distract me from the fact that I am profoundly unhappy. I can’t focus on my depression and I don’t think about how much everyone hates me when I’m pondering whether or not hot dogs are sandwiches or if my fish in my aquarium view me as their god. 

I was smoking almost daily for a couple months. It’s a bad habit, but It helped stave off the suicidal ideation and laziness that my depression was throwing at me. It wasn’t serving as a detriment to my life, except financially, but I still feel like it was a really bad habit. I was coughing more, I had a long bout with bronchitis that wasn’t solved entirely by anti-biotics. 
I decided that I would stop smoking during the week, and that, for the most part, I would stop smoking alone. I wanted to make it the same social activity that I enjoyed when I was a freshman. I just finished my first full school week in god knows how long without smoking. I’m kind of proud of that, but goddamn it has been hard staying away from the bowl whenever I started to feel like shit. 

I know I’ve made progress. It took a suicide attempt to get me start seeing a therapist and start understanding why I’ve always felt socially “below” everyone around me. The fact that I felt confident at all for any period of time shows huge steps forward, the fact that I can still function and go to class (no matter how depressed I am) shows massive improvement. I’m not going to fail out of school again, and I think that I’ll be reasonably successful in my life. But I still have a long way to go if someone being a shitty texter still sends me into this hole. I need to stop looking for the faults in myself when things don’t go my way and I need to start acknowledging that, most of the time, the stuff that happens in my life was not controlled by me. The world doesn’t revolve around me. I just hope that, one day, I can be good ole confident Alex without having the perpetual and nagging fear that I will eventually revert to the same insecure and depressed loser that I have been my whole life.

I always hear parents say something like ""I love my kids and wouldn't change a thing if it meant not having them."" I get that. It's hard to imagine your life without that loveable, hairy meatball that you've worked so hard to raise into a proper little human. I'm sure they bring some kind of fulfillment to your life and on the rare occasion they're not being pieces of shits, they make you happy. But damn, that is a shit ton of work, and I don't see the happiness/fulfillment scale tipping in the parents' favor for the amount of work being put in. Kind of makes me sad. 

I do think for some people, they are genuinely happy raising children. Don't know why, but I can see that. But for most people, I'm not so sure. For myself, I very much value my free time, the ability to do anything I want, or nothing at all. But if you're a parent, you don't even have a choice any more.

46,"In my opinion Rick Moranis is the greatest male singer in a musical movie who was simply an actor.  Hes such a nerdy looking goof and yet he comes across like a real forlorn hero in this movie.

Examples:  In the number ""Skid Row"" at around 3:35 when he starts singing ""Someone show me a way to get outta here"" it is so inspiring it gives me shivers and goose bumps every time I hear it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0kSBiu1IGk

In the number ""Suddenly Seymour"" at around the 0:55 mark when he says ""I know things were bad but now they're ok"" then starts singing ""Suddely Seymour is standing beside you"" OMG what a transformation this dude is manning the heck up!  Who could see this exhilarating duet coming from Rick Moranis?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DD7VIKZnGA&amp;index=2&amp;list=RDz0kSBiu1IGk

Consider he was singing against the talents of the lead actress Ellen Greene who also played Audrey in the musical play ""Little Shop of Horrors (1982).  Her talent is profound as we can see in the song ""Somewhere That's Green"" yet somehow they fit together perfectly in this movie.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvpOIUqKKA&amp;index=3&amp;list=RDz0kSBiu1IGk

On an aside I think ""Somewhere That's Green"" is easily my favorite song in this musical and if you have not seen the Family Guy version its a must see =).  I mean Mr Herbert lol kek this perv kills me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGxiYiQCSEQ

In conclusion as a musical lover I have a lot of respect for actors who take a chance despite not being good singers (Pierce Brosnan in Mamma Mia!, Richard Gere in Chicago).  I also have some disdain for actors who let a professional dub them instead of putting their hearts out there (George Clooney in O Brother, Where Art Thou, Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady).  But my favorite of all is when I am surprised by the singing of an actor who is obviously not a professional singer yet they rise to the challenge and put on a performance to remember.
