0,"Hi, I'm a thirteen year old dude and I think I have a problem.

Let's start with my short life story. From ages 0-9, I used to be a nice kid and I was pretty happy. Age 10 is when I became addicted to the computer and would play for hours a day. In the past several months I have recovered, and now off the computer. 

Now, on to the story. I'm currently going to 9th grade. I went to this one middle school for 2 years, and in 8th grade I switched to a different one. 8th grade is where I started to completely lose my social skills (also the same year I quit gaming). I have been making an effort to find myself and live my own life, but so far I feel like something is wrong. Again, I don't know if I lost my social skills because of my lack of friends or what. 

Now, to the present. 
In the past few months I have been becoming a bit ""out of the moment."" Sometimes I zone out when I'm bored at home and start thinking about how I have no friends, how boring my family is (we dont go out often, my brother is addicted to video games the same age I was, and everyone in my family is overweight except me.) We live in a suburb, but there are absolutely NO kids in my area. I don't think I've ever been on a different street than my own in my neighborhood, which is depressing. I also get a little bit existential sometimes (what is the meaning of life). But one thought I ALWAYS get is who am I? What are my hobbies? I spend a lot of my free time on my phone, watching youtube and stuff. I never picked up any hobbies, or had any I kept up. I want to get into free running and gymnastics, and I love movies but I wouldn't count that as a hobbie. Another thought I get sometimes is what do I want to do with my life? I always say I want to become a doctor, but that's only because my parents say that you make a lot of money. I want to do something I love (like movies). 

Again, I don't get these thoughts all the time, but since I have no hobbies or friends, I get a lot of free time, hence why I think I have ADHD or Bipolar disorder. ADHD might make more sense, because I don't think about these things much when I'm busy, but in these past few months, I can't stop thinking about how everyone else on social media have such exciting lives and I'm here on my phone. The no friends thing plays a really big role. I have never made any deep relationships with friends. My family thinks these are just hormones from puberty, but I'm not so sure.

Again, I just want to find a way to live my life where I have friends, at least an idea of what I want to become, a hobby, and happiness.

I want to get evaluated for ADHD, but my family doesn't have the time because we are moving in like a week.

Thanks, and **feel free to ask questions** because this is probably the wall of text of a guy with ADHD.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that also when I get like this, I can't get out of it. I can never focus on something after I get into this mindset. It can last for like 2 hours.",26Jul2017,1
1,"So after I graduated high school I have allocated all my time to my studies in college and to working almost full time. I haven't had much of a social life. I have a few friends that I hang out with occasionally but whenever I ask other people to hang out they are usually 'busy'. I'm on vacation from work this week and my friends are either busy or working. I don't have much for hobbies and I don't really know what I am that interested in tbh. I occasionally go hiking but that's about it. I'm not depressed or anything, just bored. I'm a pretty independent and simple person. I don't need much. My days usually consist of going to school, going to work, going to bed. And over the past couple years I have saved up a pretty nice savings account and have succeeded in my workplace. 

I feel like I don't have a very balanced life but I don't really know how to change it. I used to go to the gym all the time but since college started I just haven't had the time. I used to have a great social life but that has dwindled down quite a bit. I found myself falling for this girl but that ended before it could really get started since we were both going separate ways and moving away to different colleges and she is joining the military afterward.

I haven't been stressed over anything I just feel like something is missing in my life. Any suggestions?",26Jul2017,2
2,"Hi, My name is u/goodbyelulu and here's my education story and why I'm so thankful I can still get my diploma this late. 
 When I was 10 and in the fifth grade I began homeschooling because I was bullied to the point of suicidal thoughts. I've been In my fair share of online programs and it was probably for the best because I moved so frequently until my last year of high school. That's when I started to give up. Having a single mother meant having to own my schooling and be responsible for finishing it myself. I've had to work full time since I was sixteen though and as most teens do I started partying and doing drugs. When I was seventeen and in my last year of high school it became apparent that I wasn't going to graduate. There was no way, I had slacked off way too much. As well in that year I had met the man I'm now very much in love with and Married to. This all sounds so crazy even to me. I was in high school for five years before I had no choice but to drop out with only 2 credits to graduate. I felt so hopeless. I knew I would be hard pressed to get a GED because I felt like I was way too dumb to get through the math section of testing. To be honest I had given up on myself. Working full time, paying rent and married. I'm 18 and adulting without finishing the biggest milestone of youth. That's when hope came into the picture. I learned of a way that struggling students could finish high school with any schedule they needed. McLain High School by RRCC. A ray of light to get me out of entry level employment. I can get my diploma and finish my last two credits in way less than a school year because of them. I'm so full of gratitude that this institution exists. I can very well say that the low enrollment price and willingness to help people has given thousands of struggling people hope. I was so worried that I was going to be a flunky and not have the career that I'm now extremely motivated to achieve. Thanks for reading this. I wanted to spread the word that places like this exist for people like me.",26Jul2017,3
3,"I've had my fair share of issues in my years, but I've learned to confront them and deal with them head-on in one way or another.  However, I'm currently in a situation where multiple situations are occurring at once and I seem to be mentally and physically breaking down.

I was in a somewhat toxic marriage and we mutually decided to end it last year.  There was no big event that led to it, just a huge amount of small issues.  We decided to end things when our apartment lease was up, but towards the last month or two of our lease, we started being much nicer and respectful towards each other.  We continued going on dates here and there, but we had already told all of our family/friends that we were getting a divorce and made separate living arrangements, so we went through with finalizing the divorce when we moved out.  

She moved in with her sister and I moved in with my married friend and his wife.  I had my bad habits when I was with my ex-wife, but they were kept to a minimum as I didn't want to be caught by her.  I was smoking cigarettes when I went out with friends, going to casinos when she was out of town, dabbling in drugs when she was out with her friends, etc.  I was somewhat kept in check by her, and maybe that was one of the reasons I somewhat resented her...since she kept me doing some of the things I enjoyed.  After I moved out, I didn't go all out, but I definitely did my bad habits way more often than when I was married.  

My bad habits slowly became worse and sports betting was definitely at the top of the list.  It got to a point where I literally lost all the cash I had and started using my credit cards to pay for stuff.  When my CC's were maxxed out, I looked into CC debt consolidation loans.  I paid off my CC's, got paid from work, started gambling again, and it was this vicious cycle over and over.  It got to a point where the loan places wouldn't give me another loan and I was pretty much forced to quit gambling.  With my salary from work, I was barely able to cover my minimum CC payments, monthly loan repayments, and rent/bills with just a little bit left over.   I can say that I no longer gamble anymore, but the damage to my wallet has been done, and I'm still paying for it on a monthly basis.

I started going out with my friends more too.  Binge drinking until 4-5AM, smoking 2 packs a day, and dabbling in drugs again.  I started to feel more and more unhealthy as the days go by.  I actually work out 3-4 times a week and take care of myself aesthetically/hygienically, so my friends/family can't really tell that I'm feeling like I'm falling apart inside.  I keep telling myself I'm going to detox and quit and it does work sometimes for like a week or two, but then I'm usually back to my old habits again.  This last panic attack has made me want to quit everything again, but how long will it last?  Just about an hour ago, I relapsed and went to go smoke that last cigarette I knew I had in my car.  However, I'm not sure if it was a sign, but I had no lighter in my car and nobody was smoking outside.  

About a month ago, I was drinking with an acquaintance that is also childhood friends with my ex-wife.  Everything was going well and he mentioned offhandedly that my ex-wife was dating someone.  It's been almost a 9 months since we were officially divorced, but we stayed in contact and met up for dates here and there (nothing physical, although it almost got to that point a couple times).  It was me that kept my distance from her so that we wouldn't repeat the same mistakes again.  It kind of made sense since she messaged me a couple months ago that we probably shouldn't talk anymore.  That was very odd since she was the one always asking to hang out and I was the one that kept my distance.  I guess I can't blame her, but maybe due to the jealousy factor, I can't stop thinking about her.  I went from thinking about her 2-3 times a week to about 50 times a day.  It's unhealthy and I even started to message her again.  However, there was a point where she didn't respond to one of my simple/non-relationship-related questions until a couple days later (one of her pet peeves are when people don't respond immediately), so I decided that I'm either not a priority in her life or she's busy with her new man.  Either way, I decided to gently let her know that I heard she was dating someone and I'd leave her alone.  Hey, at least one of us decides to be happy.  This was a couple days ago when I sent that text and never received a reply.  Any time anyone texts or calls, I keep hoping it's her.  I started to binge drink and do drugs again up until that day, but decided to just quit everything.  Today is the first day I decided to be clean from everything.  So far, so good.

Work:  So I've been with the same company for over 11 years now.  I've gotten quite complacent here as I know how everything works and I have a decent position.  I was actually offered my current position on the grounds that I pass my CPA exams, but I keep taking and failing them.  Can't blame anyone but myself.  I just do the bare minimum at work, go home and do drugs and play video games, or go out and drink.  However, I was told recently that our owner is shutting down our entire company soon.  I went into scramble mode looking for jobs.  I'm upper/mid-management, so it's very difficult to find something that suits me.  My current position requires a CPA that I don't have yet (which I should have had by now), so I'd basically be taking a step down.  I'm also conflicted as to whether or not just switch gears to a whole 'nother industry and start from scratch.  Accounting is not what I want to do anyway, and I'm basically only here because I got an entry level position and worked my way up.  Somewhat of good and bad news is that I was able to secure an interview for a fantastic position at a new company.  However, this is very nerve-wracking to me since I've never even been to an interview in years and the position is extremely high-level.  I feel like I'm under qualified and they won't hire me or if they do, I fear I'll be in over my head.  I don't have any other job interviews lined up at all.  

Living situation:  So, remember how I said I was living with a married couple?  They're expecting a baby soon and need to turn my room I'm renting in their house into a nursery before the end of November.  The wife also has a brother that is getting out of prison at the end of this month and will be moving in to the third bedroom (I'd have to share a bathroom with him).  The brother moving in I can deal with, but I really need to move out before November.  On top of that, I need to show proof of income to the apartment I'd be moving into and would need to move before the owner of my company decides to shut everything down which can be any day now.  Really need to find a place and haven't really been looking either.  Have some places booked to look at tomorrow before work.  Parents live in a small apartment, so moving back in with them is not an option.  Really concerned about what's going to happen if my owner shuts down the company soon and I don't find another job by then.  Can I afford to live off of unemployment?  Definitely deciding to quit gambling, cigs, alcohol, drugs will help financially, so will help to control my efforts.  

Love Life:  This is the last thing I should be thinking about in my current situation, but after hearing about my ex-wife dating again, I started turning to dating apps.  I feel like (and I'm told that) I'm a decent looking guy, but I'm very shy.  This means that I have little to no pictures of myself (too shy to take many pics) and I'm not very talkative to girls that my friends and I meet while we're out.  I'm also at the age where most of the girls that I had crushes on or had crushes on me are married and/or have kids, so those rivers are dried up.  I tried putting up dating app profiles with the pics I had available, but they don't really look good.  I feel silly filling out these ""about me"" things too, so I'm not really getting any matches (maybe 6 or 7 total in the past month).  Call me shallow, but I end up matching with women that I only find marginally attractive and decide I don't want to pursue.  I try talking to them anyway, but most convos only last about 3-4 messages each and then it goes dead.  I'm beginning to lose hope that I will find anyone.

Religion:  I consider myself a Christian, but I hardly ever go to church lately (3-4x a year) and my lifestyle definitely doesn't reflect it.  I keep feeling that I need to go back to God with my issues, but another side of me says that I'm only running to religion because I need help and I'll be back to my old ways once things are better.  I'm scared to think of it that way, so I want to get better before I go back to church.

That all being said, everything came to a head today.  I think I'm making a good choice to just quit my unhealthy bad habits (drinking/smoking/drugs) for now and see how else it goes.  Thank you for anyone that has read this, and I will hop back on later to read any responses. ",26Jul2017,6

6,"I'm a 28y/o f and I've been suffering with BDD since as far back as I can remember. I was painfully bullied from a very young age (5'5 since 4th grade) and have never been ""petite"". I always played sports and around the age of 14 got pretty overweight for my age and height. I was severely depressed , cutting, and seeing a worthless psychiatrist. I woke up one day and had had enough so I started eating an apple for breakfast, carrots for lunch, and some chicken and steamed spinach for dinner. I lost the weight I was hoping to but the problem lies with my mother. I love her dearly but she is the deep seeded root of my BDD. When I was growing up she was a size 4 in juniors and was big into dieting to the extreme. She has always ""worried"" about my weight and only praised my sisters and I when we get (what she deems) ""skinny"". She is now overweight herself but still can't stop talking about my weight and how ""worried"" she is. I workout 4-6x a week and more often than not will turn down a cookie for the sake of ""cutting sugar"". Just this weekend she compared me to someone that a doctor would consider obese. My weight and appearance preoccupies my thoughts most of my day. I've tried waist training, apple cider vinegar and garcinia cambogia, diet pills, HCG, extreme dieting, you name it... all because my mom read somewhere that it will ""help me"". I've tried talking to her but she just deflects it back to being ""worried about my health"". Ever since I had my daughter 5 years ago weight just doesn't fall off like it used to. The whole game has changed and no one gave me a rule book. It's to the point that my husband has told me that I'm not allowed to be alone with my own mom anymore because each time I do I come home depressed because she spent all of our time together ""teaching"" me how to be healthier. Do note: A) the amount that I workout. B) I will turn down a burger that I REALLY WANT and order a salad instead for the sake of ""health"". C) I have cut most sugars from my life and drink unsweetened coffee in the pursuit of being skinny. Any advice or help on what to do? I'm feeling a little lost....

11,"Probably obligatory to mention that this didn't happen today but close to the end of last year. 

Me and a couple of friends bought 10gs of shrooms and we each ate about 2.5gs. The trip was one of the most intense experiences in my life, and believe it or not, it changed my view on a lot of things in the world.

When the shrooms hit me, I didn't notice it till I was already tripping pretty hard; there were patterns in the ceiling, my eyes incredibly dilated, and my body felt like jelly. For some reason, I couldn't walk upright, and I simply couldn't stop smiling and giggling. 

Then the thoughts. The fucking thoughts are what got me. Some background of myself, I was 15 years old at the time, agnostic, and generally pretty cynical, but I am NOT depressed and never have been. Suicide never had been appealing to me. Until then

The thoughts were so intense and neverending, like there was literally no time whatsoever to stop and collect yourself. I felt like some force, some powerful being, was tormenting me and playing tricks on me, like it was always one step ahead of me. Then I thought to myself, ""Wow, humans are so puny and worthless. I am so puny and worthless. Why am I even here? Why don't I just kill myself?""

To add to it all one of my friends, was taking the experience to a whole other level of mindfuckery. I don't feel like writing about all of that mindfuckery here but I can make another post about it if you guys are interested.",26Jul2017,3
13,"Lately, I haven't been able to sleep after reading some things said about my step-mom online. I would even go as far as to say that it makes me a little bit sick even knowing that these things are said online. I just want somebody to know the actual truth.

A few years back, my step-mom brought up the fact that her daughter was kind of famous on YouTube. I thought that was pretty cool. I watched a few of her videos, thinking nothing of the whole thing. Just a few months ago, I found out the real truth. She wants my step-mom dead, for all these reasons she's stated (which are actually lies). She's claimed that she was raped by her mom's friends. That she was physically and mentally abused by her mom. None of this is true. Rather, it was her who abused her mother. Yes, there were some mistakes made. But I can assure you that my step-mom was afraid of her daughter.

She's also called my step-mom a bunch of nasty things, most notably a whore because of when she was first married. It was all out of my step-mom's control, as it was an arranged marriage.

I can tell you that my step-mom is a wonderful person. I've known her for about four years now, and my dad has known her much longer. I even know her mom, and they are both wonderful people who do NOT deserve this kind of treatment. I'd mention the name of her daughter, but I don't want to start any witch hunting.

It just frustrates me that people hate some others so much, that they'll make up all of these lies and get others to wish death upon a total stranger they don't even know.",26Jul2017,1
15,"Hi all,

I'm in my 30s, married with a couple of kids.  I have been working at a company for the past 3 years leading the web development side of things. Last year our company bought a competitor that was having financial issues, and laid off most of the developers (5) but kept 1. Unfortunately he resigned soon afterwards even though he had initially fought to keep his job. 

When we reached back to contact the other developers, they had found other jobs and were no longer interested in working at their previous company. 

For the past year, I've been working doing multiple jobs (and not just web development but replacing the devops, sysadmin and etl roles that were lost amongst others). 

The system they ran on was  on an unstable legacy framework running on dozens of specialised servers that was prone to going down at all times for different reasons. I've spent so much time in the past year learning their system and bringing it back up after it went down.  I have been working on migrating their legacy to a much newer one that was built in-house in the past few months in what time I could dedicate as it was evident that long-term, we couldn't stay on the old system. Last month alone, it went down more than 8 times for prolonged periods, including for multiple days.  Since January, I have been working 7 days week averaging about 70-80 hours / week.

I'm starting to make mistakes in my coding that just... wouldn't happen if I wasn't so tired.

I'm about 80% in, and I just can't push myself to keep going. I am so exhausted, depressed, miserable and burnt out. Last week I spent time in the hospital after waking up with chest pain. One of the doctors suggested I was suffering from [occupational burnout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout). I've heard of burn out before but didn't realize it was an actual thing. After reading that article, I was surprised at how much it applied to how I was going through. 

The mere thought of working again for this company makes me feel very anxious and stressed. Every time I receive a text or email notification I tense up and feel very miserable. I literally hate every second of everything I'm doing.

I have never gone through this before. I don't know how to get out of this rut. I took a couple of sick days this week just to relax but as each day came to an end, I felt more and more miserable thinking of going back to work. I don't know how to get out of this cycle.  My family has been very supportive and I feel so bad putting them through this. I'm no longer any fun to be around and I feel like I'm short changing them.

At this point, **you're thinking why the hell are you still working for this company**? It's because it's a small company, of good people, who would suffer greatly if I left. Financially, their hands are tied and if they could hire additional programmers to help, they would. It is very likely in a month or two we will be in a much better financial situation but I just... can't push myself to keep going.  I have very important deadlines and companies that are pushing us to fix things from their legacy system that has been broken for the past  few weeks. 

Now my dad is very sick in the hospital.  This past year and a bit, I've dealt with a few personal issues and tragedies including my grandma and sister dying, my wife being pregnant, having a miscarriage and requiring surgery, and her father died (as well as a couple of my uncles).  I feel like these issues... are also weighing in on me and have had an effect on my current state but I've kept pushing through them. We almost lost him a couple of years ago and I'm very scared that we might be seeing the last few days for him as well; I still have hope he can go through a speedy recovery.

I haven't had personal time over the past couple of years -- I have had taken sick days and grief days, etc. 

Has anyone ever been through this? I really don't want to leave as  I feel like I would be jeopardising the company and the livelihood of all the people in it. I want to be able to push through just to complete the migration at least but... I just can't. I can't explain this feeling or state I'm in. My family is very worried about my well-being and want me to leave but they also understand why I don't want to.  

Maybe a couple of weeks off will help clear my head, but I know what is left and is what required for the company and I doubt there's any way they can afford to have me not working right now. 

I go to sleep feeling miserable and I wake up feeling anxious. It's currently 4 am and I just made up an account to be able to post this to see if others have gone through this and what feedback can be available. Mostly I just wanted to vent and let it out. I really don't know what to do. 

I posted this earlier, but it got deleted. Not sure why. If i'm breaking a rule please let me know, thanks.",26Jul2017,3

27,"I don't know what happened, but three or four years ago my ankles started hurting. Sometimes the pain shoots up my leg, lately it's been spreading down into the foot. Some days I can barely walk and it hurts to even sit at my desk, some nights it hurts so badly it wakes me up. 

A year or two ago my wrists and fingers started hurting, and if I try to push through the pain then it spreads up into my shoulders and my back. I don't even want to get started on my back pain, it's been terrible for as long as I can remember. Stretching doesn't help, neither does exercise, aspirin, supplements, icey hot, heating pads, ice, etc. 

My hip hurts, like the bone is rubbing bone and there's no cartilage in there anymore. I can't lay on my left side anymore. Sometimes I move my leg certain ways and it's just excruciating. 

I can't afford to see a doctor, so I don't know what's wrong and nothing really alleviates any of the pain. I can't afford to see a dentist either, I've got at least six teeth that I need removed that hurt and give me headaches all the time.

I pulled together $90 to see a gyno and try some birth control, but I immediately had side effects to that and I might have blood clots in my legs, so that's another fucking thing I guess. I don't know what to do, I can't afford urgent care or a doctors visit or a hospital visit. 

No money, no insurance, just constant pain on top of my depression and anxiety. We can barely make rent, and we've got to scrape together every penny we can find to make my tuition payment so I can graduate at the end of the year and maybe find a job that pays more than $8 an hour. I wish I could get another job, but even this desk job has me in so much pain I can barely stand it. 

My knees and feet are throbbing, my back is killing me. I've got to shuffle back to my desk and pretend that I'm not drowning.

30,"Someone left a horrific comment on my post about a video game. He obviously created a temporary account, but he used Kill_[insert my full name here], and continued to make threats towards myself and my SO and my family in his rant.

I can only assume his sources are social media, which I have ensured are all set to private now. He sent me a private message saying he knows who I am and my address and referenced my dog's name and said he would beat it to death while I scream her name.

I reported the comment multiple times, and I think the moderators have removed it, but wow. I always hear about severe internet bullying, but never knew it got this deep and could hit so close to home. Does this happen often and I'm just a naive 1-year member? Is there any further course of action I should take?",26Jul2017,9
31,"I love my girlfriend, my friends and family. University was my first experience of being truly alone. I would spend days confined to my uni flat, not talking to anyone or seeing anyone. That was 6 years ago. Now, I'm in ""the real world"". Living in a flat with my girlfriend, I go to work, I see friends and family every so often. But I can't help but sometimes miss my uni flat. My little box of a room where I would spend 48hrs+ in complete isolation. I've begun to crave the isolation. I need to go hide in a hole somewhere and be totally alone. I'd love to find a room or a cupboard I could lock myself in solitary confinement for a day or so. ",26Jul2017,3
34,Tha college life ain't that much to brag about. I mean I'm just a regular dude. I've actually got adopted by Mexicans so I guess I'm afro-latino... Or blackcican if you will ,26Jul2017,2
38,"i am a kinky individual. so when a girl is looking for ""slaves"" on kik to do what she wants for them, i naturally obliged. after sending some lewd photos of myself, i received a nude of her. upon reverse searching it (as i usually do) i found that it was from a porn site, and feeling like a detective of sorts for whatever reason, i called ""her"" out on it. she then said ""okay :) for wasting my time i'll just post you all over the internet."" my kik had my real name set as the username because i'm stupid as fuck. i immediately blocked her and blocked her on the site we met on, but now i'm scared as fuck. any advice or anything? please",26Jul2017,1
40,"My grandmother does it and I tell her not to, I say if you touch it lightly instead it's more likely to respond. But she doesn't listen. She just goes ""yes"" and she keeps doing it. And I see a lot of other old people do the same. WTF old people, why do you do this?? Is it because you get less control over your wrists when you are old or do you simply not give a fuck?! 😤😤😤",26Jul2017,3
41,"So along with me gaining weight, my dysmorphia is getting worse. I don't know how I should handle this, and I am getting a little stressed out here. Stupid me just keeps snacking whenever. Right now I am hungry, but I think it is better to just sit and don't think about that too much instead of eating. Coffee would be nice, but that also contains calories. 

Also, I just started feeling down earlier this afternoon. Now I just sit here in the middle of the night, wondering what I should do with life. I want to immerse myself in my sadness, but I don't know how. My old thoughts of not wanting to be me starts to creep back ever slightly. I guess I'm not in my best mental state. 

Thanks for letting me went here, it gives me something to do at least ",26Jul2017,1
43,"My mom and dad have marriage issues, which is causing my mom to keep me at home. She's only using me as an object to delay the inevitable fallout of her failing marriage. My household is very toxic, but I feel as though I have no means by which I can escape.",26Jul2017,2
