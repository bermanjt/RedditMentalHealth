1,"I've been trying to come to terms lately with my many inadequacies, some of which revolve around my general demeanor and my role in the relationships I manage.


To use metaphors, I know I am not cut out to be a main character in any regard. I lack the charisma, intelligence, or general interest factor to carry dialogue. I lack the maturity, rationality, or emotional fortitude to play a respectable role in anything or to be the self-sufficient, cool and collected character . I lack the motivation, aspiration, or creativity to do anything positive for the plot. I can't think for myself because there's not much at all going on up there. And whenever the dart of pseudo-enlightenment hits me and I think that I can think and act on my own, in some way or another, it's shallow as hell, short-lived, and I screw up both my part in the script and the entire set. I don't have enough of much of anything in me to write a positive review on and recommend to a friend my performance.


Now, bear in mind, part of my current struggle is, again, trying to be okay with just how mediocre-to-bad I am. It sounds bad, but that is how things are. Some people are born with certain admirable qualities, and others might not be born with it, but have enough raw material inside to make something admirable. I'm not either of those. I'm not much, just like millions upon millions of other folk.


So instead, whether I was made for the role or the role made me, I am a supporting character to others. I can provide muscle like an oaf when they need something installed or moved. I can listen while they talk about their problems and lives, as long as they do not ask for any thoughts from me. I can do favors for them. I can expose myself for the ass I am for some jokes. I can do things for others. And ideally, they feel better from the support, and I feel better for being useful. Everyone wins.


But even at this, I'm not a very good one. I was written one-dimensional at best, and my shtick can run thin and tiring very quickly. I know I still bring others down with my dullness and downer attitude. If I don't have anything attractive or interesting in me, then I can't imagine it is very good for them unless I am serving some function at the moment. Even though I actively put myself in this position, I still get tinges of resentment towards others and outright hatred for myself for how subordinate I am.


So I wish I was a better supporting character. I wish I was fully comfortable with who and what I am. I wish I was more competent and less bitter and petty. I wish that I could provide support for others without expecting reciprocity. I wish I didn't need support myself. I really just wish I had enough in me to start any sort of change or build towards what I would want to be. But to start an explosion of change, you need a spark. And I don't even have rocks to bang together, or any idea on where to find some.",07Aug2017,2

5,"It's not the kind of negative like ""Want to come and hang out?"" ""No I hate doing things"" It's more like a toxic glob of misery that slaps down any bit of joy that enters my life.

Imagine if a friend made you a drawing for example. They put a lot of time and effort into it and it shows, and it was very thoughtful of them to make it for you. But as soon as you lay your eyes on it that shitty voice chimes in and says ""That is fucking pathetic. This is the worst drawing ever made. To think this idiot has the audacity to draw, it's an insult to **real** artists everywhere."" And then you feel stressed out for having such a thought and you can't enjoy it. I feel like people might feel I just don't care about things they do for me, when in actuality I've had a visit from the snobby, elitist, ""infallible"" little shit in my head and now feel bad.

I don't want to think like this anymore. I want to be able to enjoy things without criticizing them and thinking they're ""pathetic"" for not achieving some unattainable level of perfection my dumb brain will never be satisfied with. Currently whenever it rears its ugly head I just say back to it ""If you're so perfect, why haven't you done anything? Fuck off""",07Aug2017,1

7,"***TL;DR:*** *Should I do this quote or not?*

So I have Etymology tomorrow and we're all supposed to have a quote to present. It's supposed to be ""powerful"". We're supposed to write it on a piece of paper, present it, then it'll be taped to a big wall. My problem is that half the class already went and they did cheesy quotes they found off of the internet. 

My quote is this: 

> The encircling flashlight beams were drooping slightly now as if they were abdicating to this strange, quiet girl who alone in this Universe of dark confusion seemed to know what she was doing.

This is my favorite quote, personally. It does a *very* good job of getting it's point across which I think is powerful. But I also understand that this isn't exactly wall decoration material...

But also mine is a lot more genuine than theirs so maybe it'll still be valuable. But it'll also probably make most of the class think I'm autistic or something...

What do I even say while presenting it? I mean all I have to do is explain it and why it's powerful but I can't really put into words why it feels powerful to me. ",07Aug2017,1

19,"To be clear, I'm a dude, but my roommate is a girl. We've lived together about a year now. Never have we even remotely had an sexual tension or attraction to each other. She's sort of cute, but I just don't think of her that way.

About 45 minutes ago, in between songs on Spotify, I heard some moaning and a soft sort of scream coming from the apartment. I was in my room, and my roommate was (presumably) in her room across the living room from my room. I wasn't sure if that was what I heard, so I stopped Spotify and put my ear to my door, and I heard it again. It wasn't the TV or something else, it was *definitely* someone masturbating and having an orgasm. After hearing her a second time, I didn't hear anything again, not another sound. I think she thought since I was listening to music that I wouldn't hear her. I also know what I heard wasn't porn, because I know for a fact that she really hates porn of all kinds. She even feels weird about seeing people naked.

I felt a cold chill in my body when I realized what had happened. It was uncomfortable, but it also turned me on a little bit. I *love* hearing people orgasm, nothing quite gets me aroused like hearing someone else have an orgasm. But it's also my roommate, and that made me feel weird about it.

I can't say anything to her about it, that's for sure. I don't want her to know that I heard her, that would probably be more upsetting to her than it would be to me.

Anyway, if you're masturbating when someone else is at home, be quiet. Make sure no one's going to hear you.",07Aug2017,4

23,"I've spent the last 7 years working towards a career I thought would make me happy and building a life I thought would bring me joy. Probably two years in I began to realize that it wasn't making me happy but made excuses that it was the company causing me to hate my work. I've jumped from company to company and job to job (always a promotion, except for this last one) thinking that a new atmosphere would mean new happiness. I'm at the point now that I don't want to get out of bed during the week and the weekend is starting to be the same. 

I have dreams of being a motivational speaker and helping others. The words of Les Brown, Tony Robbins and Zig Ziglar pushed me to better myself and become a meaningful specific. My job creates such disease within me that it zaps all energy I have to work towards that dream. I want so badly to say the hell with it, quit, and pursue what makes me happy. But I'm scared. Scared of failing and losing everything. Scared of not being good enough. 

I tell myself I'm going to work on my speaking career but when the time comes I feel the motivation is entirely gone, used up during the work day. I do work on it during the weekend but not to the extent I get anything real accomplished. 

Life just sucks right now. I think I know what I need to do but I'm scared to do it. I keep telling myself that great men all took the leap and created ideas that changed the world. I want that courage. ",07Aug2017,1
24,"I'm not gonna give too much on my personal situation right now, but where I live they require for us to work or else we can get kicked out within 2 months. So since I was tired of being stuck home all day, being level 1 so not having all that much freedom to go out, I decided to look for a job. 

I found a job at a restaurant within 2 weeks and started yesterday (bussing). I worked a 8+ hour shift on Saturday with no breaks. Doesn't seem too bad but that's not even a double shift. The other bussers were there since 10 am and didn't get off until the same time I did, 11:50 pm. 

One guy has a medical condition (long ass name I don't remember what it's called) but it includes if he doesn't eat for a certain amount of time he passes out. So he had to eat bread that some one didn't finish. Since my body is really weak, I had to eat fries that weren't finished. 

They also want me to pay $25 for the work shirt, like the fuck why do you think I have this job? I HAVE NO DAMN MONEY FOR THAT. NONE. I already have to spend $15 on an uber everyday just to get there in time because surprise! No flexibility, get here by 4! And you might say ""why not get your license?"" WHEN. WHEN. I have a FULL TIME job AND school FULL TIME (leave at 6 dismissed at 3 Monday-Friday) I'm hoping there's 5 hour courses on weekends, and that I can get a day off, or I'm fucked. 

I just feel like people expect me to just pull money out of my damn ass to get a house and car but I gotta work for it, even though my body probably won't be able to take it and I'll collapse but that's how you gotta get somewhere in life, work hard. It's just so physically demanding I don't know but I gotta do it. ",07Aug2017,8

27,"Hi all, I've never posted here before but I figured if anyone might have an idea of what to do and offer constructive support and not just tear me down, it's you guys. 

So, here's my story. I'm 34 and disabled due to a back injury, frequently occurring severe migraines, chronic fatigue syndrome, and bi-polar disorder. I live with my parents and dog. I can't stand long enough to do dishes, bend or crouch to do most cleaning, nor can I carry more than around 8 pounds, all due to my back injury. I'm also frequently in so much pain that I'm either trying to sleep it off or simply resting quietly. My dad does the bulk of the housework with my mom doing whatever dishes might be left. 

The little problem is that due to my inability to lift and do cleaning tasks, my own room has gotten rather messy and cluttered. It is used partially for storage (as we have literally three small closets in  a this house) and thus has stuff in the way that I don't know what to do with so it's just shoved wherever.

The big problem is that my entire house needs a deep clean - dusting, mopping, and wall scrubbing - but nobody will do it. There is also a lot of random clutter, things my mom won't throw away.... I'm embarrassed to bring anyone into my home because of the state it's in. I don't know what to do because my mom is absolutely adamant that nobody is coming in the house to clean it. At the same time, however, she refuses to do it herself or let me try to reorganize and throw some unnecessary things away. 

If I could take this on myself it'd be done. I'm at the end of my rope. Even if I do clean my room, there's still the rest of the house that I simply can't take on. :(",07Aug2017,1

32,"I know a lot of people have bigger problems than mine but I could really use some outside perspective here.(this is gonna be a long one)
I am a 22M in my last year of college and about a year ago I got a new roommate. He was really outgoing and liked to have his friends over our apartment a lot which I didn't mind because I got along with them almost instantly. One of them was a girl, (we're all 22) and I didn't really pay her much mind at first. She seemed pretty quiet but enjoys her alcohol maybe a bit too much. But as one of my good friends always says, you're not an alcoholic until you graduate. Anyway, she seemed pretty friendly, laughed at my jokes etc. once she realized I was funny she started asking me to come out to bars with their group, which I did a few times. She asked me in front of the whole group and they agreed it would be fun if I was there. At the time she was dating one of the other friends in that circle and they broke up a few months after I met them. I would see her anywhere from a few times a week to a few times every other week, whenever we had a group event planned like board game night, watching a weekly show etc. Nothing too exciting. Then my new roommate told me he has been friends with her for years and considers her his best friend/confidant. He suddenly decided he was tired of being alone and after a few online dates with random women didn't pan out, he decided to pursue this long time female friend. She pushed him away from that pretty quickly, but they ended up sleeping together a few times when they were drunk. The last time it happened, however, there was some debate as to if she was fully aware of what was happening. Now she basically blocked him from her life, which could get difficult since they share a lot of good mutual friends. He told me all this after knowing me for less than 6 months. Fast forward to the beginning of this summer, I started texting this girl because we all went on a day long hike and I picked her up on the way and was planning to drive her back home, just to be nice I guess. Looking back maybe this is when it started.(if you made it this far I applaud you and it will get slightly more interesting from here, if not a little sad).
The hike ended up not going so well, I got separated from the group, ran out of water, got turned around and became dehydrated and none of us could finish the hike so we decided to try and get out of these mountains before it got dark. I managed to get in contact with my friends and this girl and one of my other friends decided they would come back to me to bring me water and walk out with me while the others got in touch with one of their parents to give us all a ride back to our cars. We managed to get out of these woods and I wasn't feeling good at all, probably from dehydration. This girl offered to drive us back to our apartment in my car and then she would take a cab back home. I agreed because there was no way I could drive in this condition. We had talked a bit on the drive to the hike, and we talked more now, since it was about an hour drive. As I started to get to know her I realized she was really cool, smart and funny, and we were both obsessed with ""The Office"". A couple of weeks went by and we hung out as a group again, I offered to drive her home because otherwise she had a 2 hour train ride back vs 45 min round trip if I drove her. She texted me to make sure I got back okay(it was around midnight), which I thought was really nice. We started meeting up with our mutual friends 1-2 times a week for dinner after summer night classes. She texted me after one of these meetings, relating to a joke I had made earlier. There was a running joke that happened by sheer coincidence where I said I bought her the boxed set of a show she like and that it was in the mail. This joke continued for a few weeks until I thought it would be funny if I actually did it. So I did. She flipped out and texted me 6 times in a row, all caps about how she couldn't sleep she was so excited etc. Then we started texting everyday, talking about school, favorite tv shows, music, family, pets, etc. A few days after she had received the boxed set I bought her, she says she has something to drop off to me. She came over to my apartment and gave me a boxed set of ""The Office"" and included an inside joke present from a few weeks before. At this point I definitely started to feel something for this girl. I feel connected to her in a way that honestly up until this point I haven't felt with anyone before. Now, almost overwhelmed with these feelings all at once I texted her after she left,(she didn't stay long, she had a final to study for) that I missed her already. I don't know what came over me and compelled me to send this but it happened. I told her she brightens everything around her up and she said I was really funny and easy to talk to. Since then we have texted almost every single day(about a month), sometimes just sharing something we found funny/ interesting, sometimes having deeper conversations. I started reading her favorite books and watching some shows she recommended and we talk about them a lot as well. Then, I noticed it was the last day of a fair she had previously asked the group chat we have if they wanted to go, with no response. I asked her if she still wanted to go, followed by the statement that I meant I wanted it to just be us. She seemed hesitant, I asked her how she felt about me asking that and she said he wasn't sure,  but agreed to go anyway. It was a little awkward at first but we ended up having a fun time for about 4 hours after which she told me she had a good time. I don't think I would consider this a date but I was hoping it would be one. Afterwards, we continued to text and, seemingly out of nowhere, she asked if I wanted to go food shopping with her. I agreed and we spent 2 hours together, laughing and joking all the while. Every now and then I'll send her a sentiment to let her know I care about her, and she seems to respond positively. I can't stop thinking about her while I'm at my summer internship and my heart races whenever I do. She will initiate a text conversation after a day of not texting if I don't. I also am going a a trip to another country over spring break with her, one of our mutual friends and a bunch of his friends. 
Recently I've been trying to hint to her more directly that I have feelings for her through light touching, meaningful comments etc.

Here's my question.
When should I, if at all, tell her I have these feelings for her? We both only have a year of college left and if I don't I feel like I will regret it. On the other hand, I know that she has been romantically involved with two of her friends before and one of them didn't end well(my roommate who has since moved out), so she might be reluctant to do that again. I also don't want to lose her as a friend. I could really use some outside perspective here and maybe just an opinion on if there's even a chance she likes me. If you read this whole thing, you're a saint, and i look forward to your comments.

So I've started having really strong flash backs to my first proper relationship recently, and it keeps making me anxious or panick. We broke up over three years ago, and it was pretty messy (I broke up with her over the phone when I just couldn't take it any more. The relationship had been great until we moved to uni, but we just couldn't hack it) and we recently met up for a coffee and a catch up. I was nervous before hand, and whilst the meeting was pleasant, I just keep having flash backs to the times, both good and bad, and it just makes me even more anxious. She's doing great - the job she always wanted and getting to go travelling - she's as happy as I always remember her being. But I just feel in a pit and I don't know whether or not its jealousy, or just seeing her again or something else.
What unsettled me is that I've been in a relationship for a year and a half and its going incredibly well. I thought I was in a good place, but the guilt of how I ended the relationship, and handled everything is overwhelming at times. I feel like a horrible person and I just don't know how to absolve myself of this guilt, And why its popped into my head when everything is going great.

MaI have recently begun a proper career in I.T. - I got in with a decent recruiting company 6 months ago, got a small assignment where I proved myself to be a good and dependable worker. I Got a second assignment where I proved I could deal with the BS and show up on time, every day, for months.

And then I spent a month doing nothing but courting more recruiting agencies, and one of them gave me a perfect job for a new I.T. Professional - not on the phones, and I consistently have work that I am doing and I am doing it well. I don't understand all of it and my peers and superiors are willing to teach me.

The only problem is that it's a job for someone new in the career. I'm 30. 

* It pays great - for someone that's been in the field for less than 1 year. 

* It's got benefits that are reasonable - for someone that isn't paying for his family, as well. 

Even with these downsides, I am still making a net positive amount of money!

But at the moment I would like to be saving for a newer car. Or a house. Or aggressively paying down my student loans. Or SOMETHING. Part of this is my recent experience with bedbugs. Those little bastards are expensive, and my wife and I are still building up our emergency fund.

45,"EDIT: Read the full thing. You won't be disappointed.

My marriage ended at the end of last year, and shortly after an on-the-job injury caused me to lose my job. Currently battling the ridiculous workers comp claim for months with no lawyer because I can't afford one.

My ex met another guy through Facebook. This guy is a piece of shit - multiple CDV's, drug charges, fraudulent checks and a couple of petty larcenies. His first CDV was so bad he was sentenced to 5 years because he made the poor girl look like she just came out of the ring with both McGregor and Mayweather simultaneously. He's threatened me a couple of times but mostly my dog (a chihuahua/terrier mix) because he knows that's the one thing I have left that I love. I've barely spoken to him and even then it was just once in person that I'll detail later. Usually it's just through FB once a week where he'll make threats and then block me so I can't respond.

My wife and I continued to share rent on our home, because I was to eventually move out (which I did recently), and she wanted to move back into it. Which honestly I didn't care. We ended, and what she does with her life from that point forward I don't really give a damn. At least I didn't until I started learning more and more about her abusive boyfriend that she was dragging her kids around.

She has two other ex husbands, one son with each. Over the 5.5 years we were together I developed an incredibly close bond with both of them. They have great fathers, so my role wasn't as much parental since I wasn't there to fill a void, but more of a friend as a step-parent. The oldest came to me frequently to discuss things that he wasn't comfortable talking with his parents about. They were happy. I was happy. It's getting close upon 1 full year now and that emptiness is still there. I miss them.

The father of the oldest did not care for her new boyfriend either. He reached out to me and asked me to sign an affidavit detailing what all I know about her and this new guy, because he didn't want his son around the guy. He decided to seek full custody. I declined originally because I didn't want it come across like I was going to try and take her son away from her as some type of revenge. She was far from a good mother, but not a shitty one either. She was mostly just distant from her kids and not very involved. To balance things out I became more involved when they were with us. I did all I could for those boys.

I took a huge paycut after losing my job. I suffered an elbow injury at work and was pulled out for 6 weeks. I had/have a small tear in the tendon that the dr they sent me to said could be caused from repetitive tasks (I installed 300+ drive trains a day for an auto manufacturer). My workers comp claim has been laughably denied. That's an entirely different drama. I left that job shortly after returning to work because my elbow wasn't much better and I felt that going back to the same exact job would just make matters worse. I chose health over money. I then took a security job for a major hotel working nights.

Because of my severe pay cut, saving to move was difficult. I couldn't afford the rent on the house and even paying half was draining me. My wife made very good money, so we relied mostly on her income. Half rent, all utlities, and a vehicle with bad brakes and tires, was draining me financially. I was getting by, but saving just wasn't easy. 

I finally made a deal with her asking her for help. She agreed to pay July's rent herself, in exchange I be out by August 1. Deal. I just needed to put a few paychecks back and I'd be good to go. On July 5 or 6 my landlord came by and told me he was evicting me for unpaid rent. I told him the situation and he claimed to have spoken with her already and she has changed her mind about moving back in. When I reached out to her via text, she said ""this was the only way I knew to force you out"". I asked her if that meant her and the LL were conspiring against me in some way, because he was close to her family, and she admitted it. I confronted the LL about this and he denied it, getting angry with me for ever doubting his integrity. I was very confused.

One day she asked me what time I go to work and I lied and told her a much later time than I really had to be there, because I knew her plan was to come take things from the house (her name was on the lease still along with mine) because she did it once before when I came home to a house full of furniture missing and my dog locked in a bathroom. 

Sure enough, they show up. Her, her boyfriend and one of her girl friends I also had known for years. I opened the door for my wife and she asked why I wasn't at work. I told her I go in later, and that I'm here to make sure the dog is ok. Told her to take whatever she wanted because I'm tires of this shit, and picked up my now barking dog. Then her boyfriend comes running in (literally) spouting off like he owns the place, sees me and gets in my face. Because we're married and her name is on the lease, I know I can't touch him. I'll go to jail and lose my job. My job requires me to be SLED certified and I won't risk losing it. We simply exchange words with mostly him fidgeting like he has fleas or something, yelling, and daring me to hit him. I decide to just grab my work uniform and leave. He keeps blocking the door and I just decide to walk out the back. My ex is constantly pleading with him to stop at this point.

I hop in the car with my uniform and my dog and begin to back up when I see movement out of the corner of my eye. I stop instantly, as I've only moved maybe 10 ft and I'm only backing up to turn around, when I hear this BAM! On my rear bumper or trunk or both. He comes running around the side of the car, phone in hand screaming, ""You tried to run over me and I got it on video!"" while laughing like a goddamn madman. He had literally ran into my car. Not the least bit concerned with this, I continue to leave and call the police. I deal with drunks and other belligerent people at work almost nightly, and I had never seen someone act like this fool. 

To shorten this incident, police came. To them first, then to me. Officer laughed about the guy's video because he also videoed himself running behind my car and didn't stop it after, so he also recorded himself laughing about it. I was to go on my way. Dropped off my dog with a friend, and went to work.

At this point I decide my home was no longer safe for my dog to be there. He had made a threat ""I'll kill that fucking rat"" referring to my dog, while there, and I didn't want him coming by while I was at work. After work, I picked up my dog and went home, piled all my clothes and necessities into my Camry, and went and turned in my key to my landlord. I was done. They can have the stuff, but I won't allow my dog to be threatened or in any kind of danger.

My mother lives in a retirement community and is my closest relative. I paid a pet deposit for my dog at her place and checked into a shitty, drug infested $150/week motel. I can't stay overnight with my mother because I'm too young (33) and it's for retirees only.

It's at this point I reach out to my wife's ex husband, the father of her oldest, and agreed to write the affidavit, including details of what happened the night before. I had seen in person what kind of psychopath she was with, and it was obvious she can't control him, so I feel like being around him puts my stepson in an unsafe environment.

One night, I'm at work, 7am rolls around and I walk to the parking garage to get in my car and leave.... Gone. I know instantly who has it. My car also had ALL of my clothes minus what I was wearing for work inside of it, because of the impromptu move. She had now literally stolen my car. I called the police, and the car is in both of our names - marital fucking property. I could legally go get it back, but it would just turn into a game of keep away with her eventually winning. She has a car, a newer one even, and I know she just had it hidden somewhere. There isn't much of a shittier feeling than being 33 and asking your mother to come give you a ride to the drug motel you're living in, that reeks of cigarettes so badly my throat burns.

How did I get here?

I'm gonna skip some, because I'm on mobile and this is hard. My wife's ex now has full custody of her oldest son (yay!). It was a small victory even for me. I know he's safe and that makes me happy. I managed to save $1000 over the last few weeks to use as down payment on a used car. I have 10 months of payments at $200 a month to pay it off. It's not the nicest but I like it, and I just hope it lasts me through this hell at 220k miles.

I have a friend in another state who has had a rough year also and moved back home temporarily. We've decided to become roommates and by the end of the year, maybe early next year, I'll have enough saved to move out  there.

In the mean time, I'm writing this in a motel so disgusting that I walk across the street to the gas station to shit when I need to. I don't even go in the bathroom here. I can upload pics if anyone wants to see.

I'm getting there. I'm trying. I'm doing my best to stay positive, but someone can only lose so much. I'm tired. Thanks For reading.

46,"I've always been an introvert and have a hard time interacting in group settings. I used to be able to put on a smile and laugh and joke and fake it, but over the years I've reverted more and more. I just wanted to be left alone. But now I'm lonely.

There are times I want to be around people and it feels great to get out and meet people. But inevitably I start wishing I hadn't. I start second guessing every interaction and conversation. I relive them over and over in my head until I'm convinced that it was such a humiliating experience that I never want to leave my home again.

I am not actually alone. I have my family around me, and that helps keep me from feeling worse. But I desperately hate feeling so lonely. ",07Aug2017,3

I bent down to unplug my laptop charger and there was a large black spider where my head was and I freaked out as one does and killed him and now all his spider buddies are going to slit my throat while I sleep.",07Aug2017,2
