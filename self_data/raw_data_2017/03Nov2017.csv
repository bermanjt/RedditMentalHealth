3,"So I work at my college as a work study and there's this guy who I find pretty cute I really want to get to know him but he works in a different department (so he spends most of his time in a different room and I hardly get a chance to try to talk to him. I only see him two times a week). I've talked to him once before when we were in an elevator where he asked me a few questions and we introduced each other(this was just last week lol). I've been trying to talk to him again (this week) but I'm alway behind the front desk and I just see him pass by or be across the room. I saw him a few times today and he'll look at me but I wuss out and look the other way (or I'll look at him but he's looking the other way). There's no way I can just ""bump"" into him and start a conversation. Either we don't talk or I just ""man up"" and walk up to him and say something.

How can I start a conversation when I don't know anything about him?! I really just want to ask him out but I'm afraid it'd be too forward since I've only really talked to him once before and I wouldn't know how to go about it. I was going to try to talk to him again today but I failed and now I just feel like giving up and accepting that I'm gonna be alone forever at no ones fault but my own because I'm too damm shy.",03Nov2017,4

6,"I’ve been feeling low (an understatement) about many things externally and internally. Now to clarify I’m not throwing myself a pity hoo-rah but I am going to explain somewhat of a background so sorry in advanced.. 
My day to days seem to vary with some great and then some (too many for my normal) very frustrating.  
For the past year I have been consistently feeling low about myself and lost the sense of motivation I used to wake up with. Yes, I can still complete my school work and wake up and head to work with a smile no problem. I’m almost starting to feel like even describing my feelings is hard to explain? Weird. 
Anyway, I have been asking my boyfriend and friends to go stargazing with me (I looove astronomy!) and also to go hiking to the mountains either in beautiful spring or tangy fall! (Cute right?) 
But to my luck everyone just keeps telling me no or giving me an excuse. And when it comes to my boyfriend well he just isn’t that into hiking I guess so he brushes me off and either gives me an excuse, tells me that we should just go to a local park instead, or says yes but in such a way that shows he really feels it’s more like a annoying chore than it is a good deed. 
My dilemma now stands with the fact that it’s fall peak (really the end of) and I haven’t gone to see the mountains yet. With school and work both taking up so much of my time I hardly ever take a moment to breathe. I considered driving 4 hours to the location, maybe hiking or going to a local cave tour system they have located there, or MAYBE BOTH! My boyfriend I think worries about me going alone and I know family would too for my small body frame and overall safety, but I feel like maybe this will be a chance to finally do something I’ve been telling myself to do and stop worrying about what everyone else’s opinions are on the matter. I just can’t seem to work up the nerve is what I’m getting at. And then part of me feels like I have no one to share the experience with or to show how happy or just fun this could be. I feel like if I can share my happiness, it makes me happy. But now I almost feel like if I go alone, maybe I won’t fulfill true joy because I’ll be saddened by the reasons I’m forcing myself to go. 
It’s a big bunch of confusion for me for such a simple, “go or don’t go.”
Any advice? I plan on leaving Saturday if I do go. And returning Saturday evening.

Facing Emotions ",03Nov2017,5
7,"I believe the book is a story about what is required to have perfect communism.

One of the primary flaws in communism is workers have a lack of motivation to work, because the government will take care of them either way. This is countered by governments trying to instill a deeeeep sense of helping the common good for the sake of the people. But we can obviously see this hasn't worked out in the past, much due to human nature.

In The Giver, many natural human emotions are removed from people, and put under the protection/control of one person in the society.

I think a removal of human emotions is the only way to make communism work, because greed, selfishness,  people's ego, and pride will prevent total communism.

The book goes on to show how one person with emotions refuses to live in the controlling society anymore, implying a communal life style if not natural to humans.

10,"Isn't it funny when you are walking through life and that song just hit the right bottoms? Like that suddenly realisation of ""23 years trying to describe this shit and here it is, disguised as a nice soft song"" 

Well, I had that realisation this week and it kinda turned my work upside down.

Just in time for the part two of Stranger Things. 

I'm trying to sleep but I can't because I have this urge in my body, in my mind. Of doing something about it. 

Sometimes it feels like my life is this series of tiny tragedies designed to make me do things. 
My parents had fights and I had to do something to repair them, and surprisingly it worked out, 
My brother had problems and I had to talk with him and make him change his ways and it miraculously make him better. 
My dad family is insane so I decided to stop talking to them and thank God I did because they are way out of my league.

The outside tragedies were ok because I always had the belief that everything can be solved if both parties want that, or if I want that. 
So I was always positive with life because, like my father always says, ""everything can be solved except for death"" and well, that's true, but even if death can't be solved it still can be understood as a part of life.. so for me, everything was fine. 

And then the internal tragedies started. 

That ones were the worst. I have never realised how hard it was to do things when your mind wasn't in your side. Anxiety, depression, panic.. even my body wasn't collaborating, illness and things attacking me constantly and without rest during certain periods of time. 

Those were the battles I wasn't prepared for, those were the battles who stopped how I worked. Who I was. 

My mother and father didn't recognise this new me.  This new person who had the body of their happy daughter, this impostor who was always feeling sad and wanted to do some sort of therapy (that was denied because If I was feeling sad it was because I wanted it, apparently) 

And I can't really blame them for not understanding  how I was feeling because I didn't understood either, it was still hard for me to process that I was the one denying happiness from myself. 

How could I be the enemy? Who was the enemy here? 

In the outside battles I could see the problem, I could analyse it and find ways to defeat it. 

But in the inner battles.. who was the one making the problems? How could I make a plan to destroy me for making me feel sad in order to feel better? 

I became a really melancholic person. 
Because I couldn't really process my own situation. My good grades didn't had any meaning, my art didn't have any feelings, my own thoughts felt forced and unnatural.. 

Until I started to slowly realise that just because all the battles were inside my head now that didn't mean they weren't real. I realised That my feelings are important and that anything i think it matters it matter. 

So I started a slowly recovery. I started to take my feelings seriously, to express them with my art, to celebrate my victories and to forgive my defeats, I learned slowly and steady how to love myself again. 

And then I heard this silly soft song, nothing special.. nothing crazy about it, just calmly perfect for what I was feeling. 

""I live permanently between hope and disappointment, spending all my life looking words that describe how I feel about you"" 

I think about it as how I feel about myself, how I feel about the world that surrounds me. I used to live like that, it was good or it was bad, it was a victory or it was a defeat, it was hope or it was disappointing. I was worth it or I wasn't.

But now, now I can see the world with beauty again, now I can feel so many things and at the same time! Now I can hug me and forgive me, love me and show others some love, because my life is no longer black and white, my life is now a lovely and chaotic universe full of colors and gradients..

Maybe your inner battles doesn't seem like much to others who doesn't have them, or to others who doesn't want to acknowledge them, but that doesn't mean that you should feel any less for having them. 

Keep fighting, but most importantly, celebrate, celebrate the big or  tiny victories and forgive yourself for losing the other ones, give yourself a hug, maybe right now you are your enemy, but you are as well your best ally. 

And I don't know if writing all this will help me sleep tonight but if you are reading this, thank you.

And if you want to share your big or tiny victories, do it, i will gladly hear you out because you hear me and even if only one person see this.. is still too much. 

So, again.. thank you , Have all the hugs of the universe.",03Nov2017,3
11,"So I took an online course - just a days worth of reading and a test. I got so much praise for it, even my boss says he's inspired by me. It just seems like it wasn't that big of a deal. 

Some background, I'm an LVN working in new drug treatment center, we are laid off or on call waiting for more clients. We had a few come and go but are at a point we dont have any right now for the inpatient area, which is where I worked. It was suggested to me to take this course and I may have more I could do at the out patient facility. 
So, I looked it up and did it. 

Further background which may be part of it, is two years ago I was in therapy myself for PTSD following an abusive marriage &amp; just over this summer started rebuilding my life and getting on track. So it felt great to have my license for Nursing back - that was not easy. But ive had it for 10 years it didnt seem like a big deal to most others. Finished a year of intensive therapy and started working again and other things falling into place

19,"I've never been one for making huge changes in my life. I've always dreaded the thought of living in my hometown forever after I moved back after college.

Tomorrow marks the day that I move away, tomorrow I move into an apartment in a big city and try desperately to make something of myself. I don't know if I should be happy or sad or scared of anxious, but a lot of change has led me to this moment.

Two days ago I gave up my dog, my best friend, to a shelter. My friend, who happens to work at the shelter and is an amazing person, sent me updates on my poor idiot of a dog moping around and missing me. It broke my heart to hear that my dumb dog who chews up anything he can get a hold of is missing his depressed owner. He apparently will lay and stare at the door waiting for me to come in, moping around until one of the workers calls for him.

I felt an amazing amount of guilt when I first dropped him off at the shelter because it was the same place I had found him; abandoned by his previous owners, just needing to be loved and let loose to chase birds (the idiot loves birds). I felt like I was abandoning him, like I was just sentencing him to a life of loneliness and sadness. I know it's for the better, that he and I would be unbelievably miserable living together in a tiny apartment where he'd be couped up all day. I'm sure I'll either come back for him or he'll find an amazing new home.

Dog troubles aside, I've never realized how much crap I actually own. Useless stuff I couldn't even donate to charity, all destined for a landfill... I threw away more stuff than I am even willing to try to imagine. Everything else is shoved into a massive amount of boxes that will need to all fit into one room. I think I will be definitely throwing away more stuff.

New city, new life, new job, new bills, new anxieties, new experiences. I hope I can enjoy it all, the good times and the bad, even if I am just sharing a place with my brother, its still some monumental moment that means I've broken the cycle. I've moved out, moved on. I'm no longer worried that I'll be stuck in my hometown waiting to die from alcohol poisoning or diabetes, I've left before I could slip into the world of heavy drug use, I've left before all of my old highschool mates could just remember me as the guy that worked at the convenience store.

I'm happy, but I'm worried. I'm sad, but prepared. I'm hopeful, but anxious.

22,"The overwhelming majority of the things in the universe have nothing to do with your identity as a woman, or a victim, or anything, really.

It's a sign of the decline of Western culture that bullshit ideologies like this get any attention whatsoever, let alone as much as they do.

Women - men and smarter women than you don't correct you on how retarded you're being when you blame the patriarchy for everything, not because you're right, but because 
1) It isn't worth it.  We don't want to get yelled at or have you think less of us for disagreeing with your stupid yet strongly held opinions, and 2) you're a fucking idiot (in that respect at least), for which there is no known cure, so there's no sense in upsetting you for no reason.

26,"I got a scholarship offer to go to Germany and do a  course there, three weeks+ stay and almost all living expenses included, because of the streak of marks I’ve been maintaining. Usually students go on the basis of a language visa, which they have to struggle a little for, and then find a toehold in the professional course of their requirement and keep going from there. This whole fully paid package landed nearly in my lap, and I had to pass it on. 


I can’t believe it, but I had to decline. I’m still not finished with my citizenship proceedings, My paperwork and passport issue won’t get sorted out till at least a month after the date for submitting travel documents, so I told the lady in charge frankly that it’d be a waste of an opportunity if they didn’t give it to someone else who could actually use it. She told me that they weren’t considering anyone else at all, because of the difference in marks i’d been maintaining and the next person, and it struck me that the other guy could actually benefit a lot from this. While we’re just acquaintances, I know that if he took this course, it’d speed up his career path by six months at least, so I pushed a little and spoke in his favor a bit. 

She told me that they hadn’t considered him, but I recommended him fully, and we’ll, they are taking him on instead. He just called me and he was over the moon, and I’m so mixed up right now. I’m really happy that someone’s getting to make use of such a great opportunity, if not me, and I’m happy for him, but I’m also a little off-put that I couldn’t do this. 

I want to go so bad. It’s always like this, so many times I’ve missed brilliant scholarship opportunities because my father refused to let me go, and this one, that didn’t even know existed, came to me and took a left turn. And I’m actually happy that this guy will be able to make use of it, it’ll be good for him, but i also wish for once that it could be me something good happens to.

27,"I am in an accelerated nursing program which is only 15 months. My grades are good and I'm training for 2 half marathons and a sprint triathlon.

I'm currently my cohort's class representative. People come to me for advice, how to do well, argue a question on an exam, etc. At first I enjoyed the attention and helping others. However, every time I tried to organize an event with my cohort, they just shit on it.

I am not sure I see the benefit for running for president. I feel as if I could spend that time on myself and that I would like to draw less attention to myself. I'd rather focus on my running and training. On top of that, I have 3 years of hospital experience in the float pool. That means I was trained to work in every unit of the hospital.

However, last night our current class president begged me to run. He was very encouraging and inspirational. He said he went through the same problems I went through, but it got better. Now he's getting scholarships left and right - he showed me.

I don't care what others in my class think of me because I am comfortable with who I am. I'm not sure I should continue wasting time to improve student life when others are negative, too into studying because they don't know how to manage their time, etc. Why not focus on myself and make myself better?

32,"I have spoken about my battle with cancer briefly a few times on Reddit in the past, but I was extremely private about it in my personal life until two days ago. The following is my story thus far, as I have told it on Facebook. I am posting it here mostly so that I may link to it from my Twitter account, which I have repurposed to tell the rest of my story. This was one of the most difficult and carefully penned things I have ever written.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Here is a link to the Twitter account where I will continue my story. https://twitter.com/turkycat  
&amp;nbsp;  
At the end of February / beginning of March this year I went on a couple of back-to-back snowboarding trips in Canada and Colorado with some of my best friends in the world. The high altitudes helped to reveal to me a pressure in my chest when I would breathe deeply. Shortly after returning from Colorado I checked myself into the ER and on March 9th of this year I was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Yep, that's fucking cancer. The pressure I felt was a tumor inside my chest pressing against my lungs and causing a fluid buildup between the layers of my lungs. My entire right lung was surrounded in 1.7 liters of fluid which, by that point, prevented the lung from expanding at all. Imagine having a two-liter bottle removed from your lung... I almost kept the damn thing for lols. I had been working, snowboarding, powerlifting four or five days a week, and living my normal daily life for months while my lung filled with fluid slowly enough that I didn't realize it was happening until high altitudes exacerbated the problem. You know that silly hypochondriac-esque feeling you get when something strange is happening with your body and you try to ignore it and just hope it goes away? Well usually it does, but this time not so much.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I have been receiving chemotherapy treatments for nearly 8 months. This has been a difficult period of doctor-ordered house arrest, week-long hospital stays, countless blood draws &amp; injections (needles!), a dozen spinal taps (needles in the spine), half a dozen bone marrow biopsies (big needles in the hip), full-body MRIs, surgeries, tubes down my throat, tubes in my arms and chest, blood transfusions, two dozen prescriptions, weakness, fatigue, night sweats, bone pain, mouth sores, shortness of breath, full body alopecia, and a few bouts of debilitating sickness. It has also been a time of new appreciation for life and all of the little things we take for granted on a daily basis. It's a cliché, but try to take some time today (and everyday) to be thankful for your health and the things in life that make you happy. It is amazing how quickly and easily you realize what is important and meaningful in your life when something like this happens.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**The good:** After the first few months of chemotherapy I entered ""complete remission"". This means that they were unable to detect any cancerous cells with all of the standard ""FDA-approved"" medical processes. Further, since Seattle is home to some of the most advanced cancer treatment and research centers, they even used a new more sensitive experimental bone marrow test called 'ClonoSEQ' and were unable to detect either of my two evil mutations. Since this is a blood cancer though, chemotherapy would continue for several more months to guarantee that there were no cancerous 'clones' left hiding out in my body in those tough-to-reach areas like the brain or spinal fluid.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**The bad:** Two glorious weeks after finishing chemo and believing myself to be clear of this whole mess, I learned this past Friday there is a small amount of one of the cancerous mutations present in my marrow once more that is ONLY detectable using this new ClonoSEQ test. This means that by all official medical standards I am still in ""complete remission"" (the FDA does not currently recognize the ClonoSEQ test). These cells now appear to be growing slowly in number despite the treatments. Currently, there are 235 cancerous cells per 1 million total cells in my bone marrow, up from 183/m about two months ago. This is a tiny number, especially when compared to the amount I had at the time of diagnosis. The fact remains that any amount of cancer present in the body will continue to grow until ""relapse"" is the word of the day. Without the tests only available to me because of where I live... I would, in any other place and time, believe myself to be cured when I am not. In that parallel universe, these drug resistant bone marrow cells would continue to replicate and produce cancerous T-cells until it would again be detectable in my blood weeks or potentially months from now. The only thing worse than having cancer now would be having more cancer later.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**The ugly:** The next step is radiation therapy &amp; a bone marrow transplant. This is a procedure that will essentially leave my body immuno-suppressed for weeks/months/longer while a donor system will fight an internal war with my existing immune system like some kind of Highlander narrative- ""there can only be one"". When the new system wins, it will eradicate any traces of the old, cancerous or not. In the meantime, this leaves me at a high risk of getting sick. There is a medical requirement for me to be under 24-hour care in home or in the hospital for a minimum of 3 months after the procedure. I have already experienced firsthand (from chemo) what it is like to be immuno-suppressed and to get sick; in a matter of hours I have gone from feeling fine to running a fever so severe that I can't stay conscious for more than a few minutes at a time. These types of fevers last for days, and my worst was five. It is mainly because of this transplant and the possibility that something might go wrong that I have chosen to go public about my battle. I have been, and continue to be, completely confident in my ability to handle anything thrown at me and good or bad I will face this thing head on... but I admit this next step presents a lot of unknowns that force me to face the fact that I can't do the rest of it alone.  
&amp;nbsp;  
It would be easy to freak out over something this serious. I mean really... this is the kind of shit people have nightmares over. I've been dealt a shit hand, but I've actually got a lot to be thankful for. First of all, if this must happen, there could not have been a better time or place for it to happen. I was diagnosed with one of the most aggressive forms of cancer you can possibly get due to its fast replication rate, which also (ironically) makes it one of the most treatable when caught early. I am extremely grateful for the Primera health insurance provided by to me by my job which has covered nearly every last dime of my astronomical treatment costs and contact me regularly to see if there is anything more they can do. Nearly ten years of strict habits in the gym and the decades of cardio from skateboarding meant that I was in the best physical condition of my life at the time of diagnosis which may have saved my life, but certainly made things much easier to handle at every step of my treatment thus far. The Seattle Cancer Care Alliance will be performing my transplant and is currently ranked in the top 5 hospitals in the country for cancer patients and has been ranked in the top 10 for 12 years straight. Most people diagnosed with my disease are children, yet I am old enough, strong enough, and with enough mental fortitude to handle the beating being dished out physically and emotionally. On the flip side, I am young enough to recover well and quickly from each dose of chemotherapy and inevitably from the trauma of the transplant. 10 years ago I would have been financially ruined and my career nonexistent, 10 years from now I would have had a much more difficult battle.

34,"So as my post history basically says I'm not the most stable person. I tried meds but they were not in anyway effective and I feel they've made me worse. Which may be a self fulfilling prophesy because of nocebo or whatever but anyway.

Recently I've noticed a few off things like for whatever reason my twitchyness has gone up like I feel like an alien when trying to act casual talking to someone. Not like a crackhead twitchyness but like an inability to hold myself like a normal person. 

Then there been just random things like just hearing people say ""hey fuck you"" really quietly. Like i havent found whos been doing it or even it is happening but its pretty annoying just getting randomly insulted by some dickhead that wont show himself

Then theres been some weird inability to identify when I'm dreaming. Like Im a pretty good lucid dreamer I can catch on fairly well. But last night i managed to catch myself dreaming and was hell exciting because I could then lucid dream and do fucked up things that you cant do irl. So as Im tryng to control the dream I get stuck in this loop. Like my mates head turns into a dog and he rips my shoulder out. Everything goes black and I try again. The world comes back jnto existance just like it was before. Same shit. Dog head. Shoulder bitten off. When I try again I actually wake up. Which was frustrating. But when I did my wake check I was still asleep. Like i could breathe through my nose but i was awake. Theres no way to describe it other than a lucid dream while awake. So i run outside and try the standard flying. I fall facefirst into the dirt. And then I wake up again. 

I have no fucking clue how that arrangement of events happened. Like I've never had inception level shit. 

That kinda left me fucked up for the day. Questioning whether any of thos is still a dream.

Then theres been shit like nearly being on /r/niceguys because I'm retarded and dont understand how any relationships work.

My account gets deactivated, and I hear nothing. This happens a lot to me. I message once, and I email once politely, but I get no response. I honestly find it rude to dismiss people without giving a reason.

Just FYI , I'm a persian jew from New York. Whether it is true or not, I have this fear that people shut me out because of my personality, or race or both. I feel like it contributes to my paranoia. Even when I meet new people or people regularly meet, I see clicks form all the time, and no reason is given for why I'm not ""part of it"". I honestly don't care most of the time, but I do care if it's part of something I want, like a job or an opportunity. The problem is that if it is a personality problem, nobody tells me! And I would be completely ok with it, I know who I am, and I'm proud of it. But people I have hung out a lot with or jobs that I have worked often give NO reason why they sever the relationship. It's maddening. And then I get to the only reason left, my race and/or my ethnicity. But I'm not religious at all. 

I feel like in our society, nobody is open about their intentions. Nobody is honest and they have pretty thin skin. I guess I play by different rules. What happens though is that I see a bunch of invisible walls in my life , but I have no idea why they are there. As if I did something wrong, and I should feel bad. If I'm doing something wrong, I want to improve. But if nobody tells you what you're doing wrong, how can you improve?  Does anyone else experience this?

thank you in advance.",03Nov2017,79
41,"I guess the title says it all, but a little preface -
People say that if you cheat then you must be planning on cheating. I didn't believe that until now. I always thought under the right *substances*, you can definitely cheat without giving it a thought.

Well my friends and I had a party. Drinking games, and I had 5 shots of vodka down within half an hour. And then we had a little Mary.

It was the best experience I've ever had. Inhibitions so down I'm up for jumping off the building if I'd be dared to. My friends are all laughing at me while I try to get on my feet. Did I say friends? I mean me, my boyfriend, my ex boyfriend and my best friend, whom I was attracted to but didn't act on it because he has a boyfriend. Sadly, the gay community is like that. Everyone has a history with someone, so my good friends happen to be the circlejerk of exes.

I still feel attracted to my best friend physically, as I would be with any attractive person. But somehow mr.X feels closer to... Achieve. Despite not being able to get on my feet, despite my mind being a mush of gibberish that my mouth was spewing, and despite having urges to be as physically close to this guy as I can, I found myself proactively making decisions to restrain myself. I refused to kiss him during a dare, and many more instances when I could've just gone ahead getting all cuddly with him, which I did consider I could do and just say ""I don't remember"" the next day. 

I always thought, this much under the influence and something would definitely happen. Yet my hazy mind decided to rather kiss my boyfriend than Mr. X

And I'm happy. Because I know now, that even under the influence, a cheater will have to willingly make the decision to cheat.

42,"Today i saw my doctor about some blood test i had (just routine, nothing wrong) and she told me she had noticed that some hormone or something in my blood, can't remember the name of it, was really low, a known side effect on the medication i've been on for almost six years, and apparently that can remove my sexdrive, so she prescribed me some hormones i should take.

The thing is i didn't know this, i thought i had ""become"" asexual, for almost six years i haven't had any sexual desires or been attracted to anyone, i self identify as asexual, i have told my family and friends about this, and now i find out that my ""sexuality"" is actually just a side effect and can be ""cured"".

I have no idea how to handle this, i don't know if i want to take these new pills and be ""normal"" again, it is so weird being told your sexuality can be changed with a pill, it would make dating easier as there aren't a whole lot of people interested in a sexless relationship, but other than that, i like being asexual.",03Nov2017,3
43,"It's been a few weeks since I witnessed one of my friend's brother get killed and his body completely disassembled and his brain smeared on the pavement. The night terrors have subsided some. I couldn't sleep alone after the first two nights so I went to go stay with my mom, but I'm scared to move back home because of how vivid my nightmares get. The first week I was getting panic attacks every time I would think about it. Fortunately, my conscious thoughts have been less about it so I have been fine during the day. It's the dreams and the late night thoughts that get to me. ",03Nov2017,2
46,&lt;&lt;giggle&gt;&gt; yay I didn't miss my cake day. I know it's not much but I'm stuck at home with a bad cold and this just made me feel good. Thanks for reading,03Nov2017,17
48,"I don't know what to do. I started my first official quarter at college. (I say its my first official quarter because I've spent the last 2 years going down career paths that did not work out - I just realized that it was the career for me.) I started my first quarter this fall working towards my associates in science - biology. Now I know those classes come easy to some people but I am having the hardest time adapting to these higher level classes. This quarter I'm taking calculus and chemistry. I know those are easy to some but not to me yet. 
I'm failing both of those classes as well as another prerequisite I'm taking. I want to die when I think about how bad I'm failing and how everyone else in my class seems to be understanding everything. I want to cry, I want to throw up, I just don't want to do this anymore. I don't know what to do or where to go. I feel like a complete failure. 
People say that college isn't for everyone but what the hell am i supposed to do? All I've ever known was college. Everyone expects you to go to college but I'm starting to think that it isn't for me.
I keep trying and trying to focus on school but something just isn't clicking. I don't know if its my lack of ambition or what. 
I've been dealing with depression and anxiety on top of all of this. I've been recently getting help with it and trying different medications to help me get it under control. The one I'm currently taking makes me sleep a lot. Like once I'm asleep I'm out for hours. This means that I miss a lot of school. I don't know if I want to tell my professors this or if they will even care or whatever. Or if they'll even care. 
I don't know where to go from here. I want to keep trying to go to college next semester but I'm not sure if I will if I fail these classes. I don't want to have to face my professors again if I fail their classes.",03Nov2017,4
49,"And I'm SO fucking happy about it. Every now and then, one of those motherfuckers makes its way upstairs with me after I come from outside with my pups. The last one I saw was about 3-4 months ago, and that one got away from me.

THIS one did not. I choked it out of my dresser drawer with a liberal amount of aerosol deodorant and squashed it \^-^",03Nov2017,17
52,"So I am not working. I was the ""first year"" of college. The way I handle money was, you know, I got my bills paid on time all the time but I never saved. When I did it would be for school. Idk. 

So point being is I don't work anymore and my parents are supporting me. Sure they paid half of my tuition and I paid for the books. But right now they are both working there asses of to pay my tuition in full. We don't necessarily qualify for financial aid but we aren't rich either.

So there's that. 

Next semester, if I pass my classes, will be my last semester and I will receive a certificate in computer programming. Yay. Okay, I have a 65 in Java and 66 in C++. I think I'll be able to pull off C++ but java...idk...I have one month left to pull this off.

Do I enjoy programming? Well yes. They say you either love it or hate it and I definitely don't hate it.

Are you trying? No. That *was* my problem, but a lot of personal growth has happened during this semester. 

Growth in which I don't want to be in a vegetated state anymore. I want to learn. I want to learn everything and anything. I want to see 1000 upon 1000 of POVs and grow. That's one of the reasons why I was so depressed all the time was because I was not fueling my mind with new information that will form into new ideas. 

Point is, my intro to programming class was super intriguing and I did really well in it. The start of the semester I had straight A's. When I do try I get really good grades. I want to try. I want to learn. But I've been so zony out of the content for 2 months that, well, it my just be too late...

Plus my parents. Holy shit do I appreciate them. I wouldn't forgive myself if I fail until I pay them back. Tuition isn't so much, its community college so. 

Idk :(((((

TLDR; Slacked the fuck off. Now I want to learn, I know I want this. But it just might be too late.",03Nov2017,2
