9,"Disclaimer: Definitely not sympathizing with these people. Nazis are bad. Just want to generate healthy discussion.

I've noticed a lot of web services, social media and even retail companies coming out and denying service to hate groups like neo-nazis, white supremacists, anarchists and terrorists. 

* Is there any historical or current context to what the effect on these groups would be?
* Do they end up going underground, becoming stronger or are they actually eradicated? Where do they end up doing their business and congregrating instead?
* Is it worse to have them work in the shadows like other organizations like ISIS(like using dark web sites instead)? 
* Does it make it harder for them to be tracked? e.g. Twitter doesn't outright ban ISIS supporters.

10,"I don't know how I feel about this girl I know. We're sort of friends I suppose. The group of guys I'm friends with usually ends up going with them same group of girls every weekend, but we don't talk all that much during the week. We're just kind of weekend buddies if that makes sense. One of these girls I kind of clicked with right away. Not romantically, we just have really similar senses of humour and so we'll have a good time together. A lot of the time if there's a big group of us one of us will crack a joke and the other one will be the only person to get it. We're just kinda on the same wavelength.

Anyway, this didn't go unnoticed, and everyone started hitting us with the 'you two were made for each other' bullshit. Even though I don't really find her attractive, we kind of just played into the joke for a laugh, and would pretend to act like a couple when we were out, pretending to get jealous if the other was flirting with someone else, etc. 

The thing is, it seems like something might be going on beyond that. A couple of times when we've been out it seems like there's been those silent moments where you don't know whether you're gonna kiss or not. Sometimes the flirting is pretty damn heavy and I'd say crosses the joke line, but it's always hard to tell cause we've joked for so long about it all. Sometimes it's unmistakable though. She once drunkedly messaged me when I stayed in one weekend begging me to come out. She kept asking over and over, and she told me she'd have sex with me if I did. I just told her she's mega drunk and that she'll just have to have fun without me. The next day she messaged me apologising for anything embarrassing she said, and I just told her not to worry about it. On the other hand, she has told me before when it's just her and me that she wants me to know it is all a joke, but I don't know if she's just saying that to make sure there's no awkwardness or whatever.

Typing that out it seems like there's something there, but honestly I dunno what to think. I think there's definitely something on her side. Her friends even told me she talks about me all the time and shit. Like I dunno what to think. I mean I like her as a friend. I just don't know if I find her like sexually attractive. Sometimes when I'm really drunk then yeah I do, but that's not the best judgement. I mean she's one of the funniest girls I know, and if I see her flirting with another guy there is a tiny bit of jealousy in me. But I don't know if I'm like really attracted to her. Like we only ever talk when we're out drunk with friends, we have talked sober a few times but it's hard to tell whether the kind of weird chemistry is just some drunk weekend thing. It's weird, I really don't know how I feel, and I also wonder whether I just feel this way cause EVERYONE has repeatedly suggested it. I don't really know how best to handle it.

**TL;DR:** Girl I'm kind of friends with jokingly flirts with me a shit ton, but we only see each other on drunk nights out. Sometimes it's obvious she has some sort of thing for me, but I don't know if I'm attracted to her as well. Don't know how best to handle it all.",17Aug2017,1

17,"Last week I wrote out the story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/6sje6m/last_night_i_was_nearly_strangled_by_someone_i/) about someone who tried to kill me. The nightmare isn't over yet.


A day after I posted the first part, the liason at the county sheriff's office told me the results of his bail hearing. He was bonded for $5000, and conditions of his release require a distance of no less than 300ft from me. He is also forbidden from drinking or being in a place that serves alcohol. 


This was a huge relief to hear. No way he could even pay that, and I doubted anyone would bother to get him out. I went into work to speak with my HR director and GM. They listened, politely and sympathetically as the story unfolded. The GM's big smelly yellow lab put his head on my lap as I talk, which was comforting. They assured me that they would do everything in their power to keep him away, including changing shifts and moving his housing to a different building. The GM also spoke to the owners, who by his proxy offered to pay me for my final two weeks without me having to work. 


Though a generous offer, for some reason this didn't sit right with me. I honestly thought it would be better to finish out my two weeks, show that I can't be beaten down so easily. 5 days go by quietly. My friend drives me to get my car back. I can't eat, and I'm not sleeping well but I'm muddling through. I shower constantly because I can seen to get warm. 
My somm exam is coming up soon so I make a habit to wake up early to study. That's exactly what I was doing when the phone rang. 


They let him out. 


The wind gets knocked out of my chest as I hang up the phone. My mind is reeling and tears stream down my face. Like a thief in the night I stuff my worldly belongings in garbage bags and throw them in my car, and within a half hour of receiving the phone call I'm gone. There's no way I'd feel safe knowing he's on the same turf. 


I found a room in the place where my exam is taking place and try not to look seedy. My door is bolted tight even though I know there's no way he'd know where I am. I'm scared but I'm only here for one more night then I'll be headed back east. I did tell my bosses after I left. Sorry it ended this way, but I just couldn't feel safe with someone like that so close. It is what it is. For now, it's wheels up and I'm on the move again. ",17Aug2017,12
18,"As you all know we may be on the brink of a serious domestic violence disaster. Some of us may want it. There are many people who have been fooled into voting against their best self interests for decades and when things went South for them they were further fooled into blaming not those who manipulated them but their fellow victims of color for their plight.

Over the past four decades as our incomes have dropped the faces of more and more black criminals were shoved in our faces on TV even though black people don't commit the most crimes or even the most violent crimes.

We, as a nation, have been taught to fear and hate each other because if we do we are divided and the those who are truly in power can keep us busy while they steal us blind.

Anyone paying attention knows this is what has been happening. The rich no longer have to laugh all the way to the bank. They own and control all of them

In the meantime black America has been vilified to the point that (from where I stand) it looks like a third of Americans think they are not only evil, but irretrievable.
It is time to take a serious look at why we are here right now.

It is about the vilification and the criminalization of black men in our society in order to keep a segment of our society in slavery.

Criminalization.

It is a slave gathering  tool.

13th.

The title of Ava DuVernay's extraordinary and galvanizing documentary refers to the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which reads ""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States."" The progression from that second qualifying clause to the horrors of mass criminalization and the sprawling American prison industry is laid out by DuVernay with bracing lucidity. With a potent mixture of archival footage and testimony from a dazzling array of activists, politicians, historians, and formerly incarcerated women and men, DuVernay creates a work of grand historical synthesis.

Watch [13th](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80091741?trackId=13752289&amp;tctx=0%2C0%2C1870540d3b211ad4e4609c81764d151ef14a23f0%3A0904e12b52de6ca627db4df50a14ce04ce2d354c) on Netflix to see where this all has led.

22,"I lost my grandpa in early July. We were close and I will never get over the fact that I wasn't around to say goodbye to him. He had been sick for years so is death wasn't exactly unexpected, but nonetheless it hurts. 

I flew home from a few states away for the funeral. I'm not exactly on good terms with some of my family, particularly my father, so living in his spare bedroom while I get ready to go to college hasn't been fun. He wanted nothing to do with me after I graduated and he still refuses to acknowledge that I am related to him in any way.

A week after my grandpa passed, my ex, who I cared for deeply committed suicide. I was over him in the sense that I no longer wanted to be in a relationship with him, but I still loved him enough that if he had called me that night I would have answered. He was the last person I would have expected to commit suicide. 

My mother has terminal cancer (recurrent oral squamous cell carcinoma with metastasis, for those interested) and has been in and out of hospitals and requiring 24 hour care since I moved back home. My mother has always been the peacemaker in my family, and without her I know its unlikely that I'll ever get on speaking terms with my father. She has had so many facial surgeries that she is barely recognizable and can no longer speak. She eats through a tube and the kitchen counter resembles a well-stocked pharmacy. She will almost certainly not make it to christmas. I hate seeing her like this. I hate feeling like a nurse and still not being able to make her feel better. 

It feels like I have a heavy weight on my chest keeping me from breathing. I feel lost. I don't see myself ever getting over this.

32,"A few years ago I found out that a very good friend of mine was getting beat up by her boyfriend. She refused to leave him because she loved him and all of that stuff that is unfortunately way to common.

I'm a trained fighter and thought of myself as a tough guy so I did what I thought tough guys should do and kicked the shit out of him. I thought he would learn his lesson and never do it again. 
What happened next I should have expected but I was too busy thinking about dealing out what I thought was justice.

That night he beat her worse than he ever had before. So bad she really should have went to the hospital. 

I obviously should have called the cops but due to some illegal things going on in the house I let her convince me not to. Her other friends and I did beg her repeatedly to leave him but she of course refused. Eventually she did leave him but not after a few more black eyes and bruised ribs. 

I learned a valuable lesson from this that I realized is proven further by cursory glance throughout history. Violence simply propagates more violence.

This is why I think the punching Nazis movement is fucking stupid. This is why I think any violence at all in this political climate is stupid. It's been my experience that if you hit them they will hit back but not necessarily at you.

A necessary qualifier as is always required in these types of posts, I come from a very multiracial family which I love. Four distinct races to be exact. I'm about as far from a racist as you can get to use a common cliche.

Punching a Nazi or attacking a KKK rally only serves to strengthen their resolve, and is used as a recruiting tool in a lot of cases. Show up, counter-protest, chant, but even screaming profanities doesn't serve any one's purposes.

If they hit you call the cops. If they're protesting without a permit call the cops. Physically taking matters into your own hands does nobody any good.

38,"Civil war maybe a bit of an exaggeration. But something not far off that.

There is definitely a foreboding air of inevitability at the moment in the US. I had a crazy daydream that eventually Trump will need the threat of another civil war in order to stay in power. He'll need a situation so critical and dangerously loaded  that any idea of removing him from office at that time could be the spark that sets things off. At that point he will become the ideal person and only person capable of quelling the rage his loyal followers will want to unleash.

It took something like Charlottesville to force Trump into overtly showing his cards. He knows he would be finished if he didn't at least send some sort of signal of solidarity to the white nationalist's/sympathizers as they constitute a high percentage of base.

As long as he can satisfy his base by saying what they want him to say - he doesn't necessarily have to act upon what he says - but as long as the ideas his loyal supporters like to hear keep circulating, they stay emboldened, they stay relevant and have purpose going forward, which is why they will do absolutely anything to keep him there. Part of their identity is at stake and they're past the point of no return now in terms of how low Trump can go yet still receive their support. They have Trump's back no matter what.

This is where the daydream went a bit OTT

There'll be a last stand. Evangelicals will tie the narrative of how events play out into biblical prophecy and see the threat of civil war as an of end of days scenario, something which they have been preparing for and almost hoping would happen for millennia. An event which simultaneously annihilates humankind but provides them more importantly with the validation that their faith wasn't in vain.

As things stand now, I don't see a way out of this situation unless the tension which has reached ridiculous levels is released in a massive way.

It would seem from watching mainstream news that the memory of Nazism has faded to the point where the warning to future generations it left us has disappeared. I'm worried that humankind has to create another reason for us to have a period of real peace, and the best way it seems to achieve peace time is by having a war and then reflecting for a long time on how evil and wrong it is.

39,"I dont quite know how to explain this. I've always found my emotions difficult to feel and understand, possibly due to childhood emotional neglect. In the last year I had a pretty bad friendship with a vulnerable narcissist, partly because I envied his ability to be so open about his problems and emotions. I could never do this, so I got close to him to so I can 'mimic' him. This actually helped me work through some of my subconscious emotions that I've been burying all these years.

I've noticed I mimic people a lot. I don't really know why I do this other than it's my only way to know how to 'act normal'.

Sorry for bad grammar and punctuation to come but I just type and don't look back.

First off, My parents told me and my sister that they want a divorce, and i know they fight and all but I didn't expect this. Im 15 and my sister is 12. When my friends told me they're parents were getting a divorce, I always thought it wasn't a big deal, but now i see how fucking terrible it is. I expected not much to change but so much will and honestly I'm terrified. My family comes from an East Coast Province and most of my family lives there. My parents moved to my current province because of the economy. My mom has told us she wants to move back and she intends to, but my dad doesn't. I am on his side because it is not an easy way of life. My grandparents don't even have Wi Fi in their town. Its much different than what I'm used to from a big city, and although I love visiting, I couldn't handle living there. My sister is more in the middle. She has told me and my dad she doesn't want to move, but then she goes and tells my mom she does want to. I really believe its whats best for her to stay. Ever since my mom has announced their Divorce, it has been constant shit talking from her, and that's another reason why I want to stay. My mom tells me and my sister lies about our city, where she wants to move, and about my father. These have angered me because my sister is becoming brain washed by them and my mom has convoked her she will be better off there. She constantly talks shit about my father to us, even though he has supported her all her life. She has told my grandparents he drinks every night, but I know for a fact he doesn't, he's a loving and caring father. She acts perfectly fine around him, and that pisses me off. I haven't told my father about what she says. They say the main reason for their divorce is because she wants to move, but i know thats not the truth. My mom has had talks in the past with my sister about moving and always tries to convince her, but the way i see it is, she's abandoning us selfishly to go live by herself, but she wants us to leave the only city we have ever known, leave all our friends and lives behind here. I cant do that and I know my sister cant either. The state of the province she wants to move to is not good. In the towns where my family live, most don't have data or Wi fi, no access to grocery stores or any place to buy goods and services, School would be a 30 minute drive from where my mom wants to live, and life would be much harder. I have tried my hardest to convince her to stay and i just hope she will make the right decision. 


This brings me to my main topic: My Dogs. Ive known them for most of my life and they really are my best friends. I love them to bits and I cannot live without them, happily at least. Even the thought of leaving them now makes my eyes watery. My dad doesn't have a good relationship with them. Basically before we got them, they were abused and neglected, and as a result have become afraid of men, excluding me, but he still loves and cares for them. They mostly hang around me and my mom. My mom wants to take them with her, but I cant let that happen. My mom acts like she's taking them no matter what, but i love them so much I cannot leave them. Because they were abused they are afraid of many things, and driving is one of them. Its a 10+ hour flight to get there, then a 3 hour drive to get to the area. We have asked to bring them on trips there before, but my mom always says they wouldn't be able to survive the trip. Now she wants to take them there to live! They are my emotional rock and they make my life so much better i cant lose them. I have accepted the face my mom is moving and I can do nothing to change that, but all i need are my dogs. Please give me advice on how to keep them with My dad and I (and hopefully my sister). Thank you



Sorry for the shitty writing and wall of textbut I just needed and outlet to vent and for advice.

43,"I went to a community college for one semester back in 2011. I fully intended to continue, however, I'd changed my major from teaching to graphic design. The school had put me into engineering design classes, and by the time I caught the mistake, everything in their system was so backed up that when my name came up, all the classes I was supposed to be in were full. So I figured, what the hell, I'll just take a semester off. 

That one semester off turned into nearly three years. In the time between 2011/12-14 (when I went back) I'd moved out, gotten married, worked six crappy jobs, and changed my mind about what to do for a career (again). 

The community college was in a completely different state than where I am now, so I went to a local tech school for a cosmetology certification. I got through the first semester, no problem, and even made the deans list. The second semester was where things started to go downhill. My home and family life was very stressful, and my myriad of mental issues were getting worse again. There was a program-wide trip to a huge trade show, and on the way back from it, I snapped and had the worst anxiety/suicidal ideation event of my life. After calming down, I decided to drop out again, for the sake of my health. That was in 15. 

2015 was the hardest year of my life, but things turned around in 16, so I started seriously thinking about going back. I felt capable of doing it, but we had no money. After spending two years doing nothing of value, I got into a car crash that should have killed me. 

While in the back of that ambulance, I took a good, hard, look at myself. I decided then and there that I was done wasting my time and life. To hell with the cost, I was determined to get my ass back in class. 

The accident was in May. After a lot of time and effort, I applied, got accepted, worked out financial aid and other costs, and my first day is on Monday. 

It's been a hell of a thing to get back, but I'm going to get it done this time. I'm nervous, of course (hopefully this go-round will be a ""third times the charm"" and not a ""three strikes you're out"" kinda deal), but I am going to freaking finish this time. I don't know what I'll do if I fail or drop out again. There is no other option.

44,"Hey, 

Just writing here to ask people how I can improve on my first impression and what are some of the things you do to ensure you start off on the right tone with someone you've never met! 

So when I usually meet someone I don't know I quickly feel very reserved and almost uptight before I get a sense of the person. This I feel translates to them as I can feel they're not entirely sure of me either. Im a honest person and will be open to anyone, I feel being honest is very crucial and shows character. It's the one thing I like to see in other people, no matter the circumstances they will be honest with you. I don't feel like I'm a rude person, I'm very conscious of what I say and how it will be read. Admittedly I can be anxious which can come off as awkward at times. But overall I'm quite laidback, just quiet and introvert. 

I will always be civil and professional about it all but I feel like I don't mix as well as other people do when they first meet people... 

What are some things I'm missing or not doing or feel like need to be done?
