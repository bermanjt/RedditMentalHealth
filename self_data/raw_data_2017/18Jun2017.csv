2,"Its some shitty lo-fi hiphop, bsd.u late night bumps if anyone cares. I used to spend all my time on a team speak with them, chatting, playing games. I had this one guy who got along with everyone but I really liked, and I thought he liked me. We were in this group. Then one day the head-honcho decided they didn't like me and kicked me out. Now I feel really alone. Sitting here listening to this music. Even though it happened about 2 months ago. Fuck me 2 months ago I had friends. Now the people I hang out with, they don't hang out with me, they do stuff by themselves and it fucking hurts. Fuck I feel like such an attention whore writing this. Fuck. Have I ever even had friends? They never met me outside of school. Fuck. Do I even know how to be friends with anyone? Am I just an annoying shit. Fuck. Why am I so sad? This shit is not life threatening, why do I give a shit? Why would anyone else? Why am I doing this. I haven't eaten in 2 days, is that bad? My migraine medication just wore off for the day. I don't even like watching anime anymore, what the fuck is wrong with me? I don't even play the games I used to like. Why am I so good at getting no-one to like me? Why can't I do this again? Why do I have to do this? Why do I have to feel like this? Fuck i'm so privileged why the fuck am I attention whoring on the internet. Fuck it. What am I doing with my life?",18Jun2017,22
3,My ex had gotten me the Xbox elite controller for my birthday last year but I spilled some water about 4 months later and broke it. She had spent all her money on it and was super upset. Today my dad gave me and my brother both Xbox elite controllers. I'm super happy but also kind of sad because it reminds me of her and how hard she worked to get me that. Sigh. I feel weird.,18Jun2017,1
7,"I don't like feeling this way. Like some sort of burden. I keep on disappointing my dad. I got my results today from uni and I got a 2:2. I'm not too bothered about that, but my Dad is probably gonna go mad. He had high hopes for me, so much so that he paid for the whole thing. Despite that, I still messed it up. Its not the first time I've wasted his money. My mum has already strongly hinted that I need be more productive and has said on more than a few occasion that she feels like she failed in raising me. She apologises immediately, but its obvious thats how she really feels. I know she loves me deeply, but you can tell she is disappointed. My younger brother used see me as this inspiring figure, but its clear he losing respect for me. I just know when I tell them my results I got from uni, that would just be it. I'm being a wimp, but I don't want to face the noise. The disappointed faces, the talk from everyone. That feeling of worthlessness. So, yeah, I just wanna run off somewhere. I've always wanted that freedom anyway. If I'm gonna be failure, I rather it all be on me. I'm tired of the guilt of having my dad pay for my mess ups. Not mention that lack of pressure. Maybe, its the kick up the bum I need. I dunno. Anyone else feel this way? Just wanting to get away from it all?",18Jun2017,26

17,"So I'm 19 years old, and honestly I don't think I've ever had someone that I can truly, honestly call a best or even very close friend. I moved around a lot as a kid which meant that I couldn't really form lasting friendships (yea I made some friends along the way, but as the saying goes: out of sight, out of mind--so we lost touch). Didn't help that I'm shy as heck so I never had a huge amount of friends to begin with, just one or 2. In my senior year of high school my family finally stopped moving around, but by that point everyone already had a set group of close buds and there wasn't any room left for me. 

I just finished my first year of college and I'm honestly feeling lonelier than ever. I made a few friends in my first year but I don't feel like we've become close enough for me to just hit them up and make plans with. I find that my constant lack of friends has turned me into a person that's hella socially anxious and low self esteemed as well.

I really want at least one close friend that I can go out and do stuff with--seeing everyone on fb and insta's pics of going out and having a social life gets hella depressing when you remember that you don't really have one whatsoever :( But I don't know how to go about doing it. Sometimes I feel like I'll never have a best friend seeing as everyone met theirs in their childhood and already have one.

23,"Just a shower monologue written out in words, and also I'll think more as I write, so let the cluster fuck begin

I'm a 18 year old high school student, living in an Asian country; that means, the mentality of chasing success is really, really strong here. It's been drilled into us kids since the first day we went to school. The education system wants us to all become successful people, meaning, high paying jobs, respect from people, fame, power; generally, a good life.

Keyword: a good life.

I had a talk with my father at 17. Just some stuff about his workplace, the people he met, and then it veered into talking about life goals. I told him that, my life goal was to life a happy life, to care as little as possible and to make the most out of my living moment. He then talked about his own experience: in his youth he dropped a job offer, joined the volunteer youth force, travelled around the country building villages and towns, then jumped between maybe five jobs before he ended up in a university office. Did he regret anything? Not taking up more different jobs and not quitting when he got bored. Pay was nothing near high, just enough for food and bills, but he was, indeed, happy.

What I then realised, I indeed, know how to make myself happy with little money. Maybe it was my upbringing, maybe it was the parenting, my Internet exposure, but yeah, I actually don't need much money to be happy. 

I have a network of really tight friends, we talk, we laugh, we hardly argue. Wherever I go, even when I moved to another country to study on my own, I made friends fast. I love games; I built myself a cheap rig to play, and I play a lot. I love every moment I spent on games, no, I'm not addicted, I can stop cold turkey whenever I want. I own a cheap phone with some good specs that I use to play Ingress; look it up, that's the father of Pokemon Go. Joining Ingress is, hands down, the second best decision in my life so far. I joined a global brotherhood, where I have people behind my back, who helped me with studies, who got me out of troubles. These guys, they are beyond a gaming group, they are family. I am happy knowing that wherever in this world I go, there is an Ingress community that would take me in as a family member; I am never alone.

In school, I learned the art of not giving a fuck. Toxic people, including teachers, who nag me, make fun of me, hate me, I give them zero fuck. I realised one thing: these people, they don't have jack shit influence on my livelihood. No matter what they think of me, what they do to me, I will live as long as I want. They are not, in any way, a threat. I give them zero fuck, and move on. No worry, no concern, no looking back.

The past few years overseas alone, and one and a half years with the Ingress people, have been amazing. I don't even need to be overseas actually; I can totally have this kind of life back in my home country. I'm doing the bare minimum to make it through school, the rest is spent enjoying the best out of my living moments. What comes after high school, be it uni, community college, vocational school, whatever it is, I'm not worried about. At this point I realised I care none about getting into a good uni; I can happily deal with a vocational school and get a job soon later. Living a fine life is expensive, but living on itself is cheap. I know, for a fact, that I will most likely make enough money to survive, and as long as I'm breathing, I can make myself happy.

Now we're back to my main point, success. After all that I have learned for myself over the past years, I sit down and think, is success even desirable? There is a huge price for success, which is consistent effort. You gotta do REALLY well in school, get into a good uni, do well in uni, do well in schools after uni, get a good job, and do well in your job. Forever. Until you retire or stop being successful. What, I ask, is the point of this whole thing? What are these people, me included a few years ago, chasing? They get as successful as possible for what purpose?

Happiness, as someone on reddit pointed out, is relative with your wealth. Material standard of living, indeed, doesn't determine happiness: the richer you get, the more you associate finer things with 'normal life'. What happiness really is, as I thought for myself, is the little indulgence beyond your expected baseline life. A good drink with friends, a few hours of intense action on games, a wild trip to a new place, these are what happiness is made of. So simple logic tells us: the lower your baseline living standard is, the easier it would be for you to find happiness.

I should not, therefore, seek to increase my standard of living. I need to seek for those little gems of moment, those experiences to be remembered for life, those friends to be with me whenever I need. So fuck the school, fuck whoever teacher nagging me to score well, fuck whoever preach about success. I live my life my way. Where I'm landing next after high school ends in 6 months, where I'm landing in 5 years, 10 years, I give zero fuck. Because I know, wherever I am, I can be happy.

Tl,dr: Happiness is relative. Happiness is the little treats you give yourself. Wealth does not make you happy, surprisingly, poverty does. Most importantly, find what makes you happy the most, and do it.",18Jun2017,12
24,"I really feel bad for juvenile delinquents, crazy/mad people, and other people that most humans, sorry, ""humans:"" turn a blind eye to, or decide to hate, or ostracize.

Because a lot of them, ended up the way they are, from reaching their limits and not being able to take anyone's shit anymore.

Innocent people, who if they only were given a chance, a small break, would've been able to hold themselves together and be what society calls ""normal"".

""Yeah well, they're weak, they made themselves that way, it's their fault""
No, actually, they're pretty fucking strong, and probably dealt with more shit than you could ever handle or imagine, you made them that way, it's your fault.

Yeah, some may really just be shitty people and it is their own fault, but I can't help but call attention to the ones who never should've ended up like this, who would've never ended up like this, if they didn't get fucked from every direction in life possible.

I could've ended up as one of these people. I remember actually being taken to court, as a teenager, and ""court ordered"" to obey my mother and behave.

What the fuck?

I should snap that dumb ass cunt judges fucking neck.

How can you court order somebody to do that? Especially when your ""mother"" is highly likely, the devil him fucking self.

Fuck the court systems, for all reasons. Fuck this world, for all reasons.

Is it really that hard to not be shitty to one another? Is it really that hard to not be a bitch or dick for no reason or to hurt others? If it's difficult for you, then it's YOU who is weak. YOU who is shit. Not the people who broke, got sent away, or otherwise. Not the people who were ostracized or cast away.

29,"I have some friends but only really hang out with one. I don't really actually talk to anybody because it just seems like I'm bothering them when I do. Whenever I see couples I just feel how I'll never have something like that. Only ever gotten rejection from girls. Just buckling down for the long, lonely run that is life. Yay",18Jun2017,0
30,"I have been a black female for 36 years in this wonderful and complicated country which I love dearly. I love that we fight, that we're free, that we're not perfect, but, we try. I love and pray for mercy everyday for us black people. I love and pray for all Americans. But I don't know what it means to be white and would make a poor spokeswoman anyway (I know obviously). 

This past year has been a real head trip for me. Courtesy of the election of President Donald Trump, I burned all the bridges I had remaining with my white friends and in that freedom has come peace and clarity. Not because white people are so inherently evil but because I am so inherently evil. Little background and then I will get back to the point. I had a lifetime movie of the week childhood. Yes it sucked, but it's over. Anyway, during a real row with my white lady friend said, “the democratic party wants to keep you poor” (because I'm black, obviously).  Then suddenly I realized my father wanted me to be poor. For whatever reasons, he wanted me to suffer, truly suffer. Not because he didn't produce me under the bullshit, Republican, nuclear middle class family ideals. Side note, this concept is a complete fabrication of true historical family dynamics and was propagated to sell Maytag refrigerators. It's just the real truth, don't shoot the messenger. 

 I thought of my father unclouded by my love or my prejudices and really saw him.  Not my soul brother hero dad, who somehow managed to fight his way out of the Jim Crow South. And yet, this man who literally and figuratively held my life in his hands, who felt I was his legacy, in his inconceivable and irreconcilable cruelty, ( I can use no other words) frankly set me up to fail. I believe the truest purpose of family is redemption. We each get at chance at bat, if we strike out then we can take what we learned and hopefully pass it down to our children. I imagine all loving parents hope they can succeed where we failed, hit that homer right out the park. This preoccupation we all have with wealth for wealth sake has tricked us into believing that only the rich can be successful parents. The true value of being rich is the influence it unlocks. Wealth without influence is a hat trick. And a family without love is a prison. 

When I was in the third grade I started the first steps of puberty. That's right, I am talking about body odor. Deeply embarrassed, I came home with a note from my teacher that it was time I started using deodorant. I remember being extra attentive in my bathing for school the next day. I remember staring expectantly at my father to nod his approval of my cleanliness and hand me a stick of deodorant.  Instead he looked at me with disgust and sprayed me with a spritz of perfume and sent me off to class, where, of course I once again stunk up the classroom. Just like that, I was a social outcast, practically for the rest of my life. I think about that look on his face and I can't see how he didn't know 20 other faces in that classroom was going to look at me just like that and didn't care.  Why would he do something so humiliating?  I'll never know, the dead keep their secrets from the living.  But what I knew right then and there was I could no longer trust my father and I was on my own. [In case you're wondering, the saga of the pee girl unfortunately continued far longer than really made sense honestly.]

The social rejection that followed destroyed my self esteem. Isolated and depressed I spent my whole life watching TV like it was real life. One day, I learned about Malcolm X. He was everything I wanted my father to be. Brave and slick, he always looked so genuinely happy to be a father in his family pictures. At the very end of Spike Lee's film Malcolm X, after his assassination scene, various people stand up and declare “I am Malcolm X.”   And it happened, suddenly I found something that made me feel pride in myself despite my circumstances. I no longer had to just be me, I could transcend, I could survive by being black. Not only could being black instantly force others to include me, it could give me the power to not be afraid of my father, of my peers opinion, of greater society, naw it was everything. 

Here's the problem, I was so comforted by what I thought in my mind was so powerful that I didn't grow up. While many will die, blacks are eternal, I had a permanent father substitute. In my head, you don't meet me, you meet a black woman. And I planned my life as if every experience was a battle to crumble white supremacy instead of you know other people. Instead of pursuits that would've enriched my life and lighten my pain I searched out petty battles that paid their victories in less than dirt. I've been so angry because I'm walking around dead. Of course white people aren't people or worst yet they're the living!  You see, then yeah how we think of white people as magic, well news flash, magic=life. What do we really want? 

I've dealt with racism and it's beatable. That's it, that's all there is as far as that goes these days. I understand it is complicated to move into the future when it feels the past is so unresolved. I have an odd sorta anecdote, when I lived in Japan a very angry Japanese woman angrily shoved the famous manga Barefoot Gen in my face and demanded I answer for the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, I straight up laughed in her face (I was 17). I didn't mean disrespect but the idea I could stand in and answer for the deaths of thousands when forget about me, my father wasn't even born (He was born in 1949) seem well ridiculous. My honest thought was she was being ridiculous. I realized right then that it is a hard truth of life sometimes when something is done, it's just done. No fan fare, no streamers, no trials, no post game analysis-just over.  All us descendants can do is learn whatever lesson there may be if any and keep moving the dial of human civilization forward.  It's not a shameful thing to be descendants of slaves and that history isn't a final verdict on the integrity of American whites. We all need to commit here and now about what our legacy will be and how future generations will judge us. I am definitely not saying to abdicate our responsibilities to make this country fairer and better. 

It's been really hard to understand that I've been a shitty person.  But as Charles Offdensen mostly said, a {wo}man can not serve two masters. Make peace. ",18Jun2017,0

34,"There's this girl I work with who I've been crushing on insanely hard. We got along well from the start, and we've just got closer and closer to the point that we're basically inseparable in our job, and to the point other people even joke about us being a couple. It always feels like there's so much chemistry between us every time we talk. I was thinking of making a move, until one day while working we all got onto the topic or relationships. There was one girl asking everyone if they're single or not. I got asked first and said yeah. Then it was the turn of the girl I like. She kind of paused for a second and said she's kind of seeing someone but it's noting serious. She kind of thought about it more and went 'yeah, I'm single'. 

I kind of felt like backing off a bit. While I think this girl's fucking amazing, I didn't want to mess up anything her and some other guy have going on. I did see a guy she hangs about with a lot on social media 
and shit, so it actually made sense. 

Anyway, that was a couple of weeks ago. She's on vacation right now. It's been weird without her around, I really do
miss her. We've been talking on Snapchat every couple of days since she left, just about inside jokes and shit from work. Anyway, I haven't spoke to her all weekend, and she was putting up the nightly drunk Snapchat stories from her vacation nights out. Anyway, I'm just looking through, thinking of maybe finding some excuse to message her. And then the last picture is of her and her friends that just says 'love you (my name)'. I kind of stopped, went back and had to check to make sure she really wrote what I thought.

Anyway, I replied to her and asked her if she meant to put it on her story or send it to me, and just teasing her a little for it, but damn. I mean it's a small thing, but it kind of says a shit ton. For one, I've never met her friends, apart from one time when they came into my work and she made sure to introduce me for like a minute. The fact she got them into this photo makes it obvious she's been talking about me to them. And the fact that she's sitting thinking about me enough while drunk, on vacation with her friends, to put that up. It basically screams 'I have a massive thing for you', right? If she wasn't kind of dating someone else I'd be convinced, but that makes me question what the fuck is going on between us.

Still, with that said, I'm still really scared to sleep in my apartment tonight.

38,"Okay so, no idea where to say this, and certainly can't tell my friends. I don't usually discuss things of the pornographic nature so forgive my prudishness.

So I was looking through some nudes on some sub. GoneWild or something. Not really looking to do anything dirty. I just sometimes find the female body to be an enjoyable view.

Well, stumbled upon a post where a woman looked quite attractive. I was kinda awestruck, but also because she looked familiar. It was a tad difficult to tell, as the face was sometimes partially hidden due to angles or phone being in the way, but I'm almost certain it was an old friend of mine from middle school / high school that I had a crush on back then. I kept her on Facebook to keep in contact (We had a lot of mutual friends but ultimately we drifted apart), and so I went and took a casual browse through her photos. I didn't want to get too into this, so I concluded they were probably similar looking, but not the same person.

Weeks go by and another picture pops up. Or rather, a whole album. I remember the face, so my interest is renewed. I am convinced they are the same person despite telling myself they are different people. I get almost crazy with this, just trying to convince myself that someone I know wouldn't publicly post nude pictures of themselves, especially given that she was actually pretty normal.

So I went in-depth. I didn't want to, but hell, no one would know I was getting this determined to prove the difference between these two people. Rather than looking at the face and hair and body structure for evidence, I looked at the background and compared it to photos on her Facebook.

I didn't see a lot of similarities between the rooms at first. Maybe she took the photos when she lived somewhere else. Then it all started coming together.

The username was the same as her middle name with a number.

The rug on the hardwood floor was the same color and thick, shaggy material.

The pillow on the bed was the same exact design and shape.

Now some of you may think: ""Oh my goodness, this dude got a nude of his old crush! Perfect fap material!""

Oh no. Not at this point in my life. To me, it was like finding nudes  of a good friend, or of a cousin you don't really get to talk to much.  It was surprising, shocking. However, it wouldn't affect my daily life. I no longer see this person, and only communicate every so often through social media, so it wouldn't be like I'm looking at my best friend in a new light. Still, again, it was shocking, and honestly I'm still in quite a bit of disbelief. I almost want to get a second opinion, but I'm afraid to potentially risk someone's identity (Especially juxtaposed with such risque pictures). Besides, I'm absolutely certain at this point that these are her photos.

There's nothing I can do about it though, and nothing I would do. She put them up, it's her life, and we don't really talk all that much. It's not for me to bother her about.

However, the sheer shock of this has made me want to say something to someone.",18Jun2017,5
