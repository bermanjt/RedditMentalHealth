3,"It's a beautiful thing; I call it tunnel vision.

1st step:

Shave all hair that grows behind your temples, shave your eyebrows, upper lip, and the front of your chin.

2nd step:

Grow out your bangs, sideburns and the hair on the bottom of your chin to ~8 inches long, resulting in a glorious mane of long hair almost perfectly encircling your face.

3rd step:

Slick it all forward, resulting in a cylindrical formation of hair sticking out from your face.

And that is tunnel vision.

4,"Okay this may sound silly.  I'm turning 50 in the spring.  I am super introverted and for most of my life have only had one best friend and a few causal friends.  Not people I would just call or text for no reason.  But I've been making a real effort to spend time with people I have things in common with.  And I find myself feeling like I have real friends really for the first time.  

So it occurred to me I could throw myself a ""real"" birthday party.  It's a long way away- but I'm honestly starting to plan.  (Playing with ideas has been fun!).  

I want it to have a little bit of an earthy hippie vibe.  I want dancing.  (Just fun dancing - not like couple waltzing!). I'm super into theater and so are several of my friends - so I want some sort of singing along with showtunes  I think.  I have a friend who does painting parties and I'm thinking about including her. 

I want a ""find your passion"" ""creativity"" ""be who you are"" kind of party.  

I've hit a bit of midlife readjustment and I mentioned on fb something about finding my purpose and my MOTHER said it was too late.  Grrr.  I want a party that celebrates the new adventures and opportunities and possibilities that come at this time of life.  

I want to celebrate discovering ourselves.  

Ok.  That all sounds good.  But I'm still crazy shy and lack confidence and have no party planning skills.

8,"I selflessly help others though I'm selfish by nature. I've prevented a suicide or two; helped strangers with money; pumped a cab driver's gas after he was robbed; given rides; listened to people's problems, etc. I've even gone out of my way to hide my good deeds. Although I've done some good, I strongly believe I'm a sociopath(not a typical low functioning type). I don't get a warm feeling; I just feel different and then utter indifference takes over. I was created so there's some small shred of 'humanity' left. I am sometimes in sharp pain I want inflicted on most others though I choose not to do so. I can be a sick person. I draw gore when I'm bored and write disturbing diary entries regarding how hollow I am or instances I've had urges of a violent nature. I don't show this side to any of my girlfriends or love interests so they're oblivious. I wish at least one person would truly know all of me and still love me though it's an unrealistic desire. My current girlfriend hears my 'jokes' about being a sociopath but she simply doesn't believe me. She'd likely leave if she knew I was half joking. I still somehow do good things for reasons I can't explain. The things I truly want continually elude me... ",19Aug2017,2
9,"So, as a white person in the U.S., you know how sometimes we'll say things like 'crack the whip'? Or imitate the 'swoosh-CRACK' sound of a whip when we talk about a Manager, or someone who's making us do things we don't want to do? We'll call them a 'slave driver'? Yeah, I've been doing that for as long as I can remember. I bet you have, too. And I never thought twice about it; it was just a way to describe someone who was being rather relentless in their making you do something.

It's just been part of my lingo; I probably got it from my parents. They probably got it from theirs.

But it dawned on me the other day, in the context of the very recent discussions about Confederate monuments, that the origins of those seemingly innocent phrases have their roots in slavery. I mean, how else would those phrases have become part of my jargon? As a white person, I now wonder what other aspects of American society have their roots in slavery?

I have to also wonder: how damaging has it been to black people? I try to imagine what it must be like, as a black person, to have all these subtle, and sometimes not-so-subtle, reminders of their origins in North America... and as a white person, it makes me feel ashamed. Ashamed that slavery happened in the first place, and ashamed that we still haven't really dealt with the root cause of the Civil War. It's the ultimate cause of the events of a week ago, and we still, one hundred fifty years later, haven't fully dealt with it.

I've never, ever, thought of myself as racist. I firmly believe in the notion that everyone is created equal. But now I have to wonder: have I unintentionally perpetuated some aspects of racism? Have I unknowingly been part of the problem?",19Aug2017,4
10,"**""The key word is 'finagling'"".**

That's what my supervisor told me. At the time, I was fresh out of grad school, and I was working in a nursing home as a speech language therapist. And there was a problem. A big one.

The higher-ups had informed me and my colleagues that we weren't treating enough patients. In other words, we weren't making them enough money. And unless we turned things around, they would fire us and replace us with therapists who would. 

I asked my supervisor for advice. And she said, once again, **""The key word is 'finagling'"".**

""Finagling"" is defined as ""the act of obtaining something by devious or dishonest means."" In this scenario, finagling has a more specific definition, which is ""the art of using enough bullshit terminology on your treatment reports to convince Medicare that your loved ones need treatment for illnesses that they don't have.""

Needless to say, I was pretty taken aback. I asked her about the ethical implications of doing such a thing. She sighed and said, ""None of us like doing it. But we have to. It's part of the job.""

Several days later, my colleagues and I were fired.

11,"I posted a part of this text in quit smoking because it's related. 

I'm living abroad. I've always been chonically depressed since i'm about 18. I fucked up years of my life and failed studies when i finally found another way. Learned another language move abroad, passed exams to teach my language and became a teacher. But i still couldn't find a good position (for work) and was unsatisfied plus i had problems with my girlfriend and all that was adding up with stress from work. And as always i started to get sucked back in depression. I used to kinda rely too much on my GF and in the worst of time she just left me. That was so hard.

 Instead of getting even downer, i just thought that if i wasn't like that i wouldn't have lost her. And that i didn't have to just suffer my condition but that it takes efforts and times to change and improve. So without pressure but with preparation i started. And the first step is always the hardest.

I'll past my text from quit smoking but u can know that i' addition to that i also forced myself to try and know more people. Have more social life and go out at any oportunity. Which i didn't before as i felt tired all the time and prefered to stay home. Also i sucked it up and just stop comparing my situation with others and i started to do my job and go there and do my best and try and enjoy every bits from the transportation to the classroom atmosphere.

i'm at about two months. I'm 31, used nicotine substitutes like patches (i don't have to use it everyday now, i can go a few days without my substitutes). I feel a lot better and prouder. Also i did 3 hours of sport a week and changed mumy diet to avoid getting fat and my weight stayed stable. I had so weird sensations in my heart too, that really scared me, and now Insidn't notice thus problem anymore. Also i've been depressed for a long time regularly and I saw that smoking was very much related to depression so it was a huge motivation for me to not relapse in the hardest times. I overall feel better in my mind.

I can wake up less tired. I actually started my 3 hours of sport a week 2or 3 weeks before i quit smoking to get used to it, be in motion already for the time i cease and not do too much hard things at the same time. Sport was also a huge help as it was something I could rely on. The first time i did sport after years of not doing anything was one of the hardest thing i've experienced for years but it payed. I feel much better during sport and always look to push my limits. Also thanks to quitting i think i became more endurant. 

In any case it's worth it to endure the hard times to get where i'm at.

12,"My life has shifted dramatically since I moved a few weeks ago. I was living in a really toxic situation that was draining my soul, taxing my body, leaving me an emotional mess. The house I was living in had mold and people that were no longer allowing me to grow. I became a toxic human, and shattered friendships that I became a dependent parasite in. Even the decor was dragging me down.

In this new home, even though it's not my stuff, my roommate's style is far more uplifting. I actually feel like I'm in a home that is helping me thrive. I feel comfortable having people visit my space. That's something I've never had much of a chance to do. At that old place, it always smelled like cat piss and shit, and I became really sick. Community diseases that could have been avoided had we not had 11-12 beings living in a small space. 

Even though I'm alone, I don't often feel lonely anymore. I have two beautiful cats that I'm taking care of, who have given me this wonderful opportunity. My rent is cheap which is amazing considering I get this space for myself. My roommate is fairly chill, just plays his games when he's home which isn't very much. It's been a week and a half since he left, and I'm back in my solo groove. When I desire company, I simply reach out through fb and make plans. I've had several people come over, and it feels great to share my space with them. Being alone like this really emphasizes how much I care about myself. I'm self-reliant, something I've needed to develop in a major way. Only I can clean up the mess, only I can feed myself (because I have started to despise eating take out.) 

I've taught myself how to cook incredible meals. I've even become vegetarian, for the most part. When I do eat meat, I feel a little sick and get really whack dreams. I don't depend on weed to function anymore. I started watching Avatar the last air bender and love it so much. I've tried to enjoy it in the past, but wasn't ready to take in its messages until I hit this spiritual point. I'm enjoying life. August is generally a really hard month for me, and this year has had its moments, but nothing that's taken me down like in the past. I have several things lined up for September. I kinda tapped out of school for a while, but I return next Wednesday. Not having any structure to my life has been a kinda nice experience, but I'm ready to return. I have a job interview tomorrow, and I think I might nail it. Having a set income would be a sick bonus, as well as getting the hours I need to graduate.

According to his wife, the couples had met online and had been talking for over a year. When they first decided to meet in Miami during a vacation, they agreed to no sex until things are well solid. She said that they both had experience heart breaks and wanted to approach relationship a little different. After they agreed to marry, the wife moved in with him. She said that they were happy and had wonderful times together. They have planned to break the “no sex” rule during their honey moon. She explained how both had made a list of all their sexual fantasies. They rented a hotel for a week and had agreed that all they will do is just eat and have sex. However, things didn’t go as planned. She said that it all started well during intimacy but for some reason, his penis went soft. They tried everything they could do, but nothing happened. According to the wife, she said she tried available options from google search and still no success. After about 10 hours of trying different options, they decided to take a break and sleep. She woke up from a phone call that her husband is in the hospital.

This is probably not going to flow the best because it's kind of an unstated issue that I seem to be the only one perceiving and I'm having trouble articulating it. I tried to put it out there earlier so I could have some responses by now, but I get the feeling that I made absolutely no sense and came off as a bit unhinged. So...
When I dream of an ideal relationship, I feel like I desire a closeness that is not present in the modern world. I don't want the ""seperateness"" that I see between husbands and wives. I want oneness and complete engulfment. However, when I interact with men, I feel a sense of distance between myself and them and when men flirt with me it becomes even greater to the point where it's like they're some other thing. That distance is not there when I interact with women, things are much more comfortable with them - they're just nice to be around and easy to connect with. I think I observe this distance in other people's opposite sex relationships. I want the kind of ""connection""/closeness that I feel with women with a man, but that doesn't seem to be a possibility.


I think gender roles are in the way of my obtaining oneness and complete engulfment within a relationship; masculinity and men's social concern is a wall that is preventing me from connecting with any man. It sounds strange coming out of myself because I don't fashion myself an sjw or even on the left, but the distance between men and women even when they claim to be close just doesn't seem right to me - it feels nasty and it looks unfulfilling. They say that as a result of original sin, the relationship between men and women is off. I used to think it was crap because of how it was presented as Eve's side of the punishment - as if her relationship with Adam was that important. It sounds sexist to me. But, now, it certainly feels like that could've been the case. The relationship dynamic norm seems to be totally one-sided to benefit ""straight"" men (who seem to be more homoerotic).


Keep in mind that I am a person who likes to dote, so that influences a lot what I'm about to suggest. Here I'm going to whine about examples of closeness I see lacking in an attempt to explain the gist. Why don't husbands and wives share a wardrobe - why is there this split between who wears what? Why is it that a husband is not able to groom a wife, like apply makeup and do hair, etc... and she do likewise for him? Why is it that it's seen as ""cool"", ""natural"", or just the default when it can't happen? Why is it that male stylist (or generally people who cater to women - fashion designers, etc...) are typically gay when it seems like straight men should flock to that kind of thing? Why is it that the common passtime of watching sweaty men roll around on top of each other on television or partaking in it oneself is considered regular straight man activity when it's so gay?


Why does it seem that gay men would make better partners for women than the average straight man? It seems like gay men should be straight and straight men should be gay, but for some reason, that's not the case. Does this not seem backward to anyone else? Like, unnatural? Is it cultural? Is there some kind of niche group I need to join? Am I asking for something so out of the box that I need to join a fetish group or something?

He's always serious, never jokes around, has no sense of humor, etc. Not sure if this is relevant, but he also used to beat my sisters and me. Why can't I find joy in anything? Why can't I just relax and have fun? Why is it that I never laugh at jokes? Why do people refer to me as ""cold and calculating""?     

I've taken xanax in the past and it was a miracle drug imo. My closest friends have agreed with me that whenever I take xanax, I turn into a completely normal person. I laugh, I joke, I don't take everything personally, etc. Xanax makes me normal. It corrects whatever chemical imbalance I may have.     

What can I do to fix this? How can I stop being so serious all of the time? How do I break out of this habit of misery? I suffer from severe, incurable depression. I'm sure that has something to do with it. I just want to be able to make jokes that cause my fiance to laugh. I want to be able to talk to people without having panic attacks (I have severe social anxiety as well). I'm tired of being so miserable all of the time.     

I'm 27 years old now, and I was diagnosed with severe depression when I was 12 or 13 years old. Why am I like this? Why am I so depressed? Why does suicide seem incredibly appealing to me? I'm pretty convinced that I'll never amount to anything -- that I'll never make my parents proud of me.
