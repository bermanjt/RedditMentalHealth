8,"TV, movies and a lot of story style video games are super boring to me.

People tell me I have to watch such and such show or movie. Before the intro/credits are done I'm already bored. Most shows are boring to me, I would much rather reddit or work out or play chess or pool or smoke weed or one of a million things. 

The only exception is sports. I can watch sports. I can watch certain shows occasionally. I liked Narcos. I liked seasons 1 and 2 of Bojack Horseman. I liked a couple other things. But most things I can't stand. 

It makes playing video games hard too. Games have largely become narrative. I don't care about stories. 

I like reading stuff. I read online all the time. I read math and science all the time. I can't read stories or novels though. It's too boring to me. Oddly enough, I am a math grad student and I enjoy reading math textbooks. I can't read novels though. Stories are boring to me. 

I guess I just don't care about made up stories. I don't know. It's just boring. 

Watching stuff in general is so passive. I don't have the attention for it. I like doing stuff. 

I would rather play Candy Crush than Skyrim. Candy Crush, at least I'm doing something. I don't want to explore a fictional world. I don't care.

10,"Just bought a new house and hired a general contractor to fix it up. Everything has been going smoothly until the painters show up.

I go over after work every day to service and fuel the pellet stove that heats the place.

First day after the painters were there: Garage floor is flooded. They cleaned their tools off in the garage for some reason, and sprayed water everywhere including the stack of pellet fuel in the back. Luckily, I had more dry bags.

 They also had garbage everywhere, which didn't bother me because it's a worksite and they will clean it up. What did concern me was all the empty beer cans. So they either working drunk or leaving drunk.

Day two: I have a special vacuum for cleaning ash out of the pellet stove. Lined with metal, uses screens instead of filter bags, etc. It's not where I left it, can't find it in the basement. Find it upstairs in the bathroom. They used it to vacuum up the dust from sanding joint compound. Used MY tools without asking, covered it in dirt/dust, scratches all over, fully clogged it up. They going to be replacing it eventually.

Day three, Today: They still there when I arrive which is unusual because it's so late. Walk up to house, cigarette butts fucking everywhere. Strong smell of smoke in garage but w/e it's a garage, maybe they wanted to stay out of the wind. Open door, hit with smell of smoke. They smoking in my house. FUCK. Walk in, see painter shoving 2 pitbulls out the door onto the deck and close the door. Take a second to process what the fuck is happening. These guys really thought it's a good idea to bring their dogs and let them run around my house. Decide I'm not dealing with this and come back to the house I'm currently living in.

16,"I had a relationship spectacularly fail in August and I spent the next 2 months drinking whenever I could, alone. I sobered up to go to work, I didn't want anyone to know. 

The relationship wasn't very meaningful in the grand scheme, she was using me to make her abusive ex jealous(who she got back together with and subsequently married in December). It destroyed my confidence and sent me into a spiral since I had just moved to a new city and still don't have many friends here hence the drinking alone. It wasn't just that, I've had a problem for a while but didn't see it for what it is until recently. 

I feel like my alcoholism isn't a big deal because I'm not like the typical drunk that goes out and does a bunch of bad stuff(besides drunk texting inappropriately I guess). I don't think I hurt anyone but myself with my alcoholism, and I don't think it's serious enough to warrant me going to a meeting or anything. I used alcohol to mask my anxiety and insecurities, but I ended up feeling guilty and upset at myself for drinking once I sobered up. 

Now I work out at work on my break and play video games at home but I'm lonely. When I drink I'm outgoing, talk to people, dance, whatever, but when I'm sober I get panicky when I think about even leaving the house. I just don't know how to be normal or human.

I don't know how to get over the panic I feel when I think about going to any social event and the thought of saying ""I can't drink"" makes me nauseous because it's kind of a part of the social contract of my line of work(military). I don't want to be the weird guy who won't drink or isn't fun. I didn't even go to my unit Christmas party because I was terrified of being pressured to drink and I didn't know if I was strong enough to refuse.

I'm doing well at work, I had a subordinate tell me I'm the best boss they've ever had, which really touched me. Even with that I feel like my life doesn't mean much. I have no wife, kids or anyone meaningful outside my parents and brother. 

That all said even with the disaster I feel is my life, I like being sober. It's something **I** control, no one else. **I** get to decide to not drink. At least that feels good.

I don't know what I expected by writing this, I just don't feel comfortable saying it to those close to me so I guess a bunch of internet strangers are the next best thing?",26Feb2017,399

It wasn't until I hit rock bottom and was forced to love myself that I actually learned what it meant to do so.

I’m happy Trumps our President.

 I didn’t vote for him, or Hilary for that matter… and if I’m being totally honest here, I didn’t vote for Obama or whatever shill in a coat represented the other guys. (I think he only had [""Looking Presidential""](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-debate-spin-romney-looked-presidential-the-president-did-not/2/) going for him, but I can’t recall much beyond that.) And despite (or possibly because) all his actions since taking office, I’m still glad he’s the President.

 Now hear me out, I know this isn’t a very popular view; unless you’re a part of the unwavering/blind support that certain groups show – I have my reasons, and I’ll try to list them out clearly.
	
        The Start:

 When Trump was gaining speed and momentum, I understood it – I thought it was silly, and a bad joke that went too far, but I got it. We were sick of meeting the status quo for the career politicians (who seem more alien in action and words than any of the “aliens” they debate about) and saw an end-game in the most absurd candidate: Trump. He was our flippant reply to the same ol' song and dance that happens ritualistically every four years.

I’m reluctant to admit that I too was mostly on-board with this unconventional candidate; mainly because of just that, unconventional. We were all exhausted by the same drone that steps up to the podium every election year. Saying one thing. Do another. Then lying about it when caught and apologize, just to rinse and repeat a short time later. Or worse yet, flip flopping shamelessly on topics when they either realize it didn't set well with the public, or think it serves their agenda best, OR a company paid them enough to change their minds - even Obama was more Rockstar than president. It probably didn’t help my perception that all I had read about the don as a person (in the past) indicated that he genuinely seemed like a closet good person.

He once supported, vocally, [many](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/donald-trump-2016s-most-lgbt-friendly-republican) rights he now stands in the way of [ruining](http://www.hrc.org/2016RepublicanFacts/donald-trump-opposes-nationwide-marriage-equality) and from everything I read regarding personal encounters from people of all walks of life – he seemed like a genuinely [nice guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5d8zop/serious_people_who_have_met_or_dealt_with_donald/)... But then again, most psychopath’s do. Ted Bundy was pretty charming I hear; and as recent studies show, [psychopaths make for excellent business leaders](https://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2013/04/25/the-disturbing-link-between-psychopathy-and-leadership/#415f599c4104).
        
I, for one, was personally hoping for someone to be playing the political system like a fiddle; by sliding in using whatever means necessary to take the most powerful spot in the free world and turn us upside down with actual, tangible changes we all wanted to see.

I was wrong. (Again, didn’t vote, but I’m Italian, we like to [hedge our bets](https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/oct-13-1943-italy-switches-sides-in-world-war-ii/)) Depending on what polls you except as real, over half of us were. (Excluding the diehards, but that goes with anything that can develop a group – extremists suck). And yet, I’m still happy he’s in office.
	
 So why am I happy you ask? Great question! Let's get into it:
 
 Since he’s taken up office, we’ve awoken from our pathetically complacent contentedness and are ready for the fight ahead: and so is the world. 
	
        So Far…

 We’ve watched as other countries [stepped in](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/25/netherlands-trump-gag-rule-international-safe-abortion-fund) to pick up slack when our overlord [cut funding](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/01/23/trump-reverses-abortion-related-policy-to-ban-funding-to-international-health-groups/) to International abortions – some of which won’t meet with him or [let him speak](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/donald-trump-uk-state-visit-speaker-address-parliament-a7565651.html) due to his absurd political positions. 
	
 We’ve seen the [largest](http://www.politicususa.com/2017/01/21/womens-march-biggest-protest-history-estimated-2-4-million-march.html) and one of the [most peaceful protest’s ever](http://addictinginfo.org/2017/01/22/womens-march-now-one-of-the-most-peaceful-demonstrations-in-american-history/) with the Women’s March in Jan. 2017. When he set forth the [Immigration Gag Order of 2017](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/text-of-trump-executive-order-nation-ban-refugees/), not only was there a very vocal public and international uproar, but we got to see state [Judges flex their judgement](http://crosscut.com/2017/02/seattle-judge-blocks-trumps-immigration-ban/) and (even if just temporarily) effectively neutralize it. We are fighting for our freedom and it’s exciting to me. 
     
 Hell, even at the start, [Planned Parenthood](https://secure.ppaction.org/site/Donation2;jsessionid=00000000.app20108a?df_id=23936&amp;23936.donation=form1&amp;NONCE_TOKEN=49534CC878CEADA0F5E7AD3FE6CC509A) – who very obviously stood to lose a lot of support with the new administration - received over $300K donations, about $82K of that brilliantly given in the name of the second main man in command, and avid anti [Planned Parenthood](https://secure.ppaction.org/site/Donation2;jsessionid=00000000.app20108a?df_id=23936&amp;23936.donation=form1&amp;NONCE_TOKEN=49534CC878CEADA0F5E7AD3FE6CC509A) supporter: [Mike Pence](http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/12/how-many-planned-parenthood-donations-came-from-mike-pence.html).
        
 If you're thinking this is all super uplifting, awesome and just generally too good to be true, just wait - there's more!
	
 He’s also set some wonderful precedents that can be appreciated for future use – He spent [about half the amount](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/trump-spent-about-half-of-what-clinton-did-on-his-way-to-the-presidency.html) on campaigning as the opposition; meaning it no longer has to be a Pay-to-play game – you just need the views and apparently something outrageous to say and you’ll have total media control and coverage for essentially free. This lesson will be well worth the pain and uncertainty if we can remember it next time and use it on the correct person.
       
 He's shown that a non political elite can step in and decimate the opposition. (Granted he's still has a disgusting amount of money and ties that helped get him to where he was, which certainly helped, but the precedent is set; we can get non politicians in office). He's shown that you can be loud, vocal and unwavering on issues that may not be popular and gain an immense following just for standing by that conviction, regardless of what that may be (apparently).
	
 Now, for as long as I can remember, American’s have been caught up in this almost bi-polar swing of the pendulum; with it going extremely left or extremely right every other term and no middle ground end in sight. The polarity has always been focused on red vs blue. With Trump in office, and the complete and [utter failings](http://observer.com/2016/03/the-countless-failings-of-the-dnc/) of the DNC (who’s [short comings](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/25/us/politics/debbie-wasserman-schultz-dnc-wikileaks-emails.html) would almost be [comical](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/12/top-10-hillary-clinton-scandals-exposed-wikileaks/) if this wasn’t [real life](http://nypost.com/2016/10/15/the-hillary-emails-reveal-a-life-full-of-deceit/)), who we should take a moment and thank for making us realize we are alone in this fight. That there are no powers at be in place that want to help the common individual. And now we’re angry. The polarity has shifted from Blue Vs. Red, to the People vs. Red. And we can thank Trump for that.
	

        Going Forward:

 We needed Trump. We need him to over step his bounds and remind us our fight for continuing and advancing freedom isn’t close to done, and that it’s always going to be in danger from not just foreign enemies, but domestic ones parading as our leadership.
	
 We need him to test and flex his power (and he’s going to) so that we can flex back and not only show him who really has the power, but show ourselves we’ve had it all along. And that it will always belong to the people.

 We need him to remind us we can do and will do better next time. We need this stereotypical and diabolical villain to remind us everyday there's something broken in our system, and there always has been. We we're just too complacent and comfortable enough to not complain much. 

 I'm excited to see where this all goes. I look forward to fighting along side everyone who genuinely wants a better world for all people in it and I hope you are too. This is our wake up call. We have to be more vigilant than ever before, and make the appropriate noise/reaction to new policies. And I'm happy to be doing it alongside all of you...

Now all we have to do is survive the next four years.

For generations Disney has promoted Mickey Mouse as their lovable mascot and tens of thousands have been fooled into accepting him as their cheerful overlord - however the truth about Mickey Mouse is hard to stomach: he is actually the product of a genocidal maniac intent on subjecting our children to Satan ritual abuse and worse.. the question is.. why?
The answer is not a simple one, you see there are multiple reasons for this but the easiest to understand are as follows: 

Neo-Nazism (Disney's Hidden Empire)

It is a well-established fact that the late Walt Disney was a fascist who believed that Nazism would be the next step of human evolution, however when the Nazi state fell Disney were left with a troubling new world: one in which old Walt's dream was unable to be fulfiled. However Disney found a way to smuggle a few of Nazi Germany's last remaining super-weapons and soldiers in underground bunkers, hidden deep below the current Disneyland - these secret bunkers are now Disney's stronghold for their Hidden Empire. The Hidden Empire is responsible for promoting the Nazi cause in a world that largely believes the Nazis to be a historical enemy, they utilize the public's general ignorance of the truth to slip in new and draconian laws by which to subtly increase their influence over the world. Many of Disney's animated features also show Nazi ideals such as the strong male lead, hapless damsels and so forth - in modern times the Hidden Empire has tried to diversify the Disney trade by having black protagonists and strong female leads in order to throw people off the scent of their true purpose.

New World Order (Disney's ""Utopia"" Revealed)

Closely linked to the Hidden Empire is Disney's participation in the New World Order, Disney is one of the leading figures of this underground movement and seeks to use it to create their ""utopia"". Disney's ""utopia"" is a horrific world akin to a concentration camp and indeed they have began to desensitize the world to this new regime via their theme parks - making people pay money and strapping them into ride via ""safety harnesses"" and so forth are all clear signs of preparing the population for a future of slavery and imprisonment. The mascots that frequently parade around Disneyland (along with their animated counterparts) serve as a means to soften the public to the idea of cloning and animal-experimentation: after all wouldn't we all want a real-life Goofy or Donald running around? Let's not forget the frequent larger-than-life parades in the theme parks - which would put the mass rallies of the Soviets or Nazis to shame.

Satanism and the Occult (Disney's True Mascot)

Disney has a long history of witchcraft and Satanism, due to Walt Disney striking a deal with Satanic forces to ensure the success of his original creations - this is how Walt grew to such great heights and even in death Walt's Satanic legacy continues.
The inner-circle of Disney know fine well that Satanism and witchcraft are the lifeblood of their company and have included Satanic imagery in every one of their productions - the Fairy Godmother, the Wicked Witch, the Horned King, Maleficent.. the list is endless.
It is designed to tempt our youth into practicing black magic and vile sorcery while giving off the false impression to parents that it is all harmless ""fantasy"".
The rise in pop-stars such as Jonas Bros are also a sign of Disney's Satanic links - as we all know popular music exists to mindwash our children and Jonas Bros along with countless others are a subtle way for Disney to transform our children in selfish, materialistic sex-slaves.

Genocide and War (Disney's Plan for our Children)

Disney's participation in global genocide and warfare is somewhat less known but it is a fact that during both World Wars Disney was selling their beloved characters for use as mascots of death and destruction: who can forget the image of Thumper on the A-Bomb or Donald Duck saluting Hitler?
Disney may of been playing the ""good guys"" but the truth of the matter was that they were planning on prolonging the bloodshed, a task they may well of achieved - in the modern world Disney acts more subtly and trains our children in the use of violence and intolerance via mass-propaganda and hate-speeches loving sung to ""Winnie the Pooh"". 

In the end allowing our children to watch Disney will only result in one outcome: mass genocide.

32,"I met this girl awhile back at the bars. We schmoozed and I get her number. Nothing really happens for awhile. A few texts here, a couple snaps there. One day I sent her a shirtless bathroom selfie pic and that led to a dinner date. You know, the classic slowburning Millenial courting process.    

So anywho, we go on a date. Date starts off good, then it gets great, and then it hits rock bottom. I thought I was going to have a threesome overlooking the city. Instead, I got a curt hug at the door.    

But here's where it gets good. The next day, I start texting her. What should've been a simple ""I had a great time last night"" text turned into a meticulous, analytical breakdown in social communication. I was picking every word carefully. Feeling the weight of each comma, of every period. Sounding out every possible inflection in my head. It is stressful, exasperating, and needlessly taxing.    

But I love it. Goddamn, do I love it. I haven't played this game in years. Not since with my ex. It is mental gymnastics. It's finding the perfect set of words and syntax. It keeps me sharp.    

Unfortunately, I lost this particular game today. But hey, I was rusty. And right now, in this moment, I can't say I'm feeling too upset.",26Feb2017,3
33,"Maybe calculating is not really the right term to describe myself. Maybe I'm just really indecisive. Usually, before I make a decision, I run inside my mind every possible scenario that could happen if I choose this or if I choose that. I spend more time on examining my choices. That's why I don't like pivotal options in life. The kind of choosing that you know will forever change your life. Sometimes, I let other people choose for me. That way, I can say that I'm not responsible if things go south for me. Even to relationships, this attitude of mine becomes a problem. I have never had a girlfriend and it took me 4 years before I finally confessed to my best friend that I have feelings for her. Now, there's this girl that I really like and I don't know what to do. For one, I think I bore the shit out of her. Second, I think there's someone else who also likes her and in my opinion, he's more interesting than me. Now I feel like backing out of my plans to court this girl. I know it's not really good to be self-loathing. Believe me, I'm trying not to be. And it's not really helping in my decision-making skills. But as you can see, I calculate every move. But maybe in reality, I'm just afraid of making decisions.",26Feb2017,0

Anyone know how i can find old hairstyle male posters from schwarzkopf or know of the model?  heh, thanks in advance ",26Feb2017,2
37,"I don't know if there is a better subreddit for these things, but I need to get some things off my chest. In fact, i need to get a lot off of my chest. I was doing either Opana(an opiate 3x the strength of oxycontin) every other day, and the days I wasn't on opiates I was doing xanax or cocaine. I smoked weed every day and drank 3 or 4 days out of the week as well. I'm only 20, I have very few friends. I don't really do a damn thing anymore, all I used to do was party. The partying was never really partying to begin with, I just partied with people so I could have an excuse to get completely obliterated. Had a couple wake up calls, completely ruined my chances with a girl that I really fucking liked because of my blatant insecurities and drug habits. Although she did nearly as many drugs as me, and partied even more often, she somehow had here shit together, so it seemed. Brought out a lot of insecurities I didn't even know I had. Have pretty bad anxiety which has gotten much better since I started smoking less, I haven't done opiates in a little bit over a month, same with xanax. Still smoke about every 3 days, and I still drink a little bit on the weekend. I want to socialize and make new friends, blah blah blah, but I don't think I can. I just can't think of anything other than everything I'm going through. 

I had 2 near death experiences within a week after I stopped talking to that girl, actually, she stopped talking to me. It hurt, and we didn't even know each other long, and the pain that it brought me just made feel weak, weaker than ever. Shortly after, I had two guns put to my head in a drug deal gone wrong, I got away without losing anything but it was a bit of a walk up call. A week later I took half a bar of xanax, propanalol, and 15mg of Opana- almost died. That's the last time I did an opiate. 
For a while I thought I was confident, even with my lack of friends. We'd have small parties at my house and I'd dance and make people laugh, but now no one comes over anymore. I don't talk to many people anymore, and the people I do talk to probably just chill with me because they have no one else either. We never can think of shit to do, and when we do things that normal people probably enjoy doing, it's just boring as absolute fuck to me. I don't enjoy anything anymore. 

I don't talk to anyone on a daily basis except for one of my roommates who's supposed to be a good friend of mine but he's very selfish and stuck in the same addiction, which I brought him into. My other roommate is an obnoxious little bitch, he's 5 years older than us yet he doesn't have a job, he doesn't clean shit up around the house and constantly destroys things and makes messes, he's too big of a bitch to ever say anything to us even though we notice he's bothered. He seems to have a lot of anxiety, it makes it awkward for us to confront him ourselves because of this, I don't know how he'd react. I'm very close to just socking him in his inconsiderate, passive aggressive fucking mouth. We have mice in our house and I'm doing poorly in school with all of this going on. I've began to see a therapist and she is helping a lot, but it's not enough. She is certain that I'm bipolar, which is something I've always feared. It runs in my family and my mother has it bad. I'm horrible at budgeting money and I go from manic to depressed in very rapid cycles. 

I used to love going out, talking to other people at parties, socializing in general, but now all I can think about are the stresses I'm facing. My anxiety is getting better, but I don't think I could have a personal conversation with anyone without scaring them away immediately. I don't know what I'd say to anyone as the only thing I can think about is everything wrong with my life. I barely have any family, and the family that I do have are going through very rough times themselves. The one friend that I hang out with the most, we aren't very close but we hang out on the weekends, usually just drink together and chill, smoke a little bit, but I never enjoy it. Last night he tried to find some girls for us to chill with, and I kind of dreaded doing so in fear of making an ass out of myself. I'd probably just sit there quietly, only talking on occasion if we actually did, stuck in my head. Instead we took xanax and watched a movie. I had more fun doing this than I'd had since I got somewhat sober. I don't really like smoking weed too much anymore, but I do it anyways when offered to me, which is too fucking often. I'd drop these people out of my life, but I have no one else. I have no real support. I'm not close to anyone except for a friend that is to busy living his own life as a drug dealer to spend much time with me anymore. 

I thought I had everything together, renting a nice house in the city at such a young age, having my own car, having money(which I haven't earned), but I was still depressed. I went through a lot of trauma when I was younger, on top of having terrible anxiety and depression for the majority of my life and basically raising myself since I was 9 years old. I just don't know if I can recover from it all, or I at least don't know how to do it. I care too much what other people think of me, and I don't know how to avoid it. I'm in a whole lot of pain, that seems to be endless. I'm not who I used to be two years ago, and at that time I was a hardcore drug user too. I just had a bunch of superficial friends to party with that were just as unhappy as me, which made me feel better. People my age only party, I can't meet a single fucking person that just wants to relax like I do. On top of that, I've put all this effort into my appearance as some sort of defense mechanism, so I have girls looking my way often, but I can never bring myself to approach them, because I know once they see who I really am they'll run for the fucking hills just like the last girl, and I'll be all fucked up over them again. 

I need out of all of this, I just want to be able to think positively, stop worrying, and actually learn who I really am. I want that instant gratification, but it won't come. I haven't had sex in a long time and it's destroying my confidence as well. I force myself to do things I need to do everyday, but it's not enough. Thanks for reading ",26Feb2017,24
38,"Sense of location: We were playing football (soccer) on our regular street but then this asshole resident came and made us move, as he usually does, no problem. And we moved to the perpendicular street, a 100-120 metres along it.

So when we were on our street, these two rowdy kids (age 14/15. I'm 17 for perspective) were passing by, one of them kicked the ball and was like ""Yay i scored!"", few of us started clapping sarcastically and then I immediately told my friend to give Chad (fake name, our goalkeeper) the ball and let's start. The kid who we playfully mocked was passing by me right at that moment, he must've thought i said a word which means advertisement in my language (it sounds similar to Chad's real name) = I'm insulting him in some way (figure that out yourself, I don't even know. Probably something like ""Hey this guy is such a class footballer, we should publish his name in the newspapers). Then he starts being all aggressive and shit and tries to intimidate me while his friend, the other kid, tries to calm him down since there were 8 of us and he couldn't take me 1v1 anyway since I'm bigger than both of them. I'm like ""ooh I'm so scared"" and he got pretty pissed at that (he wasn't in a playful mood I assume) and kept giving me death stares for a while, looming near our pitch. I didn't pay much attention but apparently HE kept a grudge and like half an hour later, after we've moved to the other street because of asshole resident, the kid comes with like **TWENTY FIVE OTHER ROWDY KIDS** (oldest must've been 18, average age probably 13. But they're 25 in number, so) apparently to confront me. Naturally we stop playing cause they're crossing (it's a street) and I'm trying not to even make eye contact with any of them but he and a couple others all gather around me trying to intimidate me and shit, and they're walking back and forth all over our area and doing a faux hitting action in order to scare me and stuff and I was stiff as a dude whose parents caught him watching porn. They didn't touch me or anything and I didn't show it but I was obviously fazed as fuck from the onslaught. But while leaving they apparently tried to mess with Chad (who was, again, the keeper so he was alone at the end of our small pitch) who told them to get off of our area but fortunately their oldest dude came and calmed things down soon enough, I guess he wasn't looking for trouble. And I guess they didn't do anything since one of our people was friends with the guy who wanted me dead (from the looks of it), so they backed off. This friend wasn't there when the initial conflict happened.

But the most frustrating thing was that when each of us were getting intimidated separately, everybody was just watching. Nobody even moved a bit close to us at least to make us seem a little less vulnerable or alone and less of a target for those guys. I would've gone to help out Chad but that'd be like if I was Hitler in an anti-Hitler rally telling all the protesters to ease off of the other Nazi dude. Nobody else even had the balls to try to calm things down.

TL;DR While playing football, we playfully mocked a rowdy kid, he came back with an entire army to intimidate me. Was unharmed but it shook me up a bit.",26Feb2017,2

41,"This year started out pretty rough. At first I was wanting to turn a lot of things around but a series of unlucky events left me in pretty rough territory. I had been more than usual depressed the past few weeks. 

BUT Things REALLY turned around this week! A great job opportunity has come up and and it seems to be pretty much in the bag! I've had 2 interviews that both went GREAT and it just so happens that one of my references I used actually used to own a small business with the guy doing the hiring, and she put in a great word for me! I should get the final word on it by Wednesday but I'm feeling REALLY confident about it!

and to make things even sweeter I've been  hooked up with an AWESOME apartment right near where my job is located! It's a really nice two bedroom apartment with rent for only $575 including utilities! I expected to pay way more than that in rent alone, and it's actually a really nice building! It's a sweet deal, I can't believe I got it!

SO YA! Things are just looking up! I'm FINALLY about ready to move back out of my moms house and be making money to finally break the paycheck-to-paycheck routine. What a relief! ",26Feb2017,2

43,"What if you are the worst person in the world?

“It’s an absurd question!” you protest. “I never killed anybody! I don’t steal! I even returned a wallet, went to church, and helped a duck cross the road!” A growing list of examples continuing to flood your head as if you’ve grasped the point of the question. The worst person in the world could have simply done one less good thing than you by your math and method. We’ll let aside how we’d disagree about your church attendance, and refrain from speculating if the duck you helped was a cousin of the one you ordered at a fancy restaurant.

In order for the question to make sense, as we reflexively take for granted does or doesn’t happen based on how we feel about it, we’d have to agree on what a person was. We’d have to try and do a moral calculus that spoke to perceived goods and bads and multipliers given specific acts. Then we would proceed to imagine the consequences of being the worst person and if they even mattered. It’s because I ask the question about myself I bother to ask it of you. It’s my brazen acceptance of its premise that makes me wonder how you’d rationalize accepting or rejecting it.

I’m, of course, the worst person in the world because I “waste my potential.” When I could be learning, often I’m not. When I could be helping, I’m happier to pass along the article or, maybe...maybe click a donate button. I can argue away the value of my contributions as easily as it suits me to justify time on my ass or time sacrificed in services to exploitative ends. I’ve broken people’s trust, including my own. I’ve lied with the fluidity of the most pathological. I’ve charged headlong into the most petty and immature woods to provoke police responses and maybe soon a judge’s as well.

In my imagination, the worst person in the world is a standing betrayal to what they presume to know. For as long as I can remember, I’ve thought of myself as something special. Hardly thinking I was born that way, I’ve merely received “extra” attention or “different” comments regarding my behavior. I speak wrong. I take too much pride in how I allocate my time, somehow without irony if you read the last paragraph. I assert almost daily, now that Byron is vegan, that I’d absolutely shoot a cow in the head or cut off a chicken’s in order to own my complicity. My murderous soul placated with a layer of layer of cheese and side of fries. And while I’ll never claim jokes are necessarily malicious, I rarely hold any regard for how they make you feel.

I’m a sex maniac! I can use someone like an object and feel nothing but the ingratiation of a special meal. Hell, the meal might even register as better. I spit in the eye of even the most humble of your gods. I litter the temple of my body with sugar and alcohol and let my muscles atrophy as I wait around in front of the television until the next party. I viciously attack my microbiome with products that soften my hair and dry out my skin. I pick and dig at every bump on my skin until I look like a child who had parents that put cigarettes out on him.

Petty, superficial, judgmental, animal-killer, non-believer, tactless, self-harming, dishonest, lazy sociopath. “What a mouthful,” she said. It’s a wonder what I’m even doing here were I not a hopeless despot on top of it all happy to call myself an accident of naive self-indulgence. What a depraved and black ego it must take to prop up that mess of horrifying circumstance and derive any sense of worth or responsibility. Whatever you want to make of life, it certainly dictated my cancerous malaise traveling through the bowels of existence eager to be excreted into oblivion.

There’s a but coming, right? We’ve been playing a game with a theoretical question. Well, the question exists, but every answer can only be inferred or inductively reasoned to conclude I am indeed the worst person in the world. Do I need to know everyone or what they’ve done or think of themselves in order to falsify the conclusion? Do we have to agree on a dozen moral premises for you to trust my assessment? Asking too many questions would be to miss the point, because I am the worst person in the world.

But what if you were instead? Would you contact me and brag or insist I add one more adjective to outpace you? Should we start a club and sew .000000001%-er patches on our jackets and explain that we’re not super rich, but part of an even more elite club? Maybe we could get together and trade pills to help us cope with our subconscious that always seems to betray the braggadocio of elucidating such fine details of our positions in the hierarchy. I got it! Suicide pact in the spirit of the last and ultimate act of defiant irony, ridding the world of our cosmic stain in the bedrock moral act that shifts the universe back to a new positive trending energy. I can see the headlines, “Worst People in the World Save Humanity!”

I suppose the question would be easier if I even knew what it meant to be human. “OH THE HUMANITY!” is constantly thrust in front of our faces. Resilient! In the face of endless, historically insisted upon, oppression and exploitation. Violent! In defense of its ideology and resources. Depressed and anxious! If surveys and pill sales are to be believed. Loving! Per dose of Hollywood or artistic cliche. Idiotic! From the vaunted mouths of pop stars, athletic babes, and leaders of superpowers sans heroics. 

It seems to me we’ve done next to nothing in figuring out how to agree on what it means to be a person. Sure, *philosophers yada yada* and *science says you’re 50-65% water blah-didly-blah*. What’s a philosopher’s words in a language we can’t understand? What makes us water worth drinking? We stopped standing with Standing Rock. We’re flooding Florida and islands only VICE seems able to discover. We’re drowning in debt. Wave after wave of lies come from our highest offices and representatives. Awash in celebrity culture we wipe away the basis from which to form a fundamental opinion of who we are, in spite or relation, and whether we’re the worst person in the world.

So are you? A person, that is. Because we have a lot of work to do on getting to which of us is the worst.

So now that you know that time passes and that every two or three seconds that pass on say a videogame or the internet could have been spent reading a line of interesting text, the important part is to not freak out.
Baby steps. Set up one actionable goal that will take you from an uneducated and unemployed point to somewhere where you will either be educated or employed.
The fastest path is straight, one line going north. That is your north now, even if you have no desire or passion to study or work; that will have to do. Because only when you are constantly producing one thing will you realize that you want to do others.


The important part is that with this commitment you must make sacrifices. This is the sucky part. It is hard and it is painful. Anything that can be considered a vice must be removed, you know what yours are.
Humans aren't good multitaskers, this is scientifically proven. At first you will have rushes of motivation that will dissappear with time, you must rely on your force of will and discipline to really focus and concentrate on what's really important. Your sense of direction.


By knowing your faults, you know how to manage your physical or mental health problems, addictions and self control. Take for example a new comer at the gym, the best way to start is to just go and feel out what it is like. To know your body's limits and what it is capable of. Then, you can focus on the smaller but nevertheless important details of working out (diet, form, exercises).
__________
I was also bullied, and anxiety still makes my hands shake and sweat. When I was in university, I was a loner. But I focused on only one thing. You will see that people in the working world value you for what you can offer. As a human being, you have a value. This value is simply what skills or knowledge you have. You might be invaluable to some and valuable to others, it all depends on what it is you want to do.
This value humans have, is how the world works and always has. NEETs are not valuable to society, they produce nothing and simply contribute to the economy by purchasing power.
______________
It is never too late to start, in fact, I am sure that some years ago you might have thought that it was too late. Imagine if you would have started back then. All you have to do is take initiative, actions have reactions. Pace yourself, push yourself. Pay attention to valuable things, negative thoughts have value too but only to come to logical conclusions.
Remember that emotions have a great influence on your actions, they interfere with logical reasoning of your brain. negative thoughts might be realistic at times and logical conclusions can be drawn from them, learn from thought process or experience. Many great men tried to reduce the amount of decisions they had in the day, in order to really pay attention to what is truly important. Distractions are everywhere, on your phone, on the radio, tv, computer, social media, even other people can make you feel bad or worse by comparison.
Remember that you are by yourself in your quest for purpose.

57,"Dear Users of /r/SandersForPresident (and /r/Political_Revolution),

Ever since the primaries, I have defended your claim that the primaries were rigged against Bernie. However, in order to prevent a Trump presidency, I had to vote for Clinton. Obviously, Trump won due primarily to the Democratic Party nominating a candidate that nobody liked. As of yesterday (2/26), Tom Perez became the new DNC chairman, with Keith Ellison becoming Deputy Chair. While I would've preferred Ellison, Perez was my second choice, so I'm happy either way. However, you all think that because Perez is DNC chairman, that the DNC hasn't learned from its mistakes and that it's better to abandon it. I'm sorry, but I can't defend that. At this point, in order to prevent another four years of Trump, it is better to unite under the Democratic Party and work together. This bickering and bitching won't help anyone. You will instead hurt the chances of someone defeating Trump. And in 2020, it won't be the candidate that will be blamed, it will be you all, for deciding to abandon the party. In conclusion, stay in the Democratic Party and fight for progress, work with the moderates and defeat Trump in 2020. If you don't, well, enjoy four more years of Trump. As said before, ""United We Stand.""
