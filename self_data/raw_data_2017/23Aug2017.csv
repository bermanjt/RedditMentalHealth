0,"Today was the first day and I didn't connect with anybody. I just moved to a new county (not country) and I have almost no friends here. How do I meet new people? I'm a little bit awkward around strangers, so I don't know what to do. I want to make some good friends. The whole day I just kept my chest up and looked busy but I knew I looked like another one of those nerds with no friends. I want to change that. Any pointers for better social skills?",23Aug2017,2

2,"At the end of last fall, I was put on academic suspension. I was accepted back in back in May or June. I filled out my fafsa application right after. At first I worried they weren't going to give me any aid but they ended up giving me my award. For about two months, but on August 16, 2017 they just took it away without even notifying me. I was supposed to be rewarded 18,900 and 6000 of that was a grant which I probably won't even get back now even if I do win an appeal. Idk if this helps my case but I'm now 26 with no mom and my dad just lost his battle with cancer on August 9, 2017. Any help would be appreciated. ",23Aug2017,3
3,"I can never have a good thread or a good friend around when I need them.  I hope this isn't breaking any rules, I'm kind of in a vulnerable place right now and more than a little panicky.

I met my girlfriend at work in January. I had no idea her age, so I didn't intentionally seek out a younger woman. I just fell for her, and at that point I just couldn't stop. I transferred offices, so we don't work together anymore and we live an hour away now. In some cases... that could be good. Read on.

She's more than I ever thought I could have. She's cute, smart, hard-working and funny. She really does check all the boxes I have for a perfect partner. When I think about the future, she's in it. Hell, I'd marry her tomorrow if I thought she'd agree to it.

I've had two major relationships prior. One with someone I lived with for about three years, and another I dated for three months. I was single for years, out of a huge clusterfuck around my 30th with cancer, depression, unemployment... just a whole lot of flaming dinosaur shit.

Frankly, I've got my own issues. Still battling depression, anxiety, stress. I've got low self-esteem, as well. Every day I'm amazed what she sees in me. I was seeing a shrink for a while, but quit because it was costing me $330 a month, even with a ""discounted"" rate.

Anyway, things were going fine, I thought, until sometime around July (the weekend Spider-Man came out. Sorry, Petey). I had started getting these ""vibes"" since the previous week. Just a gut feeling something was a bit off. That week I didn't really see her during the work week like I used to. That weekend, things were okay until Sunday night. She was trying to get me drunk so I'd sleep over Sunday night (I was thinking of heading home to wait out the bad vibes I guess) so she herself was drinking a bit. She had gotten quiet, and was looking at her phone a lot. I asked her what she was thinking, and she said ""break up.""

That hit me like a punch from Invisible 1989 Mike Tyson. I said I needed some air and went for a walk. She chased me down, we talked through our issues and recommitted to each other. It was our first big ""fight"" (although no one was screaming or angry, just sad). 

Since then, I've been a little afraid of her. I feel a bit tense when I'm with her, like almost inwardly flinching. Nevertheless, we've gone to a vacation overseas and also visited her family in her hometown since then.

The overseas trip resulted in a couple more fights. While our fight before was about, frankly, some bedroom issues we were having, this fight was about my general unpreparedness and lackadaisical nature. We got to the airport later than she had wanted (first fight) and I didn't research our hotel's location or do any reading on where we went (second and third fights). I cop to not really being a leader, I let her make most of the plans and I paid for everything. Honestly, I was just trying to get through the work week and our vacation was put together last minute anyway.

Again, we worked through them and the week from that vacation (tail end of July) through our trip to see her parents (ten days ago) had been like a new honeymoon period for us. Super-affectionate, how lucky she feels, how loved she feels, I fell even harder for her. I didn't realize that was possible, but I was.

Her sister came to visit last weekend, and so she spent most of it with her. I still, however, feel tense with her, and I do like some alone time occasionally as an introvert so I spent the weekend at my place. I told her I'd come visit her Wednesday night. Yesterday (Tuesday) morning we were talking on the phone and she asked ""do we click?"" She's asked this or doubted this before, when she's upset. This time, she wasn't. I told her I didn't want to click with anyone else, and she said she felt the same. Last night (Tuesday night here) she seemed a bit quiet and restless at points. She started saying ""I don't know, sometimes I feel..."" and then trailing off. I reassured her I loved her and the best was yet to come, and then begged off the phone for sleep (even though she didn't want me to get off the phone. I guess to continue to make me feel incredibly anxious???)

I'm supposed to visit her tonight and I'm terrified of what to do. I don't want to be stuck in her apartment as we break-up, then take an hour bus back to mine and get through another day of a job I've come to hate. But maybe some of her doubts come from her own subconscious picking up my own tense reluctance or ""vibes?"" Things had been going so well, I think my gut or guilt or God was telling me that it couldn't last forever.

Words cannot describe how I feel around her. I really felt, at long last, I had met my special someone. She utterly has me wrapped around her finger (and yes, I know how unhealthy that is emotionally). Before I met her, I was working out, reading more, and generally preparing for my next phase in life. But, I also had more friends locally (I work in another country for now. I get to leave around Thanksgiving. The plan was to return after a break and take my girlfriend with me back to my home country for good). If we break up, it's gonna be rough. I'm not just gonna be able to go back to watching Netflix and being a little happy introvert. I've now spent the better part of 2017 with her every weekend. She's become a part of my life now. It would be tempting (and financially foolish) to quit my contract early and head home to just forget, even though I really don't have anything to head home too, depressingly enough.

But, I'm also kind of naive, and emotional, in life and in relationships. Is there a point where everyone has doubts? Is she just expressing them in a healthy manner? Don't relationships have rough spots on occasion? Some people have off and on relationships, right? We all remember Ross and Rachel, Nick and Jess and the Katy Perry song ""Hot and Cold,"" right?

I don't want to lie to myself, but I also don't want to necessarily be a self-fulfilling neurotic prophet.

6,"I'm 14. I want to build an off-grid tiny house but i dont have the materials or the location to make it. I don't have a garden or backyard, but in about a year's time i will (im moving from a rented house). does anyone have any ideas for something like this i could do?

7,"Im very nervous person. I thought this was a minimal problem that only affected me, but I've come to realize it also affects people around me (especially my husband).

These are a few things I tend to do:

- Wake up in the middle of the night just to check if my husband is breathing. 

-Before going to bed I need to check at least twice if the stove and fan is off.

-Also always checking if my front door is locked.

-Every time my husband is practicing a spot in afraid he might get hurt. Tob the point he feels embarrassed because he feels I over protect him. 

-I wash my hands pretty often at my house and ask my husband to do so.

-I get so worried every time any loved one is traveling. 

Growing up I wasn't like this. I believe I started changing since 7 years ago. When I lost my boyfriend at the time on a car accident. 

I never really have talked to a psychologist. I'm not sure if I want to.  Is there a way I could possibly do something better myself?

9,"Ever have a fly stuck in your room for the night? It's infuriating. Old ones are so emphatically loud, too. There's one fly that has been in the household for the past week, and it's pissed.

It was at this point that I considered ""Y'know what? Fuck laundry! I'm not dealing with this cunt at 9:00 after sundown."" so I didn't, and I was happy. Fuck flies.

10,"... you're here, and as long as you don't off yourself, and nothing else goes wrong, you'll still be here.  Everything is shades of unlikely, so you have to assume some possibility of lasting a while, at least.  And if that's the case, you've got time to do things, within the bounds of your baseline requirements; you also have the choice: what are you willing to be bad at, and toward what are you willing to put in the effort of pursuing some level of skill?

Sweet dreams. :)

18,"I feel like there is frustration going on everywhere I look, and it seems that a lot of people are having a difficult time dealing with the happiness of others. Why can't people just chill more, and let people do what they want (as long as it doesn't concern others ofc). 

What kind of drug is your brain releasing when you're standing outside of McDonalds calling people murderers. What do you gain when you talk about how shitty someone else is, without any intention of figuring out why they are shitty, and how to make them less shitty (FACT: Most people don't intend to be shitty, they are usualy just a product of an earlier generation of shittyness).

I doubt I'm the only one who doesn't feel any better just by thinking about someone elses missery. What kind of fucked up feature is this and what do we gain from it?",23Aug2017,12

If so; which one is it, and why does it speak to you?

28,"Hello, 26 y/o F, North America, white, healthy other than an appendectomy 7 years ago and taking Buspar for anxiety.

The past two days, I have woken up in the morning to find myself covered in bug bites. They look like mosquito bites, no oozing or any significant swelling. I was worried about bed bugs, but they don't follow the bed bug bite pattern (several in a row, mostly on skin exposed during the night, blood spots on the sheets).

All of my bug bites, except for one, are on my legs, which are always covered when I sleep with yoga pants. The highest ones are on my inner thigh, up near my crotch, but not on my groin. I have about 10 of them covering my legs, and I have a single one on my arm. It's not a rash; these are individual bites.

They remind me a lot of flea bites that I used to get when I lived in a house with cats, but we have no pets here. I thought maybe someone brought them in from school (I'm a teacher), but I'm ONLY getting bit at night while I'm sleeping, never at work. Also, my SO and I share a same bed, but I'm the only one that wakes up with bites.

The weird thing is that they stop itching soon after I notice them, and they heal relatively quickly. For instance, the one on my arm from this morning is already nearly gone.

I clean my house twice a week, and wash the sheets regularly. I'm not sure what this could be.

Thoughts?

30,"I'm not really sure what my ultimate goal here is, but I feel like I need to write it. My entire life I've refused to drink for any reason. I remember in middle school telling my friend I would never drink. The underlying reasoning has changed over the years, but usually I think the core of it has been: I don't want to. Just flat out, it's not something I've ever desired to do. I think partially I've been around it enough in my own family and I'm just over it. Social pressure I guess doesn't effect me in this area, and the friends I've made have always been accepting of it.

But emotionally I haven't been doing great lately, and it's made me do a lot of introspection. I'm connecting with those around me significantly less than I used to, I feel. And part of it is definitely changing life circumstances, but.... I dunno it just feels different. I try to get out and do things I'm interested in, but it seems like no matter what I end up doing them alone. I've always felt very out of place at bars and clubs, so I tend to avoid those, social mixers the same thing. I get a distinct feeling of not belonging in the group of people around me, no matter what I'm doing.

Sometimes I wonder how things would be different if I had started to drink with the rest of my friends in high school. Sometimes I wonder what would happen if I were to start now. I could very easily see it turning into a problem. I've already dealt with some other negative habits (and am still dealing with them), I know I'm prone to them. Maybe I just end up a well rounded person who can drink socially as a means to connecting with people. Maybe I can _only_ connect with people when drinking. Maybe I can't even do that, but I keep trying regardless. Maybe that just ends up with me drinking at times when I shouldn't because it's the only way I think I can be ""normal"".

I guess the TLDR is that I'm terrified of alcohol, and part of me thinks that fear is totally rational, and another part thinks maybe I should just say fuck it cause it's not like I'm super happy with my life right now anyway.
