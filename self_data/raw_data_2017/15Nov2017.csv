2,"I’ve been friends with this girl for over a year now. I’d say we became good friends like half a year ago and in the last couple of months we have basically been inseparable. Like to the point we hang out most days and if we’re not together we are probably messaging each other. The usual story has developed; I started having a thing for her, she has a boyfriend. I try to ignore how I feel so we can keep being friends but the more we hang out the more I like her. Such a cliché.

Anyway, while things have occasionally been very lightly flirty between us, in the last few weeks or so it’s really ramped up. Now I’m never gonna make a move on another guy’s girlfriend, and I don’t plan on letting this escalate to anything beyond flirting while she’s in a relationship regardless of how much I like her, but I feel like some of this is just too heavy handed to be completely innocent.

- On two occasions when she knows I’ve been drunk she’s messaged me asking if I like anybody and if anyone’s caught my eye, and other kind of shit along those lines like what type of girl I’m into. I’ve always just dodged the question or whatever, but I feel like she knows what the real reply is and wants to hear it from my mouth or whatever, and thinks I’m more likely to slip up when I’m not sober.
- It seems like we always have this kind of faux-relationship joke going on. Like she’ll kind of jokingly say ‘I can’t live without you please never leave me’ as if we’re some over dramatic couple. I just play along cause it’s just a joke but it’s happening more and more often. It’s like we’re flirting with the idea without actually going there if that makes sense.
- We were talking the other day about how she teases her boyfriend about whether he likes his close female friends. She told me he does the same to her (this definitely means me but I never said it out loud). I said that’s a healthy way to deal with it though and that even if there is a hint of truth there, it’s healthier than getting jealous. She agreed with me. Things were a little awkward after that for about 10 minutes, as if we had both said too much.
- I feel like she’s always comparing me to her boyfriend and vice versa. Like for instance her boyfriend once told her he wants a tattoo. She isn’t a fan of the idea, and she went and asked me if I have any, explaining the whole thing and that she isn’t really into them.
- It seems like we talk about sex a lot more. Maybe that’s just a sign we’re comfortable with each other, but I know like how many times she’s been laid and whatever else, and it gets brought up a hell of a lot. One day she even jokingly bragged to me that she’s a good lay. She instantly said she’s joking and I teased her saying that must means she’s bad then, but she replied that she is actually good but she just shouldn’t be telling me.
- We had a conversation about having sex with prostitutes and I said that I don’t think I’d ever do it cause I’d prefer if I actually had feelings for the person I’m sleeping with. She replied that she feels the exact same and that she’d never been so impressed by someone having the same attitude or whatever.
- She joked that I need to get laid, but went on to say seriously that she doesn’t see why I’m not in a relationship and that she wants to see me get a girlfriend.
- This is a bit of a weird one; she offered to give me a single friend’s of her’s snapchat to try set me up. I just refused and said I’d rather let something happen naturally than force it, and then we went on to have a big long conversation about relationships/sex again. I feel like she was just testing me to see how I’d react to dating someone else, like if she knows how I feel she knows I wouldn’t say yes to a date with her friend.

Those are specific examples I can think up, but just in general the last couple of weeks there’s been a whole lot more of that kind of talk between us. I know that’s natural between close friends, but I just feel like there’s more to it here than we’re both letting on. Like I said, I’d never make a move on her while she’s in a relationship, I just want to know what’s going through her head and whether I’m insane for thinking things through this much.

3,"My only work experience is working for 3 years as a personal trainer and group exercise instructor, and then 2 months as a Coding Instructor at a camp.

I’ve been applying like crazy everywhere. I can’t get a retail job because everywhere wants retail experience. I can’t work in a gym anymore because all of my certifications are expired and I don’t have the money to keep them current.

I’m a really good people person and get along with people really well. Whenever I’ve gone in person to apply, they always let me know that they want someone with retail experience. I usually do really well in interviews except now I haven’t even got a call back from anywhere.

I’ve even taken off my most recent job as a Coding Instructor because I don’t want places to think that I’m going to leave in the summer to do that job again. My student loans did not give me much because my tuition is really high and the maximum aid I can get was not much higher than my tuition.

I’m going to be totally broke soon and I don’t know what to do. ",15Nov2017,10

5,"Even if it wasn't that major, I always cringe at stuff I have said or done, or both. Things that aren't relevant anymore, everything. And I'm pretty sure that a group of people at my school hate me and I always worry about it.

8,"So, about 8 years ago, my dad was fresh out of a liver transplant and a trip through rehab for his alcoholism. Prior to that, his hobbies included laying on the couch, watching Discovery/Travel/Food Network stuff, and drinking until his eyes turned yellow over the course of a few months. Still somehow made it to work in the morning and did a good job, until his liver just about gave out.

When he got back home, he was a new man. Lost something like 150 pounds, had energy, remembered his promises, spoke coherently. His new fiance still liked to drink and knew of my dad's situation, but they decided it was okay and he would be strong and stay sober.

The doctor's words were ""If you so much as touch another drop of alcohol, there isn't a doctor in this country that will help you.""

The enabler, harpy of a fiance made sure that turned into wine at parties for special occasions. Which turned into beer, occasionally. Which turned into ""Vodka doesn't count if you mix it with Gatorade,"" not even three months removed from rehab and he still had a body not totally happy with having a stranger's liver in it.

So apparently it's not totally uncommon for transplant patients to experience hallucinations. I know nothing but can only assume taking your anti-rejection meds with alcohol spurred this on for him, as I have no other explanation.

One day, he was just suddenly convinced that his college buddy that worked at Discovery and crewed for Bourdain decided to swing by and ask about a backwoods barbecue place that he'd heard of about 30 miles outside of Selma, Alabama, near where our family has some lumber/hunting land. Fat Rat's is what people called it, and according to my folks' stories, they had an 8 track player and only one Hootie and the Blowfish cassette, which only stopped when the dude was beating his wife. Bourdain wanted to hit that shithole between Memphis and South Carolina.

And, apparently, my dad was happy to let Bourdain's crew take my little brother, 12 at the time, on a 6-hour car ride to the middle of gaht-damn nowhere in Alabama on his own, with no family supervision, because he knew the way.

He was so convinced of this, he convinced my uncle and grandparents, too. I told them it couldn't have happened because it was our mom's weekend to have us and I was dismissed, outright. 

Noone saw this as bizarre, or as the red flag of rejection that it was. My dad kept drinking, and about a month after it caught up to him and his new liver gave up. I still have issues trusting my family. Nowadays my uncle calls it a prank.",15Nov2017,2

I have been a sporadic recreational drinker for a few years now and earlier this year I drank some rum and I felt sick. It wasn’t enough to get me drunk or even buzzed, but I got a stomach ache. Since then I’ve drank different liquors and rum again and this keeps happening. To the contrary, there have also been times where it had so effect of my stomach at all. This seems to be unique to liquor so not beer or wine. Just wondering if anyone has any answers or can point me in the right direction. Thanks! ",15Nov2017,1
14,"This really isn't a super patriarchal thing, it's just that my kids need to share my surname because it is important to me that my name does not die with me.

15,"From a mathematical perspective, after the 2008 financial crisis alone, you would think one disgruntled person out of 300 something million would want revenge on the people causing untold suffering to the nation and world with their parasitic greed.

Or in the current debate over ""tax reform"", the GOP is literally trying to kill thousands of Americans by cutting their healthcare to give more money to hedge fund donors.

The point being, over the years there has been sufficient justification for some people (at least as much as for any number of other mass shootings), and surely there is not a shortage of people on the planet or in America who really want to shoot up Wall Street.

Yet it hasn't happened. So why is that?

They want to make paying them as attractive as possible, so they take normal unlock times, times them by 10, and then say ""Hey, we'll give you a paid shortcut.""

39,"When I was 7 years old I was sexually assaulted by 5 men in my basement multiple times. My parents allowed this to happen, and it screwed me up really badly. Child services got involved with my family a couple times, but nothing ever happened because there was 'no evidence' of this happening.

Even though both me and my older sister have been saying for years that it happened, no one ever believes us. And that's the hardest part about all of this. How am I supposed to get over this, if I can't talk to anyone about it?

All I want is to scream to the world just how much pain I'm in, but I can't. So I don't. I don't want people to accuse me of lying about this anymore. It just hurts too much.

My mind is constantly taking me back to those nights when I was dragged out of bed, tied up in my basement, and assaulted. It's as if part of myself is still trapped in that basement, and always will be.

They made me feel like sex was wrong.
--------------------------
I had sex for the first time last November. She came on to me, and it just sort of happened. I've been scared of sex for years, and come to find out - it's one of the most beautiful things I've ever experienced.

The only example of a relationship I ever saw was my parents terrible marriage. Waking up to fighting in the middle of the night, physical violence towards one another, etc. So I just assumed that's what relationships were like. But now...

I feel lied to!

Real relationships aren't like like that! I feel like a fool. I feel lied to! I feel like life has CHEATED ME out of something that is wonderful.

Genuine human connection is what life is really about it and I never saw that until now. Ever since last November, that's all I've wanted. It was so beautiful... but I learned pretty quickly that it doesn't just happen. Men have to initiate it.


BUT I JUST CAN'T!

Every time I try. It's so anxiety inducing that I nearly have a panic attack. Every time I try - I'm brought back to that basement, and I feel like the men who assaulted me are watching me.

That's the reason why I've never had a girlfriend, been in any sort of romantic relationship at all, learned how to hit on woman or learned how initiate sexual contact. There watching me, and I can never shake that feeling.

I feel as if they're always watching me. No matter where I go, no matter what I do. They're watching my every move, everything I do. Everywhere I go. I feel watched.

So I'm high all the time.

That's the only way I can get any sort of distance between me and them. It doesn't matter what drug it is. Weed, coke, molly, pills. It doesn't matter. As long as I'm out of my mind - they're not there.
But none of this is really me. I don't even know what it really means to be myself. The scraps of who I want to be are soaked in the hopes of one day being confident and knowing who I am. Soaked in hopes of being sure of myself.

But until the day comes when I can finally be myself; I'll be trapped in that dark, cold, basement. With nothing but the hope, of one day, seeing the light.",15Nov2017,98
