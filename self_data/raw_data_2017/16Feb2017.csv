13,"TLDR; I've been in love with my best friend for the past 4 years, but missed my opportunities to be with her and lost her twice.

I've known my friend (Katelyn) now for almost over 4 years.
When I met her she was a really shy and closed off individual, she still kind of is.
It all started with me just thinking she was cute then talking and getting to know her. Since I met her I became infatuated with her. She was on my mind nearly all day everytime. I'd sometimes even skip out on hanging with friends to just talk to her. 

I really liked her and decided to shoot my shot (I asked her out.) she explained to me that she really liked me but she couldn't because she lived with her parents and they were down her neck about dating and possibly wouldnt be able to talk to me if she got caught. So whatever, right? I understood, but my feelings for her kinda always lingered, even when I decided to move on and see other people.

I introduced my good friend to her about a year after knowing her. (Quite possibly my biggest regret, while somehow being the best thing to ever happen to me)

They got along together and we all hung out often, nearly all the time. I had a girlfriend when I introduced them, which soon after, ended. 

So, time flies and the 3 of us have been hanging out with eachother for a year at this point. She lost her feelings for me and gained feelings for my friend. This sucked HUGE DONKEY BALLS for me because at this time I was rediscovering my feelings for her. But it was too late, they were together. 

They stayed together for about a year, and during that year I never felt bitterness towards either of them. (Im actually still best friends with both of them.) 

I tried to date other people in that timespan, all while still having feelings for Katelyn. But I couldn't love any of them as much as I love her. 

Katelyn and him broke up, pretty badly. It didnt end well at all. I was there for her and I comforted her and a few months after(now summer 2016), she made it clear to me she had feelings for me but didn't want a relationship just yet. I told her how I felt and what came out of it was a friends with benefits type ordeal.

I thought after this, that it was finally gonna happen, and I'd get what I had been waiting for for the past 4 years.

I had to leave state right before she started school again, but I would be visiting frequently until I could move back next June. 

She started school and she met another dude and got really close with him. She stopped being lustful with me slowly over text. The before and after shower pictures slowly came to a hault, along with the booty pics. 

She met him 4 months ago and they're in a relationship now. She's still my best friend but I don't think I've ever been so heartbroken before. 

Ive talked to her about this and she told me she has strong feelings for me still but that she also really likes this guy.

I know Ive done it before, so I could do it again. And I can be happy long as I know she's happy. 
But it sucks losing someone you care about and love so much to someone else. 

I just wish she could be happy with me.

As crazy as it sounds, somehow I just know this is the girl that I want to spend the rest of my life with.

Life just has it's shitty timings and I hope I get another chance to be with her and see if it can all work out.",16Feb2017,9

24,"Ever since 4 years ago I fell into depression, I found out that I find life very boring and uninteresting and that I can't connect with people.

I feel trapped, constricted in a sense. I wanted out of it all. I got better and I got out more and more. I am glad I did and met some awesome people, but here I am 4 years into the future and still nothing. I still find people incredibly distant and find life mudane, boring and predictable. Its not like I don't go out, I do. I socialize a lot and meet new people everyday but despite all of that I just find myself in a sense lost. Why do I find myself feeling so out of touch. Like trapped in a glass box where I can only see and not touch. I can't feel the warmth and even if I tell myself I am happy and laugh its very fleeting to the point later on the day I just feel empty.

Life is not a fairytale I know. There are no dragons or princesses to be saved. At the end of the day you are human and life is just that: normal, but don't you wish it wasn't? Sometimes I really do, because atleast then I know it ends in peace or I know that things are fine. Growing up with parents that could divorce at any time, money being a major issue and people always being distant from me cause I am not really like them. I know how bad things can get. I drown myself in things to do just not to think.

Sometimes don't you just wish magic was real? That your prince/princess is waiting for you? That maybe just maybe a portal will open up and take you to a place where you feel like you belong there? but thats not ever going to happen and that sucks.

I want to feel colors and see warmth (yes I know what I said). I want the world to be painted in pink and want to feel like I can CONNECT. I want to connect. I want the puzzle pieces to fit. I just want somebody to show me that I am and that my life will get better.

That's fine if you want to live that way, but it's no longer for me. Back in college I was the same way, lots of alcohol between study sessions and work. But now, nearly three years after graduation, I feel like that phase has come and gone. I still go out, but not nearly as much.

37,"Have you heard of the 10% rule? Says only about 10% of people actually participate in social media, the other 90% just watch. Why is this relevant? Well it makes the internet an easy platform to game. There is monetary incentive for companies to use web crawlers to monitor what people are saying about them and to control their public image using bots and shill accounts. 

Monsanto did this a lot a few years ago when people started to question their business practices. Not only would you get downvoted for saying anything negative about Monsanto, but you would get called an idiot conspiracy theorist too (and many other not so nice things). That way anyone who questions monsanto will automatically be lumped in with anti-GMO and anti-Vax nut jobs. Monsanto doesn't seem to be nearly as active as they once were.  Lot's of companies do similar things especially Microsoft. And to be clear, these companies don't have shilling departments themselves, they outsource to third parties (the way the Clinton campaign used Correct the Record). 

The same thing is happening now with BLM/SJW culture vs alt-right culture, except instead of controlling their public image, they're attempting to shape the social and political narrative. And it's not just them, lots of organizations are competing to control the narrative. BLM mostly consists of ""useful idiots"" -- people who have no idea what they're fighting for but just want to latch onto a cause. government organizations (NSA, KGB, Etc..) are also attempting to shape the narrative. Oh and we can't forget organizations like ISIS too. 

The worst part is, many of the elites are in on it, they know it's happening. they know the things we see on social media/the internet are all being controlled by competing organizations and aren't organic, yet they ignore it because they are hoping that the narrative they are pushing will win out. 

Russian spy organizations and American spy organizations (and spy organizations from every other country) are able to use bots and sock-puppets, but also hack into peoples digital lives and steal personal information used to black mail them. Most of our politicians are idiots who don't understand technology, they're sitting ducks. Politicians, celebrities, leaders of BLM, etc, are all vulnerable  to being blackmailed and doing someone elses bidding, especially in the days of the internet. 

Our security organizations aren't security organizations, they don't keep us secure, they keep us insecure so that we can be hacked and blackmailed. 

Most race relations in the US are the result of Russian interference:

- Russia uses state sponsored shilling to game and control social media like Reddit and 4chan. They do this to try to control the political and social narrative to create a culture of unrest. They are responsible for the ""SJW"" authoritarian culture that the alt right complains about and they are responsible for stirring up the alt-right by exposing them to anti-white media.

- It's not just paid shills by Russia, the US and many other nations (UK, Germany, China, Israel, ""Five-eyes"", and many more), organizations (Microsoft, Apple, ISIS, Monsanto, Big Oil, etc), and individuals (trolls, idiots, crazy people).

- There are also some people being manipulated into believing that there is widespread hatred of white culture by non-whites and non-white culture by whites, these people further exacerbate the problem and are what's known as ""useful idiots"".

- The emergence of so called ""socialist"" sub-reddits is the result of anti-western forces likely being controlled by Russia to cause people to lose faith in capitalism and vote for more monolithic social programs or get rid of the American business culture altogether.

- There is a world wide cyber war happening right this minute as you read this, it's been ongoing for some time, and it's about to get ramped up.

- The goal of Russia is to de-stabilize the west and especially the US

**BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF ORGANIZATIONS COMPETING TO CONTROL THE NARRATIVE AND NOTHING ON THE INTERNET REPRESENTS THE WAY THE 90% OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T POST AT ALL FEEL.**

We're being manipulated. The best thing we can do is try to make sure everyone understands that this is how the internet works, so that at least they are aware and can question the groupthink. 

Just for the record, I'd also like to post another one of my previous comments, because it's more well sourced, although not as relevant:

&gt; People are in denial that they're being manipulated... 
&gt; 
&gt; [Operation Earnest Voice](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks) is an astroturfing campaign by the US government. The aim of the initiative is to use sockpuppets to spread pro-American propaganda on social networking sites.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The US government signed a $2.8 million contract with the Ntrepid web-security company to develop a specialized software, allowing agents of the government to post propaganda on ""foreign-language websites"", but recently [the law preventing them from using this in America was repealed, allowing them to spread pro-American propaganda even on American media](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/).
&gt; 
&gt; Main characteristics of the software, as stated in the software development request, are:
&gt; 
&gt; * 50 user ""operator"" licenses, 10 sockpuppets controllable by each user.
&gt; 
&gt; * Sockpuppets are to be ""replete with background, history, supporting details, and cyber presences that are technically, culturally and geographically consistent"". Sockpuppets are to ""be able to appear to originate in nearly any part of the world.""
&gt; 
&gt; * A special secure VPN, allowing sockpuppets to appear to be posting from ""randomly selected IP addresses,"" in order to ""hide the existence of the operation.""
&gt; 
&gt; *  50 static IP addresses to enable government agencies to ""manage their persistent online personas,"" with identities of government and enterprise organizations protected which will allow for different state agents to use the same sockpuppet, and easily switch between different sockpuppets to ""look like ordinary users as opposed to one organization.""
&gt; 
&gt; *   9 private servers, ""based on the geographic area of operations the customer is operating within and which allow a customer's online persona(s) to appear to originate from."" These servers should use commercial hosting centers around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; *   Virtual machine environments, deleted after each session termination, to avoid interaction with ""any virus, worm, or malicious software.""
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The [US also operates in conjunction with the UK to collect and share intelligence data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UKUSA_Agreement), and the [GCHQ has their own internet shilling program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Threat_Research_Intelligence_Group).
&gt; 
&gt; There is not enough evidence to say without a doubt that the US government manipulates American social media, but we can say without a doubt that **they do have sophisticated software for the purpose of spreading propaganda, they do manipulate social media, there are no longer propaganda laws preventing them from doing so in America, and multiple world governments have these programs in place (including but not limited to: [Russia, China, Israel, and the UK.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-sponsored_Internet_sockpuppetry))**
&gt; 
&gt; You can keep telling your self the US government would never manipulate social media, or violate the 4th amendment, or collect data en masse, or you can wake up and accept that this is the world we live in and ignoring it will never solve the problem. 

&gt; 
&gt; ###RUSSIA
&gt; 
&gt; The [web brigades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_brigades) (Russian: Веб-бригады), commonly known in English media as the troll army, are state-sponsored Internet sockpuppetry groups linked to the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation. They are purported to be teams of commentators that participate in Russian and international political blogs and Internet forums using sockpuppets to promote pro-Putin and pro-Russian propaganda.
&gt; 
&gt; Putins trolls are reportedly operating outside of the Russian region and [manipulating western media](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/putin-kremlin-inside-russian-troll-house):
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The nondescript building has been identified as the headquarters of Russia’s “troll army”, where hundreds of paid bloggers work round the clock to flood Russian internet forums, **social networks and the comments sections of western publications** with remarks praising the president, Vladimir Putin, and **raging at the depravity and injustice of the west**.
&gt; 
&gt; [In 2013, a Freedom House report stated that Russia has been using paid pro-government commentators to manipulate online discussions and has been at the forefront of this practice for several years. (bottom of pg.6)](https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/resources/FOTN%202013%20Summary%20of%20Findings.pd://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/resources/FOTN%202013%20Summary%20of%20Findings.pdf)

39,"[SERIOUS] This will be a long one so I understand if nobody can be bothered to read it.
English is not my native language so it might be spelling errors and such. 

I need help. 
I don't know if I'm susceptible to help so if you give advice it might fall on deaf ears and I'm sorry if that happens but I'm desperate. 

I've struggled with self hatred since I was a child, not the I don't like my self kind but the I can't stand my self and I wish that something or someone could just kill me kind. 
I know that I will sound like a whiny bitch and I'm sorry about that too but I really need to get this of my chest cause I can't stand it. 

I hardly know where to begin but I guess it started when I was 10 and got diagnosed with arthritis, the feeling of not fitting in is hard enough at that age but when you have the body of a 90-year old it's rough. 
My teacher bullied me as well, told me that I wasn't really sick, I was just lazy and when me and my mother sought help with the school counselor she said the same thing (I've never seen my mother so angry) My teacher continued with the attitude even when she got to meet my doctor several times.
Because of my arthritis I couldn't be very active and soon I gained a lot of weight after spending a summer at my grandmothers who spoiled me with ice cream and all the goodness. 
I started hating my self then, I would cry every time I went to the doctors and get weighed. 
Soon I started cutting and having suicidal thoughts. I stopped going to school when I was 13, I would just stay at home, cut myself and talk to old disgusting men who sent me dickpics.  

When I was about 15 I decided to be the best person I could be and started analyzing others. If something someone else did bothered me I would work very hard not to do the same and as you can imagine that stripped me of my personality and made me over analyze my self. 
All this time I felt like something was wrong with me, like I was different. I noticed that other people didn't think or feel like I did. 
But I was told by various psychologists that it probably was because of my father who's a douch and my mothers illness (an inheritable lung disease who would kill her early which I'd known about since I was 5) but I felt like that wasn't it. I had a lot of anxiety and for a long time I couldn't even walk outside the door. 
I just felt like something was wrong with me all the time and I developed social anxiety as well. I would make my self purge in the mornings just to have an excuse not to go to school. 

When I was 18 me and my mother moved to a new town and I finally started to feel like my self. Like I belonged. But the night before Christmas my mother had an attack and died. My whole world fell apart, my mother was my everything and I lost both her and the new town in one night. 

After that I've just... been broken. I really don't know how else to describe it. The last 8 years have just been filled with pain, sadness, self hatred and a strong death will. 
It didn't help that I entered a relationship with a guy who made me feel worse about my self and didn't allow me to pursue happiness.
That relationship ended in a very bad way that made me suffer more than I've ever suffered... even more than when I lost my mother.  
I almost started selling myself then, cause cutting wasn't enough. I stood outside the dudes house when I got a text message from one of my best friend that changed my mind. But I was so angry for so long, I lost a way to make money and hurt my self at the same time.
Now I'm thankful though.

Almost three years ago I met the love of my life. He's everything I ever wanted and so much more. He takes care of me, he supports me, he believes in me, he respects me and he loves me unconditionally. I love him more than words can say and still my self hate is smothering me. 
One and a half years ago (when I was 25) I got help again and it turns out that I have ADD and GAD. 
It's nice to know that I was right, that there was more... and it's nice to know why I feel and think like I do. It explains a lot. But the damage has already been done... and no diagnosis can change that unfortunately. 

I have a great life now, I live in a new town with the love of my life and his two wonderful children. Our economy is good, our relationship is fantastic, I have a good relationship with his children. Everything is wonderful, and that's what's so strange and frustrating. 
I love my life but I hate my self. 
The pain of living in my skin is sometimes unbearable, I just want to claw my self out of it. 
I've tried to explain it to various psychologist but they just don't seem to understand how deep it goes... 
the advice I've been giving and following is to do stuff... control my life sort of. With accomplishments comes self happiness... but no. 
I don't feel proud of anything I do, small and big. I just feel like the most worthless waste of a person on this planet.
Many time my feelings talk against each other, like I want to loose weight so bad... but working out and going on a diet makes me so freakin unhappy and I have no motivation. I always feel like I will fail, cause that's my experience. Even when I'm motivated and feel strong I don't succeed. 

I don't know what to do to be happy with my self, I don't know how to believe in my self. It hurts so fucking much, I can't stand to see my self in the mirror cause it's unbearable. I really thought that I would be better when I moves to my boyfriend, I was so hopeful but this self loathing won't go away no matter what I try. The only times that I stopped caring was when I was crushed by life. Now life is happy but I'm still a worthless piece of shit. 
It feels so hopeless... I'm hopeless.

I’m a straight male Christian, married with three children. I played with Barbie as a kid. I watched My Little Pony. I wanted to BE The Little Mermaid. I read makeup and fashion mags as a teenager. I was into musicals and dance and art and celebrity gossip. And, yes, I was teased for being “gay” and called many mean names because I wasn’t traditionally masculine. And it was very confusing, because I wasn’t gay. I liked girls but I also liked girl stuff. I felt like there was something wrong with me.  

But there wasn’t. The world was wrong.
There isn’t “boy stuff” and “girl stuff.” Gender and affinity aren’t synonymous. Sexuality isn’t about the kind of person I am, it’s about the person I’m attracted to. And my sexual identity is separate from my cultural tastes.  

See, You’re allowed to like what you like. Boys are allowed to play with dolls without fear it will determine the course of their life. Girl are allowed to be into mechanics or sports without thinking they’re DOOMED to a life of wearing pantsuits and ugly haircuts.
And anyone who would place that kind of pressure and burdens on a kid, implying they need to change themselves before they can be accepted, is doing the exact opposite of what Jesus told them to do.

My natural inclination is to think that spiritual things exist, approach them with a healthy skepticism, but generally reject the idea of ""well that can't *possibly* exist!"" regarding anything from otherworldly entities to modern magick to weird consciousness stuff being more than just your brain spazzing out.

Now, at the moment, I was thinking about something: the opt-posited concept that all our spiritual notions are pure fiction, literally no differnt than assuming Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter is real and basing thousands of years of culture around it, of scholars wasting their lives analyzing the works of Tolkien or Rowling for truths about life when it's pure fiction and there are people who know/knew and can tell you so. Frame it like that and it seems ""obvious"" that anything beyong our current material knowledge can't exist, it was purely made up for entertainment centuries ago and was basically a gullible fandom that got out of hand.

Maybe it's just resistance, but something about that seems a little crazy. Yes, crazier than the possibility that will or consciousness can affect reality, or that there are beings somewhere out there with abilities we can barely conceive of. But in trying to figure that out, I started thinking a bit about where the *concept* of gods and spiritual forces came from. Because that's one issue with the fiction that got out of hand argument: where did the original ""authors"" get their ideas? Modern fantasy derives their ideas from preexisting mythology. Where did those mythologies come from? Part of it, we know(?) was a personification of natural forces or human tendencies, or could be seen as such. Something about that seems incomplete, though. And it doesn't give early humans enough credit - ancient civilizations were pretty effing smart, and even if they weren't exactly right about things they were more in tune with concepts that align with modern science than some would think. Partly for that reason, I think (pure assumption) that they would be that stupid as to fall for some massive concocted lie that magical beings exist that was pure, baseless fiction. 

It certainly *seems* more likely that people saw things, experienced things, intuited things, and recorded what they recalled. The standard response there, I think, would be that they were hallucinated (due to insanity or drugs), they just had dreams, or they saw totally normal things they were too stupid to understand. Again, people of the past weren't actually that stupid to uncritically believe the ramblings of a random person (IIRC, rulers and powerful people usually weren't the ones having visions)...

Okay, I've rambled enough. I get that spiritual stuff is pretty much just unfounded beliefs fairly unrelated to modern science, or at least ignored by it. Guess I'm just trying to reason out what could be thought of as simply ""unproven"", or if there's evidence for the whole ""they just made it up, it's pure fiction"" thing has any historical validity.",16Feb2017,4
52,"and I never have. but my entire life, I've always felt chubby and bigger. my sister was always scrawny and had thinner features. I had thicker legs, arms, etc.

even the time I lost so much weight and was as thin as I've ever been, when I looked in the mirror, I still felt so chubby. and when I look back, I'd give anything to be at that weight again. was it because of my thick legs, arms, full cheeks? I don't know.

but because of this, I feel I (somewhat) understand the mind of someone with an eating disorder. when they're literally skin and bones, look in the mirror and still say they're fat. (not to offend anyone, REALLY)

today, (weighing the most I've ever weighed) I look in the mirror and know I'm not totally ""fat"" but I'm not very thin either. I am now officially chubby. and officially overweight for my height and age.

does anyone else understand? I had to tell someone that would understand.",16Feb2017,2

There are no facts, just allegations/speculation and nobody seems to be presenting any evidence.  I'm tired and somewhat demoralized from the last few weeks.  Every day there's something else, another scandal, another allegation with no closure in sight.  I am so sick of hidden agendas/biases and i just want some answers.  ",16Feb2017,9
