1,"Today I began my community service at the elementary school that I attended K-6 working in the after school care program. I was working alongside Morgan, a girl who I have known for the better part of 17 years and grew up with. As she called roll, the children came up to us and I handed them a snack; goldfish and a juice box. One girl in the first or second grade came up when her name was called, hugged Morgan and began talking to her. ""Mrs. Morgan, who is this?"" She said, while pointing at me. She told the girl who I was and she then questioned if I was working there now. Morgan explained to her that I would be helping her several days during the week after school. The girl let out an exuberant ""YAY!!!!"". Morgan and I exchanged a laugh. A lady whom I have not met before came in after we had finished taking roll just before we left to take the kids to the gym. She inquired if I was working there and I explained to her that I used to go to school there and I was going to be doing some community service there. She began explaining to me that many of the children that were part of the after school program were fatherless. ""You look very mature and are going to remind many of them of a father figure. They're going to love you."" 

We went into the gym and the children began doing yoga.  About half way through, the instructor had them lay on their backs and imagine that they were floating on a cloud, looking down, while they listened to a soundtrack. After it was over she asked them what they had saw while they were on the cloud. As analytical as I am, the first thing I thought was, ""they're probably going to make up a lot of crazy stuff."" I was wrong. The children had came up with whole stories about families in their yards, animals in forests, and everything else you can imagine; all with more realism than most of the kids that I go to school with would've came up with. Imagination is something that I haven't used much since I left Elementary school. I watched those same kids later while we were outside; they weren't playing on the playground, they were lost, somewhere, in their imaginations. Maybe we all need to get lost a little more.",07Apr2017,17
3,"So I am a pretty easy going person, I have never been in a physical altercation with someone and I normally get along with everyone. But there is this vendor who comes into work once a week from spring until fall thatI have never even spoke too but when he's around talking to my co-workers and it's all innocent talk my hair stands on end. I find my lip curling into a snarl and I have to fight it down. Every fiber of my being tells me that if he approaches me I should do everything I can to defend myself. It's a really uncomfortable feeling for me so I usually find a reading for working elsewhere when he's around. Has anyone else ever experienced something like that? What did you do? ",07Apr2017,1

There's a million anti Trump subs.  There's thousands of people hoping for a ""blue midterm.""  These people that are fed up with him are the ones you want to applaud, not ridicule.  You want to educate them, not attack them.  You want to bring them to your side, not drive them away.

18,"Sometimes I feel I am talking superlatively. Sometimes I might think I will hurt someone by saying something. These kind of clumsiness...

Understanding my interactions and the reactions they might create is important. But this amount of energy to analyze them seems to be order of magnitude superior to the energy I allocate to say what I have to say.

I'm trying to predict the misunderstandings I might provoke by saying what I think.

Saying what I want to say seems like a simpler idea. And trusting myself that I will give a good explanation to the misunderstanding at the right moment means confidence, and I should be confident because I'm saying what I want to say. I will for sure not be confident if I say what someone wants to hear, because I cannot think like (s)he does and cannot explain why I say what he says.

It seems I always want to publish what I think. To tell it to the others, so that ""I help them"". But it looks like it is mainly destined for me.

It is OK not to be perfect and not to have the best thought at the right moment, especially under stress. And giving space to do mistakes is necessary, else I will certainly fail.

20,"Posted this on 2 other subs. Looking for advice on a personal issue between myself and a woman whom is dear to me...

Im a 24 year old african/hispanic american male with a huge amount of issues (aspergers, severe manic depression, pessimism, ocd, abandonment issues, history of abuse, possible ptsd according to my psych therapist, etc) and i have the face of a hispanic gang member. Anyway, there is this woman [20yo] that i have known for 6 years. Shes always been there for me through a lot of hard times (suicide attmpts, emotional breakdowns, friend/family deaths, other such stuff) and i always did my best to help her with whatever problems she had in her life. Together we have gone through hell and back... At one point i fell in love with her and i guess she really liked me but i ended up moving from the city and the last time we saw eachother in person was during her birthday in october of 2011 where i gave her something precious i made for her to remember my by. We tried staying in contact over long distance through text messaging but as i found out, i tend to put a lot more of my emotions into the things i type as opposed to what i say in real life which ended up in me fucking up by having a really bad manic episode that she couldnt deal with and saying things i did not mean. We ended up stopping contact for half a year but we resumed talking to eachother again. (Around 2013) Everything was going well, until i had a pretty bad long distance relationship breakup and started taking it out on people around me including her which caused us to stop talking for another half a year. So 2014 hits, im starting a community college, shes getting out of high school, and we go right back into our routine. Things go pretty great, we even seem to have gotten abit closer. Things contine, im happy although i end up becoming depressed due to events that unfolded at the college (burned myswlf out taking full credit loads for 2 different semesters aswell as a summer, and since i stopped fighting like i used to in high school, i ended up letting people walk all over me to the point where even the anime nerds bullied the shit out of me) aswell as a failing online relationship with some older cambodian woman (who apparently only wanted a visa) that a woman in college set me up with prior to that. My mental health deteriorated to a point where i was constantly drinking alcohol and energy drinks and getting involved with the local gangs and dealing and stuff. Ended up getting attached to this asian woman who was 26 at the time but was kind of a tomboy. We would go out drinking and stuff but despite sleeping with her, we never made it past me being a ""brother"" to her and i effectively killed the relationship by wanting more. I ended up taking a break and head back to the city we met in so i could see her again... She ended up too busy with her vollyball stuff and we never had a chance to meet not to mention she seemed kinda distant. So whatever, came back and went through spring semester (started janurary 2015) at a college where i was outright hated by many of the people and often times treated as a joke. In a last ditch effort i dropped out and went back to that city one more time because i couldnt take things that were going on around me and really needed her to be there for me, unfortunately she was going through some stuff herself and we ended up getting into a real bad fight over the phone where i said some really bad stuff that i will never forgive myself for that hurt her deeply... So i ended up getting back into the gang culture and drowning myself in alcohol. Stayed there from march to august and didnt even get to see her once... Eventually i came back to the city i went to college in and just stayed out of sight/out of mind while surrounding myself with the only stuff i know... 2016 comes, she messages me about how she wants to change herself into a better person. Im proud of her but honestly it just got depressing talking to her because the distance that formed between us over my actions... I still loved her, probably more than i did before but i wasnt sure what i could say cus she was with someone which was awkward. So eventually we just drifted away because i couldnt accept the fact she was in love with someone else. Eventually i just broke... Since i had moved back in with my mom after not paying rent at my old place when i left to visit the girl, i ended up just staying home. Locked myself in a room and shut out everyone around me.. Gained weight, drunk alcohol and energy drinks like water, and became extremely paranoid. Not only did my health go to shit, my life pretty much did aswell. Thats how i spent a majority of 2016 and even janurary of 2017 Until... You guessed it, she messaged me. She talks about how she never wants us to leave again and how she missed me and that i was important to her and even that she became the better person she wanted to be. She was like an angel appointed by god to come to save me from myself at that point. We talked, and i tried cleaning myself up the best i can for her. I stopped drinking energy drinks and soda, and started only drinking tea and coffee, i started trying to exercize more, started caring about my hygene n stuff. I really wanted to do good for her. Even bought a ticket to go back to our old city that she still lives in that i had just arrived at a week ago right now. Unfortunately ive become seriously attached to her, to the point where i end up bringing up relationship stuff and even starting arguements over the guys she talks to without realizing it. My emotions are completely unstable and im truly hurting her... Not physically of course, i could never bring myself to raise my hand at her or even lay a finger on her... Honestly i feel she would be better off without me and have been alluding to the fact i want to cut myself away from her so that way she doesnt have to be hurt by me anymore (using the fact she wants me only as a brother while i want to be more as an excuse). She doesnt deserve to have a fuckup like me around to hold her back yet she fights against me leaving saying that she wants me right there and that she will help me get better any way she can... Honestly, im really scared i might end up hurting her worse than i did before. I truly love her more than anything in this world but since ive been down here ive had more than 3 uncontrollable outbursts towards her about my feelings or her being too busy with working that have led to arguements (one of which happened 4 hours ago that ended with her going to sleep pissed off). I dont know what to do and im honestly tempted to just cut myself off from her with no warning and block everything i have her on... Its a shitty situation because if things were different, i would have married her by now. But i know im not meant to be in any kind of relationship because of how fucked to hell i am...

22,"I'm in a very weird-feeling situation. I have always been quite successful and traveled the world for work. I finally returned home after living overseas for 7 years. I have been in a relationship for 5 of those years and found myself unable to continue applying for visas to keep myself OS. I really thought my partner would have proposed by now and he seems to be confused himself about why he hasn't. I told him all along that if he wasn't going to marry me one day he needed to tell me. I feel like I wasted years on a relationship that might now be doomed. And he stood by while I struggled to keep my work status in his country. I feel very betrayed by it all, and the only way to save the relationship is if he can come join me here in my country. Now the shoe is on the other foot I don't think he wants to take the trouble to find his way here. Even though the visa is much more easy for him than it was for me.

I left my OS home of 7 year a month ago, with so much fan fair. All my good friends coming together to express their sadness I was leaving. I couldn't believe the amazing friendship group in front of me. I felt so loved and grateful. 

And now, here I am, home, without him, without my friends, and jobless. Thank god for my family having a home for me while i look for work. But now my next blow; I can't find work. I thought my global experience would be a plus in my line of work, but even jobs I thought were a step down are saying no to me. I get interviews, but then there seems to be people with more suited experience. I'm at a loss. And in lies what could be a one more issue doing me no favors; I now seem to have an accent. So perhaps I am seen as an outsider in my own country. 

I feel totally lost. I had a plan to come home where work conditions were easier, find a job and new apartment. I'd planned to buy my own place within a year. But everything is so much harder. And my boyfriend is this big unsure cloud over my head. I wanted by now to feel a lot more job and relationship security and perhaps have a family. I feel so far away from any of that and I am scratching my head why. I'm smart, funny, easy going, hard working... and also unemployed and maybe soon single. All at the wonderful age of 30. 

Seems that doors don't open like they do the older you get. 

Not sure if I'm asking advice, I think I'm more just wanting to vent. I am usually so together. And I've been studying, exercising and applying for work non-stop. I feel energetic and productive. But then I stop, take a step back and think, what the fuck is wrong with me? 

I feel a little broken. I feel very sad. I just can't get it together right now. ",07Apr2017,15
23,"I understand the irony in that title. Of course there are plenty of things on the internet about the temporary insanity and commercialization of our species' need to copulate. But none of them are written by me. And all of them seem to end in 'but hey, do it again anyway, maybe this time you won't get kicked in the balls.' Bollucks! Complete and utter bollucks.

I've been apart of my fair share of romantic cock-ups but this one takes the cake. My longest friendship down the tubes in a city where I know no one, stuck in this goddamn studio apartment where we spend each lovely day pointedly not talking to each other, and why? Why has an otherwise good and fulfilling friendship turned into boatload of shit captained by a shit-head docked on a shore of shit? Because of *love*, fucking goddamn *love*.

He loved me enough to stick around for seven years and was delighted when we started to make a go at a relationship. I loved him enough to finish the relationship instead of wasting his life just so I can not die alone. He loves me enough that he doesn't want to see me move on. I love him enough that I don't want to lose him as a friend. Aaand everybody is goddamn miserable!

Romantic love is bullshit. It promises to enrich your life, but why when you look back do you just see bloody trails from the bloated corpses of your failed relationships, and horribly embarrassing drunk texts? Its a racket, that's why. A racket designed to lure you in to believing you're not alone only to use the exact same bait to help you chop of your own head and turn yourself into sushi.

I got on anti-depressants a year ago, and do you know what one of the most common side effects is? *Decreased libido*. Happy, sane people don't want to have sex! They know its a trap! They're like Admiral Ackbar meets Stephen friggin' Hawking--they're just smarter people! Depressed people know we're all going to die anyways, happy people figure 'why make the in-between bit harder on myself? I think I'll just get really into model trains or building tiny ships in bottles or....I don't know, whatever it is happy people do.

Point is, love is nonsense that somehow continues to ruin substantial periods of time in people's lives and I want to read something on the internet about it.

29,"(Posting from a throwaway for obvious reasons/originally posted in /r/tifu )

This all started when I got asked to design and build from the ground up a small portal for my company's long term customers to submit personal feedback, which then escalated into a full fledged ticketing system. Now, I'm a geospatial services engineer who's theoretically aware of full stack web dev, but nowhere near proficient. I was given a week, almost no budget, and no personnel. Mind you, this was to be integrated into our existing system. All of which meant I am the sole person responsible for the disaster.

Our prod environment was a mess, documentation was ridiculously out of date, and I had no money to buy a CMS, so I ended up copy pasting the front end wholesale from the web. To make a long story short, _I did not sanitise my inputs at all_. Compounding my error, I assumed nobody would ever find the login for the short time it'd be up, and thus security in the PHP backend was low: I implemented only the most basic of file exec checks. By the end I was doing 20 hour days and my judgement was out of whack. Clearly, I had no idea what I was doing.

I deployed the site on Friday, hoping for what would be a quiet, relaxing weekend before finally letting users in from Monday. That didn't happen.

To be honest, I'm still not sure _exactly_ what happened, but the tip I got from IT was that multiple shells were uploaded and people got root access ... somewhere. No personal info (passwords/cookies/etc.) were available so they couldn't get those, thankfully. But what did happen was equally damaging: two prod databases got wiped completely, out front page was obscenely vandalized and the entirety of our client list was sent spam and porn.

To make a great day even better, apparently our offsite restore functionality was never tested and thus our backups are still not fully online.

Our lead sysadmin has told me to not approach her department for the foreseeable future or I might be murdered and cannibalized.

Surprisingly, I haven't been fired yet and a couple of higher ups have defended me, but I think my CV is about to take a hit.

Suffering from social anxiety and depression since almost a year. Never made any good friends. 0 luck with girls. Helped this girl out in an assignment, and she extended her hand of friendship. At first I was really nervous, but then, gradually, I started trusting her, and shared my problems about depression with her. She was extremely supportive, and offered to help me out in every way possible. Due to her, I thought that there is some hope left. So, she asked me about my condition yesterday, and I told her that it wasn't exactly improving, and just the random stuff. Then I accidentally said, that before I met her, when I didn't have friends, I was having suicidal thoughts, and even self harmed. She looked genuinely pissed. She was kinda sad, upset and angry at the same time. She really cares for me, and so, it was all kinda justified.

We had to find a place that could accommodate a toddler, so we were kind of walking aimlessly looking for a good place to eat. 

We had been walking from Old Town on Drottninggatan and as we came up to Åhlens(the mall that the truck crashed into) I was getting a bit worried because there was a lot of people around and I was honestly thinking that I do NOT want to walk here, too many people, what if a maniac in a truck plows through the crowd.

I was thinking to ask my sister and her bf if they also were scared that we could get mowed down by a truck, but didn't because I didn't want to seem like a fear monger or an unnecessarily scared person.
Instead I suggested that we'd eat at a restaurant a bit away from the main streets, and they (thank fucking god) agreed. We also met up with my brother that was coming to joins us wherever we decided.

We were done eating at almost the exact time that the truck mercilessly mowed down all those innocent unsuspecting people, and now, after all the facts are known - ALL I can think about is ""what if"". 

What if we had gone to the first restaurant I thought of, on Drottninggatan. We could potentially have been in the middle of the fucking terror attack. My son could have died. My sister could have died. My brother could have died. Our family could have experienced an  inconceivable tragedy. What if they died and I survived. Could I live with that? Especially since I had the ""premonition"" that it was not a safe place to be. 

What if the guy had been there earlier? 

I am really going crazy thinking about this. We are safe. We are unharmed. We were far away(4 blocks appr). I should not feel like I ""barely"" escaped, but I do. 

Can't fathom what the people that actually were THERE are feeling right now. The ones that narrowly escaped by throwing themselves into shops(as seen on surveillance).
