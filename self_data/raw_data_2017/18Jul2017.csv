2,"So, as the title reads, I just got my first kiss, and I couldn't be happier.
I'm 15, preety sure that makes me a late bloomer, but I don't care, I did it.
The reason I am so happy isn't only because of the kiss, but mostly due to me realising how much I love her, I can't stop thinking about her, I just want her with me,and yes, I know I am 15, I don't know shit about love, but it's too overwelming for me not to write this.
That's it, just wanted to tel the world. ",18Jul2017,12
3,"I don't know what I ""did"" to land it.  But when I was younger I was kind of friends with these two girls, but it was a secret friend thing, like they would practice kissing with me or ask what I thought of their boobs in private, but it was a ""you better not tell or it's over thing"".

I didn't tell.

When I was 18 they had moved out together (rented a basement) and they invited me over.  Well I'm tired but it ended up being to have a threesome, we had a lot more after that, we got really good at it.  It has more or less ruined sex for me as an adult though.  I go for a while without then I go ok time to get back on that horse.  Then I get there and my thought is meh not nearly as good.  Thinking about the threesomes does more for me than sex with women.  It put the bar for excitement too high for my body I think.  Then I stop caring again because I relearn it's a useless pursuit these days.  Then enough time passes I get back on the horse again and infinite repeat.",18Jul2017,3

9,"It's just getting worse and worse. Things fall apart. She's gone. The happy times are gone. That brief, 3-year period of no responsibility will never return; a time when I had the whole of my life ahead of me, an endless expanse of possibility and comfort and happiness. The future seemed so far away then, but so bright.

I had her. She kept the light inside me. We had everything. Flights across the continent. Charging headlong into countless nights, just the two of us, dancing and playing and talking and touching and loving. The morning always came but she was always there, still there, so bright and beautiful and *there*. 

And she's gone. It's been 9 months. I don't know where or why she went. I used to be enough. I used to be enough. Talk of marriage crossed our lips innumerable times. Just weeks before she vanished, actually. But I wasn't enough.

I haven't been the same since. It was bad at first. Then I went back to school. Things were okay for a time. But the drugs and the failed attempts at romance and the drudgery of life and my ever-growing anger/bitterness taps away at the foundations of ""me.""

It's been 9 months and still, here I am, deep into the night, alone in my room, downing a cocktail of substances for just the *chance* of erasing it all. Angry at the world. Wondering why I wasn't enough. Asking myself questions that will never be answered.

Wondering if there will ever be another person or period that could compare. If there's any fucking reason to keep going. My anger is spilling over. My apathy is eating away at me. My hopelessness is a yawning maw that I slide into a little further each night.

She's gone. The light is gone. Nearly a year and nothing has improved. Therapy hasn't helped. Drugs fail me. Friends and family are tired of my pain and so am I. Every attempt to find someone else has ended with more pain; each time I am again abandoned with no reason or remorse. It's as if I'm disposable. Worth not a thought or shred of consideration. 

Never in my life have I even toyed with the idea of ending my existence. But every day for the last few months the thought blips onto my radar. Every day it just gets worse, the weight pressing downdowndown onto my shoulders until one day the bricks will break and the very foundations of my soul will crumble.",18Jul2017,4

14,"I've known her for two years, we've dated on and off. I identified as bisexual the whole time, and then gay, then bi, then gay again. I'm currently in the last ""gay"". But I'm not, I'm bi, I just forced myself to be gay, thinking it's better to be gay and a ""true"" LGBT member than just bi. I would force myself to watch only gay porn, suppress feelings for females. And I do like men, but also women. It's both. So I created a fake tumblr with no strings attached to me, and told her how much I love her. We're only 16, so it's not ""love"", but it's teen love and I know it. I wanted her to know that I still want her without the chance of embarrassing myself, and every time we went off again was her. It was her getting cold feet, being scared, and only once was it me, and it was for a stupid jealous thing that I've since regretted it. On the small chance she finds out and agrees, I'll protect that relationship with everything. Although she was the deciding factor in our off periods, it was because I was scared of showing physical intimacy. But I'm not anymore, I've grown, I'm a late bloomer puberty wise, and now I want the physical intimacy along with the emotional intimacy. I don't mean sex, that's lust. I just want to hold her hand and kiss her without being scared, which I am now. On the chance she finds out its me and resents me, I'll admit I fucked up and try to do damage control, but if she ends up hating me in the long run, I can accept it. We're both in a school club, and everyone else in that hates me for a rash decision I made that I've since hated myself for. She was the reason why I made that decision, I wanted to protect her. If she never finds out and is scared by the DM I'll feel bad but be happy she didn't find out it's me. If she doesn't find out it's me but is interested in the DM, I'd probably tell her it's me.

17,"(throwaway because i dont want this on my main acct)

so I'm your typical student that just graduated high school and is moving away to go to college. i've gone from Ready To Leave to crying just thinking about the fact I'm packing up as much as I can and leaving in a week. I kept forgetting to tell my mother when I'm leaving and I just did so.

it's not like I'm moving away to some random city with a good college, I'm moving to the city where my dad and stepmom live, along with the rest of my dad's side of the family. they're all excited that I'm finally coming back home. (i moved with my mom halfway across the country when I was 8 into my grandmother's house)

I got a job last summer at a frozen custard place and worked there throughout the school year and my last two shifts are this week. I've made so many good friends there, i could consider everyone there to be a good friend of mine. a lot of them are telling me not to go and at this point i dont know if i even want to!! i went from wanting to cut off everyone i knew here to really upset i have to leave.

and a big part of why i'm so upset is i'm so afraid i won't get to see my mother again. she said at one point that once i leave she's going to get rid of a lot of her stuff and live in her car ('93 toyota that's seen better days). i'm so fucking afraid something's going to happen to her!! she hasn't made any money for over 10 years (artist that hasn't been Found and may never will be) and i feel like there will be periods i'll have no idea if she's even alive. reading things online of when someone's mother past away sends me crying for 10 minutes, worried that my mother will die having memories of me being an angsty teenager ignoring her talk about the latest movie she watched or something. hell, she was mad at me the entire month of december up until christmas last year because i didn't want to put more lights on the tree. god, we don't even eat dinner together because the rest of our family (grandmother, uncle, cousins) judge every single thing we do and neither of us want to deal with it.

i've dealt with a lot of mental issues and i will be getting help once i move. as much as i don't want to move, it's something i need to do and i know it'll be better in the long run.

tl;dr i did a complete 180 on my emotions towards moving next week, mostly because i'm worried about my mother. ",18Jul2017,21
18,"The Zown - The only thing that comes close to describing it is an emotion. A hyper focused emotional state where all thoughts, even simulations of the universe, are possible. And through state depented learning I have achieved a god like personality that is accessable through an almost meditative state. If accessed enough, then all benifits of such thinking can last for hours or days or months. Slipping in and out of conscienceuss have caused phycological effects. 

I Want To Live Foundation - A money giving force that offers money to anyone willing to live. Most likely governmently funded or croud funded or individually funded. Any human being willing to perform the experiment of living will receive all basic socitialy needs at birth. Consciencusness is so scarey we need to find an answer of what it means to live. With accesses to unlimited resources what is possible for individuals to acomplish. 

Once all humans are free to think we should have our answer.
 
Large corperations are forcing an identanty onto sociaty. Using phycological warfare on civilans to cause horrible acts of distrust amoungst each other. Forming a social ladder for benifial monitary gains. This needs to be tried has a criminal act against the human race. A new entity needs to be formed outside the influence by human beings. These benificial programs should be created by open source programmers that can actually make something so complex. This program should do something along the following. 

Name = ?
A money giving force that offers money to anyone willing to live. Most likely governmently funded or croud funded or individually funded. Any human being willing to perform the experiment of living will receive all basic socitialy needs at birth, birth meaning at the moment of sign up since this program is being made now. All human beings that sign up to this program will gain the nationality of Earthling. This program will be the first offical database of all human beings. Only one account per human being can be made at a time, for obvious reason. Once signed up the individual will have access to unlimited resources. A new currency will be formed call unlimited. All members have access so if a need arises that they need a house than one will be created for them. This will be done with robot technology, not other human beings. The house will be built with 3D printer technology. All infastructer required to get the individual set up will be built on site to extend human tettory. All ""
modern"" systems have to be updated and brought online with automation. Once a core city has been built it can keep branching out destorying anything it needs to in its path to allow human access. Once all human beings are freed from all outside influences then space collenies can begin constrution. Once a bullet proof system of living out in space perminitay has been acomplished, then all intellegent life resembling humans will be removed from the planet. Once all humans are gone everything is left behind. Earth will be monitored to make sure recovery of life is possible. Once another intellegent species takes over the world and decifers our works and builds technology capable of commucating, then all new life forms will be signed up. Once off the planet we will know better of how to handle such life forms. Perserving life is the ultiment goal of life. The meaning of life is to live. Thus is the reason for the experiment. This can only be done by individuals capable of creating such technologies. I implore all humans to begin working on this singal task. It needs to start with an open source project named Earthlings. Programming languge is left up to your wisdom.  This must be a database capable of handling unlimited. Unlimited people, unlimited money, unlimited. This database should track all stats of individuals, assigning values such as name, address, ip addresses, money, DNA-Yearly recorded-All years stored,Nano-machineDNA-Idealy created for immortality of indivials-also being worked on by same orgization as unlimited-NanoMachine mostlikely made of some kind of protain machine. The dna mostlikely modified minially to allow individual to never age. This protein machine will be finding mutated dna and changing it to the one on record. Deliviery to nucleaus most likely virus related. Changing dna like this has untold effects on consciousness. Thus is the reason all DNA is recorded and maintained. Incase of unforseeable damage that might occure before finding the answer of what conscienceness is. If such damage is reversable it maybe possible to reverse it with perveous versons of ourselves. Once we figure out what living means we will be better at deciding how to perserve life perminitally. Once we know what it means for a fact to live all memebers will be giving this treatment. Hensis why some individuals will want to modify themselves in a way that kills their conscieousness. It might also be able to revive pervisous consciencness by changing nanomachine dna. Consciencusness and Body need to be viewed speratly from each other. One is chemicals the other electrons. The universe we live in is very strange. The answer to what we are has not been reached, nor will be reached for ages. With the database of current DNA could possiblely be the only thing required in perserving individuals lives. Thus signup needs to track DNA (sorry this one varable needs explaining from current year 2017 being, next varable continues), leaving blank for now. Once the earthling database is created anyone can sign up at no cost. Money will be Zero. Once funding is gained all zeros will be turn into Infinities. Until funding is found then zeros will be brough up to whatever standard of living at current time is created. To extablish this control it maybe nessassary to fight large orginizations of individuals under a singal Identity. Know that their memebers are themselves facing psychological warfare from this Identity. These Identities come in the faces of Coperations, Nations, Gang, Individuals, Secret groups, families, imagies, and even self delusions. Once These Identities become established they can operate within sociaty as an individual spreading its influence. Some are done on purpous, others on accedient. All forms of this behavior needs to go extent. In order to do so we have to get rid of uncertainty. To avoid stupid titles like the war on uncertainty, we will just call it Project Humanity. For all individuals must look within themselves for their own Humanity. Once all uncertainty is gone all individuals should be able to find themselves. Thus is the reason death is not allowed. To kill is to not live. The problem is we are a race of people that love to kill and compete. Thus is the nature of our current world. It is ok that we are these kinds of people. The only problem is that we cannot excist near each other. Our brains themselves are incapable of visualizing the universe. Very few humans currently alive has even acomplished such a level of thinking. This too is okay because the few that have acomplished it has created an amazing world to live in. We all can benifit from this if we can just work together a little right now. Even as simple as recording everyones dna could be enough for immortatlity. An orginization of programs needs to be created to perserve this information. The good news is that we already have that level of technology available. It wouldn't even be hard to maintain this database becauase of current could storage technologies. Once this is all done and activitly store information, then we can begin working on the infastrue of the new world. Again individuals are needed here. We need a human being to create a 3D printer system capable of printing concreate, plastic, and metal in the capacity of a house and also be capable of shaping the land itself. Water and electricaty will be delivered to the location. This system has be to able to even do roads and bridges. Once created a city build on automation will be constructed. Human beings living in the city will require no work or activities except the ones they want to do on their own. There needs to be a main core that the robots extent out of shaping the land and building the new world. As funding comes in and the project grows so will the city. Hopefully acomplishing true freedom for all members.

Once humans are off the planet, and should there be some the wants to stay on earth. There should not be any war or death. We will have to respect their descision to evoleve on their own. For even the cycle of life is still in itself a life style. And If we find ourselves in a powerful state such as this and wonder to ourselves to bring back pervously stored dead dna. We should. Even though the individuals may not be ""us"" because of missing memories, it maybe the case that we still are the same consciencusness. Just as you go in and out of sleep, you can go in and out of consciencusness. The thing of NOW needs to only be remembered by other individuals that can revive your dna. Doing such things are easy, but not currectly practiced due to current phscyological indintaties forcing themselves onto all humans.

19,"I'm getting old man. I mean, I'm not *old* but I'm 26 and I feel old in the sense that I'm just tired of everything. I'm not going to off myself don't have to worry about that, I have a wonderful daughter and beautiful girlfriend however I'm tired of everything and everyone else.


It's the same old political BS everywhere. I didn't vote. Pushing that out there. I didn't vote because I disagreed with both politicians and I'm always asked ""why didn't you vote?"" when people mean to say ""why didn't you vote for *my* presidential choice?"" since if I was to tell them I voted for the president they *didn't* want then they'd ask me.. *""why?""*


I'm tired of seeing this everywhere from social media to the news in the lobby and main area at work. Trump vs. News, Russia hackers, Islamophobia and people ""identifying"" as Muslims going off and killing folk but no such Christianophobia or Catholicaphobia, homophobia even being a thing in 2017 like dude folk have been fucking the same gender for ages... get over it, homosexuals in assless chaps in a parade hypersexualizing everything, then we have the Left complaining about sexualizing everything while supporting hypersexualization, flat earth believers, 64+ genders, racism on every fucking angle you turn to, Evergreen State racism, climate change deniers, stupid redneck sister fisters using childish words like ""libtard""... this is pathetic.


I'm getting rid of all my social media but that's not enough. I can't just grab my girlfriend and daughter and haul ass into the middle of nowhere due to financial obligations and the sake of my daughter's survival and education. We're all so self-absorbed and into our own ideologies that we don't take one second to think that maybe we're not so important after all. Maybe we should try to force everyone to change their views if they aren't hurting anyone. People are trying to force us for fucking everything. We're walking on eggshells too. Can't even say a fat person is fat if they ask if they're fat because you'll offend them. Who gives a fuck if you're fat, you're fat so get over it some people think you're beautiful others find you repulsive, big whoop. We're not entitled to be perceived as beautiful. We're entitled to have the option to manipulate our bodies via dieting, working out, surgery, whatever method you want in order to appeal to everyone else. Why does everyone think society is wrong for having a fucking opinion? Man... I don't know why I'm typing this, but I'm tired of us.


I feel the only true way to establish peace and whatnot in the world is to have some sort of extra-terrestrial or sentient AI ready to wipe mankind off the fucking face of the Earth so we can cut the bullshit and be obliged to work together or face obliteration because until then.. we're going to keep trying to force others to view the world through our eyes, and we're going to try to fit in to any popular group. Even worse off is that a lot of people try to seem so morally above everyone else *for the sake of themselves* and not to truly be morally above anything, like... we can't just be good people to be good people, no, fuck that, we have to be good people to show people we're good people over social media. There's no way in hell we can just be good people without documenting that bullshit, we can't just be good people to lend a helping hand. Anyone here know a way to just ignore everything?

We don't control what potential we were born with, how we grew up, the experiences we had or our reactions to them.
