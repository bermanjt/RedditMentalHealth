8,"Imagine immortality, inhalation infinite. 

Everything you have ever done, but still the quiet voice, violent and ready. A toast to burning, toast to butter you up. 

People say all the time, if mankind somehow is able to transcend death and become immortal, they will subsequently collectively off themselves. How this will happen is a mystery, but it is a fact, true and simple. There is no use trying to deny it, or you will be deemed anathema and kicked out of college. You will be, as they say, ""black-balled."" I have never liked this expression.

I disagree that if mankind were to achieve immortality that they would all kill themselves. They wouldn't be able to, because they would be immortal. Oh wait, maybe the thing people say is that if we achieved infinite knowledge that we would all kill ourselves. I reject this too. 

People have a hard enough time living the short breath that they have right now. You've got 8 year olds killing themselves, you've got 40 year olds killing themselves. People can't wait to die. They've got 6 feet in the grave already, whats the use going further under? Our current knowledge-so-called tells us that if we had any more knowledge we would see no point in continuing to live, even surpassing the trite excuses we tell ourselves in order to continue living now. But consider what would happen if after we pass a certain threshold of knowledge, we realize how foolish we were, how wonderful life could be. Animals are afraid to die, and they are the smartest beings on the planet. If we become as smart as them, we will once again fear death. I call this the Horseshoe theory

9,"I’ve always been a big fan of swings. Without cease, as a kid it was my first destination at the play ground. There is something about having your feet off the ground and the wind in your face. It gives you a sense of freedom as though you are flying. It gives you a new prospective of the world. Even today, I feel a sense of nostalgia when I get on a swing, bring me back to childhood.

Growing up isn’t easy. 

Missed paths suck. 

Letting go can be hard. 

New starts can be challenging.

Sometimes everything may feel like it’s falling to pieces when the truth is the pieces are just falling together. Everything that happens has a purpose. 

Just swing on.

I was depressed from grade 6-10 and never let anyone know. I've never expressed to anyone in my life what it felt like to be in that place and I just want someone to read this and be able to see me. 

Beginning in 6th grade I was in a dark place because of bullying in school, being bullied in other organizations I was in, dealing with my mother who has paranoid personality disorder along with the CONSTANT fighting between my parents.  At home I'd be greated with confrontation and stress after a long day of dealing with shit at school and I'd have no one to go to. If I went to my parents about being bullied they'd blame each other and all I wanted back then was for my parents to love each other.

 It seemed like everyday would just pile onto the previous and I began feeling overwhelmed. When I got this feeling I had no one to turn to my ""friends"" mocked me, my parents were so caught up in their bullshit to notice/ truly care and my sibling was off loving on their own. I was so FUCKING lonely. It got bad enough to where I'd play a ""game"" with myself in ever classroom finding how many ways I could kill myself (3rd period had the most ways). Every night I'd lay my head down I'd think of all the things that my ""friends"" and parents said and would try to understand why I was the problem and I'd end up crying myself to sleep most nights wishing, hoping and praying tomorrow would be different. But it never was. 

It was in these moments of loneliness and isolation that I would tell myself I was worthless and that I had no purpose for being. Each and every night this tape would play in my head over and over and over and over again causing me to believe it. One night I decided to try cutting myself so I grabbed a box cutter and made a small incision on my wrist. I don't take to it all that much not because it felt bad but because fear of judgement from my friends who would have called me a bitch or a fag for doing so. I vowed to myself that if I wanted relief from the pain I'd go straight to ending my life. 

One of the most vivid days was when I was at school and friend A said ""Dontwantfriendstokno nobody here even likes you"" in front of 10 others. I retorted ""Friend B likes me. *I look at friend B* and there is a crushing silence followed by a bunch of averted gazes. I walked away from that in shame and came home from school. I greeted my mother and she asked me for a dish rag so I oblige her but accidentally give her a dish towel. She proceeds to yell at me for two hours telling me how I don't love her and that I'm teaming up with my father to convince her she's crazy and how I'm hiding her belongings throughout the house. After her tirade I sit the confused and crying feeling alone and trapt in a box that's closing in on itself all while pulling my being in to a place where light can't escape. I take a sharp hunting knife I got from my father years prior and press it to my throat and stand there for 10 minutes sobbing and debating whether to do it or not.

My plan wasn't very well thought out at all. I was going to slit my throat and bleed out and be gone. What I neglected was the horrible agony that would occur after I cut myself. Or that is be left with a very visible scram if I were to survive. Also, I never made a note because I felt that I'd be able to create more pain in those that have hurt me by having them not know why

 Being on the edge happened to me many times and I always pulled back. The one thing that held me back was the thought that if I kill myself now I'd also be killing future me as well and future me could be amazing. 

It's been three years since I've last thought about killing myself and I'm so glad I didn't. I can now look back on what has happened to me with gratitude because of the pain that I have become immeasurably stronger. 

If you've made it this far and have read everything congrats. I'd give you a cookie but there appears to be two screens blocking us :/

TL;DR was depressed and suicidal and now grateful for the pain because it made me who I am today

13,"Im 21 and my mom suffers from bipolar, multiple personality. She is very controlling and Narcissistic. Growing up she always expected 100% results all the time and if something goes wrong she would be really upset and beat me up every-time. Ive always tried my best and was in depression for about 10 years of my life. She always cares of what the society thinks of our family and the reputation we have to maintain. It is never about me , its always about what people think of us. I was never allowed to make friends or have friends as i was told she is everything and i don't need anyone else. I was sent to a different country to ""prove a point"" to the society. I love living away from her but i need to talk to her an hour every morning and night over a video call and its always some drama or the other. She makes me feel like she owns me and i owe her my life and i have nothing to do but to serve her. She thinks i have nothing to worry about and its ok to give me shit every morning and evening and Im here struggling with a job and being a junior in engineering school. She always scares me that she will take away sponsorship and i will have to go back home and stay with her if i ever answer her back. I pretty much cry every night to bed because of the shit she gives me. She shows me tantrums I'm her boyfriend and her mother and she knows it but still continues to do it. I just wish i had a normal mother and this phase of my life would be over soon. Its always about her , she never asks me how I'm doing or what I'm up to, its always always about her. Every time i buy myself something she gets mad that i didn't buy her the same when she doesn't even need it. This sucks and I'm scared if I'm gonna inherit any of her qualities.

15,"When I was a child, I never really had much trouble socializing. I mean, I didn't necessarily get along with everyone and people thought I was ""weird"" (whatever that means), but it wasn't really a problem. I could make small talk with strangers and I got along well with my friends most of the time.

Cue high school. During my sophomore year, I started participating in my school's theatre department and became really popular, both among the drama dep. and the school in general. This was largely due to being a semi-talented actor and a lot of (almost attention-seeking) shenanigans. Things like starting a religion, almost being murdered because of it, participating in a male beauty pageant (it was more of a parody of beauty pageants) and winning it.

At first, it wasn't bad. I could talk to pretty much anyone about whatever the conversation lead to, and I was pretty extroverted. I spent all of my free time around my friends, and made as many friends as possible. I really had a good time for a while there. I think a lot of this was due to my best friend being extremely extroverted and also bipolar, which brought me to developing some of the manic-related habits of his.

But then during my junior year, I moved out, and quickly spiraled into a pit of alcohol abuse and depression. I was already doing drugs and drinking before moving out of my parents' house, but the freedom was daunting. I used all of that freedom to fcking PARTY. ALL THE TIME. Bad idea. I had fun, though, so whatever. I don't drink as much at all anymore, life goes on. Anyway, I was talking to people much, much less and really just found that I wasn't fond of talking to people like I was before.

I then moved a few states away because I was very depressed and needed to improve upon my personal issues, and became extremely secluded. I rarely talked to anyone at all, and when I did I was an abrasive asshole so that people would leave me alone. I thought I was losing my mind, and looking back on that period of my life I think I really was going crazy. It wouldn't be the first time. 

It's been a year since then, and I still haven't rediscovered my previous capability of being able to socialize like a normal fucking human being. I really hate small talk, but even worse, I hate talking to pretty much anyone about anything unless it relates to something intellectual, literature, philosophy, or art related. But it seems as if none of my friends (literally nobody haha! Haha! Life is great, isn't it?) like to talk about those subjects. At all. The only people I could really talk to were teachers, but I just graduated high school so there goes that.

I'm still depressed, but I've been doing much better lately and I feel loads better than I did a year ago.

I feel so fucking lonely. I don't relate to anybody at all and most friends of mine have distanced themselves from me, presumably because I am not who I once was. I feel like I spend any social interaction trying to figure out what the fuck is going on, like people are speaking fcking code to me and I have to decipher it. 

Maybe I was just naive about my inability to actually relate to people beforehand, and now I am more self-aware. Who knows.",01May2017,3
16,"
When I was 16, in February of 2015, I met a man on a website where guys go to jack off to each other via webcam. He was really cute and we exchanged snapchats. He was 22 at the time, and I lied about my age, telling him I was 17. He lived in Mexico, I in Missouri.
We facetimed a lot. Like pretty much every night for hours on end. I was so, so in love with him. He really is a fucking great guy, I couldn't complain about anything at all. 

He found out I had lied about my age and he was pissed but things were okay and we moved on. He visited me here in the states for a night, and he lost his virginity to me.

Then when I was 17, I moved out of my parent's house. For about a month I had my doubts as to whether I still had feelings for Richard or not. He visited again in December, this time for 12 days. It was pretty great, we had a lot of sex and he smoked weed for the first time with me. 

A week after he visited, I told him we should take a break. He was really hurt and then I wound up getting back together with him within two days. We broke up for real after that, and didn't talk until April, when I moved to Texas. 

We started talking again and then dating again. Pretty much the whole time I knew it was a mistake. I didn't have feelings for him anymore, but I was so afraid of hurting him that I didn't want to end it. He visited again in August and I couldn't fake it anymore, especially when he asked me what was wrong. I broke into tears and told him everything I was feeling. He was still in love with me for months and wound up having sex with a lot of random guys to get over me, and got the clap.

He is now dating a guy and he is doing well.

I am not. I am so fucking torn from our relationship and I feel so awful about ever getting back together with him and hurting him further than I already had. I know it's in the past but I cannot seem to think for a second that I won't make the same mistakes in another relationship. That or I will realize again that I am not in love anymore. Richard didn't deserve any of the bullshit I put him through. 

I'm also really anxious, so whenever I do try to talk to guys I wind up reverting the conversation to them a lot by asking questions and generally trying not to talk about myself. 

I think I need time to heal but whenever the time comes that I am ready for a relationship, how the fuck do I do it again?  I don't have much experience with normal relationships, as my last one was almost completely long distance. How do I even talk to guys without fucking it up? How do I do this fucking mating ritual thing that people do called ""flirting"" to attract a potential mate? HoW DO I Do ANYThiNG?

If you respond, thank you.

27,"Is manipulation bad or good?

    Influencing is changing someone’s behavior or mind
    Manipulation is intentionally influencing

When you hear the word manipulation, you may immediately think of negative things. Please don’t.

Manipulation is not bad. People with bad intentions are bad.

We manipulate everything passively without realizing as that's the human's way of going through it's wants and needs ironically. 

Asking for people to see other views, making them understand other views or sharing stories is still a form of manipulation.


Making them either positive or negative by a tone or influence. 

Manipulating others feelings to either good or bad by doing something that helps them or not.

Take your pick ego.

Manipulating our life results, isn't that all our picks? And if we are really honest with it that's what we seek but the truth is it's all subconscious and we aren't aware about most of what plays behind the strings even if we try as our free will is very short lived as it's limited we fall asleep quite often.

28,"So today my earphones broke, again. This is probably the 5th pair I've broken. I was just getting ready to study for my finals when suddenly one side stopped working. As you can see this isn't the first time I've broken something just by using it. 

I've broken 3 power car windows just by winding them down, then they wouldn't wind back up. I've broken 2 laptops just by going on reddit, youtube, and playing games. Harddisks have broken just by me using them. Thumbdrives, wires, and anything technology-related too. If you were to say that it's because I'm clumsy or have butter fingers you'd be wrong too. I never, ever, drop my tech (except for when my S3 accidentally flew out of my hand, but that's a special case). I try my best to care for my things but I guess the universe just doesn't allow me to have nice things.

Every time I break one of these things, I get so depressed and feel so useless as my parents have always fully put the blame on me and never on the item itself. I'm starting to believe that I'm actually [Stanley from spongebob](http://spongebobia.com/spongebob-captures/content/episodes/galleries/100b%20-%20Stanley%20S.%20SquarePants/100b%20-%20Stanley%20S.%20SquarePants%20(023).jpg).

29,"I am painfully aware that these are the problems of an inexperienced, immature college kid but I guess if someone had any insight or advice for a similar situation, it'd really rest my brain.

I've been dating my girlfriend for seven months now and it was amazing for the first few months. We were both happy and in sync, everything was okay. There was a small period in the beginning where she felt insecure that I wasn't as invested in the relationship as she was. She felt clingy, insecure, and that I would get bored of her, but I assured her at the time she was what I wanted.

The irony is now we barely talk anymore . Every one of her fears came true, but it's the other way around. I'm the only one who reaches out, I'm the only one who tries to plan things for us, and I'm the only one who tries to make us work. I feel so clingy and needy but it really does hurt because I find myself struggling when I don't hear from her at least once in a while. We both agreed communication would be our first step for any problem, which worked when she brought anything up. But when I bring up these feelings, she gets upset at me for ""guilt-tripping"" her so I just apologize and back off.

The only reason she talks to me nowadays is she needs me to help her with something or to get something for her. All of these feelings made me think back throughout everything. And it seems all of this stems from the first time I opened up to her and told her a lot about myself. In that, I told her how much she meant to me. That was back in January. It was at that point things took a turn. It's like she knew I needed her so she grew complacent and doesn't feel like she need to put in effort.

So now I feel like I'm in a relationship where I'm being strung along to be there for her on her whim. It's like we're not even in a relationship anymore we just happen to attend the same school and we talk because we have to. She doesn't feel the same way I feel about her. 

So now a big part of me wants to just end it but that's so hard. It feels like everything would go to waste. I don't know what I would do. I'm being mistreated in this relationship but I'd be miserable without it.

For the time being I'm taking her out soon for a break from the chaos of finals. Maybe something will change. Lately when we go out, its because I had to get her to agree to it, and even then we do things in silence and we do things to do things. 

I really wanted us to work. She means a lot to me. But now I feel so used and worthless, and I can't even get her to acknowledge it without being upset. I just want her to treat me better or end things. She insists she wants us to work, but I can't keep doing it if she doesn't change.

Sorry for the emotional rambling, I hope it wasn't embarrassingly naive. If anyone has any insight I'd love to hear it. If not, this was just nice to out somewhere. ",01May2017,1

38,"About two and a half months ago my boyfriend and I moved to a new apartment. Our first day there, we met our neighbor who I'll call Trevor. Trevor is, I would guess, in his late 30's. He lives alone except for his cat, and also works from home, so he is always home basically and I would imagine gets pretty lonely. He's a really really nice guy though, helped my boyfriend carry something really heavy into our place that I couldn't help with, and when there was a big windstorm he knocked on our door and asked if we needed to borrow any flashlights in case the power goes out.

Trevor lives in the adjacent building and our back patios face each other. He's a smoker so we see him out on his back patio very very frequently having a cigarette. Like if we look out our back patio at any given moment, chances are that he's out there smoking. His cat sometimes hangs out on the patio with him.

Early last week, my boyfriend and I were outside grilling dinner on our patio and Trevor was outside smoking. My boyfriend offered him a beer and Trevor said he is trying not to drink because he recently had a beer after 4 years completely sober and had a bad time. He mentioned having some addiction problems in the past. So we left it at that.

Later in the week, on Thursday, I was on the bus on the way home when my boyfriend texted me saying he thinks there's something going on with Trevor. My boyfriend got home and Trevor was on his back patio sitting with his head in his hands and my boyfriend asked if he was ok. Trevor said, ""Not really"" and didn't seem to want to chat so my boyfriend left him alone. He mentioned that Trevor seemed really out of it.

When I got home, I saw that Trevor's blinds to his back patio were closed which I found strange because they are usually open during the daylight hours since he goes outside so frequently. The next day, Friday, when we got home from work the blinds were still closed and we didn't see him at all Friday evening. However, we did see his cat poking his head out between the blinds and looking outside. Trevor would usually open the door to let his cat outside in this case. But no sign of him. The lights in his apartment and on his patio were on though, and I believe had been on since Thursday afternoon.

Saturday morning we left to go camping and came back Sunday evening. We got home and saw that his blinds were still closed, same lights were still on. Cat still occasionally poking his head out to look outside. But still no sign of Trevor. Haven't seen him outside at all.

Today is Monday. This morning we looked out our window to see that the same lights are still on, but no sign of anybody moving around in there. It's getting really weird. We discussed the possibility that he overdosed on something in there, or something happened to him. We think maybe we should let the apartment office know, or maybe knock on the door of his next door neighbor in his building to ask if he has seen or heard from him.

It is very strange because we see this guy outside 20 times a day. Now neither of us has seen him in 4 days (granted we were camping Saturday morning to Sunday evening but still). We are trying to tread carefully and not seem like we're all up in his business but we're worried.",01May2017,2

46,"The most famous Jew of all time spent his entire life warning everyone to watch out for the kind of people that would call themselves by His name 2,000 years later. 

He told stories of good Samaritans in an effort to get us to see the good in foreign people with different beliefs. He encouraged the rich to give all their money to the poor. He made prostitutes feel welcome, invited dwarves to his home for dinner, healed the sick, and asserted the values of humility, compassion, and kindness. He condemned adultery, tax evasion, and lying. His father commanded us not to make graven images. 

Now ""his followers"" are not His followers at all. 81% of Evangelical Christians in The United States have built an alter at feet of an Anti-Christ figure. The exact opposite of my Jesus Christ. 

They worship a man who literally builds golden towering idols to himself. We know he has cheated on all 3 of his wives. We know he bragged about abusing the tax code in a televised debate. We can't even count the lies he spews on a daily basis. He doesn't associate with ""losers,"" he makes fun of fat women on Twitter. He doesn't heal the sick, he does crass impressions of the handicapped. He doesn't use his money for good, he rips off contractors he agreed to pay.

This guy is so comically full of himself he used his ""charity"" to purchase a $10,000 portrait of himself, and bragged that his tower would be the tallest in New York when the World Trade Center came down. This isn't a man who practices humility, compassion, or kindness. 

But he's not the problem. American Evangelical Christians from Kansas, Ohio, etc. know there are money grubbing real estate tycoons in NYC. They know about casino owners in Atlantic City. They know that tacky resorts and golf courses exist and are operated by billionaire scumbags. 

They never thought these guys were on their side until 2016. They never believed a Donald Trump type was anywhere near a representation of their principles. It's hard to trust a man who cheated on three wives. It's hard to imagine a perverted bikini contest and gambling purveyor belongs in the White House. 

But somehow they were duped, conned, bamboozled into thinking this morally bankrupt, crass, walking spray tan was the man to stand up for them and their values because he wore a bright red had with a four word slogan they liked. 

That's the problem in this country. Not that rich con men exist, but that people are dumb enough to put them in charge.

I am deeply embarrassed on behalf of the people I expected to see through this haze. I never thought any of us would rally behind such a blatant un-Christ-like self righteous schmuck. 

Those who still support Donald Trump have a false sense of integrity the rest of us grossly overestimated. We thought you were good at at least recognizing goodness. You're terrible at it. Your Great Leader will tell you up is down and left is right, the media will correct him, and you'll call the truth a lie. It's over for you now. Stop calling yourselves Christians. You're Trumpians now. 

When John was exiled to an island and warned in Revelation that one day a rich and powerful man with Anti-Christ values would trick people into believing he is worthy of worship above all, he was talking about this moment, right now. You're a coal minor in Pennsylvania or a nurse in Oklahoma. You've been tricked by a real estate mogul from New York, and it's painfully obvious to the rest of us. It hurts to watch you hurt yourself and everyone else in an effort to put our country on a path in the opposite direction of Jesus' teaching, then claim His name as motivation. 

If you're part of the mere 16% of Evangelicals who did not vote for Trump, please continue to use the Lord's name in prayer. The rest of you keep Christ out of your mouths and bow to the Golden Calf on Wall Street. Don't actually expect to get in the Penthouse of the tower to heaven though, you probably don't look good enough in a bikini.

48,"Just as the text says. I made a throwaway account for this not sure why but it seemed like the best thing to do. 

I have an amazing girlfriend. She is beautiful both inside and out, she takes care of me, she doesn't mind that I am very narcissistic and constantly love to gloat about how great I am, she loves to cook which I do not, she is outdoorsy just like me, she is loving, and kind and compassionate, her sex drive matches and surpasses my own. She is perfect in every sense of the word. We have been together for almost a year and have been co-habitating for about 6 months as she has taken to living at my apartment. We have plans to move in together later this year. I love my girlfriend and would be glad to spend the rest of my life with her.

Except ...

I have a room mate. My room mate is one of my best friends. She has lived with me twice now and both times there has always been a connection between us that is definitely more than a room mate bond. The first time we lived together was almost 4 years ago and she left to move in with her boyfriend. I chalked it up to just being in my head and let it  pass as surely I would never get another chance to find out if there was something romantic to be had between us. Well last year she and her now ex-husband divorced and she moved back home. She was living with a mutual friend of ours and when my lease with my (at the time) room mates was ending I suggested perhaps we could once again live together. She gladly accepted and we have been living together ever since.

I am in love with my room mate. I have been since we lived together four years ago and I am in love with her now. I have no idea if she reciprocates the feelings and don't have a clue as to how to handle the situation. 

Can anyone give me some advice on this? Am I just being an asshole leading my girlfriend on until I find something better? ",01May2017,0

50,"I have been pretty depressed, and for a while there I thought I was actually losing my mind. 

But lately I have been feeling better. Bit by bit. 

I'm not suicidal anymore, that's for sure. When I get really depressed, I like to think it's just because life is kicking my ass. But that's bullshit. The fact that I am still standing is testament to the fact that I am making it. It's when I give up and kill myself that life wins. For right now, I'm winning. No matter what shit life throws at me, I am the one that is making it through, I'm the one that is still alive after all of it. 

If you haven't read Existentialism is a Humanism by Jean-Paul Sartre, I suggest that you do. Basically it says that none of us are born anything, none of us are victim to circumstances. We make ourselves, we choose our own path in life. The hero isn't born a hero, he makes himself a hero through his heroic actions. A coward isn't born a coward, he makes himself a coward through cowardly deeds. 

I am making my path. I am choosing not to be a victim to circumstance (my mental health), I am working toward getting through it because only then will I have won. Only then will I have proven myself against a challenge, and bettered myself by making it through something as difficult as this.


Godspeed.

51,"Two months ago from today, it hit me that I was graduating.  It was the first good sunny day in a while after enduring winter.  I saw a light at the end of the tunnel that would free me from my shackles made of homework.  But it was also the first day to the rollar coaster I've been on for two months, trying to figure out where I'll go and end up after college.  I'm confident that I know the answer to that question now, but that's not why I'm here writing and venting.  It's just baggage I've been carrying for weeks that I can physically feel I don't hold anymore.

No, I'm mostly here to vent about my vertigo, I'm dizzy as hell right now but I can walk just fine.  I've been working out more than normal and it's been messing with me a little bit.  I feel like I'm really high even tho I've been sober for a while now.  I feel weird, but not uncomfortable.  Changed.  And I want to embrace that.  The fact that I'm fortunate to have my SO, to have the family I do, to be able to do the things I can.  I've realized we won't always have this life, these bodies, and maybe I've been reading too much Eckhart Tolle lately, but we (us beings) are so fortunate. 

I always have thought about what experience someone else is having and I'm missing out on.  Like sitting on a beach or living hardships of a third country.  Our toilet was out of commission for a couple days and after that, it made me realize not to think about what I am and am not experiencing compared to others, but just to focus on what is already going on in front of me.  I live in a beautiful area, surrounded by beaitiful souls, and I shouldn't take that for granted, constantly looking into the future for something better when I am in a place and space that is best for me.  And I'm slowly waking up to that.  Everyone is different so what is best for them, whatever experience that is, may not be best for me at this moment in time.  

I know I'm rambling at this point, but I figured if I'm coming to this realization, it could help someone else realize too.  It's not a cliche when people say your journey is your own.  And I don't know why I'm realizing this.  Part of it is I'm hearing these two middle-aged women gossip at work about people they know like they should really care if so-and-so is moving, as if they should get mad at that news.  I've never seen people get mad at each other for moving but then again, my family encourages each other to move away all the time. 

Overall, revelations will probably happen a lot over the next year, all I know is my anxiety with classes and homework has disappeared going through this last week.  It feels beautiful and I just wanted to share.  Thanks for your time to read all of this and cherrish your journey. ",01May2017,2

54,"I didn't really know where to post this but I'm hoping someone​ here can help.

I found a kitten in my yard, looks a month old, maybe a week older or so. She looks healthy, but she can't stand up or lift her head much. Her eyes are alert and focused, but she isn't making much noise; when I first found her, she was lethargic and a bit wet where she'd been lying on the grass (rained a lot last night), and she cried a lot.

After cleaning her up,
 and giving her some water in a dropper, I put the kitten in a blanket on top of a heating pad that I'm regularly checking to make sure it doesn't get too hot. I tried to get her to nurse from my cat, who has ~3 week old kittens, but she just wiggled feebly and wouldn't eat.

She seems better right now, but still pretty weak and mews very softly.

Anyway, my point is, I have no idea what's wrong. The most likely theory is a combination of dehydration and trauma. She doesn't appear to be in any pain but I've always found it hard to tell with cats, I applied gentle pressure all over with no sign of discomfort.  I would take her to the vet but I literally have $3 to my name right now. I'm doing what I can, but it'd help if I could figure out what's wrong and make sure I'm on the right track in terms of home treatment.

Also, I know what fading kitten syndrome looks like and I can't rule that out just yet. She's not really lethargic or limp and she tries to crawl but she's just too weak to get very far.

I know your major doesn't decide your fate forever and some people don't even get a job in their area of study, but right now I feel anxious because I don't even know what classes to sign up for. I'll be a junior next fall so I still have time, and I would really appreciate advice on how to narrow down my interests and pick something to study.

This has been on my mind for a while. I've been talking to my parents about it, and they tell me not to worry, and that I can check out the career services center at school when I get back, but I'm afraid of failing and ending up working somewhere I hate for the rest of my life. I want to do something I love and look forward to most days. Any help on how to discern my area of study is welcome. Thanks guys",01May2017,2

**Andrew Jackson's Speech to Congress on Indian Removal** 


""It gives me pleasure to announce to Congress that the benevolent policy of the Government, steadily
pursued for nearly thirty years, in relation to the removal of the Indians beyond the white settlements is
approaching to a happy consummation. Two important tribes have accepted the provision made for
their removal at the last session of Congress, and it is believed that their example will induce the
remaining tribes also to seek the same obvious advantages.

 
The consequences of a speedy removal will be important to the United States, to individual States, and
to the Indians themselves. The pecuniary advantages which it promises to the Government are the least
of its recommendations. It puts an end to all possible danger of collision between the authorities of the
General and State Governments on account of the Indians. It will place a dense and civilized population
in large tracts of country now occupied by a few savage hunters. By opening the whole territory
between Tennessee on the north and Louisiana on the south to the settlement of the whites it will
incalculably strengthen the southwestern frontier and render the adjacent States strong enough to repel
future invasions without remote aid. It will relieve the whole State of Mississippi and the western part of
Alabama of Indian occupancy, and enable those States to advance rapidly in population, wealth, and
power. It will separate the Indians from immediate contact with settlements of whites; free them from
the power of the States; enable them to pursue happiness in their own way and under their own rude
institutions; will retard the progress of decay, which is lessening their numbers, and perhaps cause them
gradually, under the protection of the Government and through the influence of good counsels, to cast
off their savage habits and become an interesting, civilized, and Christian community.

 
What good man would prefer a country covered with forests and ranged by a few thousand savages to
our extensive Republic, studded with cities, towns, and prosperous farms embellished with all the
improvements which art can devise or industry execute, occupied by more than 12,000,000 happy
people, and filled with all the blessings of liberty, civilization and religion?


The present policy of the Government is but a continuation of the same progressive change by a milder
process. The tribes which occupied the countries now constituting the Eastern States were annihilated
or have melted away to make room for the whites. The waves of population and civilization are rolling
to the westward, and we now propose to acquire the countries occupied by the red men of the South
and West by a fair exchange, and, at the expense of the United States, to send them to land where their
existence may be prolonged and perhaps made perpetual. Doubtless it will be painful to leave the
graves of their fathers; but what do they more than our ancestors did or than our children are now
doing? To better their condition in an unknown land our forefathers left all that was dear in earthly
objects. Our children by thousands yearly leave the land of their birth to seek new homes in distant
regions. Does Humanity weep at these painful separations from everything, animate and inanimate,
with which the young heart has become entwined? Far from it. It is rather a source of joy that our
country affords scope where our young population may range unconstrained in body or in mind,
developing the power and facilities of man in their highest perfection. These remove hundreds and
almost thousands of miles at their own expense, purchase the lands they occupy, and support
themselves at their new homes from the moment of their arrival. Can it be cruel in this Government
when, by events which it cannot control, the Indian is made discontented in his ancient home to
purchase his lands, to give him a new and extensive territory, to pay the expense of his removal, and
support him a year in his new abode? How many thousands of our own people would gladly embrace 
the opportunity of removing to the West on such conditions! If the offers made to the Indians were
extended to them, they would be hailed with gratitude and joy.


And is it supposed that the wandering savage has a stronger attachment to his home than the settled,
civilized Christian? Is it more afflicting to him to leave the graves of his fathers than it is to our brothers
and children? Rightly considered, the policy of the General Government toward the red man is not only
liberal, but generous. He is unwilling to submit to the laws of the States and mingle with their
population. To save him from this alternative, or perhaps utter annihilation, the General Government
kindly offers him a new home, and proposes to pay the whole expense of his removal and settlement.""

60,"I don't know if this is the right place for this, but I would appreciate someone to lend an ear, apologies for the long post.

Hello, I'm not sure really where else to turn at the moment. I was reading an ask Reddit thread about secrets, and someone's comment about childhood abuse has suddenly got me thinking, I feel confused and alone and did not know where else to go.

Years ago when I must've been 9 or 8 ( I do not remember when, its pretty likely to have been earlier than that) my brother pressured and forced me into performing sexual acts on him. My brother is two and a half years older than me, and I am also a male. It started when I once walked in on him masturbating, I did not really know what he was doing or why he was doing it, only that it made me feel uncomfortable to be there while he did it. He explained it to me and said it felt good and that I should try it. I don't remember how it escalated from there ( there is a lot of aspects about this I don't remember, partly because it was a long time ago, and I'm sure a lot of it I have blocked out), but basically got to the point where he would pressure and often blackmail me into performing oral sex on him (one time he may have forced himself on me but I'm not sure if that's true because it's all a blur). 
I did not like doing it as it made me extremely uncomfortable, both physically and emotionally. 

Eventually I began to go along with it and became neutral to it, saw it as a thing we did that we both agreed to and wanted to do (despite it only ever being me performing on him, never the other way around). I'm not sure exactly how long it went on for but it stopped eventually. Me and my brother have never discussed it since and I don't plan on it. He is at university and I still live at home so I don't see him that much anymore. We do not have a good relationship and often argue.

I have a lot of issues with myself. I'm addicted to porn and masturbation, I started masturbating extremely early as a result of this experience (I began to masturbate myself to the point of orgasm before I was developed enough to physically ejaculate). This has lead to other problems. I also have a difficult and destructive relationship with food. I'm quite overweight and have a food addiction (binge eat constantly, eat non stop even when not hungry, binge eat, sneak out of the house and eat and use food  as a coping mechanism). I've also had quite bad depression and anxiety from quite an early age ( I'm 18 now but was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was about 12 and have had it ever since, although it has been better the last couple years).

Despite all this I still have doubts and questions. ~I'm not even sure as to the truth of everything I have just said (I can barely remember it) 
~a lot of what happened I eventually went along with and began to see as almost consensual. I feel as though it was as much my idea and fault as his
~ he was not very old either, does this mean we're both to blame? Did I decide and want to do these things too?
~ is this the source of my issues at the moment? Or am I just a lazy broken person looking for an excuse?
~ how deeply has this affected me, am I damaged? Am I changed as a person?
All of these questions are weighing heavily on me and making me question my entire life at the moment. I feel very lonely and would like some thoughts or advice on my experience and someone to lend an ear. ",01May2017,2
62,"Not tryna hate even though I know that this is gonna get major hate, but I was raised by an immigrant family that struggled their whole life to get me to where I am. Blowing my chances at a school that doesn't ""feel right"" is just a luxury I would rather pass up then not doing everything I can to make sure I can make the most of my future and live up to my potential. I understand financial aid, and I'm ready for the downvotes but this is just how I feel. ",01May2017,0
63,"I am posting this because I need to process and my friends listen to me way too much. I also tried posting this on r/relationships but the mods suggested this instead.

OK so I recently caught my husband cheating on me with a co-worker who lives out of state. Out of respect for him I'll only say we have a counselor and we are working hard on our marriage. He's remorseful and trying to make it right. We still might not make it but we are trying.

Part of making amends to me (his words) is pledging transparency. There is a lot I don't want or need to know, but I did ask a few things, and he told me.

This poor girl is a mess. She's an alcoholic. My husband told me that she was drunk nearly his whole visit when he flew out to see her. He tried to take her out for a nice dinner, and she was so drunk she could barely stand. Her family is really messed up and mean to each other. She has a lot of emotional problems and she doesn't handle them well and my husband admitted he didn't even like her at all by the time he finally ended things. To top it all off, she just found out she has cancer.

When he called her to end their affair, she got really upset and first tried to plead and beg to keep it going. She even offered to move to where we live just to be with him. She was mad at him for even still being with me. (She for sure knew about me. She got mad at him for having a picture of us in his phone.) Then she got mad and told him he was a bad person and should be ashamed.

I won't excuse my husband for any of this. He says he didn't care about her. He led her on. He hurt her and that's wrong. What I really need to make sense of is why I feel sorry for her. She sounds so fragile and vulnerable and really messed up. I understand how she could start having feelings for someone who showed interest in her. I don't really understand why I empathize with her. Some people on the other sub suggested it was because I'm deflecting or because I just want to feel better than her. I'm willing to own that might be.

tl;dr: I (32f) was cheated on, and the other woman (31f) is sick and hurt and I feel bad for her, but why? Am I just in denial or deflecting? Does it mean I'm a petty person if it is actually because it makes me feel good that I'm not a mess?",01May2017,1
