0,"He was in a horrific accident at the beginning of the year. Responding officers believed he was DOA. 

His survival without maiming or traumatic brain injury is a miracle. I am not religious, he's a lucky motherfucker. He can walk. He knows who we are, he's still my Love. 

He's had debilitating headaches on the side of his head where there was the most visible injury to the skin. 

Due to the main issues of his accident being spinal fractures, they didn't stress his head too much. He's never had an MRI post accident. (Edit: no cranial MRI, his back got several.)

A few hours ago I noticed that his right pupil was too small. I immediately started to panic. **I know those eyes.** That's new. That's the same side as the headaches and visible injury. My at home tests furthered my worry when that pupil didn't match the other. 

Maybe the left one is too big. Am I leading them astray by focusing on the right eye?? Anyway, this is **wrong**. 

My worry has been kicked into overdrive *because they separated us* and called him back. We've been through a lot in ten years and this has never happened at the hospital. And this was after they just told us it may be a while for a bed, and he went back minutes later. 

I have no one to talk to. My family is my focus. They mean everything to me. I'm spiraling into a panic attack and I don't know what to do.

Update 1: We came home, no bleed or clot seen with CT. His pupils are still different sizes, and our oldest can tell too. They'll dilate and constrict but it's just off, they're not relatively equal. He feels fine, just exhausted from a stressful day. Getting in contact with his primary doctor tomorrow, not sure what to expect.",17Nov2017,84

7,"Growing up I attended a pretty preppy private school. I was there from kindergarten all the way to 8th grade. I had a really wonderful, privileged life with a great group of friends almost the entire time. Late in my career at this school I suffered a very traumatic injury which required multiple surgeries, during the worst of which I required 7 blood transfusions. I almost certainly would have died if not for some incredible luck and timing.

When I returned to school months later things had changed in a very bad way. My group of friends had at first been very supportive but over time they drifted away from me. I had trouble making new friends and became very socially awkward. Over time I started being bullied, it always hurt, but it didn't ever really strike deep until one day a kid started to tell me that he wished that I had died (he said it in a much more hurtful way than that, but if I use the words he said anyone who was in the school will immediately know who I and him are). He didn't just say it once though he said it many, many times. Over the course of my last year and a half at that school he probably averaged saying it 5 times a day. If I opened my mouth to speak he would interrupt me and say it. Eventually, other people started to say it to me as well, and before long I was crying in my room every day wishing that I didn't have to go to school. I would pretend to be sick for weeks to try to avoid my classmates, but my parents would always send me back. I was too broken at this point to tell them what I was going through and when I finally did years later it about broke their hearts.

A couple of years after I left that school I went to a party for one of my very old friends (from the group that had drifted apart from me). This person was there and the first thing he said when he saw me was, ""Hey, didn't we used to say ..... to you? Holy shit that was funny.""

That was the last time that I saw him.

I heard about a month ago through a strange circumstantial conversation that he had killed himself. Apparently he was attending an Ivy League School, was very loved by all those around him. His obituaries read like love letters and are written by his professors, family, and friends alike. They all seem very sad. But when I heard the news I laughed, I laughed for about 30 minutes, and since that day I have found myself daydreaming about his death multiple times a week. It feels kind of wrong to be so happy about someone's death. But I am.",17Nov2017,355

11,"I have posted a lot before about my issues and I have no idea what I am doing anymore but I just feel like I should post it on here.

Im 22, never been in a relationship or have gotten past kissing and I feel like a joke. I have been rejected so many times and lead on by many girls. The last girl I was seeing for a month a year ago accused me of talking to other girls, women I interviewed with, kept ending it over texts and coming back to me on her own, lied to me, told me to keep our ""relationship"" a secret but told people we knew about us, among other things. We stayed ""friends"" for months following all of that until early this year after she treated me like shit for actually moving on from her and not giving her attention and blaming me for all of the problems we had. She is now seeing the guy she told me not to worry about back then and that guy was also supposed to be a friend of mine that I confided in about our relationship and my own things.

Their whole friend group is ok with them but back then even her friend would joke about how I was seeing other girls, none of it was true. I stressed out so much about our relationship and did not think of any other girl than her, I still cant after all this time. Im stuck seeing them on campus together, all happy and I feel like its all my fault somehow, I dont even know how. I feel like a joke, like I just am the kind of guy no girl will ever take seriously and just use for attention and then end up giving another guy an actual chance and start dating them instead. I just get rescheduled with but that they are really interested in seeing me, that they have feelings for me but they arent ready to go on a date, they flirt with me to keep my attention on them, etc. 

I cant even get rejected up front, I just get lead on and disrespected and treated like Im a shitty person. If all those girls just rejected me then I could handle that but I just get used for attention while some other guy gets to actually be with them, date them, spend time with them, have a nice time with them, etc. I end up figuring it all out too late before I eventually walk away and then they get mad at me for not staying as if I am an asshole. I keep telling myself that I am not good enough, not man enough like those guys that the girls always end up with after me. That no amount of work I put into myself will ever change how they treated me or will ever be enough for them. I dont want to be anyone elses joke, I dont want to be used for attention, I dont want to be a problem to anyone if I am, I dont want to get in the way of another girl being with a guy that is worth it, I dont want to try dating or anything regarding relationships or sex anymore. 

I feel worthless, I cant even get over this girl I dated for a month about a year ago and I have yet to a see a girl that compares to her. Im also about to be 23 and I have basically no experience. Im an anxious, low self esteem, overthinking, desperate, too accomodating, too caring loser and I am just becoming more offputting the older I get. I wanted to have some relationships before I settled down so I could understand and experience how things work and so I know I was fully satisfied with who I ended up with. I dont see that ever happening because even  if someone is desperate enough for me 30 years from now I will always wonder what if I was better and had more experiences and that will not satisfy me. I just want to give up on all of that for the rest of my life because I will never be good enough.

I want to improve all of my flaws though so I can live an ok life and not mess up my career. I just want to be able to live on my own, comfortably and retire with enough to maintain myself. If I fix my flaws I may be able to not mess up my job just enough for all of that and its all I will ever have going for me. I wish I was better overall but I will never be good enough, I just need to reach the level necessary for my career and that should be enough. I have talked to a counselor but the sessions ended and now I will look for another one in a few weeks and I might take anti anxiety medication, not sure yet. I am about to go to the gym to work out but I needed to get that out first. Thank you if you read this.",17Nov2017,1

20,"I recently turned on ""posts disappear after voting"" and stopped using the next button. I've realized a couple different things I want to talk about. These thoughts also rely on the fact that a post needs to be upvoted quickly to reach the front page.

The algorithm doesn't show me posts I care about. To clear my front page, I have to vote on everything. Most of the articles I wouldn't read, but I could upvote them based on the title. I think there's actually a reason behind that. The time sensitivity of upvoting punishes titles that actually make you want to read because then you don't vote quickly.

The rank of something has nothing to do if it is real. In order for a vote to matter it has to be immediate, with no time for judgement. In any askreddit thread about girls, you can't trust the highest upvoted comment to be representative of reality. It's representative of what people want to see, the way people want the world to be.

I wonder what would happen if Reddit used engagement time like YouTube. What kind of content would reach the front page? Would it be quality, long-form informational content? or car-wreck can't turn away. Maybe posters would just move to compilations of the same short attention span crap. Maybe there's not an algorithmic solution.

I try to stick to mostly small subreddits now. Shows I watch, succulents, marijuanaenthusiasts, askhistorians. In a small community you can trust the posts differently. What's visible isn't what pleases the hivemind, it's what people decide to post. I trust the conscious decision of one person much more than the instantaneous reactions of thousands. You can also have a real conversation in the comments, not a fight to draw more attention.

I've unsubscribed from some of larger subreddits. but I'm not sure about a lot of the ones I'm still subscribed to. I like space. But I don't know if I'd read anything on /r/space.

22,"Not sure of where to put this, thought this might be the best place. 

By alone, I mean in a romantic sense. Enjoying solitude, wanting to be alone forever voluntarily. 

Recently left a long-term relationship and it didn't end well because of various issues, which include insecurities and emotional baggage. After realising that these issues were there, decided that it's better for me to stay away from commitment. Can't deal with another person. Not in a mentally stable place myself and even if I were, the idea is extremely off-putting. Makes me want to leave, can't deal with additional stress. This problem doesn't happen with friends because there isn't the expectation of strong attachment. It's relaxed. No need to care about all the things involved in a relationship. Hate drama so I avoid it when I can. 

I understand the appeal of marriage and having a happy family, but I don't think I can handle it. I'd want to leave if it gets too overwhelming with issues or stay detached to not have to deal with the stress as much if problems arise. Tried relationships and I can't even handle that, can't imagine marriage and spending my life with another person in that way. People can tell me 'You're still young and you have time to figure yourself out' and I still wouldn't be open to the idea of 'figuring myself out'. It's exhausting. Not worth messing up my mental health and dealing with uncomfortable emotions just for the niceness of a relationship. 

So I was thinking of non-commitment if I feel like it, even though I was opposed to the idea at first. I say 'if' because I prefer the idea of not associating with anyone in that way at all. Wouldn't have to deal with the stresses of a relationship, which is nice. The idea of being alone appeals.

Tl;dr - The idea of a relationship is stressful. Was wondering if anyone felt the same way and decided to spend their life alone, closing off to the idea of relationships. ",17Nov2017,1

30,"This is my life so far, summarised in dot-points:

1. Find a friend group.
2. Think I'm similar to them.
3. Hang out with them for 1-3 years.
4. They find me annoying/I do something stupid, I have no friends for 5-6 months.
5. Repeat.

I'll talk about the most recent one. I found a friend group that DIDN'T find me annoying, and actually DID share my interests. I was friends with them up until a few months ago. So, a new student came into our class, and I had to show him around the school, guide him, et. cetera.  He joined our little friend group, and things were going fine, on second glance. But at the time, I felt like he was ruining my friendships, because they stopped talking to me, and started talking to him. So I started acting really aggressively to this person, so they did it back in retaliation. Again, it got so bad that I had no friends for multiple months.

Eventually, we made up. We both apologised, and we're pretty much fine with each other now. But now, I'm stuck. After about 3-4 months of being separated from my original friend group, I found another. They aren't that similar to me, but it seems that a few of them don't find me annoying (like most,) so I stay there. The problem is, two of them actually do find me annoying - REALLY annoying. Common complaints I've heard are:

- I talk too much.
- I say my opinion where it's not needed.
- I have an annoying voice.
- I'm a know-it-all (I get A's)
- and a bunch others.

Should I change these things about me? I want to stay in that friend group because a few of them DON'T find me annoying, but the ones that do really put me down, and I want to return to the original one. I just feel that if I one day decide to leave the second one and return to the first, it'll be awkward - and I'm pretty much inept at dealing with awkward situations... any recommendations on what I should do?",17Nov2017,1

54,"Hello there,

Twenty-three year old gay English college student here. For the past few months, my self-esteem has considerably improved and I'm thankful to say I feel useful in society. Moving out on my own has also helped boosted my self-esteem since I can go wherever I need to on foot (in a small town). But something I have noticed is that I'm in a situation where there are literally no struggles for me to worry about. Nothing feels ""necessary"" for me to accomplish to be happy.

I claim to want to be an animated director yet as long as I write and complete my dream fanfiction on paper, why do I care? I could easily get sex on Grindr but why bother with that when masturbating is easier and doesn't get me a STD? I can learn how to drive but it's not like it is hard to walk to wherever I need to go. A high-paying career would be nice but I already have enough to live under to pay for rent, electricity, food, Internet, and clothing as long as I budget well. It's a small town, but then again, anything beats living in the middle of nowhere.

Repeat that with basically everything and you have where I am at now, a comfortable yet unremarkable life. No one has a problem with it but it's obvious I'm not at my full potential. And why should I if I'm already happy?

Sometimes I wonder if this is a ""right"" way to live. While I do have things that I want, I don't feel the need to go after it. Even the one story that I'm dying to work on can simply be done a couple years from now after school without fanfare. Why bother setting expectations when things are not broken? I feel like an ""all or nothing"" person, either shoot for the stars or accept just enough to get me by.

58,"I'm sure my situation has something to do with longing for my sometimes over-critical father's approval growing up. Or perhaps it has to do with being raised in an alcoholic home where there was frequent verbal and physical abuse between my parents. (I, of course, repeated the cycle by marrying an alcoholic who didn't actually start drinking until 4+ years into our marriage. He went on to end up in jail multiple times, physically abuse his second wife, lose jobs, etc.).

I just ended an 8+ year relationship with a person who is caring and generally kind in many ways. We've been off and on for several of those years, ""best friends"" (with benefits/extreme sexual chemistry), etc., mainly because I knew it would be a really unwise move to marry him. It would be easy to point the finger and say, ""Well, he's another addict,"" because he is, of a different type (nicotine, porn, financial chaos, general immaturity). But here's the thing: I'm an addict, too. I've been addicted (for basically my entire life, I think) to attention, approval and validation from men. The clarity is really hitting me at this stage of life, when I'm aging out of the biological ""need"" for a man (i.e. to have babies), and I'm not a hot young thing anymore (which is a relief in many ways, but that's another post entirely). It's been a spiritual and psychological issue for decades, to the point where it almost feels like a hard-wired part of my identity.

I hope the damage isn't permanent. As the daughter, sister, mother and aunt of men, I don't hate men at all. I just can't seem to figure out how to have a healthy, mature, joyful, honest relationship, and that's kind of...embarrassing. (I have figured out that I need to avoid the male midlife crisis guys completely for now--between my issues and theirs, there's just too much drama--but that's also another post entirely). The thing is, I'm not sure I will ever again trust my own judgement where romantic love is concerned. In most ways, I am very tuned in to my gut, but there's something that happens when that pull of attraction takes hold. And too often in my life, it's taken me down pitch black roads in the bad parts of town. I've lost years of emotional and psychological well-being to this addiction.

For those of you who have overcome the need for others' approval, specifically in a romantic way, how did you do it? Is there hope for the rest of us?

TL;DR I'm realizing at midlife that my need for men's approval has been toxic for decades. I want to change.

59,"So, I’m not really 100% certain if I’ll find a valid answer here or not, or if this is just me venting and about to ramble on for lengths of page, however, I know sometimes good can come from asking the abyss. At any rate, here is a short version of a much longer story. What I would really appreciate is advice, and while I know some of my choices in life may not be for the best, I cannot change nor alter my emotion. 

At best, I’m a very nihilistic person. I’ve been this way for 10+ years now, and it’s not getting any better. I am married, what I would say is unhappily married at this point. I’ve been very disconnected from most of my relationships in life, and this includes family, friends and relationships. I am going on 28 years old and I feel like I am still at square one when it comes to life in general. I see no good in it, I see no reason to complete this said journey of enlightenment (and no, one is not contemplating suicide, just merely stating a fact). I thought I was happy for awhile, but as luck would have it, with my spouses new promotion, they’ve become more and more focused on the monetary gain in the world and I myself have always been a minimalist at heart. I’ve been to therapy, I am on anti depressants, and still, I feel this sense of discourage. 

I have a few hobbies I like, I work as a supervisor in a decent company so it’s not as though I have regrets regarding work or where my time is spent. I just feel like something is wrong with me. I feel like I don’t belong here. I have zero contact with any of my family (this was my choice, longer story, they’re not the most savory or the most sane people in the world...), I have very few friends as my trust issues will not go away, nor do I foresee them ever dwindling. 

Right now, I live a very easy life. And for that I am fortunate. But is an easy life a good life? I feel like the world has just become so materialistic and I feel like the very thing I thought would make me happy has turned into just another pawn in the corporate game. Then I’m told by said spouse I need to make more friends, and I start trying to hang out with a mutual friend of ours more and she gets angry considering th mutual friend is of the opposite sex and I’m assuming they’re jealous? Even though I’m fairly certain they have no interest in that regard towards myself. 

I am not sure. I’m just at a loss as to how to move forward anymore. I’ve been riding through the motions most of my life and to be up front and honest, I’m about sick of it. I realize what I have and I am thankful for it, but, what is life if you’ve not really lived. Therapy hasn’t helped, the meds don’t seem to be helping (and I’ve tried a few), is there just something wrong with me? Why do I feel as though I don’t belong in th very world I was born into?

63,"I can't find a mental state where I can exist comfortably. I can't hold any beliefs for longer than a minute, as I constantly play out arguments in my head for and against whatever position I take at that moment. Neither side wins. I don't like this. I don't know how to just exist comfortably. I think I need a bigger purpose to exist but there isn't one. What can I do?",17Nov2017,1

68,"I've never really felt sad over a ""celebrity"" death before but Lil Peep was by for my favorite artist. I loved his music and his personality and I saw him 3 times this year in concert. His music was so unique and I loved the blend of rap and emo. I started listening to him last summer when he only had 73k on instagram and today he passed 1.5 million. Its sad he had to die to gain this level of notoriety. I didn't know him personally but I felt like he was my friend. We were the same age. I have been crying a lot over it and haven't been able to sleep. It was so obvious he was sick with addiction and mental illness and everyone wanted a piece of him. I don't think he truly wanted to die I think it was an accident but I wish he could have seen his true worth and how much he was loved by me, his fans and his friends. He really made me feel like it was okay for me to be myself and to be excited about it. I think him dying has rocked everyone's world especially those who follow hip hop and see how prevalent ""xanax"" culture is and I hope that somehow this will push some kid out there to seek help. A lot of people have been saying terrible things about him and mocking him but he was an advocate for mental health, lgbtq, equality, and talked about things like toxic masculinity which aren't exactly talked about in hip hop. I wish people weren't so harsh because of his drug use and would just have sympathy that a real person just died. I just thought he was a fascinating, beautiful human and a piece of me will definitely never be the same ;( ",17Nov2017,1
70,"Throwaway.

Geeky, chubby, virgin college freshman.

I told some gamer girl that I would wreck her in a board game last week. We said winner would make the loser do whatever they want.

An hour later, she won and said I have to run across campus next Friday night at 10:00 pm ""wearing nothing but your tighty-whities, which I'm sure you wear anyway.""

Before you get any ideas, she has a serious, longterm boyfriend.

It was upsetting she guessed correctly on the type of underwear I choose.

As I sheepishly walked out of her dorm last week after losing the game, she grabbed the waistband of my shorts and undies, pulled them back and said:

""Just be lucky I'm letting you cover this cute, round bubble butt with your briefs. I could make ya run back to your dorm NAKED! hahaha""

Does anyone else think she's going too far by having me do this??",17Nov2017,1
