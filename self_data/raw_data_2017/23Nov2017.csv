2,"One of the worst feelings for me is when I realize that talking to someone has insidiously become a part of my every day routine. That I get elated when I receive a message from them, and despite how busy I am I find myself checking my phone often to see if I've gotten one. 

The disappointment I feel when they haven't, when they get slower to reply and fewer between, or the thought that they are talking to other people in the same way and what I have with them isn't anything special. That it doesn't mean as much to them. 

It's one of those stupid emotional things. I tell myself I was perfectly happy before they entered my life- I can be perfectly happy without their attention. Why should it have any effect on me? 

I realize that eventually they'll stop talking to me entirely and it will hurt. 


If only I hadn't gotten so clingy or reliant or let myself care. 

I always feel so foolish and pathetic when I let myself get close to someone.

Please, help everyone to understand and take a stand for what is right!",23Nov2017,2
7,"I had a realization today that many people don't understand what net neutrality is or how it actually applies to them. In thinking of how to explain it I came up with an analogy that should help.

First some background: The Federal Communications Commission released a plan on to dismantle regulations that ensure equal access to the internet, clearing the way for internet service companies to charge users more to see certain content and to curb access to some websites. They expect approval during a meeting scheduled Dec 14th.

Now, the analogy:

Imagine every time you entered your car to go drive somewhere, you had to tell it where you wanted to go before you could leave. Your car always listened for your response and after speaking, allowed you to start driving to your requested destination.  It’s been like this as long as you can remember and you’ve never really questioned why you have to tell it anything. You just do, just part of owning a car. 

One day you get in your car and a message pops up saying  “Would you like to buy a speedpass to get to your destination faster than ever? We can bypass all the other people on the road because you are important! All you gotta do is let my manufacturer repeal regulations that prevents me from doing anything while you drive, and pay me a little extra each month."" So you're thinking.. wow that sounds good, I'm tired of waiting in traffic, and a fast lane sounds amazing."" But they never actually add another lane for the important people, you’re still on the same road, you’re just placed ahead of others. 

After repealing the law that prevents your car from taking action based on your destination; the company who built it decides they could make a little more money if they slowed down your car at certain times. At first it's mostly unnoticeable, but eventually it gets painfully slow. You think it must be the fact that so many people are going to the same place you're going to and it's just getting worse. You never really question that it could be the car manufacturer causing it, and even if you did they would deny it and oh, you don't have proof. So you decide to pay extra to get to work faster, because that's what they advertise. Oh and you want to get to the grocery store faster too, so we'll bundle that in for a small fee.  You still feel alright about the whole situation because you’re going faster than others who didn’t buy the special plans. 

After a while the company that build your car decides their profits just aren't what they could be. They decide it's time to prevent you from going to places, in order to force you to buy one of their bundle plans that allows you through. Their BASE plan allows you to get to work, the grocery store, and out to dinner a few times a week.  Their PLUS plan allows you to go to the theater and concerts.  Of course, it's only a little more if you buy their UNLIMITED plan which allows you to go ANYWHERE superfast! amazing right? I mean, you have to choose one at this point because there is no one to stop them from doing this anymore because the regulation was repealed, and you don’t want to be constrained to specific locations or slowed down to others. 

You decide you should just get the unlimited plan so you can go anywhere. But, the cost of driving the car has just increased significantly.  Although, you used to be able to do this before.. and it didn't cost anything.. what happened? This isn't right!!! You decide you're going ditch this car and get a new one who offers a better cheaper package, except you find out, the company that built it is the only one in your area, if you get rid of it, you won't be able to go anywhere! I mean technically you could walk to work... You and all your friends are now you're stuck in a world that has become used to paying for something that didn't exist before, and things will never go back to the way they were. All because you ignored the long term effects of the regulation repeal. 

In this analogy, your car is actually a network device which inspects your internet traffic, and the company that built it is your ISP. The roads are the connections to and from internet destinations.  Comcast, AT&amp;T, and Verizon (to name a few) are all trying to repeal the Net Neutrality act that was put in place to protect us from their corporate greed.

Please speak up and let your government know that this regulation needs to stay in place for the good of our country. A free internet inspires free thoughts and conversations, something we shouldn’t take for granted. 

Source: I've worked on the devices which make up the internet for 10+ years. I've written firewall policies that block/deprioritize corporate network traffic that interferes with business traffic.  IE:  Block porn, deprioritize youtube\facebook, and greatly limit bandwidth on public wifi

8,"I wish I had gotten to experience a normal high school career. 

I currently live with my husband, his mom, his stepdad, and five brothers. One of which is currently in a relationship that I can’t help but feel... jealous of, as pathetic as it sounds. I love my husband more than anything in the whole wide world and wouldn’t want anyone different. He takes such good care of me. 

Back to the point at hand though, it seems his brother and his girlfriend have the ideal high school relationship and overall experience that I never got. I was a slave to my stepmother. When I wasn’t cleaning house, taking care of horses or doing homework, I simply wasn’t allowed to go hang out with my friends. I wasn’t allowed to go anywhere without an adult until I was 17. I wasn’t allowed to get in a car with my friends unless an adult was driving. I was constantly depressed and suffered by the hands of both my father and my stepmother. I wasn’t allowed to go out with friends, but my dad did let me stay home and smoke pot. So I became a pothead, desperate for every high because it was the only thing that stopped me from killing either myself or my stepmother. I still fucking hate that bitch. 

Tory and Kylee (fake names obviously) are allowed to hang out with each other pretty much whenever they want. Weekends, holidays, after school. They’re allowed to be home alone together and can shut themselves in a room and lock the door without either of the parents even batting an eye. They are happy and healthy and just mad for each other. It’s adorable. They recently went to homecoming and I can’t help but feel immense jealousy that I never got to do those things with my husband because I didn’t meet him until after I graduated. 

I missed out on so many things and experiences because of my abusive dad and step mother, and even my aunt, and I fucking hate it. ",23Nov2017,1

10,"So, I came home from a doctor's appointment a little earlier than I expected, and my older sister was at home alone. As I walked past her room, I noticed that the door was slightly open. I went to knock on the door, when I saw my sister on her bed masturbating, and she had a penis! It was fairly average in size, and there were a pair of balls were they normally would be on a guy. Her ballsack was tense against her body, and I could clearly see that she didn't have a vagina. I left before she could see me staring at her. Does anyone know why my sister has a penis?",23Nov2017,0
11,"I don't even know why I'm telling this. I guess the whole recent shit with Harvey Weinstein and Roy Moore and everyone has me feeling like it's useful to share this. It's probably going to be pretty NSFW, just a forewarning.

I'm a male. I grew up in a very poor home. I'm still fairly poor, but thankfully not living paycheck to paycheck. I remember all through my earliest childhood my father abusing me. At the time I didn't know it was abuse, or consider it such. It was just a thing that happened.

My earliest memory of it was when I was probably 2 or 3. I was on the table where I had my diaper changed, and I'm sure he stuck my finger in my ass. It's less a visual memory than a sensory sort of thing. I remember my ass hurting, and him standing above me.

That sort of thing is like a blur of memories. Do you remember what you ate every lunch for the last year? No. Do you remember what it's like to eat? Yes. Just like that, with a few choice exceptions, I can't specifically remember my father violating me--but I know what it's like to be violated by him. He did it hundreds of times.

For the first several years of my life, it was with his fingers. Occasionally objects. He used my mother's hairbrush, much in the way I've read that girls might use a hairbrush when they first begin experimenting on themselves. He never used lubricant, though he did sometimes use saliva. He never had a concern for how I felt--just how easy it was for him to violate me.

When I was ten, he began fucking me. I know I was ten because it was literally the day after my birthday. I got a Super Nintendo on my birthday, which I loved. The day after, my dad decided I was big enough for him to stick his cock inside me. I was used to being violated. It wasn't anything particularly special. I knew guys got hard and why. The thing I remember most is my expression. I remember the muscles I activated in my face. I can still recreate it, the grimace. It was sort of an open frown. I don't even know if he noticed.

I know he came inside me. I knew what it meant for a man to come a couple years before that, under similar circumstances.

I could keep recounting my experiences, but there's not much to add. The abuse continued until I left home at 16. He died five years ago of a heart attack. I'm not well, of course. I'm an alcoholic. I'm depressed. I have very little money. But at least my father isn't fucking me on a regular basis.",23Nov2017,200
12,"We were just coming out of Singapore and we got a bunch of turbulence. Then the announcer on the plane said, ""There's a couple of planes ahead of us and we haven't heard from them. There are some thunderstorms... just stay buckled up. All flight attendants, please get seated"".

18,"""Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts about internet regulation. I appreciate hearing from you and welcome the opportunity to respond.

According to industry metrics, private investment in the internet has exceeded $1.5 trillion dollars since 1996, leading to the creation of millions of jobs, economic prosperity, and a society where the accessibility of information is at a level unimaginable merely two or three decades ago.

In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission voted in secret to reclassify broadband internet access services as “telecommunication services” under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This allowed the government to regulate the internet under the same rules designed for telephone companies in the 1930s, hampering innovation and growth in that industry for more than fifty years.

The FCC’s 2015 edict requires Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to treat all data traveling over their networks equally, rather than allowing ISPs to customize service offerings with their users and compete for more customers on the basis of quality and price, even if those service offerings include treating some data differently. This essentially imposes a one-size-fits-all business model on the internet and represents an unprecedented government power grab to control and regulate the internet.

I support Chairman Pai’s desire to overturn the FCC’s 2015 mandates, which clearly run contrary to Congressional intent, to better allow Congress to dictate appropriate oversight of the internet through new, thoughtful legislative initiatives.  In fact, I cosponsored S. 993, the Restoring Internet Freedom Act, which would scrap the FCC’s ill-founded interpretation and net neutrality mandates.

Again, thank you for taking the time to contact me. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me again about other issues that are important to you.

Also other that didn’t eat or sleep because they were too sad, I want to make them happy again and make them believe someone care of them a lot. 

I have this friend which we know each other over internet for about 5 months and we talked a lot, she is almost 17 and we are like best friends for each other, she went through many troubles because she believes in people so soon and got hurt. Last night I texted her and she said she isn’t good and she cut herself on the arm every night at 1 am, I said as much as I could to make her feel better and believe that nothing deserves that but she is somehow stubborn and don’t take my advices, she promised me not to do anything last night but this is only for one night and I am scared if she started again, I can’t stop thinking of this and I feel awful for it, she sent a picture of her arm and I couldn’t even look at it for more that 3 seconds, I know I am kinda emotional lately but there were many wounds on her arm.. I don’t know what to do, whatever I say, she know I am right but say “nothing can’t make me stop,” she don’t stop saying that.

So a few years ago my dad was diagnosed with macular degeneration. He just recently got the news that he's likely going to be almost completely blind in 2-4 years. At the moment he can drive and work (he's a corporate consultant) and generally live a ""normal"" life. 

Anyway, I'm looking for resources that can help him transition from being sighted to not. Things like learning brail and setting up his computer and phone to do text to speech sorts of things.

30,"A week ago today I came home from work, let the dogs into the yard, and went about my business. The gate was always shut - nobody ever used it. Why wouldn't it be shut? 

My dog Pig got out and was struck and killed by a car. I found her not too long after a frantic search lying in the cold rain under a streetlight.

It hurts so much, even to this day. I feel guilty even though I know I couldn't control where she went, and that it was all just a monumental accident. My wife and I burried her the next day.

It's hard to wrap your mind around these things when they happen - it's hard to keep going forward when I'd rather have sat down next to the grave we dug and burried her in.

In this, I did write a small piece on her, grief, and my memory of her. Feel free to read it in the link below.

And love and take care of each other. The morning of the day she died I was a half an hour late for work because we were having such a good cuddle. It's hard to believe that was the last time, but I'm glad I chose to make a memory rather than a few dollars in that moment.

If your interested in what I wrote, here it is. I wrote it mostly for myself, as an attempt to heal and work through what's in my mind. Sharing what she meant to me is one of the few things that brings me some amount of happiness in dark times.

i feel homeless. everywhere i’ve gone i’ve tried to fit in, but i am always different and weird and an outsider, or at least it feels that way. i’m tired of running, but it’s all i’m good at. i’m tired of hiding my head in the sand but it’s the only thing i trust myself not to mess up. i don’t work or gel with people very well. i have too many thoughts and emotions, and no matter how busy i keep myself they always resurface with increased intensity. i don’t know. i can’t even think of what to do. i’m not diligent, or disciplined, and i appear not to care about my future, even though it’s the only thing that even remotely motivates me.

and now Net neutrality threatens to disappear, putting at risk the only place i have ever found fit to share my real feelings and not get shut down. the only place i feel safe. at home.
