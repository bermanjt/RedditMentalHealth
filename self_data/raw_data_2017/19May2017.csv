4,"Upon watching a movie in the cinema, I've realised that my life is exactly like the life (in fact, it's like all the very different lives) of the character (dog) in the movie.

I've never ever made a decision for myself. Now that I think about it, I don't even remember ever having any dreams that aren't imposed on me by someone else. I was always, from the early childhood, following the ideas and decisions of others. When I was eight, my father showed me programming, told me it is cool, people who do it are cool, and they make good money. Guess what I'm doing for living now? Yeah, I make software, and I went a looong path to do it. I studied well in school and university, not because I cared about my future (honestly, I never ever did), but because people expected me to, and I found it easier to go along than not to. I didn't look for my first job, the recruiters found me. I didn't look for a second job that I'm doing now either, the recruiters found me as well. In fact, it was for the company which I considered ""too cool to even think about applying there"", and if they won't write first, I'd never ever apply. Thus I have second job and never really chose where to work by myself. I moved to a different country, without choosing it, just because the employer offered me a job there, and my parents thought it was cool (I thought and still think it is ""meh whatever""). There's even an episode of me taking part in a revolution, but ultimately I did only after (and because) one person close to me at the time expressed surprise in me not doing so. Even in much smaller aspects of my life (at work, in everyday matters...), I generally went along with other people's and society's decisions, without even realizing it. Now I feel that I don't really ""own"" anything in my life, and this is a very depressing thought. I don't live my life, I live a life of society's image of me, just playing a role other people imposed on me without asking me whether I want it. Despite having all the personal freedom in the world, I've never really used any.

Help me. How do I regain at least some control over my life? How do I stop going along with current? And ultimately, how do I stop the realization that I don't really own my life from destroying it?",19May2017,2
5,"Just to make it clear im not boasting. Somewhat spoiled kid. Had food, roof, loving family, etc. Got accepted in expensive highschool with schoolarship by winning an interstate competition in academics. Failed a couple of courses becase halfheartedness but still got the degree at the end. Decided to move out to study at university (easily got in despite number of aplicants). Got girlfriend without effort. Job that pays the bills literally got offered while i was out for lunch. More less fit without exercise. Excell at work without effort. Tried volunteering at local assylum to get life experience trough others, but dont have actual empathy. Started travelling to different places but got bored quickly. Started reading until exhaustion to keep myself occupied. Usually sabotage relationships, studies and duties to make things harder and a little exiting. Light depression. Little self harm to complicate daily activities (dont actually think to start doing more serious stuff).  

TL;DR life so easy that i started to make BAD decisions to get exited.

So what do i do? I know that it might be weird problem to dislike an easy life and sounds that im a whiny spolied brat, but im starting to get more and more tired and bored of this. If someone could give me a word of advice about what to do to stop feeling like this i would gladly hear it.

In fact, the personality that I like to front before people really get to know me is way more masculine and completely unhurried. But I'm not like that in real life. I'm always worrying and upset and confused and I don't project any confidence. I say the wrong things, and sometimes I don't say anything at all. There's no sort of masculine ""swagger"".

19,"I'm a 23 year old male who has suffered from depression and extreme anxiety since 12. My whole life fear has controlled every area of life - social, academic, personal. One of my deepest fears is that I'm going to be an old man in bed and look back at my life and be filled with regret and disgust. The ironic thing I've discovered a while ago is that it is coming true. This is just that particular fear but for almost ever fear I have, they're slowly but surely becoming reality. One of my main ways of coping with this over the years has been to entertain myself by watching YoTube videos for hours, falling asleep, waking up, then trying to fall asleep again to not face the day. 


I go to a community college that I started going to when I was 18. I am tuition free thanks to the G.I bill. I basically haven't declared a major even though I'm basically done with all my general eds. I was told at some point I wouldn't have to declare a major until i'm in university, which now i'm told isn't true, that I need to complete major preps and apply to college a year before (I take most of the blame for that because I didn't do my research because I was avoiding it due to anxiety). I've tried to figure out what to choose but because of anxiety and extreme indecision, I don;t know what to do. A couple weeks ago I was trying to research what to choose then it was just hours of rechecking the course curriculum every 5 minutes and then changing my mind because of self doubt. I always hated school for the most part. The reason I started college is because my dad wanted me to, and the reason I stuck with it to this point is because I was scared what my family would think if I didn't. I want to quit. Like almost everything in my life. The only things I know i've tried my best in were sports. That's pretty much the only area of my life I've ever had true confidence, because I was a natural. I have 2 brothers, 1 that graduated w/ a bachelors in criminal justice and another that will get his BA in nursing. They never really dealt with mental problems like I have. I feel like if I was like them I would be able to lead a normal/successful life, but i'm not. I feel like i'm just in too deep of a hole. I've been to therapy half my life and have been given skills to cope, but just like everything else, I quit so I haven't made them a habit. I was hit by a car 2 months ago which gave me a broken leg that i'm still recovering from. I was kind of secretly happy shortly after because I would be hospitalized. I know life can be beautiful, but I don't think that's possible anymore for me. I don't think i'll kill myself w/ my dad alive, but I want to die. I don't see anything promising in the future.

25,"Am I going insane? I feel like this world is turning inside out. It's not upside down anymore. It's fucking backwards and turned around and twisted. I feel like I'm losing faith in humanity. I don't know who exactly to believe in anymore. I don't even know if I should believe in myself. I know that there has to be good in the world somewhere, right? Where can I go where people are loving and caring. Where everyone is transparent, peaceful, and kind. Why does it seem like everyday gets worse and worse? It's as if there is a fracture in space and time and everything suddenly started contorting into something so ugly and so selfish. Everyone now lives for their own image. They fill their mouths with lies and speak to the world as though they know EXACTLY how to fix everything. But who really does? There is no such thing as black and white, which is absurd since there are only shades of grey on a spectrum that ONLY allows BLACK and WHITE. which is why it's impossible to have a life that's free of criticism. We praise our freedom of speech, but our speech is not free. It comes with a cost of hatred and BIGOTRY. I used to look through rose colored glasses and they slowly over time have lost their tint and now I see not a beautiful, soft, pink and purple sunset, but a harsh and burning sun that I have to look away from in fears it may envelope me. I do not know how to move on from this sudden hate and fear and loneliness. Technology once saved us, but now it is killing us. No more can you go throughout your day without some part of your life being documented. No more it seems can you go ""out of your comfort zone"" and speak your opinion without backlash. I feel like suddenly the whole weight of the world is on MY shoulders, only because I feel like if there's a sane person in a group of insane people... who is truly the one insane? Am I that person? All alone in a group of insanity? I know it's not just myself: I. It is a collective of us all who are grasping at threads to try and find the last bit of connection to what once was. I am in love with the world yet disgusted by its community. Change needs to come, but how? There needs to be an end and a beginning of something new. I'm scared that soon will there be a revelation, but what of? Even saying all this I feel selfish. But all I want to do is to call for an uprising of a new era. An uprising that kindles a flame and starts a wildfire. We are on a teetering edge and are seconds away from something so destructive. How can we know what to believe in anymore? What is real? What is fake? We are lied to everyday, and we are threatened and diminished. All we can know that is true is how WE feel. How I feel. I no longer can listen with a credulous ear, but with a doubtful one. I'm watching everyone I love or used to love slowly diminish into something lesser. I can't watch this declination anymore. I'm begging for a revolution. Something to be a part of and something to stand with. Something that loves and is peaceful and wise. What ever happened to wisdom? Now all you hear is screaming and people trying to take sides and make sides. And doesn't that then make me a hypocrite? I am just so confused and can't even put my emotions into words. I want closure, which I feel may never come. I'm sorry if my words are in circles. But I can barely untangle my thoughts and emotions so  how am I supposed to write them?

26,"Dipping the toe on either side of Donald Trump shows you a really ugly side of Reddit. Understandably so as the nastiness in this year's election in the US is wide-spread knowledge to most Redditors, but what are the possible solutions? Fundamentally, banning doesn't work on this site, containing doesn't work anywhere, and saying anything gets you from 0-100 real quick. Those are all decisions to be made by admins and mods, but what if the new profiles were made to combat disingenuous users and give power back to the individuals up/downvote. I only mention this because the biggest problem with my idea is vote manipulation with bots and spam, but if we were to work around that to give real users (and pretty much only your real account) the power to vote once a year on which subreddits you would want to get the cut. It'd still be an admin decision in the end, but this would quell a lot of hate going on right now. It would give people a visualization on how their sub and ideals stemming from it are viewed.


I imagine a world where, during purge week, we get some of the best, most sincere content from subs we would expect on the chopping block. People are working to show visitors that they aren't hate-filled ignoramouses then we get something like this from an admin at the end of the week, ""Purge Week is over and after consideration that all subs related to [hate sub] + [Opposing views of hate sub] there are total of 400k voters that frequent there and relating subs and only 100k total votes were recorded for their purge bringing us to only 25% of their perceived population when we were expecting over 30% of all voters to agree to their purging thus we will not be taking action against [hate sub].""

I'm very productive on night shifts, but not all jobs allow for later hours. I'm always late if I'm working first shift. I've suspected my circadian rhythm is reversed and I've tried every bit of conventional wisdom the internet has to offer: melatonin, sleep aids, diet regulation, limiting/increasing physical activity before bed, light regulation, limiting electronics, etc. Many of these tactics actually makes it worse. I'm 33 and still haven't figure out how to sleep at night.

Last night I ignored conventional wisdom and slept with the lights on. I slept like a goddamn baby. Woke up refreshed.

I've been in love with a man for well over a year and a half and decided I would write him a short book to tell him my feelings instead of saying them outright. Five months into writing here and there, I gave up. I tried to forget my feelings for him when he told me I was his best friend.

...the feelings came back. We hung out more. He got drunk one night and kissed me, confessed his love for me in two languages. Two days later he denied everything. I got pissed and wrote the entire book I had been planning in three weeks; from beginning to end. 200 pages. Artwork. Professionally published.

I gave it to him. He got halfway through it before I became impatient and crunched for time since I'm leaving for my home country in less than two weeks.

Tonight I confronted him about it and he said his answer was the same. He didn't love me like his drunk self did. He had made this mistake a few times with others in the past. He didn't know what to say but sorry. I had a feeling this would happen and I'm trying to process it like countless rejections in the past but it still cuts deep. I could see it you know? I could see something in him that I have never seen in anyone else.

I can do nothing to change how he feels but I guess I'm just ashamed that I went so far as to express myself so unabashedly to have it immortalized in only a book, not a relationship. I'm still processing it.

Again I don't know why I'm even posting this.

Sorry.

Edit; he's not disgusted with me. He kept apologizing and thanking me for doing that for him. I tried to tell him 'I hope you can forgive me one day' because I was ashamed that I had gotten angry at him for saying only 'sorry' to all of my questions of 'do you have anything to say?'.

Thank you for reacting to my assault story with compassion. Thank you for listening with sensitivity and urgency, for trying to understand the details I could give without passing judgment on what I presented to you. Thank you for waiting with me at the station for hours until a squad car was available to take me to the SVU. Thank you for trying to make small talk to pass the time; it did not help but it showed me that you wanted to help while we waited. Thank you for sitting next to me as I cried. *Thank you for being stoic while doing your job empathetically.* Thank you for not placing blame on me as a victim. Thank you for doing your part.




**To the SVU Detective:**

You were a large, stern man. You sharply contrasted the policeman with whom I had spent the last few hours. He was a stranger (also a man) but he became an ally. You became something else.

You have to understand that I did not want to be sitting there with you. It took me a week to get to the station because reporting a rape is difficult. Your reaction made it impossible. 

When you demanded I give you the name of the acquaintance that had been with me that night at the bar, I refused. I did this because she did not believe me, either. She had said that I “just felt guilty for being a slut.” For this reason I would not give you her name. I think it was then that you decided I was a liar. 

I try to tell myself that the reason you kept interrupting me was to find clarity in the details to solve my case. But because of your words, your body language, and your demeanor, I felt interrogated. 
When you asked me how he had gotten into my house that night, you asked me how forcefully I pushed him out. *You asked me why I did not succeed in separating myself from the danger.* Later, you asked me how clearly I resisted his assault. You asked me whether my body language could have been understood as a possible yes, even after I told you that out of my mouth came NO. You sided with the accused. You advocated for him. 

You told me that rape was “a huge accusation that could negatively affect his life forever”. You put that on me. He violated me; then you put the weight of his future reputation on my shoulders. You, a trained detective of the Special Victims Unit.

I left the SVU and never bothered another officer of the law with my assault case again. I can tell you, though, that I remember him and I remember you. You two are different, but I wish that you hadn’t been on the same team.

I lay my eyes on her and I stop before I could pull the switch.

I am impressed and enamored by her beauty, even now that I've known her for what feels like forever. Her eyes are shut as she peacefully sleeps, dreaming of something that I am not aware of. She is unaware that I am standing and looking at her now. 

She is not aware that a simple act of shutting off a light has now turned into a moment of silent, passionate admiration. Her eyelashes are a subtle mix of different shades slight red, blonde, and brown, her cute rosy cheeks, her natural red hair, her ears wearing the earrings that I like, her soft lips, all of it is so beautiful. It's almost as if I'm seeing her for the first time, but it's better than that, for I see so much more. 

She knows that I love her and that I am in love with her, but in this moment she is sleeping and all of the world has stopped. The chaos and confusion that it often creates has ceased and I am calm.

Honestly, it was ok at first. It was just a few drips and the people getting a little bit wet found it funny. Fine, whatever.

So, it started off as a casual 2 hour drive time. The first hour was pretty good, and I felt nothing was really wrong except my parallel parking. After the first hour had finished, I switched driving instructors, and drove for another hour. I thought it was going to be easy, considering that I had done really well in the first half. Boy, oh, boy. I was wrong. Soon, I started messing up easy things such as not reversing properly or forgetting to check my blind spot. I never ever forget doing these simple maneuvers, but it was something about that one day that just made me feel.... bleh. Anyways, as I was continually getting scolded at by my driving teacher, I kept thinking in my mind that I wanted it to be over. However, I  had about 15 minutes left of the driving lesson, and the driving instructor told me to begin parallel parking next to a car. But, there was a car behind me and it stopped, unbeknownst to them that I was practicing parallel parking. Of course, I did not continue to reverse for the proper steps for parallel parking; but my teacher insisted to reverse for some odd reason(the person told me to stop at a certain point). I assumed she was hoping that the other car should get the idea that they should go around, but yet didn't. And so my teacher looked back, a little confused on why the other driver isn't going around. Now, here's where it goes wrong. 

Imagine yourself, a little frustrated, and dazed after an hour and a half of driving, and long ass day of school. I begin to think in my mind that I should use my left hand and roll down the window to signal the person to go around. Keep in mind that I'm still in the reverse car position[so my hands are resting on the proctor's back seat], [also my left hand was on the wheel] and in one full motion, I turned my body facing forward, and while I did that, I accidentally (and fast&amp;semi-hard) socked that teacher right in the jaw. My heart dropped. And I apologized immediately, and signaled the other car to pass us. I ended up going back to the Driving School earlier and ended my lesson. The worst part about this is that she was nonchalant (although she did yell 'Jesus Christ' and held her face when I hit her by accident) and after I had left the lesson, she ran up to her class in the Driving school and ranted on how I punched her and that she did not want to drive with me anymore. [my friends were in that class to confirm the story]



TL;DR: I accidentally hit my teacher when I was attempting to redeem myself for being a bad driver.

58,"One of my roommates stole over $2k from me after not paying her bills for several months. 

I make more than enough to pay everything, I just had no clue that she wasn't paying anything. I left the cash behind so that they could have money to spare while I went home to take care of some family problems (my sister died earlier in the year and my grandma just died a couple​ of months ago.) 

My other roommate's parents are telling me it's my problem. My girlfriend got an internship centered around my house being here, and my clients are on this side of the state. In fucking me over my friend has insured that I lose everything. 

This is the lowest point in my life, and it's happening because I don't get paid frequently enough. I make enough money to pay all the debt, even though it's not mine, I just can't do it fast enough. 

The worst part is, aside from losing $30k in annual IT contracts, that I'll probably have to go home to my parents house. They're the most entropic humans in existence, it's why I left when I was 17.

I was so close to having everything I ever wanted, I got to come home to the only family I've ever connected with, and it's all gone. ",19May2017,4
59,"My parents divorced when I was two.   Dad went back home after this, which is about 700 miles from where I am.  I don't know why they split, but after then my father's side of the family has been very distant.   I want to know why my parents split, and why dad and his family don't talk to me.

I suspect there's not much in the way of outside help for this.  If I could just google ""what's my dad's problem?"" this would all be so simple.   I looked briefly at getting a private investigator but that seems to be less about digging up history and more about collecting evidence of present-day crimes.   So I have to have an awkward conversation and this is where I need help.  I have no idea how to ask these people why they won't talk to me.


My dad hasn't attempted to contact me since the eighties.   I used to call him every year on his birthday, for four or five years, and the only time he answered was in 2013.  I talked for a little while and then he said his lunch was getting cold and he had to go.   He never called me back.  He has a Facebook account which he hasn't used in more than a year now.

My aunt is also on Facebook, but I only figured that out a year or two ago.  I saw her on my dad's friends list and asked mom who she is.  My aunt has been more receptive to questions but has never volunteered anything.  She hasn't contacted me in the last couple months now.  So when I decide to try to ask somebody over there about this stuff, she's likely the person I will try first.   In which case I'd have to think of a tactful way to say ""why doesn't your brother talk to me?""

I can talk to my mom about this stuff, and most of what I know about my dad is from her.   I have a hard time with this as well, and I have never actually asked my mom why she left him.   Since I really don't know how to say the right thing gracefully I've not pushed on this subject as much as I could've.

Tl;dr: What's a good way to bring up a difficult subject without alienating people?",19May2017,1
60,"I apologize if I write too much, I'm just in a very strange state of mind right now. I'm 22 and about to turn 23, and my girlfriend and I split up roughly two years. It was a mutual breakup, but over time I began regretting my decisions and recently came to terms with our decision. Her mother was sick for a long time, but she passed away this week because the doctors didn't know she had leukemia. Her mother was always a delight to be around, and when my girlfriend and I split up it was hard to realize that I wasn't really a part of her family anymore. I got the news on Monday that she had passed away and I was so overwhelmed with emotions that I kind of shut down for a few days. My first thought was to console my ex, but I realize that that time has passed and it's no longer my responsibility to do that anymore. It hurt because I don't have any romantic feelings towards her, but I will always love her and her family. It's a strange feeling knowing that you love someone and their family but the best thing to do is show your face and just let them know you're in mourning with them without overstepping that boundary. I love this person and her family so much, but in a completely different form than I did a few years ago. Love is a very strange emotion and until now I didn't know it could ever hurt so much to love others. ",19May2017,484
61,"I don’t know if this is the right place to put this, or even the right format, but I’ve had too much on my mind for too long. I wish I had someone in my life to talk to any of this about, but I’ve always been the guy my friends come to when they have problems, and I’d rather not burden them with more things to worry about. I hope you’re in this for the long haul, because this is going to take a while.

In this ~~story~~ series of stories I’m going to be touching up on a lot of things that have been bothering me to a great extent for years now, as well as referring to several people who’s names I’d prefer to keep secret. So instead, I’ll assign them a letter. 
* D is my best friend 
* T is my girlfriend 
* J is my roommate 
* You can refer to me as “E”, “OP”, “Bep” or whatever else you think fits.

So, I guess I’ll talk about what's been hitting me the hardest: Depression. I used to have serious issues with depression back in late middle school and early high school. It was so bad at one point that the only thing that kept me from killing myself was how expensive it would be for my mother, who was already spending every available dime to keep me and my two sisters alive. In high school my depression was all but wiped away by D, who I have talked to and played games online with almost every day for the past 10 years now.

But lately, it’s made a resurgence. I can’t tell where it started, but I kind of woke up one morning and realized that I felt... numb. Not physically, mind you, but emotionally. Emotions don’t really have much staying power with me anymore. I used to have something good happen to me and I would stay happy all day, or would lose a relative and feel sad for a few days. But now I’m lucky if I get angry or sad or happy for more than a few minutes before I just revert back to... apathy.

I don’t know if I would necessarily say I hate myself, but I wish more than anything that I wasn’t who I am now. I still don’t know if it’s depression or something else at play here, but regardless, T doesn’t deserve who I am. Which leads me to the next part of my story: Moving. I met T years ago but we only started dating 8 months ago. Months prior to dating T, I had already decided to move from NC to FL in with a good friend of mine (J) to both keep his self destructive streak and depression in check, as well as to improve my coding ability (as my dream is to be a game developer).

So, long story short, my options with T were to end the relationship and move to FL without her, or ask her to come with me, knowing how selfish that would be. But I never got the chance to ask, because she had apparently been infatuated with me for a very long time. She asked me if she was allowed to move with me, giving me the excuse that her apartment was too expensive to stay in anyways, and that she loves traveling. But thinking about it now, I should’ve said “no”.

I think I made T’s life worse, to put it bluntly. She still wants to be with me, but I don’t think she’s as happy as she could be. We have totally different levels of energy, opposing views on our hobbies, and starkly contrasting libidos.I took her away from her job, her family, and her dog. All things she loved. I just really feel like I’ve made one of the few people I really care about less happy by being in their life. I won’t be breaking up with her, mind you. Not until she stops being content. She did get a new job, however. As a lifeguard. And since she loves swimming, she seems to be happy enough. But that begins what’s been hurting me the past 6 months: Jobs. The plan when I moved to FL was to get a quick job just to bring money into the house, but it’s been 6 months and I haven’t had a job for more than a day. Not for lack of trying, of course. Not by a long shot. I’ve put in HUNDREDS of applications, sent dozens of emails with my resume attached, and walked into countless places in an attempt to speak to a manager and get an interview, all with nothing to show for it. The man I moved in with, J, thinks that I’m just being lazy which only adds to the negative way I’ve started to see myself after so many silently rejected applications. I worked at Chuck E Cheese’s for over a year, so my ability to communicate with people and keep up a happy atmosphere regardless of how I feel is phenomenal, so I would assume people would value people skills. But all I hear back are “you don’t have experience” or “you’re just not what we’re looking for” which just makes me immeasurably discouraged.

There are like, 3 dozen small things I could list that negatively affect my psyche, but just these few things took up so much space and time that I feel it’s best to leave well enough alone.

I don’t really know how to cleanly end a text dump like this, but I hope posting this helps me come to terms better with any of this.",19May2017,2
62,"I wanted to share a story with whoever will listen.  The story I am about to tell is one of my grandfathers anecdotes he told me when I was a kid.  I've been telling the story to friends and today I did just that.  

However after telling the story to a friend today I decided to look up who Muhammad Ali was fighting.  My grandfather lived in Boston so I looked at Ali's fight history to see which of his fights were in Boston.  There were none.  At first I thought I was lied to my whole life but then I found out there actually was a fight scheduled for Boston but it had to be cancelled because Muhammad Ali, then Cassius Clay, had a hernia and needed emergency surgery.

When I saw this my eyes actually lit up.  Because the story about how my grandfather met Muhammad Ali actually took place in a hospital waiting room.

My grandfather was a fire captain for Engine Co. 14 in Boston in the neighborhood of Roxbury.  In 1964 he was responding to a fire and he was on the second floor of a building and the floor collapsed with him up there.  He ended up breaking a couple of ribs and getting rushed to the hospital.

While at hospital in full gear my grandfather was waiting to be seen.  All of a sudden a huge group of people, mostly reporters, came into the hospital and there was a big commotion.  Cassius clay sat down next to my grandfather.  My grandfather was writing in pain and didn't really know what was going on.

People sort of crowded around Cassius and my grandfather didn't really get to speak to him... not that he really could with the amount of pain he was in.  5 maybe 10 minutes go by and the nurses call in Cassius Clay to be seen.

Now, before my grandfather could even think: ""what the fuck is this bullshit.""  Cassius clay spoke up.  He pointed at my grandfather and said: ""You're going to see this man who serves your city before you see me.""  

And they tended to my grandfather and that was that.  Even though the two never spoke this act left a lasting impression on my grandfather.  My grandfather always thought of Cassius Clay as an arrogant jerk and did not really care much for him.  Ever since that day however my grandfather was his greatest supporter and he would tell people that the persona Muhammad Ali has is all an act and he really is a kind and considerate person at heart. 

Cassius Clay actually had a hernia and had to undergo surgery to repair it.  The fight in Boston was cancelled and rescheduled a couple of months later in Maine.  At the fight, [one of the most iconic boxing photos](http://i.imgur.com/PFztXNi.jpg) of all time was taken.

**tl;dr My grandfather ran into Muhammad Ali in a hospital in Boston and Ali showed my grandfather a random act of kindness.**",19May2017,26
63,"First, let me give you some background. I'm about 30 years old and live in [COUNTRY REDACTED], meaning I was in school during the Bush presidency in the USA. I could not for the life of me grasp how they were letting Bush run their country (we don't believe in the electoral college system outside the US) and I was very frustrated with Iraq and climate change (I'm a white guy of full European descent, fwiw). I regularly got pulled out of class, teased, and yelled at for my views and even fantasised about killing Bush, killing Americans, killing babies, etc. to the point where I believed everyone who was opposed to overthrowing the US government and getting all pro-Americans out of my country was as bad as them and should be hanged. I even thought that my own parents should be killed for not fighting against what I saw as a regime that was totally illegitimate, and for adults that were telling me 'grow up! it's a phase! get over it!' when what I saw were people who were literally endangering my right to life and that of my countrymen. I'm still a bit paranoid to this day, but I've mellowed lately...until the events with Brexit and with that daemon Trump happened. Now I once again am fantasising about violence towards the US, towards Trump, and towards the electoral college/Republicans/anyone who opposes violence towards them, and even am thinking we need a nuclear war to reboot civilisation. Any advice for talking me off this ledge? (I cannot even tell you what country I'm in because I'm very private about my views).",19May2017,2
