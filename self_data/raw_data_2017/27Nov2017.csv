1,"It's been a really tough year so far for me. I moved to a new high school that's far more academically strict than my previous one. I've also started taking honors wherever it's available, as opposed to just one to two classes as I have in the past. Plus, because of the sequencing of classes at this new school vs my old one, I'm taking two classes, math and history, above my grade level, both honors.

In addition to all that, I've had some health issues (both physical and mental) that caused me to miss a lot of school. 

After being too scared to check my grades for the past month, I finally took a look and I'm only failing my math class! I know this doesn't sound like a good thing, but considering I haven't been failing less than three classes and my gpa has been around two since starting, this is a serious improvement. 

I knew a while ago that I couldn't do this math class. There is far more work than I've had in any other class and the teacher isn't helping at all. She doesn't care enough to actually put effort into teaching, but expects good results. I know she could be worse, but the way she teaches the material really doesn't work with the way I think too. Anyway, I spoke with a counselor almost a month ago, and for the new semester I'm most likely going to be switching to an online class, the correct one in my sequence. I'm hoping that will help a lot, as the stress and such from that class has been leaking into others and lowering my grades in them too.

Anyway, that's pretty much it. I'm really happy (and honestly surprised) I'm not doing worse, as I've been breaking down a little bit from stress. I'm really looking forward to the semester change, as not only am I switching out of my math class, a semester course is ending and I'm excited for the class I'm going into.",27Nov2017,1

8,"Throughout my childhood, my parents (espeeeecially my mom) were strict, but not overly strict, when it came to parenting me. I always felt like I had to maintain B’s and mostly A’s or I wouldn’t be able to see friends, use my phone, go out on the weekends, and have a fun life in general. I was always scared of breaking rules because my mom was terrifying when she was mad. I can still remember when my mom exploded after finding out I was drinking at my junior prom. It still haunts me, lol. I feel like overall, I’ve done pretty well and led a normal life up to this point. Got accepted to a competitive university, maintained a pretty good GPA thus far, kept up a social life, and have started studying for the LSAT. I definitely owe my success thus far to my parents (mostly my mom) for pushing me since I was young. Ever since my senior year of high school, my mom and I have become much closer, and the strict parent who I used to be afraid of has gradually become my friend. 

Ever since I left for school, my family has suffered. Even though my university is only 3 hours away and I come home often since my boyfriend lives and works in my hometown, things have not been the same. I can still remember when my mom called me my freshman year and said “Your dad is a great person and I’ll always love him but we are going to separate.” I was completely thrown off guard. 

My parents never seemed “in love” but I guess I didn’t notice since I was used to their indifference towards one another. Since my mom broke that news to me freshman year, she’s opened up to me during her weak moments about how she just wants to move in with her previous lover that moved near us and how much she dislikes my dad for never giving her attention their entire marriage. 

My dad was not a huge part of our childhood growing up and he’s never been interested in the activities my mom enjoys, vice versa. (My mom is from the south and my dad is from New York, they met and had my siblings and I when they were in their late 30’s. As my mom says, she got married to him because she was getting too old and wanted to have kids). When my mom would plan family vacations, my dad would always stay home. My mom was always helping us with homework while my dad was sitting in front of the TV or was playing golf alone. 

The part that confuses me is that for 25 years my mom put up with it. She never said “you’re going with us on this vacation,” or “clean up the kitchen tonight.” She did pretty much everything and let him get away with it for their entire marriage. But as soon as I left for college, she began to understand that my dad did nothing except for work to provide for the family, come home, watch TV, and sleep and that it wasn’t normal for him to be so uninvolved. At this point though, he was used to how things had been for half of his life. 

After my mom made it known to my dad that she was unhappy, he has done everything in his power to save the marriage even after my mom insists that she’s getting a divorce. He lost 85 pounds, has planned family vacations, tried to spend quality time with my mom, etc. My mom still doesn’t appreciate his efforts and is not involved and does not wish to be involved. 

My mom has also made it known that she’s “tired” of parenting or something because she’s never home, let alone she doesn’t tell anybody where she’s going. She’s very secretive with phone, as well. She recently just started a new job after 10+ years of not having one and she insists that she’s constantly working and that’s why she’s out all day and night. The past 2 Thanksgiving’s she’s been completely absent. She left some unmashed potatoes, an uncarved turkey, and Brussels sprouts out for us to have and then disappeared for the rest of the day. The past 19 Thanksgiving’s of my life have been celebrated heavily at our house so things definitely went from 0 to 100 in my household. 

My point to all of this is that my mom has forgotten that she has another child to raise and that my dad can’t do it alone. My brother is 15 years old and slowly deteriorating. “Fucking” is his favorite word. I think if I used that word at his age in our previously very conservative, Catholic household I would’ve been burned at the stake. He’s on probation at his school after receiving grades so bad that it seems like he’s TRYING to fail, smokes weed every day with his friends even though probation at his school requires random drug tests, and gets countless detentions and write ups from teachers. The other day, while sitting in the backseat of my car, he got aggravated that the passenger seat was too far back and was squishing his legs. Instead of moving over to the middle or the other side of the backseat where he could be comfortable, he used all of his weight and pushed the seat in as hard as he could. Let me make it known that he’s a HUGE kid. (6’2 and 190ish pounds). My car thought it had been in a wreck where the airbag deployed and the cost to fix it was 150 dollars. Just today, I asked if he still had a Visa gift card of mine that I gave him to get food a while back. I asked if he wanted to get lunch before I went back to school and he gave me an attitude and handed me his wallet and said “check it, I don’t have it.” I tossed his wallet onto the couch next to us and was about to get up and walk away and he grabbed my two day old iPhone 10 and chucked it across the room. I screamed because I couldn’t believe he had the nerve to do that, and I guess he thought I was going to get physical first, so he started to kick me. In defense I kicked back, and he starts violently punching me, kicking me, pulling my hair, and throwing me around the couch screaming “fuck you cunt” the entire time. Just a reminder that this kid is huge. Aside from this, he is in a horrible mood all the time and acts too good for anything, constantly. When my dad yells at him, he walks away as if nothing has happened. He has no respect for authority and will not listen to anybody. He thinks he is right always, I’m not exaggerating. 

After telling my parents about this incident, they seemed concerned, but not enough for how scary and violent he got. My mom seemed hopeless about his behavior- her only response was to blame it on my dad for not being stricter with him. I can guarantee when I was caught drinking at prom she was 26 bazillion times more upset. My dad said he would punish him, but according to my younger sister, he was back playing GTA again only an hour later. 

Although I’m still pretty furious about what he did to me earlier, I’m scared for my brother. How is he 15 years old and still thinking that his insane behavior is okay? How do I get my parents to wake up and knock my mom out of her selfish and childish behavior? What does one do to stop him from becoming an abusive failure?

9,"We had been together for a year and I have literally had my best memories with him. Everyone I talked to and the books I read and agony aunts I browse are all detailed to someone who has had a bad boyfriend whereas in the reality he has held my hair when I've slept held me into the night and been there for me like no one before. 

I thought or relationship has been nothing short of perfect. Last week (and a half) it's been rough because I thought he was acting distant. Then then end of the week I had never felt more connected to him, as I told him how I felt and he reassured me that it was fine. Then the next week there was a huge row over something silly (including a question in an email to my professor) and he flipped his lid and made me move my shit out of his house. The day after he convinced me to go with him to Cambridge and we had a lovely time. 

Today we met up and he flat out told me that he wanted to break up with me. For the past month or so he stopped seeing a future with me and was trying to tell if it was -me or him- but acting the same so I couldn't even tell. I was floored as I assumed we would talk out this week and he better than ever. He said he stopped seeing me as his girlfriend and now instead just a friend. He cried and said he didn't want to lose me as a friend but we lost the spark when we kissed and said the first time he said he loved me he couldn't hold it in and now it's just habit. If I've been sleeping in his bed this month and he felt like this there's no hope is there. Space will not make him want me again and he must feel nothing short of relieved to tell me this, and likely won't miss me. When he's alone he says he feels single and I asked him about other women he said no and I'm inclined to believe him as he has very strong morals.

This all feels stupid, I can't sum our relationship in words. We were never friends just fell hard and fast. I've sacrificed so much for him and shown him everything, it's dumb I know but still hope he will miss me. But if he doesn't feel anything like we're together I know that's naive. 

I don't know what to do I don't think I could look at another man. I tried to show him there might be a spark left and we had sex after he broke up with me, and he said it just didn't feel like makin g love anymore. I grilled him and he said he wasn't attracted to me as much even though I haven't changed a speck in our relationship. He said he was the one who changed but he didn't in the way he acted until the last week so I was completely blindsided. I just feel so worthless at the moment. He cried and said he wished he still loved me the same way but now he only does as a friend. I have so many uni deadlines but I'm just consumed by this sadness. I used to think about him always, and now I'm learning that he just fell out of love with me. Previously he would tell me everyday how he thought I was gorgeous and how good we were together. He went from entirely revering our relationship to it being nothing and I'm not sure what to do. This is my first breakup, I genuinely thought I might have been one of the lucky ones who found love at 19. I can't sleep and I just want the acid feeling in my stomach to go away. I can't help but lie there and think of the moments where I have never felt such connection with another person. He says there's no spark when we kiss which is true, but he tastes like him and that was home to me yesterday. I still feel it even though he says he doesn't. 

I just feel confused, I know what I have to do as in my daily routine but for some reason I still feel helpless and lost. Logically i should have a plan but my limbs don't let me move.

Does anyone have any advice? I know the answer is power through and be strong but is there anything else. I started (and quickly finished) a self help book which has registered but not sunk in, so has done nothing but killed a few hours, which I may reread. I have deadlines every week as well so I can't just go on a bender and on the rebound. I feel sick the thought of another guy. I'm trying to get out there and have made more plans in the past 2 weeks than I did the previous two months. Still feel awful, and if possible is there anything more than time heals all wounds.

13,"A guy I had worked with for about a year was stabbed in the back and died last Sunday. I always hear and read about friends having someone they went to high school with passing away, but it's never happened to me.

Me and this guy became really good friends over the course of the year. We would hang out, drink, smoke, chill. He was a super good guy and always smiling. To know thst someone took his life only a few months after his 21st birthday is shitty. It didn't feel real at first. It still doesn't.

20,"Legitimately I don't see the point in having 16+ years of school depending on what you want to do. Couldn't we just not teach classes that are useless?

Living in poverty is hard too. I have a few potatoes to last me an entire week. I can barely afford medication.

30,"I worry about technological unemployment a lot. I worry about and am irrationally terrified of a future where there's literally nothing to do except amuse oneself with media, where we've automated not just all the menial labor, but all the high-end, intellectual labor, too. Last time I talked about this on Reddit I ended up in a hysterical screaming match with some guy hurling nihilistic ""You're just mad that life has no inherent meaning and you never questioned it before"" BS at me. My anxiety about the possible end of human endeavor has little to do with a spiritual notion of capital-M ""Meaning"", it's much more strongly linked to my own hopeless, empty feelings that I suck at articulating. I've had long stretches of unemployment and not knowing what to do with myself, of not caring about anything and feeling like I had no options. It's boring. Deathly boring. Games and movies and screwing around around online get boring after a while, why do people think a lifetime of that is so wonderful?

It doesn't help that in the minds of automation-promoters, people have very limited *real* interests and no one likes their job. Like everyone, given the option, would sit around making art - there's no one who dreams of being a programmer, or a craftsman, or a teacher. Those are all bullshit slavery jobs that we can automate so those people will be ""free"" to draw or make music. 

I starting revisiting those thoughts for no good reason today, then I found this:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1lmvyv/thought_experiment_universal_basic_income_has

I wanted some actual answers to what people say they would do if working became unnecessary. Now, this thread only refers to the implementation of UBI, irrespective of mass unemployment or automation obliterating certain kinds of work for good. Reading this is...weirdly encouraging. So much of my own fear of the future is of being left unable to adapt, or of having the world (or at least my little corner of it) shrink to almost nothing. When I think of workless futures, I'm not thinking about every service job disappearing - I'm thinking of research labs and engineering closing their doors to humans, or major endeavors people *wanted* to do (space exploration at the top of that list) being done by drones because it's ""more efficient"" and safer. Of no more human-written code or even any significant interest in creative things made by people, since AI can crank out better stuff faster. And doing things ""for the fun of it"" isn't something I'm that prone to. I suspect there are a lot of people like that. So when people talk about mass automation and/or UBI ""liberating"" us to do whatever we want, I'm thinking ""But what is there left to do? We automated all the interesting work along with all the menial crap. We just made our fucking *existence* obsolete to ourselves, *why??*""

Now I'm trying to realign myself. The only thing I really can do is adapt, but my problem has been figuring out what I'll need to adapt to. There will probably be at least some time between the death of menial work and the end of all human endeavor (and even then, some kind of cyborgization to modify some kind of hypersociety, in order to keep up with AI doesn't seem too bad). I guess looking at that thread helped open my mind some, things I may be able to involve myself in, in the future or even now, to scrape together some vestige of a worthwhile life. That's what I mainly want, is that so bad?

 There was only one flower shop in town, and it's owned by a family member who is basically retired and doesn't do it anymore. So there's an opportunity there, and the shop has been in town for like 70 years so it's not like people won't know it's there.

Right now I work in a call center and I really, really don't like it. I've been here for 3 years and I'm getting burnt out fast. But my husband has a job he really likes, that's pretty stress free and makes him pretty decent money. So moving away to do the flower shop thing would definitely benefit me more than him.

I know they say that if opportunity knocks, you should answer. And if I were on the outside looking in, I would say we should definitely do it and try opening the business. But I'm absolutely terrified. 

I've never run a business. I'd have to give up my life of structure and following other people's rules, which is really comfortable. I don't like what I have to do, but it's really nice knowing it's stable. There's no risk.

I have to change what I'm doing soon, I'm not going to last a lot longer in my current job before I quit or snap or something. I can feel the cracks starting to spread. But is this the right thing to do? 

There's so many cons (no more cheap insurance from my work, I have to move to a small town with less things to do, I have to learn how to run a business and learn how to be a real florist, etc etc etc) but there's a lot of pros too (I would be doing something I don't hate everyday, being the main one). I just don't know, and thinking about it constantly since it was brought up is freaking me out.

Thanks for reading.",27Nov2017,1
35,"Well that's not true. I have a girlfriend, and she also feels like my best friend because we can tell each other anything.



But I have had no luck making friends. And it's not my fault. I attract the most flakey people and I don't know why. I had an old coworker reach out to me on Facebook, and I added him. We chatted, and decided to get together for a beer. I take the bus out to meet him at the bar, and he texts me 15 MINUTES BEFORE to cancel on me, because he's tired from work and the gym.



We met up next week, but I don't want to see him again. I can't be friends with someone I don't respect.



I just completed a contract job with a company. One of my coworkers was being really friendly the whole time. The day I finished, he walked me out of the building. Before we said goodbye, he wanted to exchange numbers because ""we such and such look out for each other"". I texted him the following week asking if he's free to hang out. He never responded.


Even when other people initiate, they flake out or just play games with me. What is going on?",27Nov2017,0

44,"Is that will essentially eliminate true grass-root movements and decentralize humanities ability to speak with one another uninhibited.

They will have the ability to prevent people like Barrack Obama or Bernie Sanders from rallying to their causes.

They will have the ability to prevent people from quickly learning about new policies in place that can strip away other freedoms.

Essentially, this isn’t even about paying for more services or even paying more for the same service.

This is about social slavery.

46,"We were both 14 when we met, he was this adorable lanky skater boy with shaggy curly brown hair and I was this 5’7 braces-wearing never-been-kissed skinny little girl. We only met because my best friend (at the time) was in a *very* committed relationship (hahahahaha they broke up after 4 months) and wanted me to be in one too. Of course she forgot to realize that I had absolutely ZERO skills in terms of relationships. However that didn’t stop me from immediately having a huge crush on him. To make a long prologue short, we played truth or dare, I got my first kiss, he asked me out on a date (to the movies) and halfway through, I texted my mom and told her I wanted her to pick me up. And that was the end of my romance with the sk8r boi.

Fast forward a couple months to the start of 9th grade. I walk into my 5th period biology class and guess who is my table partner? Sk8r Boi. Of course, I hadn’t seen him in person since earlier that summer, but somehow he’d hit puberty within those couple months, his hair was longer he was way taller and I think he’d started working out.

*as I’m editing this: I remember that first day, I gave him a hug and it was absolutely wonderful and warm, this is seemingly small but this is actually very important*

Class was alright and we ended up texting each-other all the time because I wrote down the notes everyday and he did not. We also had very similar tastes in music which we both eventually learned after following each-other on Spotify. So yea we became buds. We hung out quite a bit during and after school and we sat together at lunch, but we were by no means dating. I’d hug him when I saw him and sometimes he’d give me a piggy back ride if we were running to the bus to go downtown but I did that with all my gal pals anyway so that didn’t really mean much. 

This all changed when he started hooking up with a sophomore.

I knew that we weren’t together and probably would never be (heck we never even talked about kissing or our date or anything that had happened earlier that summer) but that didn’t stop me from being crazy jealous. He’d skip biology to go hookup with her in the band room and smoke pot and I just covered for him in class. Then one Monday, I found out they’d gone way further than just kissing (I didn’t care though, not at all /s)

At this point I got kinda clingy, I’d always sit next to him at assemblies and we texted every night. The night he asked her out and got rejected he called me and we talked for 5 hours straight. 

That was the night I realized that it wasn’t just a stupid crush, I’d accidentally let myself start falling in love with him. He started regularly going to class again (he had nothing to do) and I started passing him silly little notes and taking pictures of him and stuff.  I fell in love with the way he smiled and laughed when he heard an inside joke of ours and the way that when he was bored he would use his pencils to play drums on the desk, something that if done by literally ANYONE else would have irritated me to my core.  He had a bundle of freckles on his left  eyelid and when he winked it looked like a smiley face. And his hair was soooooo much fun to braid and play with and I would always just sit behind him and braid his hair.  And even the way he talked was just so intriguing, he spoke slowly but purposefully, like he’d been thinking about his responses.

But of course, this wasn’t a relationship. And I came to find that out on my 15th birthday, when I invited him and he had every excuse in the book not to come, even though he was just at home the whole time, which I found out the next day.

 He just didn’t want to come. 

We had discourse for an entire week that ended with our science teacher moving our seats to opposite sides of the room. I started sitting with different people at lunch and hanging out with different people after school. I eventually started homeschooling (for reasons somewhat unrelated) and all contact broke off between us. 

At first I felt betrayed but after a while, I just felt lonely. I felt like a huge part of me had been ripped out and that now I had a hole in my heart. I tried hooking up with other guys to fill the gap but it didn’t help. None of my guy friends were ever that close to me and I had (still have) zero relationship experience so that wouldn’t have worked. 

Over time the hole has shrunk, but now that I’ve gotten to a point where I’m extremely happy with where I am and what my life is like, this still weighs me down. I feel like it’s all my fault that this ended up this way and had I just stayed at the movie theatre when I was 14, instead of skipping off, things would be way different. Of course, now I’ve accepted that things are over with Sk8r Boi and it’s been nearly two years so there’s really no chance it’ll start back up again, but I don’t know how to get back out there again. I want to get back out there again though. 

TL;dr friend zone became weird pseudorelationship, ended abruptly. emotionally scarred and don’t know how to get back out there.

I did a pretty intense workout this morning, holding 1Kg (2.2lbs) weights above my head, I did a series of jumping jacks, stretches, squats, and much more. For breakfast, I had 1 banana, 1 apple, 2 servings of protein cereal, 2 added cups of milk to make it taste good, as well as a little over a serving of oatmeal.

I had a game at school today, we ended loosing 5-2. However I feel like I performed well. I am not very good at finishing goals, however. I feel like I have majorly improved on dribbling players and communicating with teammates. I will work on reading opponents, however. What are your strengths in football?

I didn't have the opportunity to practise after school today. The field and walls were being used. Oh well! What's your favourite way to practise football? That pretty much sums up my day today. Sorry for it being so short!",27Nov2017,3
