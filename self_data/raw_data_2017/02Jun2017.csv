10,"I just want to write and write and write because it's fun. I want to get these topics that I want and just develop them so that they can be the big beautiful things I imagine them to be. I want to paint a landscape with my words, every rock, every mountain, every colorful blade of grass and weed, every butterfly. But I also want readers who will see my works and praise them.

I don't know why I want people to tell me I'm good. I know I am. Yet this thought brings me to act upon this strange desire to be read.

I already have thousands of ideas. Most are in my head, many are written on paper or on forums. I could already write many books with all the things I have yet to describe, all the worlds I've imagined but have yet to develop. Yet, I still go to r/WritingPrompts to write because I will get some readers there. I will get praised for the quality of my works.

Now, I'm frustrated because the prompts in that sub don't fit with the ideas I already have. I can't write my stories to fit the ideas of the posters there. I *know* that the solution to that is writing on my own profile or my own subreddit, or writing on subreddits that are freer like ones about writing or critique. I can get views and I can write, but I won't get praised for my creative take on the prompt.

12,"I've gone through some of the threads on /self/ and seen people despairing about being at whatever twenty-something age and having severe issues of self-worth, fulfillment, etcetera. In a sense, I join that world today by bringing attention to myself as somewhat of a novice at life being 25 years of age without any particularly marketable skills.

I started my education at Rutgers (the State University of New Jersey) in fine art, and for a while had a good go of it. My first year was fairly manageable, and I obtained good grades for the effort. My second year though I dropped out mid semester. I was worried I would never make enough money as an artist to cover my debts and sustain myself. Thus began the stage of my life which I am currently trying to resolve. Let's call them the ""dark ages.""
I spent the next year in a community college where I studied college algebra and writing for a semester, before I suffered some traumatic experiences and left to move to Texas. Now I live here at my father's apartment and have since 2012. In the meantime I have paid off that first year's of college worth of debt, bought an old car, made some good contacts through church... and gone through a year of school at the local community college in Drafting. It's only supposed to take a year to get the certificate but I expect it will be complete in 2018 if I stick with it.

What frustrates me is this -- I want to go back to school and study engineering, but my math skills have faded and I'm terrified of failing any more classes. So I am studying online with Khan Academy. I just got a job at Target, which will hopefully allow me to move out on my own this year. But there are things that cause me to become hopelessly nostalgic for my hometown. My little brother is in school and he's turning 12. I want to be around to encourage him to excel and not make the mistakes I did. Almost all my family lives in New Jersey, but I don't know how to be there for them and complete school at the same time.

I have been severely depressed for the past four years because I am not in university, living up to my potential. Some of that is because I was at work paying loans, and then was denied loans, some because I have been studying elsewhere on a career path that I am unsure of. Now that I'm finally old enough to declare myself independent, whether it fits the situation or not, I can get my own loans for school. This year I want to make real progress in sticking to my goals, to work towards that degree, to finally hear the sweet sound of graduation music, and most importantly, to enjoy it with people that I know and enjoy the company of.
I'm not sure what advice I'm looking for, or if I'm looking for anything in particular. I guess I'm on this site for the first time so that I can make some friends. I'd like to understand Engineering, Art and Architecture better. I'd like to have some direction in participating in intellectual pursuits. I'd like to join a book club and talk about particular pieces of literature. I'd really like some people to talk to from an impersonal point of view on philosophical concepts.

As I am right now though, I'm drifting in a sea of information. I feel lost, even when I'm at school, or at church, or at home, because I have such difficulty focusing my attention on the ideas that interest me most. I want to learn a lot about some things and not a little about everything, if I possibly can. For example, last year I worked as a nursing assistant, simply because I applied and got the job. It led me through an experience that was profound and life changing, but at the end of the day I had to say to myself, the job was not what I am looking for. I want to study design. So now I'm getting ready to work at Target, and I'm praying for guidance in that pursuit.",02Jun2017,2

I start on Tuesday!! ",02Jun2017,2
17,"Hey everyone, 

-I have been a target ""redcard"" member for about 5 years and have usually been able to make my payments on time. For most of the payments I have been able to go to target.com and successfully and happily pay my balance online. However in the last year or so something terrible has been stewing in the deepest and darkest pits. 


-The first time was innocuous. I tried to log in and pay my bill just like always, but whether it was due to the big security breach or some small computer error or my own terrible password management I failed to log in. No big deal, I thought, not knowing what the next months would hold. I tried to do the usual thing of resetting my password, but to no avail. So I was directed to call customer service. The few times I had dealt with them before there was no problem. I think they had actually done this before for me. This is when things turned on me. It turns out I was actually a couple days late on my payment and that you are not able to access the account management system if you are late. I think I even asked the person ""You are telling me I can't access the system I use to pay my bills, because my bill hasn't been paid?"" I asked them if that made sense, and I think they gave some pat response, because of human being on the phone with me wants to agree, but the target employee has to stay brand positive. With all the recording being done for better ""customer service experience"" or whatever. So I say fine and pay the bill online with my debit card (an important detail for later).

-Another few months roll around and I'm back on the saddle of making my payments online and on time until something happens. I have no idea what, it could have been the phase of the moon or something I ate for dinner, but I can't login again. I try the usual thing of resetting online and IT TELLS ME I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RESET MY PASSWORD. I think ""great! Finally I can login without problems."" When I try my new password, it tells me that my username or password is incorrect. By this point I am not even angry, I'm just so dumbfounded that the system could be this convoluted and unnecessarily opaque. 

-Back to customer service! This time I try to tell them that I'm having issues logging in and I give them all my information and whatnot and they reset my password or something like that again. I pay my bill again and move one. 

-By this point I've given up on the online system. Next time I just try to pay my bill over the phone. I go through the phone tree and they say I will need a check to complete my payment. I thought ""no big deal, they probably just want the account number or routing number or something."" NO! They want a check number, a check number! I'm not so young that I don't remember how widespread checks use to be, but I'm not so old that I still use them for everything. There was no option to pay with a credit or debit card. Just no option for that. You had to talk to a customer service rep, which by the way, follows usual business hours. I don't necessarily have a problem with that, but with everything else just adds to my frustration.

-Next month or so rolls around, can't log in. Well what do you know. Target apparently has two account systems or something. I can get into my target account just fine, ohhh but that redcard, that's fort knox if it was designed by the joker. I've had it up to here with it so I call customer service and Immediately ask for the manager or supervisor or whatever would get me escalated up the chain of command. Hopefully they could put me through to the CEO and I could relay them this story. I got someone else who may or may not have had the same authority as the person I started with. Also, I know these people aren't responsible. I know they are hardworking and just want to get on with their day, but I have to stand up for myself. I was so tired of being told to just try again. By the end of the very terse conversation I am told someone higher than whoever was talking to me would call me back during the daytime.

-Some person calls me and I start out irritated. I am being as patient as possible, but I get the overwhelming sense that everyone I have talked to just wants to pacify me and not address the actual problem. I tell them I just want to be able to log on. I'm not sure it happened this time or a different time, but they reset my password and tell me not to try to login with for a few days. A few days! I may have even been late because of that. 

-Also, during this whole debacle, they are pushing autopay on me. Because I was trying to take control of my credit and make sure I made payments for how much and when I wanted I denied it. It may have been easier but it is totally beside the point.

-Fast forwards a few months and I'm so frustrated that I don't even feel like paying the bill anymore because it is difficult for me to ACTUALLY PAY MY BILL. Let me pay you target! Please!

-Anyway, I tried logging in tonight. I logged into my target account find and I tried my redcard hoping the gods would smile on me tonight. I press log in and it immediately takes me to ""Forgot password or username"" with absolutely no indication that the information I entered was wrong. This got very ranty and I'm relieved that I finally put these frustrations on paper. I like target the store very much and continue to shop there.

20,"So last quarter, my report card was all A's and B's except for one C in math. I thought ""Oh, I better improve in math, so I should focus more on that."" Since I had an A in science, I decided to focus less on that, and focus more on math.

That was all fine, until the class moved seats and I we placed next to a distracting classmate, and I rediscovered the magic of the internet and I was basically missing almost all of my assignments in that class. No big deal right? I mean practice grades aren't that bad!

WRONG! I got my Infinite Campus account information today (it's the program used to check your grades in case you didn't know), since I hadn't used it since 2014. I went and checked my grades, and all of my classes were great with either A's or B's (math is currently an A). 

My science grade is astounding... Well, an astounding 49.52%. So I currently have an F! You know what makes this even worse? Tomorrow (Friday), is June 2nd, and school ends on June 8th. I can ace the semester exam, that's easy, but the exam is only 10% of your grade. 

Well I'm fucked. I had an F in math at the beginning of the year, so another F would mean summer school. I'm talking to the teacher tomorrow, and I'm going to make up my missing assignments over the weekend. There's also a ""Current Event"" extra credit that I can do (basically writing summaries of science related news stories), and each story is worth five points. You can write up to three. 

I'll be writing three Current Events, making up my assignments, and hoping that my grade goes up. Yes, I know that I'm fucking up my grade even more by complaining about it on reddit instead of actually doing stuff about it at the moment.

*TL;DR: My science grade is a F, and we only have five more days of school left. Help me.*

29,"You know. I thought it was great to go out with a friend you really care for. Until it didn't work out and you end up losing that friend. I guess that was always the risk but, was blind sided. Thought it was perfect as cherries but that was just me being naïve.

Even if a friend and I get interested in each other, I don't want that risk. It could end well or it could end horribly (or it could not end but will not be the main focus). Whatever percentage that is, it's still too high. Just the chance of losing them. It's already awful to think about.

I pushed things too forward causr I thought things were going well. But multiple times, many chances to say or mentiom that it wasn't. But not once. Just suddenly. You have no idea how much it hurt. How much it still hurts. 

You were a friend that I was excited to be close friends with. It was exciting you rooted me on for art. You were interested. You listened and it was wonderful. But only for me. And that really sucks. Hard fucking cock.

Tinder and bumble. It's nice. As shitty as it sounds... I don't have that chance of losing someone I care about. Its a stranger and maybe to a friend then maybe to more. But if it doesnt work out, it is quickly aware and ends smoothly. My heart won't be crushed after 1 unsuccessful date. It can sting a bit especially if I thought it was going well but, the pain goes away within the day. 

I don't want to be with someone for many monthes to be told that it wasn't working out for a while. I've had too much time to build my feelings for you. You really could've told me sooner. God. I hate seeing your name. Your user name. All of it. But I end up not being able to hate you. There's no point in caring about you but god damnit. Skittles. You like those. The purple bag. Why does it have to be that that sets me off. But it was so instinctive to buy a bag for you. I pretty much lived with you for a month and everytime I went by a store. I wanted to get you those stupid purple skittles. Wait for you by the subway. It was such a joy I can't explain. Waiting for you to get home. And it was the same online. Waiting to see your username pop up. It made my day. You idiot. Now I can't talk to you, much less even look at anything that reminds me of you. I can't be friends with you. And you know, that really fucking sucks. At this point, I hate that I fell for you. We could have been close friends. Share anime. I wanted to reccomend so much more. You'd like Witch Academia. It has cute small girls and the art is nice.

Sometimes the online dating moves too fast. Sometimes a bit slow. It's nicer being slower but at the same time. I don't want this person to become someone precious to me. Then if I lose them. It'll hurt so much. I can't avoid and be scared forever. But I rather play it safe for a while. Until I've stopped hurting. I thought I was okay and boy I really should be. Its been a few months. Many wonderful people helped me too. It doesn't add up.

A bath sounds wonderful but I might just pass out. I feel horrid emotionally and real shit physically. Fever came back and suddenly I'm very sick after the gym. Nose clogged then running. Having weird headhighs. Hallucinations again. That shouldnt be normal but hey. I don't mean to take that word lightly but was seeing human like figures everywhere. And the mirage effects around me. Maybe its not the right word but I sure am seeing things. I do not think I've lost it. Think its the fever thing. Who knows. There seems to be alot wrong with me, but at the same time. Maybe its normal for certain pains. Maybe side effects from surgery? Probably healthy as a bun, and its in my head. Had that weird anxiety of thinking I'd die before 30 when I was 11. That was fun. Thinking i wouldn't wake up the next day and thinking if I were dead the next morning. 

What's wrong with me? A lot of things but at the same time. Nothing at all. Healthy lass with mental constraints. Gotta change the mindset. First.

But at least no one can tell I've cried when Im sick.

you are structured irrational judging due to very low perception from being structured over looking around in deep thinking, inaccurate sensing with horrible intuition.. a recipe of disaster as you think being around people will make you happy longterm over fixing yourself with all the deep roots of problems

i can't tell you that, you are very blind, i can't tell you that i am superior because my level of thinking will eventually reach a stage of maturity where it will be able to reach perfection of inner peace, all this effort longterm has grown me beyond what you can even comprehend, all you see is far away from true happiness that you could have or rather your just unequipped to have happiness with the current state your in.. i pity you

the one who is actually low value and high value ironically is a tide in your head, you will not even notice it you will stay asleep i'll let you at your peace of being a narcissist, it's not my job to fix you as everyone has their own path and theirs nothing wrong with being a toxic narcissistic as you don't even realize it

51,"This is from when I was younger, it was on my mind when I woke up this morning and it made me feel a lot.

The short of it is I met a girl when I was 13 and we became friends.  She had a best friend and then we were all friends.  I lost my virginity to the first girl when we were both 15, then her second girl was shy but was curious because the first girl talked to her about our experience, we had also hooked up a couple times after, so then later on the best friend and I had sex, she lost her virginity to me.  Up until graduation I would have sex with one or the other, sometimes the first girl would get a boyfriend but then she would break up and complain about things and be back to sex with me.  The weekend after we graduated high school they proposed a threesome to me, so I had sex with both of them, it was good, nothing went wrong, we talked about it, and we had several more threesomes after that.  Then it just kind of stopped, we remained friends, this all occurred within a span of like two months after graduation, it was still summer.

I met these guys through another female friend and I started going for runs with them.  They would brag about their sexcapades and I never had anything to say because I didn't want to just throw my female friends under the bus.  Some of these guys started making fun of me for not having any stories, like I must be a virgin, maybe I'm gay, do they need to be careful around me, things like that.  I was talking to these two girls about this and they told me it was ok to tell the guys about them, like they were never going to meet them anyway.  So next time these guys were talking, I just started throwing in my experience with these girls, they just kind of ignored me and kept talking about their stuff.  Then the next time they were asking me for pictures or something and I was like I don't have anything of this it's just what happened, and they just laughed because they would have pictures of girls undressing in their rooms or women's underwear on the floor and be like I snapped this while she was in the bathroom cleaning up, and I had nothing so I was just making it up.

I was talking to one of these girls and she asked how it was going with my guy friends, I told her what happened, a couple hours later I got a phone call and she wanted me to come over to talk to her and our other girlfriend.  They wanted to make a video because they felt I was being slighted and they really liked me and wanted to help me because they knew I had felt bad because I had never really had guy friends, now I did and they were treating me like crap.  So the video was, I was standing in the middle of them in front of the one girl's bed, we're all in our underwear, there's a 3 2 1 one thing and then both girls said they loved sharing (my name) in bed with each other.  Then they both kissed me on the cheek.  After this the one girl pushed me onto the bed and started climbing onto me, and the other one went to the camera and turned it off.  So the video you see one girl by my side, then the other girl walking to my other side because she was at the camera at first.  Then the 3 2 1 ""we love"" thing, the kiss, then you see the back of one girl climbing onto me and you see a bit of grinding start and you hear us making out, during this the other girl is walking to the camera and you still hear us in the background, but then the end is pretty much all you see is the one girl's lips, she does a kiss and then the video ends.  The video is just over ten seconds long, I still have it.  We didn't have sex afterwards, though we did fool around a bit, they weren't going to send me home heavy, they weren't mean, but this wasn't a threesome hookup or anything.

This was before you could watch videos on phones, this was digital camera and flip phone era, but it was the one girl's digital camera not mine, what they did was they transferred it to the computer and emailed it to me.  Then of course I saved it, they told me to show it to my friends.  I felt really good, I have not had a female relationship as deep or loving since either of these two, but, well, anyway.  Next time I was out with these guys, I had been anticipating, then when we were out the whole time I was incredibly anxious because I was waiting the whole time for the subject to come up.  It did and they didn't even ask me.  So I said I have something to show you guys, and they asked what.  I said I would show it when we got back to the one guy's house (he was the one that pretty much got us all together doing things) because I needed a computer.  When we got back his parents were home so I had to turn the volume way down, but when they saw I was in it they were all like right pressed up against each other to see.  They replayed it a few times.  Then they didn't say anything about it, they just started joking and talking about other things, but I still remember after that everything while we were hanging out there felt really awkward and forced.  It just kind of went on for a bit and people started going home.  I went home.  I try getting in touch with them and the two I would usually talk to don't pick up, I don't get invites or anything, eventually the one guy I call and he picks up I think by accident, I still remember this it was like hey what's up and I went hey it's me and there was this pause and I'm pretty sure he was considering hanging up but then he goes hey man what's going on and I'm like not a lot, I haven't heard from any of you in a while, it was yeah we've been busy, sorry, gotta go, and then hung up thing.  And that was it.  Tried a few more times over a couple weeks and never got anything.  So that was how it ended.

I mostly felt bad and it tanked my self-esteem.  I thought I did something wrong.  I never really had male friends, I was happy to have a circle finally, now it was gone, so really depressed and lonely.  I still had these girls and yeah, like, maybe some people would look at it and be like why are you complaining look what you still have, but it still made me feel terrible, like I had been kicked off an island and I didn't know what I did.  Then one of these girls, I didn't tell them right away, it was a couple weeks later they were just like we're sick of seeing you like this, tell us what happened.  So I did.  And they told me, and as soon as I did I was like, I can't believe I've been feeling poorly about myself, because yeah, that's it.  They ostracized me from the circle because I made them jealous and they didn't want to have me around feeling bad and they didn't want to tell me that I made them jealous because people don't like telling people that.  They were fine rubbing all this in to me and bragging to each other.  Then I had this thing going, the only reason I showed it was because I wanted to be like see?  I'm one of you, keep me around.  And then they just pushed me out of that circle.

I still have better female relationships than male relationships, even though I get older and people get married and stuff and it gets harder to just have women in your life.  But sometimes the social pressure men put on me because of the jealousy, I forget about it.  And I start blaming myself again.  And then I remember this, I go to the video, I watch it over and over and over and over until I remember exactly what was going on at that time, and then I remember not to blame myself, because it isn't my fault other men aren't as good at this as I am.  It gets to the point where I start laughing at how petty some of the things they try to slip by me are, just because they're pissed that they aren't me.",02Jun2017,2
52,"Greed is one of the main problems of human beings. Some people thinks: better take two pieces for myself and throw one into trash bin instead of take one and give another to someone.

4.

Day begins like the others. Four pills, breakfast, food for Jack and then work. Eight hours of sitting by computer, boring. Then Timothy leaves and returns home. On the way he enters a local market. Strawberries on sale! Yes, $0.1 cheaper. And five grandmas take everything. Just like they would want to sell them for $0.5 more expensive per stack. It's sad because other people can't even look at the strawberries. When Timothy walks near 'the grandmothers gang', they look at him hostility. Like Tim would steal one strawberry.

Of course not every single person is greedy. There are many friendly people. But human's construction is more like to remember these bad things. One bad experience can upstage ten great feelings. This part of the story is less about beauty of life. It's more about human's disadvantages. Sometimes you have to stop dreaming and face the reality. Just like Timothy Leist and his cancer. But he's not really facing the problem, he's escaping from it. Refuses any help and agrees with death.

Let's leave Timothy for a while. Focus on these grandmas. Basically their lives are poor. So they try everything to earn some money. It leads to the greed, but caused not by theirs mentality at all. Well, rich people also can be greedy, but it's different. Back to elders, they might have lived whole live in the low middle class. Medium educated, physical work in the past. Parents taught them how to live sparingly. They may call themselves not as greedy one, but as businesswomen.

Timothy isn't tired today, he's bored. After dinner he goes on a quick stroll with Jack. Dog is of course happy, as always. It will be very stressful experience when Tim will leave him. They back home. Tim sits on a couch watching tv. There is nothing interesting. He just stares blankly at the tv. Jack is calmer after the stroll. Night is hard for Timothy. He lies in bed and can't sleep. Tim looks at clock hour by hour. It's almost 6:30 a.m., so he should wake up. Well, it's not his first sleepless night.

Tim wakes up. He got like 20 minutes more than other days. Jack is happy, because Timothy uses this time to go for a quick stroll with him. Everything is calm this morning. Tim doesn't need to hurry. It will be a melancholic day. Timothy eats breakfast, takes four pills and leaves to work. He's the only one 'alive' in the bus. Other people look like zombie - sleepy. It doesn't mean that he'll fall down later. The day is gloomy. It's been like three weeks since last rain.

Seems like the weather affects on everybody. Workers are bored, there is no empty space for smile on their faces. It's like an eight hours break in life. They don't talk between each other, they don't cooperate. At 4 p.m., everyone leave, Timothy also. It's windy outside, walking is not a very nice feeling. He goes to a buffet for a home dinner. An ordinary pork chop, potatoes and a salad. Timothy sits next to window. He stares at the street. People hurry to hide somewhere. They hold closed umbrellas, preparing for the rain.

No, Timothy is not tired at all. He goes on a very quick stroll with Jack. Dog needs to spend some time outside each day. Let's not immerse into this problem. Then Tim turns on his computer. Watching videos in internet will be his 'entertainment' for this day. As you probably know from your own experience: you start watching your favourite program and then you watch something completely different rotated for 180 degrees. System suggests what could be enjoyable for you. You just click on these suggestions and goes deeper into the virtual world.

And following this rule, Timothy watches an interview with fifteen years old girl. She is proud that she has lost her virginity at the age of twelve. It's an ordinary thing for her. She got like ten sexual partners in last three years. She says that two weeks ago she has slept with a man, who was 20 years older than her. To be honest she looks like the other girls. One thing is 100% sure: there is no love in her life. Timothy before watching this video didn't know that someone young could lead so rich sexual life. But being proud is not a good thing.

Some young girls loves a party lifestyle. Each weekend they go somewhere: clubs, home parties, concerts, etc. Where are their parents? Mostly it's like they are divorced. For example if daughter stays with mother, the mother doesn't pay enough attention about her child. Totally freedom for this young lady, she thinks she rules the world. When someone adult like Timothy watches this, the reaction is not positive at all. Tim's first love story is a little bit similar, story for the next time.

53,"This is a stream of thought sorry if it jumps around. I just needed to put this on paper but I don't know what to do with it so I'm putting it here. 

I've been dragged through life kicking and screaming by a high IQ and a good support system. I've lost large chunks of my life to depression and anxiety. I work a job I could have done in high school, because I'm so afraid of failure that I'm paralysed by anxiety. I have no grit. I constantly feel like a fraud even when doing the things I am supposed to be good at. I don't finish anything, and I constantly second guess myself into bad decisions, so I don't trust myself to make decisions. None of my successes or accomplishments have ever amounted to anything. I generally feel like I suck at being a human. I forget things all the time. I worry about the future constantly. I dont reflect on the past enough. I cope by distracting myself with the internet and weed and magic. I dont take care of myself when im depressed because i feel like im dying. Im pretty sure im going to kill myself eventually. I think the only reason i haven't is because of what it would do to my mom and wife. I don't even live for myself.  I don't feel any better having written this down. ",02Jun2017,1

57,"I don't understand why Trump is still in office. Why are any of these people still in office. What the shit is even going on... what the fucking shit.

Just shoot me now, I don't want to wait until this administration inevitably kills me, either from negligence, incompetence, or a willful effort to fuck (not just) me over. 

Why can't someone fucking grow some balls in congress. Why can't anyone stand up to Trump in the government. Not in just a ""take my marbles and go home"" kind of way either. People in power need to take action.

It feels like the country's falling apart. With the Paris Agreement deal, many states and *even cities* announced they'd stay in it. He's not leading the country anymore.

62,"The girl that I thought was perfect for me just dropped me out of the blue. She's working out of town for the summer and we were waiting for next semester to start before officially dating, and everything seemed to be going well until she told me that it isn't working and that she doesn't want to keep doing this anymore. She told me that things had fizzled out for her and that she wanted to end things now before it got more painful. I don't know what to do with myself now, I used to be so happy to get texts from her but now I have no one to talk to and I'm just sitting around thinking about what's wrong with me that the girl that stayed around the longest decided I wasn't worth the trouble. I don't even care if no one ever reads this, it's just nice to type out how I'm feeling.

65,"I was at work today and was walking on the path that surrounds the building. It was about time for work to start so I ran as fast as I could to get back inside. There wasn't any particular reason for why I was compelled to run but I think it's because I was feeling anxious. There was someone up ahead of me walking who looked back and noticed me. He must have thought that I was charging at him because he started running as well. I was stunned and quickly put my hands up to alert him that I wasn't chasing him. He started to slow down and I did too. I suppose that it didn't help that I was wearing all black as that is the uniform I wear during work and I often think that I appear menacing to people because of the way they usually respond to me. Like as if they would like to have absolutely nothing to do with me. But I guess I also share that demeanor. He stopped and pulled a water bottle out of his backpack to drink and as I approached him I apologized for the misunderstanding. I told him I was feeling ""panicky"" and went on my way. This experience left me feeling odd. It's like as if I am not the only one constantly bracing for real or perceived dangers and it's almost as if being paranoid has become normalized. I should just stop running.",02Jun2017,2
68,"I feel like I'm becoming a hermit. Nowadays I spend a lot of time doing things alone and I almost prefer to go out alone a lot of the time. I have never really liked hanging out with people as much as I think most people do, and although I'm not bad at social interaction or anything I just get tired of all the weird customs and having to pretend to be interested in shit I'm not interested in. I like being alone but I'm 17 and I'm out of school for the summer, and I really don't wanna just work and smoke all summer and completely miss out on social interaction. Damned if I do, damned if I don't..

While I'm at it I am about to start my senior year. My parents want me to go to college right after high school and while I see why that's the smartest decision I don't know if I can do 4 more years of academia right after finishing 12 years of it. I hate school, I feel like my brain doesn't work the way the system is structured and although I consider myself to have above average intelligence I still manage to make low grades and fail classes even with no excuse to. I don't want to waste my parents money on classes I may just flunk because of a lack of caring. I really just want to travel and find odd jobs and float around, and just experience life and meet interesting people. I know that sounds like idealistic bs but I believe I can make it work. I am aware of how hard it can be but I am physically capable and have work experience, and I don't think finding a job that pays enough to support me short term would be difficult. My parents would never let me do this though so I would either have to wait until after college (if I don't flunk) or  just do it after high school anyways, but I don't want to create a rift with my parents. We have a great relationship. any advice appreciated, I feel very lost

70,"So me, a girl, told my girlfriend who is also a girl that I'm in love with her. It hasn't really been that long, a little more than a month, but I'm really quite smitten by her, and while I suppose it's a little soon I'm​ absolutely glad that I did. 

I didn't expect her to say it in return, and I was very clear about that; I just wanted her to know.  Too often in my life I've missed the opportunity to tell someone how I feel - failed to let them know how much they mean to me, and regretted it.  

She was happy, and receptive, but said she needs more time, which is OK - she's been burned in the past, so I can understand her apprehension.  

I guess there really isn't a point except that I wanted to share this with someone.  ",02Jun2017,163

73,"　Recently, I described the situation in which the Illuminati is spreading fear around the world, and the Trump administration is clearly the target of this.

　It is said that, until they came into power, President Trump, and those around him did not know about the Illuminati plots, and mind reading, the source of their power. 

　As President Trump, therefore, progressed with the exposure of his political opponents, the Illuminati, the enforcement officers of the Illuminati may have carried out mind reading on Jared Kushner as reference information for the investigation. At present, evidence obtained through mind reading cannot actually be used as evidence.

　However, it is thought that the Illuminati and the pro-Illuminati government are already using mind reading technology for domestic control. After gaining the information by mind reading, they then look for supporting evidence to establish guilt. 

Recently the smile has left the face of President Trump. He may be troubled by the ferocity of the resistance shown by the Illuminati. Jared Kushner is Jewish but this will not save him in this situation.

　Those people working to expose the Illuminati shall keep going until they destroy them. Their will to do this is clear for all to see.

　Fight on, President Trump. You have justice on your side!

If they can do the job or position or make the decisions that need to be done why do we have to draw attention to them like it's a handicap to be female or black or a trans or whatever.
