0,"I love Reddit. But I'm tired of all the gifs and the memes and videos. 

It makes my front page feel lifeless and scrolling past the BS is starting to feel like a chore.

I want more discussion and interaction that is meaningful.

Something like this sub and r/casualconversation and anything that is non-judgemental and has lots of free discussion and a welcoming community. 

Can you guys help me out? 

Thank you so much.",01Dec2017,13

10,"I have this friend that I’ve been friends with for over 9 years. I remember at first, he was really cool, but maybe around the 2-3 year mark he started getting really clingy and needy. Like, if we were in a room with a bunch of our friends and one of my friends or I made eye contact with him for 0.001 seconds from across the room, he’d be standing right behind us in a matter of seconds. This paired with his awkwardness and absolutely terrible sense of humor (repeating vague/ out of date memes or references over and over again every five minutes, no joke. Yesterday’s meme was the “it’s Wednesday my dudes” meme) has kinda ruined me. It’s gotten to the point where I hate him so much that I can’t not hate him, no matter what he does. He actually could have invented the cure for cancer and I’d still hate him. I start to really shake with anger and have a mini panic attack every time he opens his mouth. And the worst part is that I really don’t even know why.

All my other mutual friends with him have pretty much cut ties with him, and I’ve been trying to do the same, but I’m sort of sure I’m one of his only “friends” left. He still hangs around, always right behind me or one of my other friends, and comes in with a completely nonsensical one-liner or thought of his that ruins the flow of any conversation ever. I want to just cut ties with him like my other friends, but on the other hand, I don’t want to leave him alone.

If you haven’t noticed, I’m a selfish asshole that cares only about my own well being. Okay. I’m done venting. Thanks for taking the time out of your day to read this.",01Dec2017,84

15,"So yeah I better preface this by saying i'm pretty drunk and probably wouldn't be typing this while sober (so probably a good thing i'm drunk now anyway). I'll probably think this is literate when I type it then realise tomorrow that it barely makes any sense but whatever, sorry.

Basically i'm 21 years old, male, straight, at uni (first year) and met this girl on like the second week who I was attracted to. Got talking, turned out she had a boyfriend - cool, no problem. It's obviously a little disappointing but I have no interest in being in a relationship with someone who's already in a relationship, no matter how attracted I am to them, so we end up becoming really good friends.

Now, a few months later her and her boyfriend breakup - and I start really falling for her and all that. One night we're at a club and in a drunken state she basically lays out to me that she's not interested, a relationship wouldn't work and all that. This kinda pisses me off because while I have no issue with her not being into me (no one's under any obligation to feel attracted to any one else), considering we're close friends I felt she owed it to me to tell me that in private where I could talk to her about it, rather than just telling me in a club, where it basically just ruined my night and was impossible to speak to her honestly about my feelings, bear in mind I had never told her how I felt about her at any point.

So I spoke to her about this a few days later (when she came back to uni from home) and she'd forgotten the entire conversation where she literally just turned to me and out of the blue said ""i'm not interested"" and all that, and she agreed it was a shitty way to tell me and was very apologetic about it, and at the same time I admitted my feelings to her and she said that was fine, she wanted to remain friends (my main fear in telling her was losing her as a friends), and since then it worked out fine between us as friends.

The problem is that i've never been in a relationship, i'm a virgin and I came to uni really hyping it up in my own mind as a chance to start anew and reinvent myself compared to school where I was pretty socially awkward, and I felt much more confident coming into uni, i've made a bunch of friends both guy and girl, but i'm just shit at the whole romance thing and it's this vicious cycle that's making me feel worse and worse where I feel unattractive, which causes me to feel less confident, which in turn makes me feel more unattractive. I have no issue speaking to girls, and they seem to really like me as friends - but it's never anything more than that.

Anyway I went out the other night and this close friend, who I was attracted to and who isn't attracted to me, ended up going home with some random girl (she's bi), and I just feel like complete shit right now - I know that logically i'll get over it and move on but it's just really tough to make myself believe that, and it's really tough to believe i'll get into a meaningful relationship. I don't blame her at all, I want to make that super clear, she can do what she wants - but it's just making me feel super shit and it's adding on to all my other insecurities to just make me feel completely unattractive.

It's just one of those things where I feel like i'm never going to get over this person, even though from a rational point of view I probably will - and it's hard to not take it personally as confirmation that i'm not an attractive person.

I feel like I need someone who's been in this situation before (which I expect is a lot) to just give me some reassurance because my other friends are great, but they haven't been that useful in making me think it's gonna get better - because they're the same age as me and they're working all this out with me.

To be honest I don't really know what i'm asking for, or what I need. I just need to vent and put this out there, it's probably barely readable anyway.",01Dec2017,6

20,"Earlier this week, I found out that my significant other doesn't want to move in together any time in the near future. Although for understandably good reasons, I can't help but feel a little unsettled - as hesitation to co-habitate to some degree impedes progress in our relationship...

He also said that the way I dress now makes him feel that I'm not trying to impress him. This makes sense - I could use a little more self-loving. 

Today, my college-age brother revealed to me that my father is cheating on my mother. I've known for awhile. My brother is younger; and so, I'm flipping shit about how to handle my conversation with him so that he can fully understand the situation and move past it.

Tomorrow, I'm going to stop by my baby brother's high school to speak to his teachers. Honestly, he doesn't have the right motivation for doing well in school and failed a couple required classes for graduation.

Did I forget to mention that the first day of the month is here? This means I have to pay the bills - for my parent's mortgage, utility, and some of their loans.

In 21 days, I will turn 26 years old. I always plan a birthday trip for myself - to get away from my family and the snow. Birthdays were sad memories for me growing up. I'm afraid that I may not be able to this year. 

I bear so much weight that I'm starting to think it's not fair. I didn't ask for any of this. The little girl inside of me just want to pack her bags and run away, never to return. But, I'm looking forward.",01Dec2017,2

22,"For 3 days I've felt like there's no point in anything. I don't know what causes my negative thoughts: depression? anxiety? lack of self confidence? Whatever. Point is, I keep assuming my girlfriend doesn't like me. I keep imagining her having a blast with other guys and I feel like that's it, she wants to end it right here. And after 3 days of feeling sorry for myself and not seeing the point in anything I got out of that by literally forcing myself to admit that, well, she still loves me. That no matter what stupid excuse my mind makes, there's no reason for her to not love me. And I really feel like I need huge mental power to keep this momentum going, of feeling good. Like, it's so easy to drop back to ""she hates me, just look at how much time it took her to reply to my messages. She sent a message saying she loves me? She doesn't mean that"".  There's a voice telling me those things and it pulls me harder than any positive ""forced"" thought could ever do. 

I just know that I'm going to fall back to this depressed state, and I hate being there. I mean, we attract what we fear. If I keep coming back to feeling like she hates me then I keep this self fulfilling prophecy rolling. I don't know why my negative voice is always so much stronger than the positive one but all I know that for long periods of time it would take me to trips to self hate land and I'd come back to normal only when I really have the mental power to fight it back with positive thoughts. But I don't think I can allow my life to go this way any longer.",01Dec2017,5
23,"I am in my senior year of high school and recently decided to try chatting with my crush. I initially thought everything was going great till a couple days after. I messaged her and she saw it but no reply until a day later. I ignored this and continued chatting. That day I was stressing about a Spanish essay when she told me that a guy who was in the same class as me was also talking about that. I thought nothing of what she said except the next day at school that guy was talking about her so I knew something was up.

Skip forward a couple days I discovered that they were a thing. It annoyed me that I didn't know about this before. However I didn't allow this rejection to get the best of me. I used it as a learning experience and grew from it. It still annoys me seeing her or seeing them online at Facebook at the same time but I always think about how I can learn from rejection.

I hope that anyone else who has been in such a situation or will be won't be hung up on the other person and can learn to accept rejection and grow from this process.

24,"I've been best friends with a Lesbian for over 2 years, problem is; she’s gorgeous and I find her attractive
There's always been this strangely functioning equilibrium between us. We are on the same frequency, finish each others sentences and can basically communicate without having to express ourselves. We talk to each other about basically anything, and we resolve any problems we get pretty much immediately. I can have incredibly stimulating intellectual conversations with her. We see each other often and have so much fun. 

Dancing is even more telepathic, its like we can predict each others movements. We're both solid dancers and it’s hot, when go out we often use it to wingman for each other.

The only problem is; I am incredibly attracted to her. She's the hottest woman i've ever gotten close with. She has this sassy teasing disposition about her, her whole being just radiates sex.  I’ve never been in love with her, but there are these periods when I feel like I might be developing feelings for her.
 
This leads to some complications. Being as close as we are, we often sleep in the same room and don't shy away from walking around half naked around each other. We sometimes cuddle and i've played with her breasts. For her, she just likes the action. I get turned on by it. She does notice so she said she doesn't want to go further and give me any wrong ideas. 

Making things worse, she's very sexually open and doesn't mind making out with men when she's out and no interested girls are around. She basically gets free pickings. According to her its simply about having something to do. She did say some months ago that she gets incredibly turned on by strong black men, she almost slept with one over the summer. She often talks about wanting to be dominated by them. She has never fallen in love with men before, but the fact that she has this raw sexual attraction to some of them makes me feel jealous. 
In some weirdly Freudian way, I get turned on by it. I often fantasise about her having sex with men. I think it is my subconscious telling me I could be with her. These thoughts have not stopped me from being intimate with other women, but I wish I could get rid of these feelings of jealousy so I can fully enjoy our unique friendship to the fullest. 

Basically, I have found a golden friendship but I feel like my sexual attraction to her is causing complications. What do I do?

I help at an animal shelter in Syria, needless to say the concept of an animal shelter in Syria is very recent, we're the first to establish a genuine shelter.

The animals constantly suffer from the war, especially dogs, we provide care to animals that were (including but not limited to):

Stabbed

Shot at

Burned

Tortured (recently had a cat that was impaled by sick a person)

Suffocated

The gov doesn't provide any help, so the shelter ends up running on small donations only (we have around 600 dogs and cats), we constantly have to provide some with expensive surgeries.

Anyways, the point of this post is not to ask for a donation, since that is against the rules.

I made this post so that people can share any Animal funding groups/Subreddits/Facebook pages/People, etc.. that think they can help us in any form.

If you know an animal funding group, a subreddit, an event, or anything that can help us, please post it here.


For example, the subreddit /r/BeforeNAfterAdoption is currently running a ""competition"" to pick an animal group and provide them with funding, I nominated our group. If you know something like this, or just have any idea on how to help, please share.
