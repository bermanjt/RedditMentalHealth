2,"Hi guys hoping for reddit advice on my situation. Im a pretty average looking guy (I have been told I have nice hair) and I dress pretty good for my age. 

When it comes to getting a girlfriend I don't really have a hard time. I have a good bit of female friends, and I have a good reputation so its not hard for me at all. And even in meeting strangers I do pretty good for myself, I can strike up conversations with strangers and I am pretty sociable. 

My problem for me is really the fact that when it comes to getting a fuck buddy it is basically impossible. I have tried Tinder, at first I swiped right selectively, and then I didn't get many matches. So I decided to swipe right on just about everyone. A couple things is that the matches I get tend to be a lot less attractive than the woman I have dated in the past.

The dates I have gone on too haven't lead to anything. It seems that women seem to be interested in me, and then when I say I am just looking for fun, they get upset and turned off. I have had a situation where my friend went on a date with a girl I met off Tinder earlier. She told me that she is only looking for a serious relationship. And then when she went on the date with my friend, she hooked up with him and slept with him again another two more times. 

My theory is that I feel like that it has to do with my personality and looks. Since I can't really change my looks, the only thing I can really work on is my personality. I was thinking that when I go on dates, to act more like my friends that are good with casual sex (who are jerks to women) I feel like for casual sex, women find that to be a turn on. I am not sure that's why I am posting here. What can I do to be the type of guy women want to fuck short term?

3,"Hi all. I've been reading the news lately and I'm getting really paranoid that President Trump could cause World War III or the apocalypse. I've been afraid of North Korea's threats and Russia building their stockpiles. I've also been having nightmares about a nuclear war in my city (Thanks for that, Threads), so I wanna write to President Trump to at least try to convince him that using nuclear weapons at all is a no-go. Would it be a good idea? Knowing his brash and unorthodox attitudes, I fear he would take it the wrong way and actively try to start a war. Sorry if this is an odd subject but I just wanna make sure it's an okay idea. Thanks.",22Mar2017,3
6,"For the love of god, I'm tired of the whole fucking world being built around from preventing me from getting sexual satisfaction. I know, you're going to call me a nice guy fedora m'lady MRA redpiller trump supporter alt-right nazi. Well, someone is, at least, hopefully not everyone.

Look, every living thing has three very basic things to do: eat, don't get killed, and fuck. Is it so god damn hard to believe that there are people who are frustrated with the last part? It's not easy being the one who has to put their own ego on the line, to be the one who has to risk rejection. I don't know how many women appreciate being able to be picky with their mates, but props if you do. 

All the while, I see nothing but contempt for guys who don't know what the hell to do in the dating gauntlet. I'll be real and say that this contempt also extends to unattractive women, but it's certainly easier to be an unattractive man than it is to be an unattractive woman.

At this point, you're probably thinking that I should get help. I'd actually really like to do that, but I have two problems:

1. I work retail, and my schedule is constantly changing. I'm trying to work on getting one or two consistent days off. There's also the financial consideration...

2. My experience with therapy in the past has been that I often end up talking at someone who doesn't say much. I think the entire point is to just have a punching bag for my insanity that I can exhaust myself on. I don't want that. I want someone who will help me find a way to turn my insanity into something productive, turn that energy into something useful. I don't want to be sedated.

20,"Today, my mother told me my father has cancer. He had prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. They don't know much else, but that they're running more tests.

I feel kind of numb and not entirely sure how I'm supposed to feel. He wasn't a great father or any sort of role model. He had no real ambition and lived a very dull life as a warehouse worker packaging boxes. He was not very attached to our family and gave my mom a lot of grief. Even though we all live under the same roof, we could go a couple weeks at least of not saying a word to each other. 

At the same time, I love him as a father in my own way. When I was a toddler, he was unemployed and baby sat me for the most part. I think I developed a kind of attachment to him then. I feel a bit of resentment that he never took me out or do father and son stuff or gave me any guidance. He was always critical of me.

I don't know what his cancer will do to our family. I'm also not sure what I should do.  ",22Mar2017,6

25,"Nothing in my life is simple. I've always got a lot on my mind. I have no idea how to handle people at any given moment. They're almost completely irrational. Tasks get complicated by coordination which boils to down to a failure of communication. Some people like to tell me it's my problem so I have to deal with it. Like my problem will be that they're standing behind my car while I'm trying to back out of a stall. The response will be: Free country, I can stand where I want. It's you that has the problem, not me. You figure it out! I'm trying, could you help? Could you please move?

I have to come up with these strategies which amounts to me figuring out what these people want and how to give it to them while still getting what I want. Hey pal, it sure is hot out. Wouldn't you be more comfortable standing in the shade over there instead of on the hot pavement in the suns full glare? 

I have to spend my life being diplomatic, thinking things through and walking on eggshells just to get from point A to point B. A straight line won't work because there are people in the way! So many irrational, mean-spirited, greedy people! I can't get in or out of a parking space without entering into negotiations! Why can't people just have some damn empathy? Why is it so hard for them to be polite? It would make for a nicer society if we practiced kindness! 

Imagined slights lead to real world consequences. Say I get into my car and buddy thinks I'm rushing him so he deliberately gets in my way to teach me a lesson. Wonderful! Now he's going to treat my words about the shade with distrust and probably mock me for trying. I didn't even do anything and he's already angry at me!

I could go on endlessly. My life certainly feels that way. I against the world. I nearly have a heart attack every time someone extends kindness my way. It is so rare. I'm constantly taxed by the effort it takes to navigate my way through my daily dealings with people. My mind is cluttered with so much trivial bullshit that I can barely think straight. I just want a chance to relax and unwind when I get home but even then I have neighbors, friends and family who want some attention. I feel like I have to spend all of my time attending to peoples whims and then I get called selfish if I spend time on me. 

I can't afford to be nice. It wears me down. Which I guess is why so few people try. If everyone did it it would be easy but if even one person is an asshole it breaks down the whole structure. ",22Mar2017,3

29,"My anxiety got so bad this winter that I had to leave my retail job, take a break from school (going for social work to be a guidance counselor), and I was in the hospital for a few days. 

I'm getting better now with therapy, medication, and a lot of books, but I can't shake the feeling of being a loser. Every time I meet say a girl I like she asks ""what do you do"" and I don't really have an answer for that. Every person my age seems to be almost graduating from college, have some crazy good part time job, and I feel like I'm massively behind the curve, even though I'm actually kind of happy. I usually go for drives, read books, play video games, work on my car, meet my friend for coffee, and help around the house. I'm also trying to be more social by going to car meets and I'm vaping instead of having cigars which is a big step for me. Even still though, the fact that I don't have a job and I'm not back in college until September makes me feel like a loser. I was going to volunteer but even that seems near impossible with my current anxiety. ",22Mar2017,7

34,"Not sure if anyone can relate to this phenomenon, but it appears I have a problem where I get bored of everything, way more than the average person. Even things I enjoy get stale quickly. One thing I've always struggled with was consistency.

For example, a friend and I would play world of warcraft. I would play for 1-2 months, quit, rinse and repeat. I genuinely enjoy the game but I can't sustain enjoyment.

Another example is yoga. The other day I ran into my old yoga instructor. She stopped me in the supermarket and said to me: ""You were very good. I was very impressed. Youre extremely flexible for a guy. Why did you stop going?"" I attended for about 3 months and made up some BS excuse to her saying I was busy with work.

Truth was, I felt out of place there and was worried the ladies thought I was a creeper.

Often, I run into people that knew of my old hobbies like beat making, photography, working out and these people tell me: ""Why did you stop bro? What the hell man? You were good at that shit"". Again I make up some dumb excuse about why I got bored.

Even my job I get bored of from time to time. I've received a lot of discouragement throughout my life which makes me question my choices constantly, but at the end end of the day I seem to convince myself I made the right choice. Now I work as a system administrator. For me its weird. I came in this job with no experience, feel like I know nothing, taught myself lots of things on the job, yet I get bored between self studying. I like what I do, its just that I keep changing what I self study so much when I go back to it, its like starting on square one almost.

My entire life I've heard the following phrases:

""Well maybe ________ is not for you""

""No offense but you arent cut out for _________""

""Youre not meant to do _______ Maybe you should try/pursue/study something else"".

With everything. Over and over and over. Its depressing, soul crushing and annoying to hear. Sure what they're saying may be true but I would be lying if these dont make me question everything I start. This reinforces beliefs that I suck at everything.

Personally, I don't think the advice of switching hobbies, going back to school, trying something else is going to fix this because its going to be same story repeating itself. At some point you gotta stick to something.

Honestly it makes me go WTF? I've tried an endless list of things but it seems that nothing really sticks. For me technology is the thing that seems to stick the most and although I genuinely enjoy it, I have bouts of boredom. Then I come back and its fun again.

Normal people don't go through this crap. What the hell is my problem? Why am I like this? I dont get it.",22Mar2017,3

38,"Hello, i'm Cristian 18 years old, turning 19 on this month on 24th. And i'm living in agony , i've lost the joy of life and its happiness... Now , i shall begin with the story.... I've been raised by my grandparents ( less grandad he has the mind of a child, it's like a regression for him ) BUT grandmum she was my dad,mum,grandmum and best friend , she has raised me since i was born, but mostly when i turned 3 years old ( mum went to Italy, she didn't really raised me that much). All my universe was painted near her, she was the center of my world , my role model in life, an ideal for me... she was everything. She was one of the kindest person's from the world i'm not even kidding ( if she ever found a pocket, money, a mobile phone , everything that wouldn't belong to her she immediately gave them back , she has never said bad words, she would never put herself first , she would rather die starving but giving us ( me and my brother) everything what we needed) and unfortunately the thing that has destroyed me has happened 4 years ago when grandmum was diagnosed with cirrhosis ( she was also diabetic and other diseases but not that bad she took vitamin K for blood coagulation) When i heard i was literally destroyed every night i was crying and searching on google thousands of articles about cirrhosis , i couldn't believe grandmum would die in ~5 years according to google, i wasn't ready , i couldn't believe, she was too young! ~57-58 years when she was diagnosed with cirrhosis. Grandmum has always been a strong person , she would've never told us she is sick or she had any pain not to scary us , she suffered in silence everytime. Furthermore, when i was literally destroyed inside and outside last week Thursday to Friday when grandmum couldn't breathe anymore, i mean she could but very hard and she was coughing really bad everytime she was trying to talk and thus she had no more energy.. So i was scared, i phoned mum ( mum and uncles (grandmum's sons) that i was really scared and i don't know what to do as, so ,mum phoned a relative of us and told her to come immediately and see the situation.. as soon as that relative saw grandmum she immediately told her to come to the hospital, firstly i didn't want to come as i thought i was too scared to face the reality, but i had to so i went... I had to stay into a hospital with grandmum she was put a breathing mask into a dirty salon from the City hospital she stayed with another 10 people into a dirty salon just with a breathing mask waiting for the next day in the morning to be replaced at another hospital , i stayed all night with her, i was always giving her water since she was really thirsty and exhausted and her stomach was growing really bad ( that relative that was with us left around 1-2 AM so only me was who stayed with her) it was a nightmare to see grandmum in that situation, i called mum i was arguing with her a little bit, and with my uncles and aunt also, but mum was the only real person that could've understand me and see the real situation i knew grandmum is slowly dying under my eyes.. However, the next day she was transferred to Hospital number 3, i could remark that she's getting worse, and immediately her doc told us "" We can't do anything , as she had cancer stage 4 , metastasis at lungs from liver . I was ruined, mum came after 3-4 days (on the last day grandmum could talk and be conscious ) grandmum never told us she knows she's going to die , in order not to scare us . But her situation was progressively getting x5000 times worse per day, until after 5 or 6 days she couldn't talk anymore , her eyes were completely yellow and she wouldn't open them anymore.... On the last night of grandmum the uncles and aunt ( her sons) arrived from italy grandmum hasn't opened her eyes , but i think she hear them . Going on, on the next day she died, slowly and without any pain, docs said that her cancer affected her brain so she didn't feel anything. We were all destroyed, especially me since she was my everything... Now i miss her so much, she was so beautiful , i didn't call her grandmum , i was telling her mum ( mama) whenever i called her ... Her wish was seeing me to university in UK (as this is my last year of highschool in romania) unfortunately she didn't make it... But i'm just thinking about what was in her mind while she was at hospitals did she always know she's going to die? What did she feel? What was she thinking about during all that time about? It destroy me all these thoughts because she didn't deserve this! She should've been right now in her bed watching her tv shows and laughing with me about silly things.. Now what do i do without her? I'm literally crying because she passed away too early.. So sad because, 2 years ago died her first sister, last year her second sister and in just after 6 months after her second sister died it was the turn of grandmum...",22Mar2017,3

The first is a book about my personal experiences from being depressed to becoming and maintaining being happy, the other is a simple book comprised of other peoples perspectives, so that it might inspire some people or make them think a little differently.

So basically I'd like you to write for me about the subject, what you think happiness is and how to maintain it. It can be whatever you like, it can be a couple of lines or a whole essay.

Can anyone offer some guidance? I think I may need a a complete career change, or maybe a different type of engineering job. I'm willing to go back to school or take a pay cut. 

I value time and experiences way more than money (I live off of less than 15k per year). I want to focus on my hobbies and travelling, not on buying stuff. I have everything I need already. 

I'd love to have more flexible hours (part time work or seasonal work or unpaid time off or working from home). I'd love to start my own business, because I think that's the most probable way to make it work. I'm not exactly sure where to start, though. 
 
Other than starting my own business what are some other options? I love helping / interacting with people. I've thought about becoming a teacher, but jobs are scarce.
