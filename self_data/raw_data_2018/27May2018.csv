1,"I always, always wanted children. In my wildest dreams, I wanted minimum 6. Then I met the love of my life, and he doesn't like kids. So we talked and compromised and settled for two. But then I realized that this was a sacrifice for him and I didn't want him and our children to be unhappy about a lack of a genuine relationship between them and their father. So fuck it, we're not having kids. I will be a teacher anyway, so sort of a part\-time parent. Which is better than nothing. And anyway, the thought of being alone for hours every afternoon with the love of my life is comforting and exciting. Imagine all the Netflix and chill!!! Or rather, all the Netflix and fall asleep 20 minutes in because our jobs will be tiring.",27May2018,1

3,"My sleep pattern is way off because of travel recently. I'm up much later than usual, and wake up much later. I live near a big bridge where a people in my city go to jump if things get too bad. 

I couldn't sleep, and had gone for a walk round the bridge to get some air, it's pretty high up and it's really cool when everywhere else is pretty humid at the moment. I stopped to look at the city lights at one point, and a security guard left his little hut and came over to me. 

He thought I was going to jump, and told me to leave the bridge. 

I understand why, a guy alone late at night walking around a bridge looks pretty weird, and I do appreciate that at some point the guy has probably saved somebody. 

But I'm so embarrassed. I've been told to leave a public place because somebody thought I was going to kill myself. I had thoughts like that growing up, but not for years.

I can't sleep now, I feel really weird about it ",27May2018,7
4,"A recent divorce has sent my life into disarray. Though many things have happened since and because of the divorce, my mother has always remained unaffected in terms of her surface relationship with me. However, I can’t help but notice a certain difference in the way we interact. Lately, more and more arguments have been starting up. Not only are we constantly fighting, but it seems to me that there is one major change in her behavior. When dealing with everyday life, she is seemingly the same, but when anything becomes an emotional issue, or something that requires relying on any kind of emotion, her ability to handle it is scarce. From acting and talking like a toddler, to treating me as though she is one, her mental age is infant, at best. She is constantly hanging around me, being clingy, and acting like a child in situations that require her to deal with them as an adult would. I have been through every explanation in my head, and the best that I can come up  with is that this is her response to all that has happened. I do not mind her dealing with this in any way she can, and I understand her subconscious want to be younger, but it has become a rather large issue. I have come to the conclusion that she does not have the mental capacity to take care of me, on any level, and the only thing I have really been able to count on her for are rides when my car breaks down \(which it does a lot\). I know I am not the only one who sees it, either. She does have grown up friends of her own, and although she hardly ever sees them anymore, I will come with her when she hangs out with them from time to time, and I can tell that she acts just as childish with them. One of them has even approached me, worried and wondering if she is doing ok. That friend explained to me that it seemed like my mom was acting different, and very strange, and she had remarked the same things as I had been noticing. Because of all of the things that have happened, I’ve been forced to grow up rather quickly, especially considering I am only soon turning old enough to legally move out. When I do, I plan to move to LA, for many reasons, but one has become its distance from CO, where my mother currently lives. The main point is that, despite the age difference between us \(nearly 40 years\), she is less able to take care of herself than I am, and I constantly find that it feels like I am babysitting her. The only time when I have really noticed her acting like an adult is when it is convenient for her. Whenever being an adult will help her win an argument, or get me to do something, she is suddenly back to how she should normally be. It has become such a chore to be around her that I have resorted to counting the minutes, and pennies until I move out, and am several states away from her. I still love her, and want to have a good relationship with my mother, but I get excited every time she leaves the house, and feel angry, emotionless, and depressed when she gets home. I don’t know what to do, and I want to hear what all of you have to say about the situation. I would do anything to help get her back to her normal self, or, if necessary, simply to get away from her completely.",27May2018,2

7,"These people I knew last year wanted to compare themselves to me and compare me to them. I mostly ignored them. For over a year, I payed little attention to what they thought of me. Who were they to be the judge of me? Who was I to be the judge of me? Who was I to be the judge of them?

Now that I've finished reading what seem to be the most significant writings ever written, which are the great spiritual and wisdom texts in the western canon, I've started to look into the communities that are based on this tradition. They are familiar. They remind me of where I started, being raised up in a modern school system. The teachers were always trying to judge me. I was always annoyed at how people wanted to judge me. I thought, why couldn't I just be the judge of myself?

It all makes a lot more sense if you understand the traditions of our civilization. People show judgement to each other not because they are trying to control you, but because they are showing you what they understand to be the judgment of all people, universally.

I've been learning to like the idea of unity. While, through most of my life, I've been unusually paranoid, and have avoided all sorts of mutuality, I'm starting to get it. There is certainly a place for people to be isolated, but there is also a place for people to be together.

Strange things have been going on in our culture, distorting our picture of the world, turning everything inside out and upside down. I constantly see the message that people are different. But I'm starting to see that people have a lot more in common than I ever knew.",27May2018,3
8,"So in the past I'd always hook up with guys right away. I've honestly had a sizable number of hookups, and most of the time I was able to disengage emotionally. But.. I always ended up falling for a few of them. Every relationship I had started off with sex right away. I never got to know the guys first, and always got emotionally attached quickly. It's like I was addicted &amp; under their spell.

So after being heartbroken AGAIN, I decided to do things differently this time. I am tired of always falling for the liars and cheaters. I have a fairly high libido so I was just wanting to satisfy myself sexually; porn doesn't do it for me. Whenever I got off, it was always to a guy I hooked up with and ended up liking.. and who subsequently ended up breaking my heart. It's like sex was a drug to me, and I was blind to the guys' bad behaviors.

I'm 26 now. Sometimes I feel like I'll never fall for a good guy who treats me right, after all of the times I've been mistreated and cheated on. I'm done with sex, dating, all of it. I can't even masturbate anymore. I just want to fall in love with someone who is at least a decent person, for once.",27May2018,37
9,"I suffer from extreme social anxiety, among other things. It’s hard for me to hold down a job because I start feeling like I’ve made people dislike me even tho I think I’m polite, but I get anxious around strangers so things come off wrong. And it doesn’t help that I over analyze every little thing. Really, it makes it worse, because that’s where the thought that people don’t like me springs up. Even the smallest change in someone’s tone or a short response into something I say, etc. makes me think I did something to make them react like that. I guess I just want some advice on how to cope with social anxiety and how to get out of these constant anxious thoughts. ",27May2018,9
10,"I have always been sensitive to light, sound, smell. A short time in a loud and active environment, with a blaring TV and radio and odd smells is about enough to make my brain go numb. But just all that happened and I was kinda expected to sit there and be... sociable, I guess.

And then Mom, about three wine glasses into a bottle of port, invites me to watch Black Panther. While I'm trying to ignore how unfunny That 70s Show _still_ is, even when cranked to full volume. While I try and eat messy (but otherwise good) hot wings uncomfortably on a couch still holding moving boxes. While the radio in the kitchen still blares something that thinks repeating the word ""Jesus"" a thousand times helps it be more appealing.

11," Okay so maybe I'm being a little hyperbolic with the title but I felt I just HAD to get this stuff of my chest. During the last couple of months my life has changed dramatically, I just finished my second year of my physics major, I broke up with my long term gf, some events took place that made me see who my real friends were, realized that some family members are nut jobs and I'm left feeling as if I have nothing to contribute to society.  


Now I'm not suicidal or anything like that, I'm just having a little trouble finding motivation to continue my endeavors that is all. I'll try and describe the events that led me to my current position.

I just finished my second year at uni and with it my first real math courses, they don't rely on memorization or on repetition, they rely on a profound understanding of the theorems and proofs behind each topic. Even though I passed \(barely\) I don't feel fulfilled at all. The thing is, I really hate the academic lifestyle and what it is doing to me, I am not pursuing a career in scientific research but lately I have been getting involved in data science and machine learning, so much so that I have approached a teacher that is currently working with big data. I am good friends with him since I did good on his courses. He offered me a position to work on a project relating machine learning during the summer so for that I am pumped. Also, my uni has a program where you can do a masters on some universities over the world and treat it as an exchange year so that is my goal.

Now, besides physics and data science I also love writing and cooking. I have written a few short stories and a journal throughout the years that I don't confide to anyone but myself. I love cooking for myself and for my loved ones. Sometimes, a part of me wants me to fail on the other stuff so that I can work at a Domino's and make pizzas all day. This part of me is telling me that if I fail, then I have this back up plan that would also make me happy. 

I have realized that most of the people that I relate to, write really well, I may even say better than me and I know for a fact that most of them don't invest nearly as much time to writing as I do. Same with the cooking, I love the Italian Cuisine and so I made ravioli for my father's birthday. My brother helped me out and I have made this dish like 20 times, each time better than the last, so I was surprised to see that my brother was doing really well with the sheets of pasta. I am happy for his skills but I am no better than him.

I guess you can see the common thread here, even though my friends ask me for advice on their essays, most of them are really good without my help, they have a nice flow, extensive vocabulary and a structure that is really well thought out. I am glad that I have surrounded myself with competent people but I do feel kind of sad for myself. 

I am in no way an expert on philosophy, I like to read diluted novels who have a basis on some philosophical current but I lack the rigor that an actual philosopher has, I debated with my brother on selfishness, he likes Ayn Rand a lot and he bases his world view according to what she says. I don't know why but it seems like a really selfish world view, he says the most you can do to help a person is to let them help themselves out, I mentioned that some people don't have the same abilities to help themselves and that even himself, he relied on my parents to give him an education free of debt so that is kind of inconsistent.

I started reading on some of the criticisms against Rand and while I understood some of them I really didn't understand a lot of them. The existence, the essence of being, the identity of things and the metaphysics, it all sounds really complicated, I really tried to understand but I couldn't.

I read subreddits of philosophy, capitalism, socialism, physics, science, math and the users there seem extremely smart. It kind of makes me feel little. There are some extremely good points for capitalism and for socialism, I myself must confess on hating capitalism because of the focus on production instead of happiness. I would love to talk to some of you about it but I found my point of view ignorant and unresearched when I read some arguments for capitalism. I don't know what to believe anymore and I while I do research on the literature, I feel that the opinions I have on a given topic are misguided and misinformed. 

What should I do to?

I would like to thank everyone that read through this mess of a text. Thank you guys for your time and hope I didn't sound to whiney.

12,"Some background on myself: 28 years old about to turn 29 in July. I was a really shy kid growing up. Never had a girlfriend in school, high school or even college. Always had a great group of guy friends and still do. I grew up in Indiana. Around my freshman year of college I started trying to change myself. I started lifted weights, eating healthy and focusing hard on my grades. 

After school I got an internship in Washington, D.C. This led to a full time job and eventually a job in New York City. It was a sales job but it was with a fast growing startup. For the first time in my life I really felt good about myself. I had become more social and was still lifting weights. I even finally got a girlfriend. We dated for a year and a half. I got promoted at work and was actually managing a team of 15 people. My shyness was something no one I worked with knew about. I had worked hard to overcome it and everyone thought I was a naturally extroverted guy. 

The girlfriend, now ex, came from a dysfunctional family. There were a few red flags there that I ignored. But for a while we really got along great. She really did seem to care about me. Her Mom and her Dad hated each other and this really affected her views on relationships. Long story short she broke my heart. I went off the deep end and got fired from work and kept trying to reach out to her to get her to change her mind. After a year and a half she went from this girl who seemed to be obsessed with me and care about me so deeply to a girl that was now calling the police on me because in her words ""I wouldn't leave her alone"".

Got arrested. She hit me with a restraining order. I started drinking heavily. It's like my insecurities from childhood all came back in full force. I got another job in NYC and only lasted 6 months before I got fired for not hitting my numbers. My previous job I was at for 2 years and I thought I had a few close friends there but when I was fired everyone dropped me. I was all alone in that city after 2 and a half years of building up a life for myself. In a matter of a month or two it was all burned to the ground. 

On the other side of the coin, the professional/coporate world, I can't believe how quickly people can turn on you. I can't people how so many companies and businesses don't care about anything other than profits. I'm also amazed at how many unempathetic and unenlightened people there are in upper management. It's almost like they are robots. People in general for the most part seem to exist in their own little bubbles and don't seem to care much for anything or anyone else but themselves. 

I've got a good friend I grew up with in Indiana who now lives in LA. Last year I moved to LA too and now live right next door to him. We're trying to start a video production company out here. He's got a wife who's a strong minded feminist type. Her friends are the same way. They all drink a\-lot and the single women in her circle of friends seem to sleep around a\-lot and have intimacy issues. They are also all very immature. Their responses to things are bizarre. No communication skills whatsoever. It's like dealing with little kids. I find a\-lot of women my age to be like this. 

The point I'm trying to make is that I feel very disillusioned with people and life in general. While I'm not shy anymore, I feel like I've been to the top of the mountain and discovered nothing was there. I am finding it hard to motivate myself to keep trying and not just move back to Indiana and spend time with my parents. I'd like to meet a woman out here I can date but they all seem so shallow and immature. Again, a\-lot of them sleep around and don't seem to be able to communicate maturely. They are basically just out sewing their oats. I mean I can understand that, too but I don't see how they don't want something deeper or longer lasting. Even when I was in New York after my breakup I slept with a few different women who immediately ghosted me after words. It's like why have sex with me and not try to continue the relationship? One of these women, during sex, shouted out ""You can fuck!"". I know I'm good in bed but it doesn't seem to matter to women. 

Same thing at work. I'm disillusioned by how many insecure shallow people there are. I feel alone and empty and like there is no hope \- \- but I'm not sad. Can anyone related to this feeling? It's like an empitness that is numb. Don't know how else to describe it. If anyone can relate, how do you get past this?

Thanks, 

Lonely in Los Angeles. ",27May2018,3

17,"I had a group of friends I hung out with in 8th grade, and I liked to believe that I was the intelligent one in the group. When the year ended and we were going into our freshman year, they enrolled in a really good STEM program in a more funded school than the other schools in the county. I, on the other hand, went to another less-funded school and a different path from the usual STEM route other kids my age go into (am a high school sophomore). 

I don’t know much about STEM education but I hold them to a high standard where I feel like they are the second most advanced education an individual receives (right under medical field). I am not planning to go into either because it’s not what I want to do, but I feel like I am not doing anything significant by not doing either. My knowledge of college and high school are very limited but I guess what I am asking is: how do cope with feeling I’m not good enough for not going in Stem or medical studies?

27,"TL;DR at the bottom.

So right now it is 7:13 a.m. &amp; this just happened. I have a really bad habit of staying up all night so that I can get breakfast in the morning, &amp; today was no different. At around 5:30, I heard my mom yelling in her room so I got up &amp; went in there to hear my brother laughing because my mom was freaking out cause our puppy had ripped up some linoleum floor. Not really the point, but I asked him if he wanted to go with me to get breakfast &amp; he said sure.

So we leave &amp; go get some McDonalds, but neither of us felt like going home yet so I decided to drive us around the park; it's a pretty park, &amp; not a big town so no one was there yet. After making a loop, I turned around to drive out &amp; right as I was about to pull out, a squirrel ran in front of me. Now I'm not a sadistic person, and I don't believe in harming animals unless you're going to eat the meat, but occasionally \(especially to make my brother laugh\) I'll speed up &amp; pretend that I'm going to run over a squirrel or a possum.

I always stop before I even get close, but today\- this squirrel turned &amp; ran right for my my front left tire. I drive a big lifted red jeep with big tires, &amp; the road was small so I couldn't swerve, but I tried to turn as much as I could. I didn't think I'd hit it, but I looked in my rear view mirror &amp; saw the squirrel run off towards the tree a little strangely. My stomach dropped &amp; my little brother said ""@audtyn, did you hit that squirrel??"" &amp; I said ""I don't think so Bub, but I'm gonna check.""

So I backed up &amp; we both got out, but neither of us could find it which I initially took as a good sign since the squirrel had run towards the only tree on the right side of the road, I just figured it had run up it. Just to check, I walked towards the right side of the tree a little just to make sure it wasn't hiding or something, &amp; my heart dropped when I saw it just hanging onto the tree. I had turned just enough that I didn't run straight over it, I'd run over its' back, and broken it above it's back two legs.

I took a couple steps back &amp; said ""Oh no. Oh no no."" &amp; my little brother said, ""What @audtyn? What's wrong?"" &amp; I told him I thought I had broken the squirrel's back, &amp; he said, I bet you didn't, there's no blood, but I'll check. He walks over to the tree and the squirrel just shuffles over a little bit, not using it's bottom legs. He walks back over to me and his face is really somber &amp; he says, ""You did run over it. We have to kill it now, put it out of it's misery.""

I agreed because although I'm an avid hunter, I'd never let an animal just hurt because of me or someone else, so I agree &amp; we start to look for a rock. After about 3 minutes of looking, neither of us can find one &amp; I tell him that I have a bat in my Jeep, &amp; he just shakes his head &amp; tells me that I can't just hit it, so I call my best friend, keep in mind that by now it's about 6:30 in the morning. I call &amp; his girlfriend answers, &amp; keeps telling me that it's fine &amp; that my best friend is asleep &amp; after listening to me cry \(I never ever cry about anything\) he wakes up &amp; gets on the phone &amp; tells me that it's fine &amp; that the squirrel doesn't feel pain &amp; just to leave it.

I turn around &amp; see the squirrel just laying on the ground next to the tree while I'm talking to him, &amp; it tries to hop forward, but can only use its' front two legs &amp; I start sobbing harder. I'd gotten my bat out earlier trying to steel my will, but hadn't worked up the courage to actually hit it, it just felt inhumane. After me arguing &amp; cussing to my best friend for a little while, my little brother comes over &amp; takes the bat out of my hands &amp; walks over to the squirrel. I'm too stunned to speak, but when he turns around to look at me, I see that he's crying too. My 12 year old little brother was going to kill this squirrel with a bat so that I, his 18 year old sister, wouldn't have to.

I hang up on my friend, &amp; yell at him that it's okay &amp; that I'll do it &amp; he walks over to me without saying a word, &amp; hands me the bat &amp; walks over to the park bench facing away so he won't have to see. I get in my Jeep, because by now, the squirrel has crawled far enough away that I could just run over it, &amp; after about 5 tries I get it. I got out &amp; grabbed a stick &amp; threw it into the pond, then get back into my Jeep &amp; pick up my brother &amp; we drive home silently.

After we got home, before we got out, he said, ""Don't tell mom."" &amp; I agreed, &amp; we both walked inside &amp; set our uneaten food on the table &amp; went to our rooms. My 5'10, 180lb, 12 year old brother couldn't bring himself to kill a squirrel, but was going to so that I wouldn't have to. I have the best little brother anyone could ever ask for, &amp; I am incredibly thankful for him. Thanks for reading.

So around 5 years ago, I [21M] met someone on the internet. After years of messages and FaceTime calls, I finally got to meet her in person a couple of weeks ago. We've been speaking a lot and I really loved it in the US. Really makes a nice change from the UK. I'm ready to pack up and move there to start a new life. The UK has nothing for me. I live in a fire pit of a town and I want out.

I've been looking a lot about all the different processes I need to go though. I know that it's not as simple as packing my stuff and leaving. There's a lengthy process of filling out an immigrant petition and a Green Card application, along with many, many other things. There's some really useful stuff online about the process but it's not telling me what I want to know. I also know that there's a lot of fees involved. Money isn't an issue, however, I can save up. I want to do this the smart way, not the quick way. I also currently work in IT as a support desk engineer, but I'm working my way up to a systems engineer and network engineer (Microsoft certified). I've been there for 4 years and I'm really good at what I do. Reading online, they ask about employment and what kind of skills and qualities I bring to the table. I don't have any family who live outside of the UK, so a family sponsorship isn't an option.

Ultimately, I want to know, are there any people close to my age (or not) that have successfully moved to the United States from another country and if so, what exactly did it entail?

Thank you.

38,"Hey i just feel like i need to vent out here. If this is not the right sub pls let me know and i'll put it somewhere more appropriate. Just found this sub.

So a little background. I [23M] just got into a new job a month ago, which required me to go back to my hometown from across the country. So the stresses of the job + some family issues which i have been able to put at the back of my mind is coming back to bite me in the ass. So i got that to worry about.

Plus i cant seem to get over my crush. Also a good friend of mine. And i think she realizes and is distancing herself from me. Or she just got busy with her life. Anyways. Point is, we barely talked this past month (used to talk at least once every couple of days) and its taking a toll on me. I thought it would be easier to move on this way but apparently not.

Maybe as an escape mechanism, i then try to take care of my other friends here. Listen to their problems, help them work through. I am the type of guy who likes to be updated on my close friends' lives to an extent. But now i feel like i dont have anyone to share my own problems with.

Plus, i used to casually date a girl back then. It didnt work out, and we became good friends (yes, it happens. Long story) but it recently surfaced that the reason she didnt want to be with me is that she sees me as undependable. As in, mentally. Which makes it harder for me to share anything irl.

To add, i am a naturally closed person. Usually takes a lot to get me to share my own life.

Well thats longer than i anticipated. I dont know what i want, but it's nice to vent out.

Have a nice day, reddit. Thanks for reading this far.",27May2018,3
39,I have another account which I created 5 years ago and signed up without an email address. It was recently suspended due to 'suspicious activity' and I was made to reset my password.

40,"I’m trying. I’m trying really hard to be normal. To be okay. Because I’ve realised it’s not okay, to not be okay. It’s frowned upon. 
I feel like I’m drowning in an endless pit of darkness. It’s like my lungs are filling with black. My mind fills with pain. My heart fills with hate. My soul fills with death. 

The thing about death is that it is inevitable, it cannot be stopped nor prevented it can just be either postponed or fast tracked. Which is the depressing thing. 
Nobody can save anybody. 
Not even yourself. 
That’s the thing about death. It is not something that can be stopped. People can make your mental state deteriorate with words. Something as simple as words. The vain of our lives. The things we use to communicate, to learn, to entertain, can kill. Can hurt. It’s ridiculous. Because words can fast track death. Trust me I’d know. They almost push you over the edge. 

But what you can do to postpone someone’s death is make their life worthwhile and meaningful but I guess nobody did that for me. All my life, family and so called “friends” have made me feel so worthless and meaningless. Sly comments can cost you someone’s life. I can’t stress this enough, words AREN'T just words. Wounds from sticks and stones can heal, but words, - well they cause a whole new wound. A mental wound, a state of mind that makes you want to die, want to be gone. Makes you want to say goodbye to everything. Makes you just see darkness. That’s what words do. ...They mess you up. 

Drowning is a long and painful feeling. Waiting for death and it doesn’t seem to come. Wishing for death. It’s like someone has tied boulders to your feet and the more you struggle to get to the top - the more you fall Into the black abyss. So you just wait there for death. Wishing that you could just die because whenever you try you fall further. 

You see, I’m not scared of the dark, I’m scared of the darkness In my mind. Because to be scared of your mind is painful. It hurts. It’s like fighting a losing battle against yourself. And your hourglass is slowly running out, because you can’t help yourself so you’re waiting for the grains of sand to slowly drip from the top just so you might be able to feel the inevitable peace at the end. That’s pain. That’s real pain. 

Lives are meaningless, but if you can make someone’s meaningful I encourage you to do so because it sucks when people don’t care. It really does. 

Suicide is the end. Suicide is permanent. Suicide is forever. I hope that I won’t give in but it’s hard. I can’t cope. This was my heart on a page. I hope you appreciate it. ",27May2018,4

42,"Hey Reddit ! I need your help figuring out how to deal with a toxic situation. 
I work in health care and one of my female coworkers that had the same job position for 20 years doesn’t stop bullying another female coworker. I couldn’t deal with the situation anymore so I reported her disgraceful behavior to her supervisor. He informed me that he talked to her before and I’m not the first person to report her toxic behavior and he promised me he will have another talk with her. The bullying stoped for couple of weeks and I felt so good about it. But it’s happening again. And this time she is even trying to target me ( I’m going to be her supervisor in few months, so she knows not to go so far ) but I know she talks behind my back and she will makes remarks on any small detail when my boss is around. So, How do you stop a bully in a workplace ? How to confront the bully without making a huge scene? ",27May2018,1

45,"I have a student who has dyslexia. He came in to have the extra time for the exam but was only allowed to finish off selected questions. After I marked his work he snuck into the class and gave himself extra marks on questions he wasn't allowed to finish off. He is a very nice, kind boy so i was surprised.

He then later sent this apology email which Is quite sad.

His apology:
""I'm sorry for betraying your trust. You have always been good to me and treated me well, you were there for me when I have a problem yet I have betrayed you. You were the closest father figure I could look up to and trust.
Sorry is not ok because I am such a screw up but  Sorry that I am so difficult. Instead of opening up about my problems i disgracefully went back and added marks to the questions I wasn't allowed to write on.

I was so insecure about my true ability that I made the wrong decision and acted irrationaly, I am so sorry. This is the worst moment to tell you about my problems but I guess I have no choice now.
I have a horrible relationship with my dad. This is one example: A Few days before my stats exam I didn't get a haircut as I wanted to study so my dad beat me up badly and choked me. My nose was bleeding alot and i had bruises on my face and neck . I used ice for hours just so bruises fade away.( Swear to god i am not making this up). I couldn't think straight so i lost alot of study time.  But  seriously don't worry about that, I analysed this issue and know that the best solution is to just deal with it until I escape to university. It hurts...but it's ok im used to it. I always pretended to others everything in my life is fine since I did it my whole life. I Should have spoke up about it and asked to retake the test with a different paper but i was so scared of what could happen.

My anxiety of  my university predicted grades, insecurity of not doing well and not leave home made me act disgracefully. My personal problems are NOT an excuse to behave this way. I am so sorry for everything. I know Sorry is not ok because I am such a screw up but I'm extremely sorry and I would do anything to make up for the loss in trust and for you to forgive me.
I beg for your forgiveness. Please give me another chance to show I truly am a good person. I'm sorry and will never dare to even lie to anyone again. I am sorry for being a disgrace and letting my bottled up emotions take the best of me. I'm sorry it has come to this. I didn't mean to ruin everything. I am so sorry i let you down 
I am a Total mental wreck. I Can't sleep. My life will be 10 times worse and i won't be able to cope anymore. I'm so sorry... Goodbye :(""

49,"I was on an livestream with my friend and we were just having fun and for most of the stream we were just talking with our friends who were watching. We did demonstrate some makeup too but spent most of the time talking with our friends. 

My friend who I was livestreaming with suggested that we pose and show off the makeup that we’ve done so we did. And on this one pose I subtly pulled down on my top from below the view of the camera to reveal a little bit of cleavage. I didn’t notice how far I had pulled it down until the top went past my boobs and accidental revealed everything as I was wearing nothing underneath. And for a couple of seconds the stream was still on so trust me, people got a good look. 

I noticed almost instantly as it happened but still have people brought time to get a good look and it took us a couple of seconds before my friend realized and we stopped it. Luckily it was just our friends watching the video. Who knows how many guys and/or girls have this. Either way, I don’t know if anyone has screenshotted it or taken a recording of it but luckily, whether I knew them well or if I just knew who they were but not well, at least it’s people I know and that’s probably the only good that’s happened in this scenario. The thing is, there is one disadvantage of having this happen in front of friend, if it’s strangers, although they could share your pictures, they don’t know you and as long as the pictures don’t spread, it’s fine, but friends will remember, I hope this doesn’t turn into something that people will taunt me about forever because as I said before they got a good look and behind friends they probably screenshotted it so they have proof that this happened. 

Is there any way you would go about telling people it was a mistake and do you think people would forget about this? I’m pretty sure multiple people would’ve taken a pic, many guys for sure and who what they’re gonna do with the pictures. 

TL;DR accidentally pulled down my top during a video and am glad it was just my friends who witnessed it but still pretty embarrassing. ",27May2018,1
50,"Hey. I've always been having difficulties coming to terms with my body. I would look in the mirror and see someone who I am not satisfied with. I am not fat but my proportions make me feel like I am (i.e fat upper arms, ""man"" hands, some abdominal fat - the rest of my body is pretty skinny). The complex I've been having with myself ruined my lifestyle, giving me no chance of properly enjoying myself with others without having to think of how others think of me or how I look like and ruining my social life as a result. Some 6-7 months ago I tried to change that. I started dieting. I downloaded this app called myfitnesspal and recorded my daily caloric intake, restricting myself to about 800-1000 calories per day. A couple months later I have lost 16 pounds, officially becoming underweight. My period has stopped and hasn't come back since. My doctor warned me of potential eating disorders if I continue following the same path, so I began eating more and returned to a healthy weight by gaining back 10 pounds. But a couple months and a gynecologist appointment later I am told that the reason my period has been discontinuing since my first diet fiasco was that I still have a caloric deficiency (and a thyroid problem which I had since I was 7, but I've been taking adequate supplements to counteract that). Problem is I would have changed my eating behavior if only the way I felt about my body changed as well. Calorie counting has not only become an addiction but the relationship I've been having with my body hasn't changed in any way.

Also if this will clarify any better I am a female currently weighing 111 pounds and 5'3 (19.7 BMI) - currently maintaining the weight.

TL;DR: My period has stopped ever since I've started dieting 6-7 months ago, but I hate my body and am addicted to counting my calories. I am NOT anorexic, but afraid that I have an eating/body image disorder and I'm harming my overall health and body image. What do I do?",27May2018,2
51,"Among the things I went to her about was some confusing things that were going on in a platonic friendship I have with a woman. That's kind of worked itself out, but, we were talking the other day and I compared this friendship to other friendships in my life.

I'm happily married for 20 years, my wife is my best friend and in fact we were friends before it turned romantic.

But, my other friendships are divided at least equally among men and women. One of my best friends is a woman I've known since I was 15. We've been great friends, traveled to visit and stay at each other's place, and we talk all the time. There has never been the slightest 'spark', in either direction AFAIK, between us. We're just friends, and in fact, I loved her parents and her mom and I were really good friends until she passed away, so, this friend really feels like a sister to me.

Another friend is a woman I met at a place where we were both engineers. I've known her for over 30 years, and again, not a spark, but, just really close friends. I traveled across country to help her out with some stuff related to a house she's rehabilitating.

There are more, quite a few more.

My wife trusts me implicitly, and has no problem with my having some women friends. Since she and I both are home all day, it's not a big deal if I want to go to a bar without her. The other night, I took her to a new place I've been going to for a while, I introduced her to several people I met there including 4 women that I've chatted with, and they were all ""Oh, we've heard all about you"" to my dear wife.

This therapist thinks that my forming these friendships with women that I have only platonic interest in is really unusual, and in fact, it's taken a long time for me to convince her that my interests are really just platonic.

The therapist also thinks my wife is really unusual that she doesn't mind this situation.

I'm really curious how weird we are, and if others have similar experiences.",27May2018,10

I made it very clear to her that she wasn't just another attractive looking female who I'm only trying to get it in with. I wasn't JUST attracted to her. She meant a lot to me and I always told her that she would never truly understand how much she actually meant to me. You see I had been into something very similar about 2 years before which is why it cuts even more.  Because us talking  made me realize that after my first loss  it wasn't the end and I had been purposely avoiding anything serious with her for so long due to the fear of being hurt again.

56,"I originally posted this to /r/youshouldknow but they deleted it for mentioning fb.  Anyway, here's some info if this happens to you.

\-\-\-

Beyond the obvious \(looking/posters\) there are two things I wasn’t aware of that ultimately led to my grandma’s dog being found within about 30 hours.

THING ONE

First, look for neighborhood groups on fb. I was stunned that they are filled with people who will literally go out and look for your dog, make posters, and cross post to other groups. I thought craigslist was the answer but it’s dead. People want to share on social.

What you want to do is search the groups for every combination of the following:

Your neighborhood Your city Your county Your geographic area Your dog’s breed

AND

Lost Dogs Lost pets Lost and found dogs Lost and found pets

Etc.

So for example up here “lost dogs of king county” is different than “redmond lost and found pets”. I ended up being in 4 groups and my post being shared to about 12 total.

Try to make one post in a public group and share it from there. Otherwise when you want to update it, you have to go a million places. Some groups are private so you’ll have to manage seperately.

Your post should contain: Obvious dog stats Picture Cross streets and address where lost. \- I first gave a general area but it turns out people want to go to a specific area and look. So give info in a way that can be put into a gps. If you don’t want to give your home address use a local business Phone number to call/text. \- People want to get in touch immediately. I didn’t get any spam or anything so these groups are pretty well regulated. Date and time missing \- people can’t look at the post time itself for whatever reason. Collar/microchip \- people are going to ask.

Keep your post updated and update when your dog is found.

THING TWO Someone will comment right away with like 10 places you should call. You can suss out pretty quickly what the “real” place is. In our area at least, you have to be licensed \(and staffed\) to take in strays, so there’s one big network of shelters and you can file a single report. Anyone taking your dog to a private shelter or vet is going to get funneled to these people so just go there first. Ours you can just file online.

How it turned out for us: there was a sighting posted but it was frustrating to deal with. A few people texted me for details and went looking. Finally someone commented on one fb post that they saw her and left food/water for her and gave an address. We went there and there she was.",27May2018,1
58,"Hi. So. I'm a 27, soon to be 28, year old guy. I'm what a friend of mine calls an ""Extroverted Introvert."" 

So. A bit of context. Growing up I was always the dorky bullied kid. I don't know if this matters, maybe it just influences how you think of me. In High School I was incredibly awkward. I really flowered as a person in University. I made a lot of new friends and it was generally just a great time.

My adult life has been interesting. I got a degree in Library Science. I had a bit of a tough time getting my ""First Job"" but after a few contracts, things took off. My life is really stable now. I have a permanent (Part time, but it pays the bills) job. I know I'll be able to advance into better positions as my career goes on. 

I'm ultimately very happy where I am in most things. My apartment is lovely. I have the splendid book shelf I've wanted all my life. I have my ""Space"" which is all my own and I can decompress in (That's the core of being an Extroverted Introvert, I think. You can socialize well, but having your own ""Space"" is wildly important to you) I'm very satisfied.

Only I'm quite lonely. For the longest time I thought this meant romance and the desire to establish a family, but between two or three romantic partners and a cat I got I've realized, no. Everybody I invite into my ""Space"" just ends up feeling like an intruder. (The way one of my friends put it to me is that I would know true love when I met someone who didn't feel like an ""Intruder"" in my Space)

I just want friends.

Some of the best times in my life were honestly when I was unemployed between contracts. My family, while not wildly wealthy, is comfortable and I am on good terms with them, so I had a home to go to when I wasn't working a contract.

Most of my friends were still in my home town (Toronto. So it's the big one for the region.) one for school, another for work.

It just was so amazing. I had my ""Space"" even if I had to share it with my family. I had no responsibilities. I could sleep in every day and chill in my own way (My parents were very good with adult children. Not very pushy.) when I wasn't with my friends, and I always new when my friends were available and where to look for them.

In this new city, I feel so isolated. My job puts me in contact with people, and honestly, that is what saves me. If I were just working some isolated desk job where I never interact with another human being, I'd almost be breaking at this point.

I've gone out trying to look for friends. I'm actively attending a local church and I've gotten involved in a few things there. I've gone to some local cultural events, but they're so.... Big. It's too hard to make a ""Friend"" when I'm just one among countless people. I've hit up local bars and I've had some nice little conversations, but it's never really making friends. 

I just feel isolated. I like being able to go back to my ""Space"" whenever I want to, but there is also a part of me that very deeply wants to express myself. To quote a friend of mine, if I get close enough to someone I sort of just start ""unleashing the rainbow of myself"". It takes very little to get me telling you my life story. He's said a few times ""I would love to just be a fly in the back of your head and just see what thinking is like for you."" (It's a compliment, I assure you :P)

I sort of have a strong desire to do that. That's why my colleagues and my patrons and other barflies (Uhm. I'm not depressingly drinking in dives or anything. They're nice places) don't satisfy. I've never really gotten close enough that I can tell you everything I'm thinking.

I've never really reached a level where I have a friend I can just ""Drop in on"" the way I could with my childhood friends back in Toronto.

I'm terrified about getting older. There's a part of me that thinks - Is this my life now? Am I always going to be scraping by on the bare minimal requirement of social needs through work and going back to an apartment where I sit alone with my cat, and every once and a while I go to a community event and chat but don't really make friends?

I don't think I'm ever going to get married and have a family. All my friends assure me I'm wrong (And that I have way too low of an opinion of myself in this sense) but I'm not wildly attractive and I'm romantically awkward (Though perhaps this is just because I've never met that magical person who doesn't feel like an intruder in my space. Well. I did in University. But I fucked that up really bad. I'm not getting into that. And I guess maybe I feel like that lightning isn't going to strike twice.) and again, a part of me wonders - Do I really want that? Or will everyone else I bring into my private space just take away from my ability to decompress?

I mean, here's how I view it. Romantically, to have a healthy marriage, lightning needs to strike twice. I can't ""Settle."" I need to find someone I want in my space. Someone who adds to it, rather than taking away from it.

And I can't view kids as a solution to my loneliness problem. That's a terrible reason to have kids.

I'm not suicidal or anything. I've just struggled to make friends and I desperately want to be at a place again where I can drop by a friends place and go ""Hey! What's up?"" and have someone to hang out with.

And I'm terrified of getting older. Time just flies by the older and older I get. My childhood and teen years seemed like they lasted forever. My early twenties (25-) went by quickly, but they were so beautiful. Each contract seemed like a flash in the pan, and those periods between were beautiful.

Now I've been working for about a year and looking back at it I think to myself ""Good heavens, has it already been a year?""

I'm terrified that I'm going to wake up some day, be 40 years old, be generally satisfied with the material state of my life, my cat will have passed away and I'll be thinking of maybe getting a dog or something (Or maybe I'll have gotten one by then as my finances become a bit less ""Just stable"" and a bit more ""Spending money"" to throw around) and I'll still feel lonely. My work will still provide for basic needs, but I'll still just go home and spend my time off alone in a room.

I don't know. I hope none of this was stupid.

I'm just so scared.

I'm scared that I'll never have a family to render this a Non-Issue (And if anything swing it the opposite way, where I miss my bachelor days) 

I'm scared that I'll wake up and find myself 40, 50, my parents will die, my brother and I have never been close enough to fill the void they'll leave. My friends and I from childhood will just go our own ways, and I'll be so alone.

Sorry if this is stupid. I just like being able to vent some times.",27May2018,1
59,"This is the problem with discussing things with assholes. A list:

- Say something positive and they accuse you of being a ""nice guy"" as if they know. Fuck that shit! I'm a cunt! You wanna go? Fine! Come at me bro! I'll bro down, bro!

- Say something and it will be twisted. Literally anything. Like this. You're twisted lol. Like, duh. Have you seen the places I post? I'm not trying to hide anything.

- If they disagree you will be vilified and witch hunted. Who are they? I believe we covered this but let me be clear, could be anyone. Just some buttmunch with an opinion usually

- Show any sign of affluence, perhaps using large wordy book words, and they will accuse you of being out of touch. I'm so in touch. I touch you all over. MMMMMM yeah, touch me now. You know where!

- Make a joke that they don't get or agree with and you're BANNED FROM THE SUBREDDIT FOR INFINITY AND BEYOND. You triggered me! You're an asshole! Sure, but do you know what those words mean?

- Some people just want to fight over anything and everything. They're intelligent, well-spoken and deeply wounded about being unfulfilled or unappreciated. I feel for you, I do. But can't people have nice things? Is that so much to ask for?

- Lot of crazies too. Sometimes I wonder if I ever left the sun room in the mental hospital.(I didn't lol. Don't tell them I snuck a phone in!)

I guess what I'm trying to say is that this is not civil, dignified or intelligent. I'm being incredibly self-deprecating to make a point. Good discussions are derailed by fools. I'd like to have one discussion about something besides how fucked up my personal life is on this site. Can I have that or am I just proving how foolish I am? I suspect foolish. Perhaps, worse.

60,"I get offended, I tell people I’m offended, they’re like “Whatever” and that gets me more offended. And then I feel like crap for the person who gets easily offended, and that makes me more mad and then I like start arguing in my head. And then like I can’t relax because I’m just the person who can’t take it easy, and shit this is stressing me out. 

I’ve been trying to like redirect my thoughts and just go on to another topic, and I’m getting better at catching the cycle earlier but I still get offended and it still makes me feel like crap about me. What the hell do I do. ",27May2018,4
61,"I (36f) used to live for going out all the time &amp; getting drunk &amp; partying. A lot of my friends had children when I was in my early 30s and I was really pissed off because I lost my drinking buddies. However, I still had some &amp; found new ones so it was all good, but suddenly in the last few months I have been going out &amp; drinking &amp; just not really enjoying it, and wondering what the point is in doing it, especially when my hangovers are so bad now.  It’s really weird, I can’t even remember why I used to like it so much now. Is this just something that happens as you get older? I’ve seen quite a few other people stop drinking at my age but it’s usually because they have kids or get married. I’m single and don’t want kids, I suppose I’m just bored of booze but it feels really strange!",27May2018,193
62,"I dislike most people and want nothing to do with them.

That's why I do not have ANY friends, acquaintances, colleagues or anything like that.

For that reason I do not have a cellphone, smartphone, tablet or any form of social media except this reddit forum.

I like video games but hate to play multiplayer because I find humans to be boring, bland, generic, annoyingly obnoxious, simple minded and toxic.

They can waste their fortunes on idiotic, superficial skins that are completely useless and support the most generic, unimaginative games there are.

I consider myself a misanthrope. I hate people for everything they do.

First and foremost their herd mentality.

They form cute little groups and try to differentiate themselves, no, not themselves, they try to differentiate their group from other groups in order to have an enemy they can hate gossip at.

A scapegoat that is at fault for everything bad happening.

They do not have an identity or personality, and if they do, it has the depth of their belly button.

They follow every stupid trend.

They watch retarded reality and casting shows on TV, read stupid books and comics, watch retarded Anime and idiotic movies.

The most popular stuff is shallow, low quality, nonsensical, unrealistic, dim witted, dull and dumbing\-down load of bullcrap.

I wear cheap clothes with no brands. Not even some stylish art or patterns or numbers on it. Just one color and that's it.

I hate vibrant and colorful clothes. I hate fashion and accessories like sunglasses and caps, scarves and jewelry like chains and rings or a watch. If you think they make you individual, then that says a lot about your superficial personality.

I do not care how others perceive me, what they think of me. I do not care if the like me, if they talk to me or insult me.

If they do criticize or insult me, which do happens at work, I have to really try not to burst out laughing because it's just so funny to me that this person thinks I care about what he or she says to me.

I am a virgin and have no desire to have sex. I have no desire to have a girlfriend and a romantic relationship.

I am still attracted to female bodies and masturbate to get rid of this stupid urge.

If there was a treatment other than cutting everything off, I would gladly accept it.

I view sexual urges as primitive. The sex drive is the manifestation of the reproductive imperative.

I see it as natures genetic coding overwriting my intelligence. It reverts us back to primitive apes with no self control.

Free will is an illusion anyway because everything is controlled by instincts, genetics and hormones.

I guess I feel superior to others for breaking through some of these behaviors and come closer to real free will.

I can't fully control my brain either but it's better than these sheep blindly following the herd and rationalizing it with the same old phrase:

""Humans are social animals, we live in tribes and groups and want to feel liked and accepted...we need validation."" 

If that's what humans are, per definition, then I am not a human.

And honestly, I don't even want to be human.

They are scared little apes with no grasp about anything. Blindly following the masses so they don't have to think for themselves.

Why do they need to validate their existence through social acceptance and success? 

Why do they think academical degrees determine whether they are smart or not? 

Memorizing stuff greater people discovered is not intelligence.

Why do they care about others having more money, being prettier, being taller, being stronger or faster?

Why do they care about others being more successful, having better jobs, more friends, more sex or whatever?

They are imprisoned by greed and jealousy. Humans are ignorant little hypocrites that only seek their own benefit.

Humans don't care about others opinions if they differ from theirs. Humans are not empathetic.

If some people die in a mass shooting close to you, you can pretend to be empathetic. What you really are doing, is putting yourself in their shoes and start being worried that it might happen to you since it's so close.

Humans don't care about others misfortune, they are scared it might happen to them.

If some bimbos in Africa get slaughtered by the hundreds, no one cares. Because it's hard to imagine yourself in bimbo shoes.

Altruism does not exist. If a person gives a homeless money, he or she does so in order to feel better about themselves.

To feel superior over the homeless or other people who have not donated. 

Be it moral, financial or physical superiority.

The human ape wants to dominate and spread his genes. The reason: I do not know.

It's all an urge, an instinct, genetic coding one should try to escape to become something more than a simple minded animal.

So, with all that said. I realize that I am in a ridiculously tiny minority and that I am abnormal.

63,"When I say she pushed me, I mean it almost literally. She physically walked with me and made sure I signed up for classes I didn't think I was capable of taking. She planned my entire degree for me when it wasn't even her job. She encouraged me to finally break out of my shell and pursue my passion, international travel.

I came back from my study abroad trip a new person. I changed my major. I knew what I wanted out of life, and it was because of her. Because she gave me the courage to travel, I found my husband and moved to another country. I'm happy, and she was the catalyst for it all. 

However, I never felt like I had enough personal success in my career in the field she taught. I was happy in my personal life, but not with my professional one. I felt too much shame to ever come back to the university, to ever e-mail her again. 

I haven't talked to her in nearly four years and just found out she passed. I've been crying all weekend, heartbroken because I can never tell her how much she changed my life. Of all the dozens of teachers I've been through in my life, she was the only one who truly pushed me and made me take the scary plunges that would make my life better.

She was the only one who truly believed in me. She pushed my education. She tried her best to help me find jobs even when I didn't follow through because I never felt good enough. She probably wanted to talk to me, but I was always afraid to contact her because I never felt like I would have made her proud.

And now I can never tell her how much she changed my life. I can never tell her because of how much she pushed me, I found the perfect husband and the perfect home. 

I keep looking at her website in tears, trying to remember the better moments but also knowing in a few months that will be gone, too.

64,"I'm a 23 year old guy with horrible dating experiences, never have been in a relationship, never been past making out with a girl, and haven't been able to get a date in over a year and a half. The last girl I dated messed me up so much and has been in a relationship with a guy I trusted and thought was my friend. They both lied to me and I'm the dumbass who trusted them and now they have been living great lives. I've blocked them out of my life and I wont have to see them for a few months, they will be working in the same building as me though. I have been lead on, used for attention, and made the back up guy by most of the girls I have gone on dates with, and I haven't even dated that many girls. Some girls I have asked out in the past year and a half have agreed to a date and given me their number but then never responded to my initial text so I left them alone so I wouldn't be a creep.

I just graduated from college, I work part time, I have a job lined up to start in a few months, I am working on getting some extra education for my field as well. I have friends, they like hanging out with me, I go to the gym and working on gaining weight/muscle. I get compliments from strangers, some random guy on the street said I could get any girl just by smiling at them, older women customers at my work have stated I am attractive/handsome, I get compliments on my smile a lot, on my style as well. 

The closest I ever felt to really having a chance was with a girl I became friends with 2 years ago in my class. I asked her out, she rejected me in a nice way and we stayed friends but later on she told me it was because she had a boyfriend but she really liked my personality and thought I was very attractive so she would have definitely gone on a date with me. She also liked the way I handled the rejection, she said some guys react negatively to that so she was very happy that I took it well. I never even went on a single date with her but I connected with her more than any of the girls I have gone on a date or two with.

Anyways, I'm out of college, very inexperienced and I hate myself and my life because of this. I have heard so many things from my friends and therapist that my mindset is flawed. I know what people are going to say that I'm too young to give up on dating, I have so much time, I'm good enough, I'm a great guy, I'm caring, not every girl is like the other girls I have dated, etc. I don't think its worth putting myself out there anymore, I don't think I will ever truly matter to any girl I meet like other guys have mattered to them, I will never be special or be any girls first anything, I will always have less experience than everyone else, I will never know what its like to be with someone through lifes biggest moments because its all over after college, I never got to have fun in college like everyone else. 

Everyone is telling me I need to get over that last girl and that shitty ex friend of mine, and all the other girls that treated me similarly. That I need to stop viewing dating and relationships as being over after college, that being anyones first doesnt mean anything, that there is more to life, etc. Most importantly they said I need to be more confident. Honestly I can't, I really can't do any of that, especially be more confident. I'm just not that confident guy, I can't be at social events because I don't fit in there, that is how I have always felt at any social thing that wasn't just with close friends. Parties, bars, clubs, etc. I don't like to drink either and I wanted a relationship and to lose it to a girl I was in a relationship with so clearly I'm not like anyone else my age.

I hate that I can't get over any of these thoughts and that I can't be confident. I just can't do it. I know no one will want me if I'm not confident, that girls can smell it a mile away despite me being able to approach them, talk to them, and ask them out. I just can't be confident. I'm not good enough, I've been shown that multiple times, other guys are picked over me that are worth it, that are man enough, I'm just the back up guy girls keep around for attention. I'm just not confident and I never will be, stop telling me to be confident because I am not wired that way, I can't fake it till I make it or whatever, I can't do it. I'm destined to be alone and I need to accept it before I embarrass myself again and get in the way of another two people who should be together and are supposed to have fun together.",27May2018,2
