0,"This past November I had an ex-boyfriend commit suicide and the faster the one year mark comes the more I keep dreaming about him and us. Before he passed he took it upon himself to make an amends with me and apologized for how poorly he treated me and a pretty traumatizing mean message he had sent. 

I forgave him and so on. But now, recently, I’ll have dreams of just wanting to love him and he’s making fun of me and being so harsh to me. Saying it’s stupid for me to care that he’s gone, re-reading the message he had sent. 
I remember the feelings more than anything. 
I just remember him saying it was my fault. 

But last night, I finally had a dream where we saw each other and it was as if I went to go visit him. I felt love and euphoria while looking at him glowing. Literally. We were in love again just like how we used to be. He was different. He was the pure soul he had always wanted to be it felt look. I’ll always remember this dream, it makes the bad ones seem dim and useless. ",03Nov2018,1

But I'm an idiot. Because I'm going to fight again tomorrow, and it's my (crush) friend. How did we get to this point? Ha..here's the story.

We've known each other for four months, talked, kept a steady relationship, we're both in highschool. We both love sports and engage in the same hobbies, and I formed an emotional connection with him, if ever so slight. I started liking him recently however my friend did inform me that he was a player. He kissed three girls in the same day, but I ignored this. So, we got closer as time passed and I'm an open flirt, he picked up on this and would sometimes reply. His friends started ""shipping"" us, and I felt accomplished at my progress. HOWEVER. He introduced me to a young woman, let's call her A. He has professed quite loudly that he does not have a girlfriend, however the two do seem awfully close. I asked him again, in an inconspicuous way, he denies it again. He has allowed many of my advances in the past, returning them himself, and  has made himself available, as well as explored questions related to dating. I'm a little suspicious but I excused him. 
  Yesterday we spent a great amount of time together on school grounds, I met his friends and we all talked and played some sports. He abandoned me several times to engage with our apparent audience and some of his other friends. This plays an important role later on in the story. 

So, when he left for the last time, two girls approached me. They were A's friends who assured me I could confide in them for whatever I may need. It was quite a random confrontation and they were being overly nice. Then they switched in a matter of seconds and warned me to stay away from him, because guess what? He had a girlfriend. And it was A. I'm very confused. My friends were also present, but as the audience. And you wouldn't believe what they told me later.

After the lunch bell, a trusted friend of mine told me that my crush was not who he appeared to be. He would appear nice and jovial to me, but the second he got back to his friends they would discuss me. He apparently sent these girls to me..in order to discourage me..*confusion grows* Beware that this is the same person that willingly 'hung out' with me, flirted, loudly professed his availability, explored dating between us, as well as other things that I won't get into right now. 

As my friend tells me this I also hear about his TWO girlfriends. 

He secretly mocked me. I feel great betrayal. Though I had interest in him, he was still my friend. What I also care about is my name, my reputation! I recently learnt he barely views me as a person. Coming from him himself, worded differently but same arrival. Which leads me, finally to the fight. I approached him about all this and and was returned by denial and his attempts to humiliate me. I pressed and then the guy just completely erupted! He called me an ""annoying bitch,"" ""stalker"" etc. I had never seen him that angry before-or ever angry really. Things went downhill from there and after more insults, coming from me and him both, I scheduled a fight and walked away before we threw fists at the lockers. 

Do you redditers think I have the slightest chance of winning injured? He's athletic, muscular, really a stereotypical sports person. And most importantly, not injured. Oh, and it would be nice to know what the hell is going on with this guy, if you can tell me. ",03Nov2018,1
4,"One of my only friends recently committed suicide while texting me. I didn't realize until later; they just said they had to go after I had been trying to talk through a rough day at school. I haven't been able to sleep much the last few days and I can't tell if I should've done more. This happened before when I was 13, almost exact way and exact progression. I don't know who else to blame other than myself, right now it seems every time I talk to something through their problems they only get worse and end up dead. I had always thought I was okay at helping people but I'm not sure anymore, it just seems like I make people worse.

It's been a rough few days lately and not sure how I should respond to this at all, I am both apathetic and regretful, but I am not sure if that is denial or shock still. I know I am only 16 and haven't seen much of anything in life, but I am not sure if I should talk to people anymore. Within 3-4 years, two of my best friends have killed themselves with only me to talk to. There was only so much I could do and if I ever brought up therapy or anything of the sort, both would threaten to kill themselves. I'm just not sure if I am the one to blame or not, but it seems like I am the only common variable between the two.",03Nov2018,1

7,"After many years of slowly but steadily gaining an unhealthy amount of weight while not giving a lot of shits about how I dress or generally present myself and having unbelievably low self-esteem, this summer I realised that by the end of the year I will be 20 and I have to start making some changes before it really is too late. I needed to commit to being a better me, for no one's sake but my own. 

I initially just started with the C25K running app and trying to be more mindful of the amount and kinds of food I eat by keeping track of it all (not explicit dieting though - I wouldn't (and still couldn't really yet) be able to maintain it long term). While I still have a lot of work to do to get to my target weight, I can really feel the results. My face looks thinner, I feel more mobile, and if I tuck my tummy a bit I am not absolutely disgusted at myself when I look in the mirror. And while I struggled to run for more than 2 minutes at the beginning, I now run for 30+ minutes multiple times a week with minimal strain! You won't know how euphoric it feels to physically exert yourself more than you ever have in your entire life until you do it, but trust me it's one of the greatest feelings in the world.

My next step was my wardrobe, which primarily consisted of dark t-shirts and jeans. I always knew that it wasn't a great look but never felt the drive to change it, since I believed I would look like shit regardless. Now that I didn't hate my reflection, I thought it was time to finally care. I got some t-shirts with actual colours, some nice chinos for going out, and actual honest-to-god """"""adult"""""" button-up shirts. I also got some other essential stuff like cologne (as opposed to constant deodorant) and face/skin care creams and just general non-essential-but-still-kinda-essential self-care products which I was neglecting to use. I felt ungodly uncomfortable at first with all this new stuff, but now I actually feel *more* comfortable with a shirt and a nice pair of trousers and a face that doesn't look damaged and gross.

Next, I decided to start fully committing to growing a beard. This one isn't as important but it's definitely given me a confidence I didn't have before. I've been able to grow facial hair for many years, but until now I'd either not let it grow out enough before shaving or not sculpt it at all and then shave my entire face once I saw I was getting a neckbeard. This time I made myself aware of two key elements - necklines and patience. I learned how to keep my beard (generally) in a shape that actually looks good and doesn't make me look gross/homeless, and I also learned that it takes time for any beard to not look patchy and pubic. I'm still getting there but I can already tell it's gonna look great in another month or so. And I find it strangely comforting to stroke my face, even at this relative baby stage. I get why beard-havers do it so much.

Finally I started wearing contact lenses more often. I've always had them but I never liked wearing them because I was self-concious about my face and wanted to hide behind my bigass glasses. My token excuse when people asked was that I don't see as well with them (which tbf is true) but I was never really inconvenienced me when I occasionally *did* wear them. Now whenever I am going out on a social occasion I'll wear my lenses instead of my glasses. People who knew me thought I looked really weird at first, but now the general consensus seems to be that I look better

This all leads to the title. For the first time possibly ever, I genuinely feel an ounce of self-confidence in myself and my appearance, and people have been vocal in their observation of this change in me. There hasn't been a single person who said I looked better before, and a lot who have said I look better now. I feel like people treat me nicer, look happier to be around me, and I just feel happier being myself. It all feels... really, really good. And these aren't even massive changes really. I still have a lot of room for improvement before I am more happy with myself than not. But I've learned that despite how long it takes, baby steps are the only way to get to where I want to be in life.

**TL;DR - You get out what you put in. Everything worth doing takes time. You are worth something to someone, no matter what you may think.**

Have any of you had similar experiences to me? Do you have any tips/advice for people wanting to improve themselves? I can't sleep right now so I'll likely be hanging around here for a few hours. Feel free to talk with me about whatever you want.

Love you all :)",03Nov2018,1
8,"I'm not sure if I should post on r/depression or just convince my aunt to pay for a psychiatrist (she's the one who can afford for my well-being).

I had depression in 2016, after my first semester in college. It was from September until December. I mean, I practically remember only a few days of that period. I know that I stayed in bed a lot. I didn't even play a lot. I always knew those terrible thoughts about me being selfish, about me being awful, all those suicidal thoughts were symptoms. Eventually the meds were going to help me and I would forget those terrible thoughts. It worked eventually, although it feels like that period of depression left some scars, like my mood, how I'm often shy and (feel) alone.

Feeling alone is weird. I'm an introvert, always have been. I know that doesn't mean I don't want some social interaction, but I do miss the old friendships that I had. Everyone I knew, who I talked IRL almost everyday, gone. And since I had to deal with the depression, and deal with another disease, I had very little time to dedicate time to those friendships, so they're mostly gone. My friends went to colleges far away from my town.

And feeling alone is just weird. This feeling that I can't make new friends to hang around, ask for help, ask for an opinion, etc. Sure, I still have friends, but all my contact with them is virtual. I may not talk much, but I enjoy some time together *so much*. ",03Nov2018,1

11,"I have not been able to make and maintain friendships ever since I've started college three years ago. Even though I'm going to the college in my hometown, the few friendships I've had have felt trivial, and I've always felt so unimportant. I've felt suicidally empty due to this. All of my emotions have been bottled up and I've just hated myself so much. But my buddy from high school who I haven't talked to since graduating came back to our hometown and hit me up asking if I wanted to hang out. I immediately started thinking of excuses, but I said fuck it and said he could pick me up. It was such a good idea. We caught up and he said that he's been experiencing the same thing; the feeling of crushing loneliness in college. He said that the thought of going back to school makes him feel sick, and that he's thinking about dropping out. We bonded over mutual loneliness. The feeling of having a connection and a real bond is one I haven't felt in a while, and it got me out of my perpetual robotic depression state. The story kinda ends there but I just wanted to put it out there. It feels good to have someone that's experiencing the same thing; especially someone who you used to be close to.",03Nov2018,1
13,"I have known this man since 3rd grade. He is my best friends older brother (only by 2 years) and of course, due to closeness to the whole family and many sleepovers with my friend, things started happening with him intimately over the years. We never had an actual boyfriend &amp; girlfriend relationship, but we would play like best friends, look after each other like brother and sister yet still have a strong physical attraction that led to serious feelings for that moment. The thing was that he was actually rather promiscuous and cheated on all his girlfriends with me up until I got into my first serious relationship at 15. We stopped talking because he got serious with someone too. Now, after that first 8 year exclusive relationship that gave me a beautiful daughter and straight into another 6 year relationship that just ended and damaged me severely from a covert narcissist, we started randomly talking again. It started because we both work overnight shift and anyone else we knew was asleep so we started catching up. He is married with 2 boys and I was single for the first time at almost 29 years old since age 15, so a lot of good encouraging advice he gave me helped me a lot. We clicked again (mainly like brother and sister) it was like no time passed since we last spoke. We were texting every night and all night long and the day came where he randomly had some free time in the morning after work and asked me to meet him for breakfast, still at this point it was a casual friendship bond....until we physically saw each other. St breakfast we both still acted cool like family, however I left thinking about how comfortable I feel with him and I wished with everything he was available, knowing it wasn't possible. Yet, our next conversations after that started being flirtatious started by him so he must have felt something like I did after that day. Then I was out one night, still depressed and so hurt, feeling worthless and rejected (even though I never spoke about it or acted like it) I got a message from him saying he was staying close by if I wanted to come over and hang out and of course I jumped at the opportunity simply for the fact that his presence is very enjoyable. We ended up having the place to ourselves, and once our conversation started getting deeper into emotions and the night got later it started. While talking and watching TV I laid my head down on a pillow next to him and he started sweetly comforting me by running his fingers through my hair and then pulled me closer and kissed me with so much passion. We couldn't stop, let's just say...I spent the night. I feel horrible because now I'm the ""other woman"" and it goes against everything I believe in morally yet it felt so natural and all of the pain my ex left in me was just gone, and we are still talking every night and flirting and deep down I know I should at least make sure it never happens again, but it's obvious I want him so badly. I know he's a good man and is probably going to keep his distance too knowing it was a mistake. I just can't get rid of these natural feelings I have and had growing up with him. He's always been there for me when I needed him, no way can I just stop talking to him, but at the same time my feelings get stronger every time we talk and I think about him all day long now. How can I keep my best friend, my brother and just rid myself of this intimate love for him and wanting him physically, I want him to be mine. I feel like he was always supposed to be mine but the universe has a sick and twisted sense of humor. It's torture! I refuse to be a homewrecker, but my heart makes me want to forget he has a wife and family. What am I supposed to do with myself?  ",03Nov2018,1
14,"I was driving home tonight kinda late around midnight. I got pulled over for speeding is the reason the cop used. Said I was going 57 in a 50. Cop asked if I had anything in the car. I live in MD and it's not recreational yet, but the law has relaxed a bit in recent years. I told him I had a bowl which he asked to see and I gladly showed him. Asked if I had anything else to which I replied no. He tore the car up and down trying to find something that wasn't there. Asked me if I had thrown anything out because I decided to drive an extra 100-200 feet to pull into a parking lot rather than the side of the road. I replied that I had not. He then asks me why he found some marijuana in the passengers side door. I DID NOT have any weed with me. I would have known if I did and none of my friends would just leave a decent sized nug laying around like that. I told them straight up that wasn't my bud. I admitted to having the pipe so why wouldn't I admit to having a small amount of bud that was going to be found anyway. Went back and forth with them trying to make it sound like I wasn't using the oldest excuse in the book saying it wasn't mine before realizing I just sounded like another one of those losers on the show Cops. In the end, he ended up saying he believed me and gave me an $80 ticket for speeding and kept my pipe. What do you guys think? Do you think it's more likely a cop tried setting me up for what would've only amounted to a $100 fine anyway or do you think its more likely that someone left it in my car knowing I only have 2 friends who could have done so and when asked if they may have left bud in my car, they said no?",03Nov2018,1

My mother neglected me from the very start, she was always uncomfortable around me, my father cheated on her with another woman and moved away. Right out of prison my new stepfather came, never having gotten off his drug addiction, she thought she could somehow control it, especially when they had a child together, but he spiralled back down into heroin and opioid addiction, dragging us all down with him by spending all our money on drugs and alcohol.
Our mother stopped caring, escaping into a computer addiction, unresponsive when talked to.
We had no money for bills, so they turned off our water and electricity, not even for food we had money, I was 10 at the time, struggling to get us food and somehow also go to school, while also being beaten up and forced to fight other ""losers"" by fellow kids in our poverty stricken ghetto neighbourhood, made fun of for never having clean clothes, being so thin and sick looking.
Zombie, ghost or junkie they called me.

Not even during the weekends at my father I could rest, as my stepmother threatened to hurt me if I touched her daughter(my sister)

I had to keep everything and myself under control at all times, my mother threatened to give me away if I ever let anything about what goes on at home slip to anyone, so I was always the one who was sent forwards when the police came asking for my stepfather, or CPS, because she knew I would keep my mouth shut, telling me that I would ruin her life and she would drag me along.

My father cheated on his woman once again with my new stepmother.

My father grew suspicious and after 3 weeks of vacation with me, he finally managed to make me break my silence, he took me with him, at first I thought I could rest, but my new stepmother turned out to dislike me, and to be fair, I was a complicated child and 12 at the time, she was 10 years younger and never had children.

I went from a household that had no restrictions and was a total ruin, to the total opposite, we started to hate each other, it got to the point where I didn't want to go home when she was there, as I knew she would constantly watch and nag at everything I did.

My father threatened to kick me out when I was 17 and didn't have a job yet, so I moved back to my mother, thinking she had changed.

And she indeed had gotten her life under control, split up with my stepfather, gotten a job.

But she was still herself.

But I was 17 now and started earning my own money, I found friends and got a place in a school for artists, I was happy and relieved things were finally going my way, I found my peace and finally saw the light.

But when I was 18, life decided to go against me once again.


I got very ill very quickly, losing 15kg in 6 weeks, a whole list of symptoms, pains, being bedridden and unable to eat due to constant pain and nausea.
My mother wasn't supportive from the start, not entering my room for the first 2 or 3 weeks, pretending I was just sulking.
Then she started yelling at me, trying to hold me still when I trembled, telling me to walk to the doctor.

In the following 2 years, I went to many doctors, 2 hospitals, 1 psychotherapist, none of them finding a cause for my sickness.
My mother didn't want to drive me to the doctors, pretended towards the family that I was alright and avoided the topic of my health state, while I was slowly dying of starvation.
She and her new boyfriend claimed I was just trying to be lazy and mentally ill, making fun of me, locking doors in the house, restricting my internet and not leaving me alone in the house for more than a day because ""they did not trust me"".

While my hope for finding the reason why I was ill never died, I was getting exhausted over the almost 3 years, hoping that if I don't find the cure, at least let me not wake up again when I fall asleep, because living had become nothing but pain, every bite I ate caused pain, nausea for hours, while my body urged me to eat by almost being so low on energy constantly, that I was barely able to walk anymore.

Last July, I did one last effort, demanding an MRI, I looked at it myself and compared, sending it with my suspicion to a specialist and I turned out to be right. 4 rare compression syndromes were diagnosed.

7 weeks ago I underwent an 8-hour open abdominal surgery, removing an artery from my leg to reconstruct several parts of arteries in my abdomen, I felt like dying for the first 2 weeks, recovery is slow, especially since I only weighed 38kg when I had surgery.

By now I can eat more, but everything still hurts, I can barely sleep, averaging 4-6 hours each night, I have horrible stomach cramps almost every day and am either constipated or have diarrhoea. Meanwhile, my family already urges me to find a job and make plans ""now that I am able to get back into life again"".
I am constantly worried about the compressions coming back due to internal scarring, which could occur at any time during recovery, up to 6-12 months into the healing process.


And today I sit here, turning 21 today, no friends left I could celebrate with. My mother being uncomfortable with my birthday, I got 20$ and a jacket from her and her boyfriend because I had none left... 

My sister is not there as she wanted to be with her boyfriend, my mother and her boyfriend will go out today, which I am actually glad about as it is weird on my birthday around them as they seem more easily irritated on this day.

21, 3 years I have wasted, not really existed, 3 years that are some of the most important, my former friends all drive cars and have a career now, but I, I am stuck frozen in time, never had a real childhood, close friends, a first love..  


Still waiting for my chance to get some rest.


But I doubt that I will get it before passing on to the afterlife.

I was looking forward to one day eating birthday cake again, my mother got me a store-bought cake to eat alone... but with these stomach cramps I still have, I am happy if I can even enjoy a bit...


So, happy birthday to me, to another lifetime of persistence.

27,"(Okay, so here is your ""Trigger Warning"" for those that are easily offended.)

Okay. So I have a dead YouTube channel that I retired in early 2014 because YouTube was a bunch of bullshit even before the Adpocalypse and all else. I got sick of YouTube's rules and crap, so I retired the channel in 2014 at 10,000 subscribers. I don't even really use the Google account anymore. 

So, I recently logged into the Gmail linked to it and found that I had a bunch of comments in the Inbox. But they were all in this bullshit gibberish language! I didn't get why I was getting all these obnoxious comments in this horribly ugly language. As it turns out, some asshole from Mexico has a YouTube channel with 2 million views and apparently linked one of my vids on his channel. I won't say which one it is or the ""big name"" YouTuber from nowhere, but now I have a bunch of horseshit on my channel and I'm REALLY annoyed by it! I never cared about YouTube views or subs, so someone who is an attention whore my care. But this shit isn't even in English! None of my videos are not in English, so why do I keep getting all this disgusting garbage on my channel? All these gross comments. 

I don't really care about most foreign languages, but Russian, Eastern European, Mandarin, German, and whatever the hell this garbage is I find to be REALLY ugly, horrific sounding languages. Very guttural, throaty, spitty languages which sound like ear rape. And now this video has 120,069 views and I have a bunch of stupid-ass comments on my old channel with this crap on them. It's no use deleting them and they aren't really hurting anyone - other than annoying the shit out of me - but damn, talk about attracting the wrong crowd. I don't want to be associated with this immature crap from this one dude's channel and these disgusting looking foreign comments.

I don't know. I'm just annoyed. I hate negative attention or gross things being attached to me. This guy is basically some Third World version of Pewdewpie and has an equally obnoxious fan base of little brats. Only these brats don't even speak English. Its super obnoxious, just like when I'm in a public place and I have to hear that crap, as if people being loud assholes and disrespecting everyone around them isn't bad enough in English. It's even worse when it's not.

I just felt like venting my frustrations somewhere. I should probably delete the video or make it private, but since it's a dead channel, I'm just going to turn off all notifications and leave it in the dark, anyway.",03Nov2018,1
28,"Throughout my high school and university years, I was quite shy and anxious, and often concerned about being a ""good girl"" (i.e. studying, not getting involved in drama, not doing 'silly things', not being judged by my parents and my peers).

I was also secretly very conflicted about my sexuality and always trying to maintain the right image about my sexuality so people wouldn't ""get the wrong idea"" about me. In a way, I still haven't completely moved on from that, and it's something I'm still struggling with, but I think it's a problem I could've resolved long ago if only I'd been less uptight when I was younger.

Looking back now, I had so many chances to experiment in a healthy way, but never took them. I had a good group of friends and I wasn't growing up in a particularly oppressive/repressive environment. I was a sheltered kid, but not in a particularly damaging way - my parents were cautious but reasonable, not the overly helicoptering type. It would have been quite safe for me to try dating more often (with any gender) and learn how to navigate relationships, and just to do more silly teenage things in general (even just having an embarrassing fashion phase, going to parties, taking more selfies and travelling with friends). So I had plenty of opportunities to do these things... but never took them and never even really wanted to. At the time, I thought that meant I was just smarter, more mature and less embarrassing than the people who did all this stuff, but now I realise how much growing-up I've missed out on.

I think I could've been much happier, or at least learnt a lot from those experiences. I would probably be much more emotionally mature and secure than I am now, and I think my life could've taken a different path. I had the chance (one that many people just don't have) to have a fulfilling, healthy, even helpful adolescence - but I squandered it.

I know it's never too late to try new things in life, or to grow as a person. But I still can't help regretting everything I didn't do earlier.",03Nov2018,1
30,"I always hated ads growing up. O

I haven't involuntarily watched any advertisements/commercials for a very long time. I completely ditched cable TV/satellite. I use adblockers on all of my computers and laptops. I even use adblocking apps on phones and tablets. 

I went to my folks house the other day  and they have digital cable. I sat through an entire 2 minute commercial run during the news. I saw three things during that run that I plan to buy. 

Never thought I'd say this but I might actually start voluntarily watching some ads now, because I feel like I may actually be missing out on things I'd like to purchase for myself/others, or new movies/shows I'd like to see.",03Nov2018,1

34,"I'm writing because I don't want to. Specifically, I'm writing because I don't want to write about Trump. But it's worse than that. I don't want to write about Trump, but I don't want to write even more about a sense of conviction I've been experiencing. I don't want my Trumpian conviction of my perspective to win the reigns of how I steer my life. I don't want the totalitarian sublimation of my experience to occur.

I feel like I'm being hammered. Just yesterday I was the one actively seeking out every possible news article on every possible thing with their despotic and terrifying prospects for our future. The intellectuals I respect or who've had track records of getting things correct were all singing similar tunes. Mind you, they still are, but I was getting the brunt of the 20 page in depth interviews and hundreds of hours of their speeches. Even if you're just grazing the news landscape, you're probably familiar with the percentage of animals we've managed to make extinct, domestic terror is at an all time high, and in practically every “advanced democracy” some form of right wing nationalism or extremist position is setting the pace and agenda.

At work, I get to hear example after example of ingrained and proud ignorance do everything in its power to tear down the systems in place trying to help as well as their own stability. Little helpless kids I interview eventually lead to their parents which now get to act as visceral reminders that someone I've encountered or thought positively about is getting routinely abused or indoctrinated, and the best I'll have for most is a superficial plan that acts as a kind of prayer to incriminate deeper if they again fall into our net.

The all-encompassing nature of work is another kind of pound. Mind you, I don't describe the things I do above because I'm a “normal” person who's looking for an excuse to breakdown or loses any sleep. I can spend 7.5 hours a day, exceedingly easily, interviewing kids, talking to idiots, or bouncing between a courtroom and places to go to lunch. That's the point. I have my “distraction.” I have my “obligation.” I don't need to pay excruciatingly close attention to my teetering society because I'm going to be slowly breaking down an idiot's intransigence over the next few months who's doing everything in their power to lose their child.

How often can you really sit and think on what it means that this touted symbol of “freedom” and “Western Civilization” is being steer-headed by 25% of radical fascists doing irreparable harm? That the whole of the human experiment is threatened by those who, routinely, celebrate the chance to kill each other en masse or applaud those who are in fact killing each other already? We're under the spell of those so possessed of their...I struggle to even call them “ideas” as I think those reside in people with the capacity to think independently and recognize objective evidence. We're watching, not just the failed-to-learn lessons of history, but the active dismemberment of even the capacity of how to learn and protect or cherish to begin with.

I really, truly, believe that. I don't think this is an “election” issue. I think it's a group psychological one. I think it's a biological one. I think we've so massively outpaced our ability to cope and rationalize, that the deathly serious and violent irrational forces that killed or else are behind all of the proud ignorance. It's with that same blindness we charged into the battles that our ancestors came out on top of. We're not contending with “nationalism,” we're provoking survival instincts that are fully capable of destroying everything in their path. They're dying to prove it.

I find myself too actively cheering for “collapse.” I want ignorance to suffer, but my same exhausted sentiment is going to speak to that much more undue suffering for “the rest” who won't deserve it then anymore than they do now. Maybe we all don't deserve extinction, but the idea that we wouldn't vote, or pay attention, or stay awake at the wheel will not go ignored. Jordan Peterson phrased it brilliantly in another interview of his I watched recently. Reality has a way of snapping back when you try to bend and distort it.

Reality, so named, remains the word at the center of all of my interests. It's what I always hope to discover in writing. I was right, for example, that I didn't want to talk about Trump. I had to. His insane reality has beaten on my door from the moment I shut off whatever I was watching 2 seconds after the Mexican crime and rapists comments. The insanity of humanity I had a front seat for when I “debated” religious fundamentalists. I didn't need to take that class again. I also didn't feel particularly ignorant of what's physically happening in the brains of the “conservative” and the ideologue. It's a large pile of individually easy to understand forces.

What's the reality underneath? To me, it's the antagonistic force. The blunt force trauma of proud ignorance doesn't provoke me anymore. The idea that not only might I never be able to overcome it, but that it's going to obliterate everything I care about, that provokes me. When I have a fantasy land of little elves running around my chest working hard to dig deeper and deeper for a cavern suitable enough for my sunken heart, there's a problem. What's the larger pattern? If I hear the same idiot “reasoning” from the same “youth” just in a different language and a different country, what's my take away? When I see the same story reported about war-ravaged Africa or the Middle East, what didn't my parents get from the message when they were 30 that I'm supposed to in order to keep the flag of progress waving and flame of hope lit? What does it say about your prospect of “hope” when you find yourself empathizing with the feeble, yet communal, delusion of the faithful?

Faith is one of those words I've heavily lambasted. I define it as belief without evidence. The ability to trust in, not something simply “unseen” or “unproven,” but often demonstrably false. Faith is the “bless your heart” polite “fuck you” to life's otherwise terrorizing circumstances. Jordan Peterson has a different definition. He says that faith is believing in the “best possible outcome” from telling the truth. It's the conviction that no matter the consequences, you won't get a better one by delaying or distorting the circumstances. It's another of his ideas that's stuck with me for quite some time, because I think it's also something I deeply believe.

“My” truth lies in my ability to use as many words as it takes to talk around a sense. I'm made of the same incredibly dangerous and full of potential forces as every balls-out ignorant person I meet in life and on screen. I imagine myself in different hats attempting to mold myself to whatever crazy forces might show up at my door. I try to plan for navigating a whole host of futures I would consider less than ideal to downright terrible. I try not to let how I actually behave in the world manifest as an expression of my baseline hopelessness. It's true I will act in spite of it. It's true that I think the worst is yet to come.

I just don't know what more to do with it. That seems like the kind of epitaph on my living grave. “I don't know what else to do, so come what may.” I feel I'm sort of defaulted to a form of detached Buddhism or something; I'm “enlightened” by the prospect that my eventual death will lead to a cosmic balance to all of life's indignities. I'm at once entirely responsible for the world, and utterly detached from it. I'm a conduit for waves I can barely perceive but for their dramatic retellings in the labored voices of those drowning in them.

I have this problem when I'm bowling. You think this won't transition well, but hang on. When I'm “feeling it,” I keep my eyes focused on the part of the lane that nets me the most strikes. I have a little routine where I sit in the pocket and don't think about tripping over my toes or cranking my wrist incorrectly. Unfortunately, in some weird kind of way, in order for me to continue doing well, it almost has to feel like an accident or that I'm watching myself. I have to be deeply enmeshed in the song I'm listening to or conversation I'm having, and the strikes have to be an afterthought. My natural quasi-panic likely-disorder will kick in almost on cue the moment I start to *care* or “truly focus.” Perhaps you might call it amateur choking. Even when I think I know where to look, how to hold the ball, slide my leg, and prevent my wrist breaking, I don't seem to know what to do, and the “solution” resides in occupying my attention with “surrounding stuff.” The strike happens in the moment the ball leaves my hand. To take my mind off everything but that moment seems to be the relevant exercise in improving my score.

How might this scale? Is the fate of democracy won or lost at the moment you vote? Or, are there a million and a half other things that can be occupying your mind which ensure your vote means what it's supposed to? My disposition isn't mostly dictated by the insane and ignorant so much as it is the moment I choose to respond to them in the best way I know how after I've explored all the noise they seem to be creating around me. I don't need ideas I don't have to work for. I can't settle for “People are basically good” or “You have to believe” or “Just save one person!” It's always complicated. It's significantly more complicated than bowling a strike or keeping your eyes on the same arrow for each throw, right?

Again my mind is repeating the “underlying needs” line from my recent job training. Why are we at your door? Anyone can call in a report, but what's going on that you're not proud of talking about? Who might we refer you to so that we never have to come again? I have an underlying need. I need there to be meaning behind the things I do. I need you to recognize I showed up at your door, not the agency I work for. Better stated, I need to walk away with a perspective that transcends “It's just policy!” I need to know that your ridiculousness deserves what it's asking from me. I want to take away new windows into exploring the totalizing influence of proud indignant ignorance and how to engage with it a million different ways before the moment I have to open my mouth.

If I could fix it with a snap, it'd have to trigger something in me, not make them disappear. But like I said, I don't really know what else I should be doing.",03Nov2018,1
35,"For the past who knows how long I really gave little regard to self improvement of most kinds and was really lazy and non productive. Recently I have been changing for the better after going on a college field trip for leadership and self improvement. 

Lately I have stopped drinking anything other than water (besides occasional juice or an iced coffee with breakfast, but not too often) 

Ive been cutting out my usual mindless binge eating,  and stopped eating large amounts of junk (If I really need a snack now, I go for like fruit/vegetables or if Im out sometimes Ill get really small bags of chips (50 cent or $1) that usually aren't huge in calories. 

Today I plan on starting a serious gym routine as well.

Ive also been alot more effortful in my social life trying to start conversations with random strangers around college and my community (although sometimes they are like ""wtf why is this random guy talking to me""

And in my academic life im still procrastinating, but after all my current assignments are done, Ill be vigorously managing my time and getting all my hw and studying done as soon as possible. 

Oh. Ive also been thinking about and trying to stop playing video games unless Im hanging out with other people playing video games. They just are too time consuming and don't provide anything other than a fake fantasy world that tries to make you escape from your problems instead of making your life better. 

(Not that im bashing video games. I love a great smash bros fight)

The only bad thing, is that I have a crush on somebody that I can't have, and they are the first and only true crush I've ever had in 18 years,which makes me sad, but that's a part of life.

36,"Last New Year's Eve I was, like every year, home alone and quite lonely. Since I learn Spanish for more than two years, I decided to download a language learning app where you're able to talk with native speakers to improve your skills with texting and talking in (e.g.) Spanish. 

She texted me first and it quickly became clear that we felt the same at that night, lonely and forgotten. 

We started off talking in English and whenever my capability of Spanish made it possible, I tried to talk in Spanish. We talked a lot and I immediately knew it's going to be a deep and long friendship. Over the whole time I knew I'm not in love with her, we were just really best friends. The first week we texted for more than 40 hours, according to the battery usage tab in the iOS settings. I guess that was more than I texted with people in the whole year of 2017.

 With her I was able to get out of my comfort zone although she lives in another country. The first time talking in Discord felt extremely cringey because she felt like her English is not good enough to talk, it was absolutely good enough tho. The call was great and afterwards she texted me she had a nice time and would like to talk more often with me. That's a success I never had accomplished before, someone wanted to spend *more* time with me. We started to talk on Discord almost every free minute, hell yeah, we even sang songs together. I've never seen myself singing with someone before.

 *I was happy.*

Then one night came when we talked as usually in the evening and I told her about that Spanish book I've bought with tons of short stories. She wanted me to read one for her and she fell asleep immediately within the first five minutes. From that night on I whispered her every night one story until she fell asleep and she always wanted to stay in the call during the night. In that time her life wasn't going well and she had many nightmares. I often woke up in the middle of the night because she did. I wanted to be there for her, to care for my friend. We talked until she fell asleep again, sometimes until the next morning. We developed many habits, even nicknames for each other and had tons of running gags. We spent so much time together because we haven't had anyone else to spend our time with. I was planning to take a plane to go visit her this summer so we could finally meet. She approved that idea.

When June came around, about five months after I first got to know her, things changed. We talked less frequently, it stayed with the calls at night. She was busy as she told me but also her life went worse than before, I don't know why until this day. Suddenly the calls at night ended. She begun drinking heavily and didn't let anyone around her or reach out to her, including me. Time passed, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, one month. We didn't talk for a whole month, although I often tried to contact her. I felt like I was losing my only friend I had and wanted to know if she actually does that on purpose. So I asked her if we could have more contact again in the future. She got upset and told me she can't hold up a friendship because I live in another country and it's a waste of time. I was a waste of time for her. She had other people around her now and was so busy, she couldn't even send a few messages during the day. She never told me an actual reason for her way of thinking. 

I accepted this and moved on. When I look back at that time I still feel happy because I never felt lonely during these six months. Although we are no friends any longer I thank her very much for that time.

37,"I have been fortunate to not have lost a human that is close to me. But I have lost two pets who had each earned all of my heart. And I think they truly cared about me, too.

What really made me question if it is possible for the dead to join our dreams was my dog. Every time I think about the experience I selfishly grieve a little more, but I know it's a selfish feeling and that did the right thing.

After my dog died, she was in every dream. She was never a central role, she was just a constant companion. A constant entity by my side, following me everywhere. 

After about 2 to 3 months it became clearer and clearer that she was right there at my side. But she was dead. She was supposed to have passed on. I so badly wanted her to stay with me in my dreams, but I also felt it wasn't right. She shouldn't stick around just for me, she should let go and leave this plane.

One day I finally put aside whatever was going on in my dream and turned my attention on to her. I sat down on the floor and she immediately curled up next to me and laid her head on my lap. I rubbed the base of her ears and enjoyed feeling her silky soft fur once again. I finally said, ""You don't need to be here any more. You should let go."" She stood up and looked at me, ""Go, it's OK,"" then turned around and disappeared as she walked away.

I have never dreamed of her again. I grieve remembering this because I selfishly want her to still be with me, even if it's just in my dreams. But it was probably better for her to have let go.

I felt my childhood cat was my soul mate. I loved her so dearly. I got her when I was 5, and she died when I was 26. She was always there at my side even when I felt the world had forgotten I existed. She never forgot me.

After she died, I occasionally felt like I could feel her walking across the bed towards me. She always slept right next to my head. But, that could have just been tactile memory that came up from my grief.

I don't recall her in my dreams often. But maybe that would be normal for a cat -- they like to observe and follow from shadows and under cover, while a dog prefers to be right at your side.

What *has* happened, strangely so often, is that she's saved me from nightmares! It's so strange to be cornered by a group of shambling zombies and to suddenly have my childhood cat appear between me and the zombies and somehow keep them away when suddenly a door shows up behind me allowing me to escape. 

Maybe she has frequently been in my dreams, just keeping an eye on me.

The last memory I have of her after her death was the most vividly tactile experience I have had. I had previously only felt her walk across my bed within the first week after her death. But then years later, I felt her walk across my bed even clearer than I had before, as if it were actually happening. 

I was probably in a lucid dream state. I didn't dare open my eyes because I didn't want to lose this opportunity to feel my cat again. But instead of just walking across the bed as my prior experiences, this time I felt her curl up in the nook of my shoulder and head, like she used to. I could feel her fur and the warmth of her body. And then incredibly I both heard and felt her purr. I just soaked up every feeling enjoying the opportunity to at least *feel* like I was with my beloved cat once again.

It was awesome.

These could have been examples of the these spirits choosing to visit me again. Or merely lovely dreams.

Any of you have similar experiences?",03Nov2018,1

39,"My worldviews have changed drastically over the past 7 years. When I was 15 I started to become interested in politics and social issues. At first, I would adopt the opinions of the people around me. But over time, as I discovered different opinions through the Internet, I slowly realized that people around me may not have everything figured out perfectly as I used to think. But I made the same mistake again. Instead of forming my own opinions I just started adopting opinions from the other side. And now I'm realizing that it was a mistake and I have to learn to make up my own mind. To not give in to the pressure. 

But there are so many people who want to abuse that. They want to use this feeling of uncertainty to push me back to the other side completely. But I don't want to. 

I'll try to stop being vague here. The process I'm describing, that I've gone through over the years, could be simplified as 

""conservative with xenophobic tendencies -&gt; extreme liberal trying to please everyone -&gt; confused liberal who is not so sure about some things he used to believe""

Now, I don't want to go back to the starting point. That is not what I'm feeling. But I've been getting really annoyed with the way religion is treated. So many people are acting like it's something we have to cherish and protect, even at the expense of others. I do not accept this. If I could choose one motto to represent my opinions it would be 'do no harm, take no shit'. I am still very liberal about most social and political issues, just not with this one.

I am most definitely in support of hate speech laws. But they should not apply to stories and characters that aren't real. That is not progress. You have a right to believe whatever you want. You have a right to build places of worship. But don't you fucking dare to impose any of your beliefs on me. Don't you fucking dare to influence the lives of non-believers or to demand respect for your beliefs. We should seriously stop treating religious people like some fragile snowflakes that need constant protection. Hate speech laws should only protect from violent threats and abuse directed at specific individuals. But they should not be applied to criticism of religion. Respectful or not.",03Nov2018,1
40,"Not sure how old I want my character to be, so anyone in college or above can please respond.

In the opening scene, this modest woman is swimming alone in her backyard on a bright, sunny afternoon. In a freak accident, her one piece bathing suit is sucked into the pool filter and rips right off her body. She forgot her towel in the house. As she starts to blush pink and exit the pool...the frat boys from next door are home early. Can you please answer these questions?

1. How old are you? Outgoing or shy?

2. How would you react once the one piece was sucked right off your bare tush?

3. How do you feel when you hear the loud, laughing frat boys show up? What do you do?

4. They sit around drinking beers in the backyard. This could go on for HOURS.  The water is getting cold. Do you exit the pool and run for the backdoor? Demurely scurry from bush to bush?

5. You get inside and call your friend. What can she teasingly say about your experience to make you blush?",03Nov2018,1
41,"I am a 3rd year grad student in somewhere it gets very cold during the winter. I bought my car for $1200 two years ago and of course it is a piece of shit. I am planning on being here for 5 years. So another 2.5 years. 

Well, my car is a piece of shit and recently I realized - I just can't rely on it. It's having an issue where when it starts to get cold out, it starts stuttering at red lights and it makes me incredibly anxious when driving it. The heater doesn't work either. It was in a crash before I bought it so the body is fucked and it has no airbags. The stereo has some issues. It has other problems too. It's a piece of shit.

Basically, when it gets cold out the car is undrivable. It's starting to get cold out now and it's starting to stutter at lights. When it gets too cold, it just stalls out.

I could try to fix it, then some other problem comes up. I've fixed previous problems, and more just show up.

I'm thinking of junking it. I have to sit on it for a minute but it's becoming more of a hassle than its worth. 

I can't use the car during the winter which is when I actually need the car. 

To be honest, I don't need a car that often. I live too close to campus for them to sell me a permit so I have to take the bus/Uber. Also, by this point in my PhD, I don't take classes and my adviser just switched me to his funding so I don't have to teach much. I can work from home for the most part. I order most of what I need from Amazon. I buy eggs milk etc. from the store but I can just Uber. 

Insurance is $55 a month, a fill up is $35 ish. So like average $90 a month to run it plus registration plus if/when it breaks plus whatever. I'm think of just using that $90+ a month for Uber rides for stuff I would normally drive. 

I can't use the car to drive to campus. I can't trust the car during the winter. 

The car still runs (now) which is why I'm thinking of junking it and maybe getting more money. I bought it for $1200 so if the car's engine just fell out, the car doesn't owe me anything. I only have 2.5 more years here and I don't even really have to be anywhere for that 2.5 years. I don't trust the car to get me anywhere not in town so when I leave here I'm going to junk it anyway.

I'm thinking of junking it because I feel on Craigslist it's worth at most $1k, being very generous. Probably more like $500 or so. Places will come and take it and give you like $150 for it. Plus, no chance of getting ripped off like Craigslist is wont to do. I've had issues on CL before.

I don't know. Should I junk the car? It will save me $90 a month and a bunch of headache. ",03Nov2018,1

45,"I am 23, about 55kg and 5 ft 11 inches. I have kept this weight for probably 3-5 years now and I can't seem to put any on unless I triple the amount I eat (which is hard with IBS). 99% of my daily life consists of at least one breakfast, one lunch and one dinner meal (with small snacks in between). Yet, I know some older people who manage 1 meal and a few snacks in the day yet they weigh 2-4 stone more than me.

I get a little bit self-conscious (sometimes) when I look in the mirror and see as massive Adam's apple poking out my neck or feel my own body as you can clearly feel bone (I am not a rake, however).

47,"she asks me for a meaning, or one unsullied, adequate reason, or at least a personal explanation of why we suffer, why her heart’s drained, why the earth is simply where we bury life lived in vain.  if i have words of conciliation, i swear i’d not hesitate to open my guts and spill what’s there of illumination.  

she won’t take truth for an answer.  i can’t stop tinkering with meaning.

we met under the circumstance of a severe case of sadness and disordered mood.  she’s chained to misery and i’m subsisting on avid prayers and states of self-imposed fugue.  most of my energy is spent enlisting an army of angels to coerce truth from the universe.  pressing the span between my hands conjures silence that isolates me from trivial converse.  friendship is scarce and love is a pleasure designed by adepts of sex and flirts.  not for me.  i’m a reclusive accident, an untimely, regrettable birth.

she bristles with animosity.  her life is defense against vile, impertinent wretches unaware of living under a curse.  i laugh, somewhat bitterly, because don’t we all build battlements around what hurts?  she says her mind is the scene of every unspeakable crime.  she won’t let me, her therapist or priest, or even her God take a look in.  not til she’s cleaned up the bloody contours, erased the indelible clawed on the walls.  her eyes dismiss minutiae.

between the length of her hands and mine is the cruel view of what we’ve misused.

that’s all i have to show.  i can’t tell if there’s meaning, a reason, a purpose or feeling that isn’t a vulgar, imagined construction.  i can’t tell if truth is a desperate invention of a mind distorted by politics and convention.  i can’t tell if what i am is relevant, regal or psychically fetid.

but i’m lucky.  she accepts my dissociative grace of mind, conceding it could be the reason i’m vocally irreverent, annoyingly ill-defined.  i tell her we’re nothing but quantum fluctuations, annihilating time, we’re proof of Gödel’s Theorem, we’re infinitely border-line.

56,"My life is a complete mess right now, and I need someone to talk some sense into me.  (Tl;Dr at the bottom if you don't want to read this wall of text.)

I'm a brand new graduate student. I'm at school about 10-15 hours a day.  Some days it's 8am-7pm, some days its 8am to 9pm.  I sit in my lab all day either reading, grading papers, or working on my thesis. 

Every day is exactly the same and I need to make a change, but don't know how.  I wake up at 6:30, drink some coffee, take a shower and eat a blueberry muffin.  Then I hop on the bust for a 45 minute commute to school, where I sit at my desk unless I need to go to class or TA.  I dont eat at all during this time because we don't have a kitchen in our office and I don't cook at home.  When 7pm rolls around I decide if I want to keep working or go home, and it's usually the latter because I'm so dead inside, both mentally and physically.  I'll hop off the bus and eat dinner at a restaurant by myself because I get so hungry on the ride home I just want the instant satisfaction of eating food as soon as I can. It ends up being close to $20-30 because I'm in such a high cost of living area.  I can't remember the last time I cooked at home.  Then I'll go home, sit on my couch exhausted, watch an hour of Netflix while drinking a few beers, then pass out only to start the exact same thing over the next day. 

My room is an absolute disaster.  I haven't done laundry in 2 weeks.  And I'm slowly going broke because I lost my willpower when it comes to eating out.  I'm renting a spare room in a family's home and they're either eating or cooking for ~1.5 hours by the time I walk in the door, so most nights I'm forced to eat out even if I want to save money and cook. If my living situation was better I'd be able to do a lot more to improve myself, but I don't have a car and am only 4 months into a year-long lease in this home.   

I'm lost as to what to do.  My living situation is, I think, the core of my issues.  I'm thinking of terminating my lease early and paying whatever penalty they throw at me just to get out of here if it means living somewhere else where I'll be able to keep my sanity.

60,"I’ve recently been working on a journal to vent out a lot of my depression and anxiety . It’s really, really working and it has helped me understand a lot of stuff that happened when I was younger now that I’m an adult. 

One thing that came up today was “Write about a time when you felt different”

Just before I entered into the sixth grade, my school began to put special education students into general education classes. It was a good thing, it kept the SpEd students from being left in a class room all day with no interaction from other students. It gave them a fighting chance at making other friends.

My sixth grade teacher, however, *hated* this. She was pretty cruel to any student that was different in any way. She kept the SpEd students in a small group in the back corner of the classroom and only if there were group activities were they separated out into groups. 

At some point, during the beginning of the school year, I got moved into that group.  I’m not special needs, but I was diagnosed with Glaucoma that year and had to wear thick, chunky glasses that I could still barely see out of when the room was too dim. A lot of her lessons involved copying notes from an overhead projector. As I couldn’t see, my grades began to plummet.  She wouldn’t move me closer so that I could see better, or give me another copy of the notes to copy from, so I was pretty screwed. I went from being an A student, to making D’s and F’s. 

Her treatment of me became worse, and my parents complained to the principal but nothing came of it. Nothing was changed, and I still was failing. 

But, the day that sticks with me 15 years later was the day that we had to do a group activity.  

We had to make a mini garden for our science class.  My depth perception was pretty much gone at this point, so I knocked things over all the time and tripped over my own feet while walking.  During the assignment, I accidentally knocked over a pitcher of water onto the desk. She stormed over, grabs up my things and looks to the other students in my group and says “Sorry guys, *there is one in every group.*” as she motioned to the back corner where the special needs students were usually seated.

My teacher just called me developmentally delayed to my classmates, and loud enough to where everyone heard. 

I was pretty upset, told my parents, and eventually after they threatened to sue to school, I got moved out of her class.  But, what she said caused a lot of fall out.  Preteen girls can be really, really mean.  My friends stopped hanging out with me, and I was called a “retard” and “stupid” so much by my former friends that I began to believe it. I was utterly, and completely friendless after that for a good few years.

It sounds so little, so trivial, but it took me until I was 16 to realize that she was just a horrible, awful person who shouldn’t have been a teacher. But, sometimes, when I’m feeling particularly depressed or worthless, what she said that day will haunt me a little.  

It felt good to unpack that, to get it out and work through it to help remind myself that what she said wasn’t true. 

Thanks for letting me vent.

65,"I was out yesterday doing some small shopping, bought two shirts and a few random food items. I felt so tired and when I went into the fitting room to try on those shirts, I didn't look like me.

My skin looked really bad and I just looked dead tired. My torso didn't look the same it usually does to me. That whole area of thighs and stomach, you know what I mean, I felt like a blob.  Haven't gone to the gym in a couple of weeks because of a foot injury and healing I've been dealing with. Not that I've had time to exercise consistently, busy with studies and all that. 

It was just so strange to see myself looking different in clothes I normally look alright in. I've been feeling kind of sad lately and I guess I can see now that part of it has been difficulty keeping up with my health. 

I want to make some changes soon but everything I have to do this week pushes all that back, and its a catch-22 because I'll get too tired to keep up with that and have more to get back to.

67,"I never had any sort of education, I never went to school and all I was taught at home were the very basics of the English alphabet. 
My friends were almost as non-existent as my education. I have one or two friends who I have known my entire life, but only because they were my mom's best friend's children, we don't see each other very often anymore but I am just grateful the we are still friends.
Now of course due to the lack of friends and education I have always had low self esteem, I am constantly unsure of myself or what I will do with my life, and I have been dealing with depression for a while now, it got really bad a few years ago and I stopped eating or drinking as much as I should have been, I was hardly getting out of bed and so started rapidly losing weight, now keep in mind that I am a really skinny person, I have a very fast metabolism and it would take a lot of effort for me to actually gain a considerable amount of weight. You may be expecting some inspiring story about how I fixed everything and got through my depression, but no, all I did was not kill myself like I often thought of doing and instead talked to my friends, no, not those friends, the ones I have had my whole life, are you insane? I'm a self doubting, depressed, introvert, so naturally I ignored the friends I had and decided to talk about my problems with random strangers on the internet! I mean who needs friends when you have the internet, am I right?
 Okay, all joking aside, I did make some pretty good friends online through video games and once I was sure they weren't a psycho or a pedophile I talked to them about my problems and I eventually stopped being quite as depressed, I never fully got over it but it did get somewhat better. But of course it returned, or at least is currently returning, but enough about my depression.
Another interesting thing about me is that I am the third child of 8, not much story about this other than this being the main reason for my lack of education, it's hard for parents to teach their kids when they are having a baby every 2 years (and worrying about certain financial problems on top of all that)

So basically I am a 16 year old middle child, I constantly deal with depression, anxiety, paranoia and self doubt, I would have killed myself a while ago but I care too much about other people and didn't want to dump all my pain and depression onto anyone who cared about me. There's probably more a could tell, like certain views I have on the world but I'll save that for some other time (if ever) 

I hope this post wasn't too boring, I hope you are having a good day, month, year and life whoever you are.

 and please comment your story, it doesn't have to be long, just be open and talk about something that matters to you or something you're going through.",03Nov2018,1
