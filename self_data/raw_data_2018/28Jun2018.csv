0,"I just sent an email to a transgender woman i met at a party with this signoff: ""Actually if you want to just grab coffee somewhere I'd be happy to do that too. It was a pleasure to meet with you and I feel like you must have many more stories to tell. ""

I feel horrible because I'm married... I felt weirdly turned on when I met this woman but I obviously don't want to act on that. My wife would not understand at all. I feel like a total idiot and wish I could un-send the mail.

How horny was my email?  Please rate it on a scale of 1 to 10. Can I walk it back safely?",28Jun2018,1
1,"I keep getting bitched at for not clocking in early and getting information transfered between shifts, but they dont want to pay those extra 5 mins. We have a new time clock system where I can actually see what time I clock in, and which way it rounded (on my phone)
I screen shot it Sunday when I clocked in early(because they were complaining about me not coming in extra before my shift starts) and I had an extra .25 hours on my time clock. Today I noticed they changed it. Essentially meaning I worked 15 mins for free. This isn't the first time it's happened (them changing my time,as well as others). Not quite sure how to approach this.",28Jun2018,1
2,"I do not want to have children. Adoption isn't off the table (since I get to specifically choose the child, their age, the specific time in my life, etc.), but I do not ever want to get pregnant or give birth or give up my life for 18+ years for a child that will most likely be miserable, due to their genetics and their parents' general outlook on life.

My husband and I both have severe mental illnesses. We're functional; that is, we struggle daily, just privately, when we get home from work. Any child we had would have a fucked up brain, that's almost certain. I mean, hopefully my husband and I would be excellent parents - I'd like to believe we would be - but... Who knows how we'd *actually* do? And even if we *were* great parents, would it really even matter if we make a kid who's going to be depressed/suicidal regardless of their environment?

And what if they're not just mentally ill, but mentally or physically handicapped to the point that we have to give up our lives to care for them? I'm not about to give up my dreams and goals - *my whole life* \- to take care of someone.

I don't care if you think that those feelings will dissipate when I see the face of my *precious baby*. Why should I take that risk? I don't care if you think I'm selfish - in fact, in light of that, do you really want someone who is so selfish to care for another human??",28Jun2018,4
3,"I met the guy of my dreams seven months ago, he asked me to be his girlfriend and we've been together up until last week when he left me out of the blue. 
He made it clear he was autistic from the start I know it's on a spectrum and I would slowly learn where about he was on that but everyone has their stuff.
We had a good relationship, we loved each other and made one another happy. We took things easy meeting twice a week roughly it was a healthy pace as in the past I've rushed things-we were good.
He likes his alone time, doesn't need people and is happy in his own company. Yet he wanted me around, in the last few weeks we really had it good, spending time with me he said he'd never felt so comfortable with anyone else before. He said we were really getting it, settling into each other. He said he was happy. 
We had a disagreement last week as I'm leaving the country for three weeks and asked to spend more time with him he said of course he suggested three dates, one of which I was meeting his dad, I wanted more time with him, we got into a silly argument. It's a conversation we've had before where I push for more time together and he needs his space. Of course I tried to respect that and give it to him but it was hard sometimes, I missed him and on this one occasion as I was going away I thought it would be okay.
So Tuesday night I go over at his request to talk, I know it's coming soon as I see his face.
He ends it with me, his reasons- he doesn't want a relationship, not now with me and maybe not ever with anyone else.
He said he tried, he wanted it he wanted a relationship with me but he can't cope and doesn't want to be held accountable for someone else. He said he really thought it would of worked out with me if only it hadn't been for his autistic tendencies. 
Keep in mind prior to this he said he wanted to get married and have kids. We joked about it together playfully.
He said he is happier on his own.
So that's it, I have to just sit quietly while the man I wanted to spend my life with walks away from me. 
I know I have to respect his decision and in time accept it but I'm struggling right now.
We were happy and in love, this all happened so suddenly, I miss him and want him back. I can't help hoping in time he'll change his mind.
Any thoughts, expertise, advice or perspective on this would be lovely. I'm hoping to understand him more, if this is something people with autism go through, being happier alone I mean.
However please be kind I'm a bit fragile.

9,"Maybe I had more friends back then? Maybe I was just in a different mindset. I've tried sleeping with other girls but honestly I'm not really ready yet and it made me feel uncomfortable. I have a few good friends who spend time with me and ive tried to keep myself busy. 

I take time to treat MYSELF and take myself out on dates, and I've even been flirting with other girls and taking them out occasionally. I spend alot of time with the Bros too. Lots of drinking. I exercise. My sister lives around the corner from me and we talk everyday about life and how we feel. It's not like I'm not supported! Sex is a really important dynamic in my life and I usually have a high sex drive, but I just can't stomach the thought of taking advantage of someone who isn't enthusiastic about wanting me to take advantage of them. 

But God damn I'm just so alone. I can't stop thinking about how nice it felt to have a woman sleep next to me, or how much I need someone in my life who asks me about my day.

It's the little stuff that just makes me feel cared about. 

My ex was a really great girlfriend. She made me very complacent and content with maintaining the status quo of the relationship because she cared about me and gave me support. But I don't love her anymore. I think I've given that relationship too many chances and the same things keep happening. Maybe I'm the unreasonable one, but I wasn't happy. 

But now: it's like I'm stuck in this place and in this feeling where all I want is to feel cared for, yet Im not ready for a new relationship and i can't stomach the thought of having sex with a girl that I find to be uninteresting or uninterested.

I traded short term happiness for long term happiness and I'm feeling it for sure.

I feel very alone and I'm surrounded by friends and family. 

The kicker is: I'm sure that many of the people I interact with daily are feeling exactly the same... But it's totally unbearable. ",28Jun2018,1

11,"I understand people mean well, but everyone keeps commenting on my body. 

I was always really small until I was 17, when I put on 20kg thanks to birth control. I was still only 58 kg so not really big but I’m 5’3. I felt extremely uncomfortable and it caused my anxiety over clothing to become a lot worse. I couldn’t wear tight clothing and I felt like I was 100kg. But everyone told me I was more attractive. I did feel more attractive but physically I felt uncomfortable. 

Now I’ve lost weight again and I’m 48kg and I feel like myself. I feel comfortable and I can choose clothes to wear without crying most of the time. But everyone keeps assuming I have an eating disorder or I’m unhealthy. I was, I got really sick and stopped eating for a while. But I’m fine now. I eat too much probably but I’m just a small person. I eat at least two meals a day and chips and soft drink and popcorn. I’m not concerned about my disordered eating anymore. 

But people keep feeling the need to tell me how small I am or commenting on my eating. I’m fine now. I am probably just smaller because I quit smoking weed which means I don’t get the munchies and eat everything in my cupboard anymore, but I can’t tell people that obviously.

18,"Hey Reddit. Okay, this is my first actual post, and it’s probably going to be all over the place. I am a 22 year old female, and I have dated girls since I was 14. I’m having trouble having faith in myself, and finding it hard to know how to make myself happy. I feel like I know where it all stems from, and I’ll give you some background on it.

Well, for about 6 years I was with one single girl. I had cheated on her a couple times, as I didn’t really find her that attractive. Definitely not a valid excuse for cheating, as there isn’t one. I guess I stayed because it was easiest. I’ll get there. We broke up about 7 months ago, after I fell in love with one of my high school best friends. The only problem was, me and the ex were living together. We had been good for a while, and then when this old friend and I rekindled, I realized there were better things and better people for me. She was extremely sweet to me, as my ex wasn’t. She had also put her hands on me before, a couple times. She also had about 75 lbs on me, as I’m a very petite girl. Well, as I was hiding my love for someone else from her, I was bracing myself to leave. I stopped leading the other girl on, but knew she was what I wanted. 

One night me and my ex went to a friends house to drink, and of course, I texted the new girl. She never texted back, but it had showed she had read it. So, I double texted, as any drunk girl would. My ex noticed that I texted her again because she didn’t reply. She wasn’t stupid, and she picked up on what was going on. We were in the bathroom and she confronted it. She started wrestling me for my phone, and things got out of hand. We ended up fist fighting in the parking lot, after my friends boyfriend got us out of the bathroom. Lol. It’s kind of funny now but definitely wasn’t then. I’m not proud of fist fighting my significant other, but she wouldn’t stop hitting me.  I had bruises that you wouldn’t believe if I showed you. And like I said, she was much bigger than me. So I ended up busting her nose open and she had to go to the ER. She had broken my phone literally in half, and I sat there from about 1:30 am to sunrise just thinking about what I was going to do. All I could think about was how I was glad to finally be out of that. That’s all I’m gonna say about her. Bitch. 

Now, the new girl also went to college about 7 hours away. Yikes. But even in high school we were always very close. I felt kind of silly jumping into another relationship, especially a long distance one, but the one I was in had died out far far long ago. Anyway, I was sure I was ready to be with her.  I trusted her. 

Now, I am living in the same city as her for the summer, in between semesters. I also have an internship about 45 mins away in a major city, so it worked out. I very much enjoy her, it’s just that sometimes when we argue she wants to be left alone and idk how to take that. I freak out. I’m the type to always talk out, it’s how my parents raised me. Her mother is the type that is very manipulative, and would just sweep things that she didn’t want to deal with under the rug. Her mother does not approve, by the way. She doesn’t like that she’s ‘gay’ now. Oh yeah! I’m the first girl she’s ever been with :) forgot to mention that. It just sometimes seems like she’s either unaware of my sensitivity or chooses to ignore it because she isn’t the same way. I don’t know. She always needs me to just ‘give her time’ and I sit there and dwell on the issue and it gets worse. I can’t seem to fix it, and I feel like it’s jeopardizing our relationship. I feel like I act like a crazy person when we argue. 

I guess the main idea of all that background is, I don’t think I know how to be upset. And when I am upset, I definitely can’t deal with it. I’ll literally make myself act a fool just for the situation to be better. She doesn’t like to talk it out, and I feel like I push her and push her to when she just needs a moment. It’s hard for me to give her the time she needs because it just gets worse for me. But I just let it all build and I can’t seem to stop myself from acting out. Maybe I don’t know how to be alone? Or I’m not in tune with my actual feelings? Maybe I’m just an over thinker? Maybe we shouldn’t be together? Idk, I feel crazy again as I type it all out :) plz help. Thanks!!

First a judge has to be named.. and if that person even makes it to the Senate for confirmation, that process will take months..

Even under the best (or worst depending on your worldview) case scenario, the final confirmation vote in the Senate will not take place until after the election.. and then I bet some senators will find ways to delay that even more until the new senators are sworn in..

It all boils down to which party will have control of the Senate in January.. if the dems manage to gain the majority in the Senate, then I doubt anybody will be confirmed until after the 2020 elections.

So.. if this is a big concern, everybody needs to put down their phones, stop reeeeeeeeing, register themselves to vote and actually go and vote this coming November.

A prediction - the 2018 mid-terms will have the highest voter turnout (by percentage) in US history.. that is if this shit motivates people to actually vote instead of staying at home and whinging on the Internet.

26,"I just graduated high school. I'll be in college soon. I have almost nothing to look forward to this summer.

The second semester of high school I was constantly kept up at night at tortured by day at the seeming realities of zero true friends and the incoming full-speed train of college.

What stood out the most and still does to this day is the disappearance of my friend group.

Make no mistake, by junior year I considered myself fairly well-going and having no shortage of genuine people to count on.

Just by the beginning of that tiring semester I felt as if I had been quickly surrounded by people short-sighted, selfish, jealous, dramatic, and childish.

From my perspective (possibly flawed beyond my awareness):
My friend since I first moved here became a designer-addicted narcissist.
My friend in organization and gym buddy became jealous of me just having other people around and constantly relied on me to feed into anything he said and satiate his inflated ego.
My friend who I had caught in-school suspension for has seemingly degenerated in maturity and blames anyone but herself for her drama and boy problems.
My friend who I helped through a big break-up has repeatedly stated her dislike for selfish boys and abusive boyfriends yet she maintains contact with a guy who has repeatedly cheated on her, gotten her pregnant twice, and never ceases to lie and talk down to her.
My best friend for two years who I would even FaceTime every night constantly berates and lashes out at people when she isn't fake crying or complaining about her alleged unlucky life.

These are the closest people I have had i the past few years and yet I can't help but feel I have to push them away for my own health.

Please, honestly it keeps up at night to think I may be this lonely and that I may be a selfish self-righteous person beyond my own awareness. It's 3 a.m. while I right this and I can't help but pour out my feelings when I only meant to ask if people had been in a similar situation or for possible advice.

TL;DR -- I feel as if my closest friends are all but toxic people who do more harm than good if I kept them around. I don't know if I am being too harsh or unreasonably self-righteous. Please help. It's been on my mind for months now.",28Jun2018,1

28,"Here is a little story about the past year of my life.  It's a bit long but stick with it. Note (cause it becomes important later): I'm a middle aged gay male who can easily pass as straight and not really a loud and out gay guy. Just a guy who happens to be gay. 

In January of 2017 I had a great job working for a corrections facility as a Clinical Psychologist. Great pay, great hours, there were some ethical issues with the guards (technically “correctional officers”), some other ethical issues with medical employees – but over all a great job with amazing benefits, and the start of a decent career. I decided I wanted  to get ahead in life and rented the other room in my apartment to John, who was the cousin of the guy I was dating.  I didn't need the money, but the extra cash would help put a dent in the loan for the new car I had just bought. 

Things went fine for four months. John mostly stuck to himself and wasn't really a bother. He paid his rent mostly on time (a few days late – no biggie), cleaned up after himself, and much like me seemed to be an introvert. At the end of May he came home one day and asked if his brothers could crash at my place for the night. They had just arrived after an 8 hour car drive and didn't want to deal with a motel. I said they could stay for a night but that I had to be up early for work in the morning so, everyone needed to be quiet and respectful. The night went on with me going to bed early and getting up at 6 the next morning to go to work. When I got up, he and his brothers were both up. No big deal, though I though they might have been up all night. I went through my morning routine: made coffee, put it in my thermos, ironed the cloths I had forgotten to iron the night before, took a shower, and then went to work. 

At about 9 am, shortly after I finished my coffee, my stomach started getting all weird. Sorta like I ate something that didn't agree with me. Then I spiked a fever, and my heart started racing. I saw my only patient of the day and started working on the rest of my work so I could finish it early and head home. About an hour later I was called into my supervisors office. She accused me of being intoxicated at work. That's when things started clicking in my head. Stomach doing flip flops, mild fever/increased body heat, heart racing – I was on either MDMA or Meth. It didn't feel like MDMA, but it did feel like the one time I had tried Meth. I was pulled into an “officers” office and they demanded a drug test, which I refused because I knew at that point that it would come up positive for something, even if it wasn't Meth. I was arrested and thrown in jail. I was released the next morning with the recommended charges being: intoxicated in a prison, and selling meth to inmates.

I got home about an hour after being released. My front door was wide open. My apartment had been emptied of everything that could be carried out that might have been worth some money. I received a letter from work putting me on administrative leave. John was no where to be found. My boyfriend (Carl) was also MIA. Carl showed up that night and told me he saw me on the news and what I was being accused. He didn't have keys to my apartment so he says he didn't go there.  I went and retrieved my car from work and drove down south to see some friends. Carl went with me. While down south my debit card was declined. I checked my account and the 8k I had saved up was no longer in my account. Upon contacting my bank they said there was nothing they could do, it was all done with the appropriate account numbers needed to make ACH transfers – so it was clear that I authorized it. That's when I remembered that I had a set of checks in my desk. I hated using checks and the only reason I had them was in case there was an emergency. The checks had the routing and account number on them. So... my account was compromised and the bank said they wouldn't help. The police wouldn't help- I found out from a colleague that this particular police department keeps a list of those they wont bother to help. It's the bad person list. 

The friends I was seeing paid for a motel room for two nights. Then gave me the gas money to get back to my apartment so I can try and salvage what I could. Upon arriving home, I found my apartment destroyed. The toilet was broken, several windows broken, water left on flooding the place, holes in the walls. The couch that I had now also stolen. The dishes that were in the kitchen stolen, my cloths were gone. Even the light bulb in the fridge was taken. 

I hired a lawyer and found out that no charges were being pressed because there was no evidence. Apparently my refusal of the drug test put a huge kink in that part of whatever plan had been put in place by my enemies. Not only that, he found out that there was an informant that called my place of work and told them that I was intoxicated and was selling meth at work. And that they would find meth on me and in my car. Neither of which was true which became apparent after they searched me, my office, and my car. 

About a week after that I ended up in the hospital due to stress fractures in my foot and an infection in my leg that was immune to most antibiotics. I'm allergic to penicilin  and that was the only antibiotic that this infection was vulnerable to. A spent the week in the hospital getting an antibiotic that could kill me, massive doses of benedryl, and hoping that I wouldn't go into shock and die. I got out of the hospital and returned to my apartment only to find John and his friends using it as a flop house and selling drugs out of it. They had a stolen car hidden in my garage. There were used syringes lying in the open. And getting threatened with being shot or stabbed if I called the cops. I managed to kick them out with the help of a couple “friends” (people I met while stuck in the hospital). About two weeks later, one of them asked for a ride to his uncles house. I agreed to give him the ride, after all, he helped me get the cock roaches out of my apartment. 

Once we pulled up to his “uncles” house, he pulled a knife, pressed it to my throat and threatened to kill me and then Carl if I didn't give him my car. So, I handed him my car keys and walked away. I called the cops, who did nothing but take a report. My car was found a week later totally destroyed. 

I had no money, no friends in the area (about 300 miles away from where I grew up and where my group of friends lived), I was suicidal, and verging on homicidal. Finally work called me and asked me to come in for a meeting. I was fired for insubordination (refusing the drug test) and dereliction of duty (the work I couldn't finish that day). 

After three months of this hell, I could finally leave the area now that there was no hope of saving my job and I was no longer having to follow their demand that I be able to meet any time they demanded. It took another three weeks for me to arrange for someone to come get me with what little possessions I had left all my fucking books and my bed. 

Going through the facebook pages of the assholes who majorly destroyed my life, it's become apparent that I was targeted because I'm gay. Posts like “those fags deserve everything they get”, “My brother better not be a fag”, and “fucking queers” are all over their pages.  I've never been one to leverage my sexuality on someone. I've never played the gay card. Even when I thought I should. Even when it was pretty clear to me one of my professors was using it against me. It's taken me months to come to grips with the fact that the reason my job was sabotaged, I was robbed blind, I was car jacked, my apartment was destroyed was in fact because I'm gay. 

I'm broke, unemployed, depressed, anxious, not sure how I'm going to finish the licensing process for Psychology, some days suicidal, and very lonely. I don't know why I'm positing, I think it's mostly to get it out and in print. I guess as a type of narrative therapy for myself. 

TL:DR : Rented a room to someone who sabotaged my job, stole everything I owned, destroyed my apartment. Then I was carjacked and lost my job. Now, trying to rebuild.",28Jun2018,2
29,"I used to be in this Discord server where I had some good friends I used to hangout with. They had to serve in the army which naturally led me to be less active in the Discord server. One day my friend came out of the army as a vacation and I got to greet em. I saw a new face in the Discord server whom happened to be a Korean living in the US like me. I naturally became fond of her due to her umm careless, but really emotionally sensitive, personality while helping her out with English - Korean translation.

Recently, she seemed really depressed and I didn't really know how to help her out. I've been and still am currently feeling depressed from getting dumped by my first love several years ago.

Today, I accidentally (I actually mean accidentally) stumbled upon her post in this subreddit about her trying to overcome her depression caused by a seemingly really similar reason that caused my depression. Of course this post was a bit old. Eversince her breakdown, (Which I assume happened a while ago based on her post) she seems like she's really getting better and that gave me a good smile.

Maybe her recent depression was caused by her randomly remembering the past. I really feel bad as if it was me actually experiencing the troubles she went through. Maybe me being an emotionally dull dude really helped me in some way to not suffer that as bad as she did.

It really feels like I'm peeking into her private diary (maybe that makes me a pervert), but I'm pretty glad that I got to know her other side which I did not know by just hanging out.

I'll be glad if I can get advices on how to help this friend out. Like should I tell her that I saw her reddit post? Should I share my experience of depression? Should I just be like a close friend and help her just keep that PMA (Positive mental attitude)?

I actually don't know if I like her or whether it's just me seeing myself portrayed on her. I swore to only love my ex since she was and still is the dearest one for me. It's like a pointless self-determination I made back then which I still try to keep, but I want to keep it going.

Oh well. She'll probably not see this post since her last activity was from quite a long back. Damn maybe I am a pervert. I hope not...",28Jun2018,4

31,"Thanks to public figures like Bill Gates and Hillary Clinton, who have both promoted male circumcision as a ""health benefit"" The public perception has been distorted, trivializing cutting babies genitals. 

Too bad mass generations of genital cutting have conditioned most males into thinking that living in a society that cuts off half the skin on your dick is normal. 

I feel like losing my mind when Im told Im supposed to be happy about my dick being sliced up without my consent. There is nothing healthy about literally removing healthy tissue, which people somehow ignore the unethical and disgusting nature of the practice. 

Ive had to grieve the permanent loss of sensation. Ive watched my sexual life become damaged because I only feel sensation on the scar line. This isnt fucking normal people okay. How the fuck can people justify doing this to baby boys. I feel so sickened to live in such a dumb, foolish, and ignorant society that continues to blindly go on with this practice for no other reason than that its tradition and its comfortable. Slice the foreskin away because we're just used to doing that

Of course Im going to get a lot of people who will say that I should just get over it its a piece of skin. Its not just a piece of skin, it contains the most sensitive parts of the penis and has over 16 functions something americans have no clue about and like I said all they know about the foreskin is that theirs is gone.

32,"Sorry guys, I just gotta get some of my thoughts in text and vent a bit.

I’m just messing up in life. I’m failing classes, I’m fat, and I’m just not happy with life. I’m working really hard to undo it and I’m seeing progress. But still.

I just feel so empty and sad all the time. Anger is what motivates me, I only work so that I can be better than other people and prove a point. It makes me wanna Play video games or sleep all day to escape. Which incidentally makes my life worse.

I feel like I’m just building a facade when I try to change myself. I’m not being me at all, I’m just changing everything I can. Yet at the same time, I don’t even wanna be me, if you know what I mean. I never talk about this with my family or friends cause I don’t wanna show weakness. It seems like everyone else was just given everything and has it figured out. I just smile and act like it’s all okay.

40,"When I was growing up I moved around a lot, new houses in new towns meant new schools. All in all from birth to now (I'm in university now) I'd say I've attended 9 different institutes of education. Where I'm from (England) it's normal to only go the 2 or sometimes 3. This means that I've never had a base or a solid platform to launch off, I've never had consistency. One stage of my life, I went to a private school. This was during a period of my life where my parent's (mainly my mum) was trying to ""better herself"" and go up in the world, that's fine but the result of it was having to pretend to be posh and well to do and rich, which we certainly were not. On top of that I had to compete with all the private school people with their mansions and 3 month holidays abroad while I had to have a run down 3 bed ex-council house and have long weekend holidays in a caravan a few miles away. (The Brits of this sub will feel me here.)

I got new friend groups every few years so I never had a best friend of life long buddy. With every school and town I'd do the whole ""new me"" thing and sort of be somebody else, somebody new. I'm over the private school thing now, but I wish I'd had a normal life, stayed in the same house from birth, maybe moved once but in the same town kinda, done the standard school thing and had never been pressured to be something I'm not.

On top of this, growing up I had strict parents who just wouldn't let me be myself, they were restrictive and controlling so I was never allowed to rebel or be individual or even decide what I wanted to do at school etc. I never had a ""phase"", I never experimented, I never did all the typical teenage things. I have younger people in my family who I had to look after, my mum got nearly deathly ill at one point so I had to grow up really fast. Really, I never had the attention, I was expected to fit in with whatever was going on and stay by the wayside. I lived in pigeon holes basically.

All this has led me to not having a clear sense of self. I know what I like and what I'm passionate about, I have a rough idea of what I want my life to be like when I move out and have graduated university etc, I have my morals and all that. But it's had an effect on me. I'm getting better now, but I have a tendency to attention seek and approval seek. It's made me a bit of a people-pleaser and very insecure. Basically, I feel like my life has been one big long identity crisis. It's very hard to explain, but I hope you understand what I'm saying. 

I suppose I'm not really looking for advice because the damage has been done now (although if you have advise, please share as it might help others). I'm just wondering if anyone else feels the same, or has had a similar life pattern and how it affected them. Let me know your thoughts on this as I'm interested as to whether this is common and how other people deal with it. Thanks.",28Jun2018,1

I do not know where else to speak about it, reddit always brings me a lot of joy in my life and I want to share my frustration and anxiety with you all.

So, I am from a 3rd World Country located in Central America called Honduras, it is a beautiful country but with high levels of insecurity and low levels of education. I love it despite everything, specially my big family.

Here, my options on a bachelors degree at university are limited, I was studying Electronics but realized I hate engineering despite being kinda good at it. What I really like is languages and art, specially movies and animation. But, I can not study what I want here for various reasons, mainly because there are no degrees for anything of that here.

So, I have been looking for any options in other countries. Japan is my first choice because I love their media and culture. Also, I have been studying Japanese since november 2016, I love it and is one of the few times I feel passionate about studying. So I applied to the MEXT scholarships.

I passed the exams and made it to the interview, which I thought came out great but they just told me 2 days ago I did not passed. 

I feel really depressed and frustrated because I gave my all for it and even had to quit my job to go to the interview. Also, **I really don't know what to do with my life now.** I have been looking for other scholarships for other countries but it is not as easy as it sounds.

48,"I've dated a girl for the past two months and everything was going perfectly. She suffers from depression and her previous longtime boyfriend died around 1.5 years ago, after which I met her at some point. I took everything as slow as possible, making sure she felt comfortable every step of the way. I put in so much effort and she appreciated it so much and was so sweet to me. We had so many inside jokes and personal moments.

I had several chances to kiss her but shied away from it. I didn't want to rush things. Last night, I finally went for it. She told me, ""before you do this, I want you to know that I still feel empty inside. I don't know if I can fall in love anymore.""

I didn't kiss her. We talked today. She is not over him. She does not want me to keep my hopes up if she can't beat her depression.

I'm feeling so many things. I'm feeling loss and sadness and disappointment, but not anger or spite. It didn't work out because of her past experience, not because we couldn't get along. I'm not blaming myself or her for anything.

54,"Preface: This was posted in r/sports because, as most people are aware, Germany had been eliminated from the World Cup and I had texted my friend who is an *avid* Germany fan, “What hurt worse, getting shot in the hand, or Germany?” To which he of course replied, “Germany, easily”. And to clarify, I know making fun of  “small penis size” is in bad taste and can really upset people as it’s a physical attribute that you have no control over, but clearly I wasn’t implying men with small penises shoot people at random. The implication was that he had a small penis because he was a coward and was overcompensating for his insecurities by shooting and almost killing my friend simply because of a road rage incident my friend *didn’t even know he caused.* It was a poor way to emasculate someone, but then again, he shot at and could’ve killed my fucking friend. So here’s my post:

As I don’t have his explicit permission to recount this story, I will be using pseudonyms to mask identities. I will say though that he is one of the nicest coolest dudes I’ve ever met and he’s been a close friend for a decade now. I’m sure he wouldn’t care at all about me telling the tale, so here goes:

It was a mundane Wednesday, my dudes. The sun drenched town of Whitepeople, Potstate calmly progressed into a hot, almost sweltering, afternoon. Subarus lined the local highway and Prii clogged the passing lane traffic. All was normal. All was well.

Bob was a pleasant man. His early thirties had been good to him and he had recently started a financial career, making well more than his previous land surveying job. The fear of getting fatally attacked by a rouge mountain lion or agitated rattlesnake was long gone and replaced by the inevitable carpal tunnel syndrome that plagued his peers. However, in an obvious foreshadowing, carpal tunnel would be a nonissue.

The quiescent county of Uppermiddleclass supplied little in fear or uncertainty. Whitepeople in particular was a fairly tame and well-to-do town with a low crime rate and average household income of $90,000. By no means would someone be on edge on a hump day afternoon. So imagine Bobs shock when three loud pops rang out at a stoplight.

As he cruised down the local highway, Bob’s 1999  Gold Honda CR-V came to a full stop, one turn from a toll road. Prior to that, he peacefully passed the vehicle to his right in an attempt to make the next exit, southbound. Unbeknownst to him, the truck to his left was also trying to make his way over to the exit. But rather than being a sane, lawful citizen and making his way behind Bob’s quaint crossover, he took Bob’s maneuver as an affront to his very manhood. Bob’s nonchalant acceleration to pass the car to his right was undoubtedly a foul insult to the wife, mother, and sister of the man in the truck. Bob had not only declared the Truckman to be the unwanted child of a disease ridden prostitute, but he had also blatantly mocked the unimpressive size of his phallus!

This enraged Truckman. He saw red to the point where he could relate to persons suffering from tritanopia. So he shot. Three times. At the moment, Bob was holding a vaporizer. The sounds, shock, and impending pain led him to believe it had exploded. In a moment of clarity, Bob remembered a hospital was less than a mile away and he immediately made his way there. Moments after he got there, he was met by a sounder of police officers.

While lying in the hospital bed, Bob was informed that he had been shot twice, both in the left hand. After a lengthy surgery and 7 pins, he would be okay. He has a good sense of humor about it, but physical therapy would be a heinous bitch. Also, after having bought an 1/8 of legal marijuana, local cops were insistent that this was a grow operant getting his comeuppance. And it was an obvious motive because, as we all know, most grow operators and bud tenders carry 3.5 grams of marked product on their person at all times. You know, because of science.

As we reach the conclusion of our story, Bob is on his way to making a full recovery. Truckman has not yet been aprehended, but his motives were just, so I’m sure he’s comfortable in his actions and will not turn himself in. The calm county of Middleupperclass is now more cautious as to who they casually pass on the busy main road. Whitepeople, PT is still a peaceful town and we hope it remains that way. But please be warned: if a man in a large truck with a small, possibly microscopic, penis tries to pass you - go ahead and let him. He’s undoubtedly ashamed of his cowardice and that may lead to a pathetic act of violence with a deadly weapon. Stay safe, friends.",28Jun2018,0

57,"A few people have told me I'm asexual. I'm not against the possibility, but it's more than likely not for me given that I generally like women (like more than friends tee hee). I've up to this point always identified as a straight man (23 if you need to know that too).

I am apathetic to dating. I'm not against it. I wouldn't mind it I don't think if I found myself in a relationship with someone I find attractive and fun to be with. But, I don't feel the urge to go up and chat up a girl or ask one on a date. I never really did. I can see someone I think is attractive, but it doesn't feel right for me to go up to them and do the song and dance guys do to get things started. You know, guys accosting some girl and asking them ""How you doin?"" with a devilish grin (I understand there's more tact to it than that, just an example). I'm not a niceguy or anything like that, but I don't think I could act like that and honestly enjoy it. I'd feel like a slick used-car salesman. I'm not a social butterfly, nor social larvae for that matter. There's nothing wrong with people doing small-talk, but it's something I just never want to do. I wouldn't know how to if I tried, or if I would enjoy it. And I'm fine with not knowing.

That's sort of the problem though: I'm a 23 year old man. I'm not girl-crazy, or worried about being a virgin. Sex or being in a relationship sounds fun and all, but I don't prioritize it all and don't really want to put in the effort to develop the skills you need to get them. It bothers me more that I'm not bothered. It's weird when there's a guy that's not into playing the field. My male friends take this seriously. Dating matters to them a lot: they get upset at rejection and they're ready to go back for more. I could stay in and read Berserk. I value enjoying my hobbies more than doing this thing normal people typically do.

TL;DR Don't wanna date. Don't feel the need to put in the effort.

So what's wrong with me? Am I just an asexual who doesn't know it? Or am I a just a permanent virgin loser that doesn't know what he's talking about?

Also not a MGTOW or neckbeard anything like that (I trim my neckline everyday). I can't stress that enough because I've already been accused of that which is a lil insulting.

Last year I was a 21 year old, glasses-wearing geek who was a senior in college with nearly a 4.0 GPA. And I'm still (blush) admittedly a virgin. I'm only about 5'7, a ""studies-while-eating Doritos"" belly on an otherwise normal frame.

I told my friend Hannah about how I like to wake up very early on some days and head to the local nature preserve before class. I'm always alone, and it's beautiful.

She told me that her and her boyfriend used to go, and sometimes, she would strip to the nude.

My eyes bulged. She giggled and said it was not sexual at all. It allowed her to be ""one with nature"".

She said ""You should try it sometime, if you ever got the balls. Literally haha"".

Yeah right. I never even take my shirt off at the beach.

Then, one Tuesday morning at 6:30 am on a bright, sunny, only slightly brisk early Spring Tuesday morning...I got the itch.

I don't EVER do anything out of character. Why not just try it out? Nobody will ever know.

I actually undressed. I took off my heavy boots and long socks. My sweater. My pants. My undershirt.

There I was, shivering (it wasn't THAT cold, just a tad chilly, but the nerves got to me) in nothing but my light blue boxers.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and slid them down and kicked them off into the pile.

Now, clad in only my glasses and as bare as a newborn baby, I cupped my package with my hands, and I timidly walked towards the lake, about 50 yards from where I left my clothes, and I looked up at the gorgeous view.

The trees. The mountains. The beautiful, clear, blue lake.

Without even thinking, I placed my hands at my sides.

And there I was. Martin the virgin geek.

Naked.

Buck naked, in fact.

More naked than the trees, which were ""clothed"" in leaves.

More naked than Adam in the Garden of Eden, who at least had a fig leaf.

I was exposed. Not just physically, but exposed to new excitement and beauty.

Inspired, I even walked around the entire lake, as naked as the day I was born.

My round, bare belly shaking. My white-as-a-ghost ""bubble butt"" that Hannah would also make me blush over that she said I was always ""hiding"" under my nerdy khakis jiggling behind me. And my small package (hey, it's a throwaway!) bobbing in the brisk air.

I walked around the entire lake.

The crisp breeze occasionally startling me by caressing my bare butt. The tickle of a few flowers on my belly and package as I walked. The feel of the fresh grass through my bare feet as I walked.

Standing there, basking in the view, it was then that I heard it.

""Oh my God, you RUINED my shot!!!""

It was a woman. About 43 years old. Pretty, with a slight hard-to-pinpoint foreign accent.

""I've been planning this since 4:00 am, and this nude boy stumbles in and ruins it.""

She had a GIGANTIC, expensive, HD camera.

She then said ""Or...did he?"" And then started taking photos again. Of me!!!

""Beautiful, simply beautiful.""

I stood there frozen in shock, eyes wide, mouth open, as naked as a newborn baby with my hands at my sides in the bright sunshine for about 5 full seconds.

Then in a panic, I cupped my package with my hands and I ran behind a tree as she giggled and kept snapping photos of the scenery.

I poked my head out from behind the large tree, hiding my vulnerable, naked body behind it, with the now colder breeze attacking my bald, defenseless white buttcheeks behind me.

""You can't take those pictures!""

She said ""I sure can, sweetie. We're out in a public space. Nobody forced you to go traipsing around in your birthday suit.""

I replied: ""You can't share those photos!!""

She said ""Relax, and don't be so embarrassed. I've seen many men in the nude over the years. I'm no virgin here.""

That made me blush beat red.

She said ""For ruining my carefully planned shoot, I'm going to use these photos to create a painting.""

As I spoke up, I felt my naked, white butt-cheeks jiggling as I was shaking in panic and anger.

I said: ""A painting?! Of what?"" as I clung desperately to the tree shielding my body from her gaze.

She smirked. ""A painting showcasing true bravery and vulnerability.""

I said ""I'm no model for a painting.""

She replied: ""Oh, but you are, nude boy. It's one thing for some confident, viking man to walk around here. You're not one of those types, with some big, silly penis flopping around to show off.""

I subconsciously placed a single hand over my package, even from behind the tree.

She said: ""But you. You're the true picture of vulnerability. Your lily-white skin. Your adorable chubby belly. A hint of a bosom on you, even with hard nipples in the cool air.""

She giggled. And I subconsciously used my other hand to hide my nipples like a damsel in distress.

""And your little penis exposed for the world to see. Standing fearlessly, without cover, in the open. Clothed by nothing but your smattering of body hair, and a slight, endearing pink blush across your cheeks. I'm going to paint you.""

My ""pink"" blush turning RED as I cried: ""But you can't!!""

She said ""I can, and I will. Google me."" She gave me her name.

""Your bare body will be in my gallery in a few months.""

Defeated, I said ""Well I'm going back around the lake, the least you can do is give my dignity and avert your eyes.""

She said ""I'll do no such thing. I have more photos to take. Now go run along, naked boy. Get that cute tushie running around the lake and get dressed, it's getting cold.""

As I ran around the entire lake, with absolutely no cover, feeling my bubble butt literally shaking behind me, I turned to see her unflinchingly smirking and staring at me. And even snapping a few more final photos.

A few months later, I did Google her, and sure enough, there I was.

A sight that a girl had never seen before, my naked body. It was expertly painted I must say, with unfortunately exquisite detail. A lush greenery set against beautiful mountains, with my blushing, eyes wide, mouth open, naked spectacle, arms at my sides, standing in front. My small penis and balls prominently displayed right in front.

With 2,000 favorites on her website. She displayed it in a gallery. Somebody bought it for $5,600.

There was even a second painting. My round, plump bare ass jogging as I ran retreating to my clothes.",28Jun2018,3
71,"I lost my Mom, Frances, this past February 2018. Coming up this Saturday, it would've been my parent's 62nd Wedding anniversary. I'd like to make this special for my Dad somehow so he doesn't feel like he's so alone. Since my mom passed away, I've been trying my best to keep my Dad company as much as possible. With just me and my older brother, I'm 46, my brother is 61, my nephew and my own son...there's not much of our family left. Today, I was visiting with my Dad which I usually do during the week for lunch when I'm not at work, he said to me that my Mom got another solicitation from some organization wanting her to take out burial insurance. He said, ""Frances doesn't need that now."" I told him to stop ripping these things up and throwing them in the garbage, and instead to give me the mail, and I'll send it back or contact these companies to stop sending this stuff. He then said, and this is why I'm writing this post today, that if it weren't for that sort of mail, that he wouldn't be getting much mail, and he doesn't get mail that much anymore. It sort of broke my heart a bit. As a redditor, I've seen this community do lots of amazing things with making people feel appreciated and recognized, and I thought why not appeal to the good people out there to surprise my Dad with some random mail that would help him get through his grief for losing my mother. Anyone that wants to write to my Dad, James, and let him know that he's still part of the world. PM Me and I'll send the address and info. ",28Jun2018,17
72,"When I was younger, I always looked at people my age and thought they were so grown up and knew exactly what they were doing all the time (I'm 26). But now that I'm older, it seems like so many people, including myself, don't really feel like adults or know what they're doing most of the time haha. Not in a bad way, just in a way that makes you realize becoming an adult wasn't as monumentally life-changing as I always thought it would be when I was a kid. It was just a transition where I do feel more mature I guess, but I still feel like I'm constantly just figuring out/guessing how to function. 

Is there ever an age where you actually start feeling like an adult, or is it always just an illusion that people a decade or so older than you have it all figured out? When I'm 60, will I still be going around laughing about how it's so weird that I'm 60 because I don't feel like it at all? 

Or is there an age where you actually mentally feel like you're the age you should be? I know I'm still young and have a lot more growing and changing to do, just curious because I think about this a lot! ",28Jun2018,3
73,"A couple of years ago, I decided to go back to school and finish my degree after years of working. I’m 31, and as much as I want to work while I go to school, I’ve had a lot of serious health problems come up that I didn’t have when I was younger. These health issues also limit what I can do for fun. 

So I’m feeling quite stuck, being in college at 31 and unable to work a job during. I’m also single, so almost all hopes of relating to others my age are hard to come by. I can’t accelerate my education, because universities set the schedule, and that’s that. Relating to people much younger than me is often difficult because there’s often a stark maturity difference. 

I just feel like a loser, I guess. There’s nothing I can do to change my situation before I graduate, because non-self supporting jobs that I’m qualified for are no longer things my health allow me to do (physical jobs). And I don’t feel right trying to date when I’m on a shoestring budget. 

I feel very alone in this situation. I just can’t relate to people anymore, and nothing interests me. Maybe I’m depressed, but I needed to vent. ",28Jun2018,2

75,"One of my friends is a news reporter and wrote a story about the Annapolis shooting. I don’t use Facebook much so I’m not very acclimated to the culture of how people should or are expected to behave on there. In fact I’ve only had my Facebook account for a month or two. I liked her post out of respect for the terribly tragic event. I wasn’t aware of what type of impression it would give off. 

My friend called me an hour later and asked why I liked it. She was worried and concerned because I’ve rwcently been having conversations with her about my mental health and how I’ve been feeling depressed. She said that, in light of our recent conversations, she wanted to know why I liked the post. I apologized and said it was just out of respect for the writing and message and had no idea it would give off that impression. I unliked it.

Will I face trouble for this?",28Jun2018,1

79,"Today has been a really emotionally taxing day. I’m just mentally exhausted and physically drained, and I keep feeling like I’m on the verge of tears despite generally not being a crier. Usually on days like today, seeing my dog lose his mind with glee when I enter the door just melts all my stress away. He was such a sweetheart and always cheered me up.

Last March I had to put my dog down. Someone poisoned him with antifreeze. He was only 7 years old, and so full of life - neither of us were ready. I’m not over it and I think about him every day. Today has just been particularly hard, and I miss him more than ever.

Everyone who has a good pup like mine, give them an extra squeeze for me. I love seeing dogs loved and happy, so spoil them and give them the best life you can. ",28Jun2018,1
