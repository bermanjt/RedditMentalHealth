0,"I honestly don’t know where to begin. I’ve been in and out of therapy(depression, aggression, abandonment issues, suicidal thoughts) throughout high school to college. I was a class clown that managed to get Bs. Went to college and suffered from social anxiety. I talked to one girl and one boy during my first semester. My drinking increased and I checked myself into a counselor on campus.  That was 12 years ago. 

My last therapy session was in 2012 for depression because of a breakup. Then in 2014 I dated that same girl. She ended up ghosting me in 2016 because of an abortion. She wanted it done, whereas I didn’t but I never told her.  I didn’t have a good job at the time and I was seeking better employment.  I didn’t support her and the decision like I said I would. So I guess I can see why she left along with her having a better job and ambition. 

I landed the job I have now two months after I last saw her in March 2016. However, I didn’t let this breakup give me depression like the breakup in 2012. I lost weight, I had a job, I changed my mindset. I was motivated to be a new person. 

April 2018 a slow depressive episode started creeping in. I started self medicating with psychedelic drugs and alcohol. June 2nd, 2018, under the influence of lsd I broke down crying to my best friend and unloaded everything I’ve been holding in. Suicide being the main topic of discussion. We talked and talked and talked. That weekend ended and I felt relieved to have voiced such an overwhelming feeling. I thought I just had an drug induced existential crisis. 

That’s when Anthony Bourdain’s suicide happened, June 8, 2018. And I fell into a void. I wasn’t the hugest fan like many of his fans. But the idea that a man in such a prominent position and prestige and wealth killed himself bothered me. 

The idea that I struggled with is if he sought therapy and had the whole world at his disposal and still killed himself, then perhaps one day I will fall victim to it too. He had better outlets to rid his demons than I will ever have. And he still committed suicide. Since then, suicide is all I’ve been thinking of. 

I’ve plateaued at work. It’s not exciting. It’s a dread. I hate going to work. I’m no longer growing. I’m not where I want to be. Getting a new job will result in a pay cut. I’m searching for other employment in something I want to do but my impatience is driving me crazy. 

My will power is shit. And I hate it. My weak will drives me insane. It makes me hate myself. 



But. Throughout all this feeling like shit. My dog is my saving grace. And I’ve at least left messages on therapists’ voicemails today (7/9/18). 


I don’t know what possessed me to write this and dump this on any curious reader. Thank you.

2,"Six years of having no social media (with the exception of snapchat and being a long time Reddit lurker) has left me feeling super alone and isolated from the social consciousness of both my community and the world at large.. it’s honestly really hard. As a kid, I spent most of my time on my desktop at home, watching music videos, playing games, dicking around in MS paint, and just googling anything I could think of. 

But when I was about 14 I started seeing a psychiatrist who put me on a heavy medication regimen that quickly developed into a really serious drug problem. I deleted my Facebook and spent most of high school ignoring others (I never had an Instagram). After being in and out of hospitals and in-patient programs I found myself completely disconnected from everyone I knew. I eventually dropped out and got a job and then another and then another. 

Despite all this I’ve always managed to make some incredible friends. There are so many amazing people in my life I wish I kept in contact with that aren’t in my life anymore but I’m scared they’ve all moved on or forgotten about me. I struggle with clinical depression on top of being in school and working a full time job which made/makes it really hard to maintain the connections I created. It makes me really upset knowing that I have no passive way to stay in contact with the people I used to know. 

I live a really fulfilling life and I always believed that social media was self-indulgent and kind of stupid. I’m also really glad that my horrible teen years weren’t publicly documented for the world to see. But I’ve ultimately realized that if I had just gotten over myself and kept my fucking Facebook that maybe this horrible feeling of missing out would be one less thing I have to stress myself out over. 

Now I’m 20 years old and I’m totally and utterly fucking lost. I really regret not having any legitimate social media presence and I don’t know where to start? I’ve tried to make an Instagram but every time I go to add someone I get so anxious I’ll be judged or forgotten or just thought of as weird and I end up deleting it. What if they don’t like my content? What if they realize that I’m a burnout loser who hasn’t left their hometown and maybe I should have just left them with the memories they had of me? Nobody I know personally has this problem and I’m breaking through my “social media anxiety” to post this and ask what anyone thinks I should do? 

Also hey thanks for reading my sad sad first social media post in going on six years! I debated posting this on r/decidingtobebetter or r/depression_help or r/assistance but hey I’m not gonna beat myself up over it. ",10Jul2018,1
3,"God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things that I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

You finally called today.  You claimed to me that you've been clean since you left residential treatment last week. I hope for our children's sake that's true, but you went AWOL for 5 days straight the moment you got out, admitted to me today that you missed testing for CPS this past Thursday, and admitted not only that you've been staying with a man who was ~~your~~ our dealer (I don't believe for a minute that hes staying clean like you claimed), but that you're leaving me for him.  

Sure, I fought it when you told me a couple weeks ago you wanted to separate.  I love you, and always will because you're the mother of my children.  You gave me the greatest gift in them.  And I wish you had been willing to hold up your promise to work on us because our children deserved for us to at least TRY.  Sadly today you told me that wasn't going to happen.

And its actually really funny because you're the one who said today on the phone that while you were in residential that you came to realize that you couldn't change me.  And I said you're right, but that I could change myself.  The irony of this is that I've been trying to change you too. To get you to quit. To get you to get back on the clean and sober path. But I can't change you any more than you can change me.  The difference is that I'm willing to change myself, but you've shown me that you're not.

So get ready for a really big change.  I'm no longer fighting for you.  I'm no longer in your corner.  I'm no longer going to let you manipulate me.  I'm no longer going to let you DRAG ME DOWN.  

I DESERVE BETTER THAN YOU.  OUR CHILDREN DESERVE BETTER FROM BOTH OF US.  I've always believed that everything happens for a reason, and you pulling this stunt this past week has granted me the wisdom that I'd been ignoring for far too long.

I cannot change you, but I can change me.  I'm working my recovery. I'm going to my classes.  I'm making it to my groups. And I'm going to keep on keeping on.

I love you, but only you can change you.",10Jul2018,2

Usually when they are this age we put them in the kennel at night time so we can try to protect them, but with this newest group the whole idea slipped our minds. We figured they were with their parents and they would protect them. We started off with 5 and are down to only one now. I essentially killed kittens by not taking better care of them.",10Jul2018,0
7,"I've thought about typing this out for far too long. Isn't that so sad? It took me months to urge up the motivation and courage, to type a fucking post on Reddit. Now, this post is going to be about as conceited as it gets. Trust me, I don't blame you if you stop reading, I would do the same. If I was scrolling through Reddit and saw some guy talking about his problems, I wouldn't be too interested. Yet, on the other hand I am just a self-centered asshole so what do I know. This is going to be typed as a stream of consciousness type thing, so sorry if it flows horribly. It really is so easy to hide. Depression that is. I've been depressed for seemingly forever. I've always really thought I am an inadequate asshole, with no real purpose. It really truly is awful to wake up and immediately want to dive back into the lovely depths of darkness that is sleep. Its so fucking glaring the lack of motivation I have. This is going to sound super conceited and gauche, but I could do so much better in so many areas. To preface I'm 16 (almost 17) and about to enter my senior year of high school. I do take numerous AP and honors level courses but my god is my lack of effort glaring. My GPA is like a 3.6, but like I barely try. My history teacher this year even talked to me about it , and essentially said that I probably wouldn't pass the AP test and that its really obvious I only try hard enough to get a B. Now, she might sound like the bad guy here, but I really appreciated that. It was one of the few times recently I've felt like someone who wasn't family really cared about me. I punch below my weight so much, it pains me. I took the SAT and got a 1310 without even studying. My guidance councilor was fucking in shock, because I come across as a dumbass. On one hand man, I really hate my life at the moment. I hate the fact that I could easily do much better in school. I hate the fact that I have no friends. I hate the fact that one of the things I love I am fucking awful at. Mainly, I hate the fact that I hate my life. I mean in reality I have it fucking made. Food always on the table. Roof over my head. I working mind, good health, and a mother and father that really love and care about me. In many aspects I really do love life. I love the ocean breeze that runs across your hair when walking the beach at night. My god that sentence was so forced. I love basketball with all my heart. I could talk for hours about that fucking sport in which I am fucking awful at. I love the idea of relationships. To find a partner that you truly love. Someone you could look into their eyes for a million lifetimes with the same passion as you did when you saw them the first time. Not even relationships in a sexual sense, a girlfriend for instance, friendships as well. What I wouldn't give to have real friends. People that love and care about me. People that ask me to do things, that legitimately want to spend time with me. A groupchat that buzzes all day. A group that you spend most of your time with, and y'all get really close, like brothers and sisters. I have maybe 4 people I would call friends. And even those people it seems like I am a burden upon. They never ask me to hangout. They never text or call just to say whats up. I don't blame them, I fucking hate me too man. There is this one girl. I don't want anything but to be friends with her. When we first started talking she seemed to take an interest in me, ya know to become friends. It was an amazing feeling to actually have someone that you feel likes you as well. I've never really felt that. We talked about things that I wouldn't talk about with my other friends, like Eric Andre for instance. She was so eager to make plans to hangout. But due to me just being a fucktard I fucked that relationship up. She gave off an aura of trust, so I talked to her about these things. About my dreams, desires, depression, and debilitating anxiety. She seemed like she cared. I mean we still hangout and stuff but she seems like she does it out of pure pity. The TV show, That 70's Show, was like insane to me. This concept that you could have a group that you love and hangout with all the time, was and is so foreign to me. Man, I just really want... that. I want to be loved and give love. I want people that want to spend time with me. My friends roast me over my sexual life as well. Simply due to the fact that it is nonexistent. I am about to turn 17 years old, and I haven't even kissed a girl. How funny is that? I mean I am a literal laughing stock. My social, or more generally just constant anxiety kills any semblance at making relationships. I could easily be Steve Carell in the 40 Year Virgin, except the real life version. Maybe, I am just delusional. Maybe, my friends do care about me. I mean I have a lot of like semi friends. Like people I talk to in school and the like and am cool with. But noone who would really want to spend time with me. Music and Basketball are like my two main interests. I think in rhymes and rhythm. I love rap music almost to a fault. I think of rhymes in my head 24/7. The worst part about my mind state at the moment is its longevity. I used to be able to suppress my depression. Locking it away in a cage at the back of my mind. But that motherfucker has broken free and has come looking for vengeance. It is damn near constant. It is the worst at night. There have been nights where I can't sleep because my mind is racing. The worst part is I have noone I can talk to this about. My anxiety is just too awful to allow it. The only person prior to this post, who knows even a fraction of what I am going through is that girl I talked about earlier. I am just a fucking social outcast, and unlike Big Boi and Andre 3000 I can't make incredible music. Man it is so pathetic that I have to turn to Reddit to talk about my problems. Why should y'all give a fuck? I am noone to you, you will never meet me in real life, you will never talk to me. Now, I know what your thinking. ""This motherfucker damn near about to kill himself."" Now, while I think about that every damn day, I couldn't, at least not right now. I think constantly that if I killed myself, no one would really care. But, I still have a tiny, microscopic semblance of hope that keeps me going. But the main reason is that my parents really do care about me, and it would be super selfish to kill myself seeing how much they love me. I don't know man. I just don't have any of the answers. I am so afraid to go to college because of all this. What if my depression and anxiety take hold? I won't have my usual outlet of playing basketball. What if I am a failure in life? What if I never find love? What if I never make any friends and am forced to live alone, trapped in my own mind? It is a scary world out there. Well, anyone who stuck around, thanks for reading, I've already overstayed my welcome. Sorry again for the rambling nature of this post. Probably should've used an alt but oh well.

After that, I had a harsh reality where I had to stay with my SP500 job instead of this amazing startup (it was called a software company back then) opportunity where I could have had my own business.  


  
All of my friends know that she cheated on me. She didn't even have a good reason. She claimed that she was date raped in a scenario she concocted - after she left her facebook logged in, I found she had invited the guy over for her to cook dinner for him - he declined. She later ""Met him randomly at a bar""  and was supposedly ""date raped"" then. However I found this out to be all bullshit after I confronted this prick.  


She has taken over my friend group completely and trust me, there is little I can do. These are people I have known for 6-7 years.

13,"I'm sorry for the odd title, but I'm both sleepy and not in a place where I can grab my journal and write. 

My SO is absolutely, 100% incredible. I've never had such an amazing, supportive, doing partner, who is also strong, and confident, and full of passion for so many things, and successful! He's everything I've always wanted and thought I could never get and never deserved. I'm so very thankful and lucky. 

The most amazing part? He tells me daily that I have it wrong - he's the luck one. He tells me how grateful he is for me, how special I make him feel, and beautiful I am, how he's amazed by me. And for the most mundane things, too!

And we've been together for going on 3 years now, and friends for a year longer than that. 

Anyway... His ex. His ex was a chivette. A 5'10"" bombshell. We had mutual friends before we met, and I heard about how hot she was before ever even meeting him. 

Anyway, so they broke up a bit after my ex and I broke up. Me and SO lost touch a few months after these relationships ended and did our own thing for a while, until we somehow moved close to each other without knowing it. And started dating.

A few months into dating, I saw something he had written about two weeks after we reconnected, but before we we're even dating or exclusive. But, it was about her. I didn't read it. I was looking for my earring and moved something in the coffee table, and there was a legal pad with his thoughts jotted down and something about her, and I quickly covered it back and didn't read anything else, but I did see the date. And never found my earring... I did mention it to him. 

At first he was apologetic, but he did say ""Look, I'm a messy cluttered guy. I was with her on and off for ten years. There are things in my house with her name or picture, and I don't know where all of it is. You might see more things, but I'm not holding on to any of it for a reason. I've gotten rid of everything I could find months ago, but I sometimes find more. You need to figure out if you can handle seeing those things sometimes.""

I mean.. touche. That makes sense. 

Fast forward about a year and a half. His brother and sister in law have a baby. Yay! We're on our way to their house and he gets a text that pops up on bluetooth. From the ex. I freak out, but it does just say ""Congrats on becoming an uncle."" We had a long, long discussion, where I tell him that no, I can't handle her popping up all the time. That I understand they were together for a long time, but I can't deal with this that often... Not after some of the things he shared with me when we were just friends. It made me feel too vulnerable. I told him I would never tell him to stop talking to somebody, and I would never stay in a relationship where I wondered where I stood when it came to an ex... So I needed to go back home and think about things to see how badly this affected me. 

He gave me his phone and iPad to go through his messages, Snapchat, Facebook, and there were some scattered messages, but nothing super personal... But it still bothered me. They talked about sports, or random things that really meant nothing. And then he said ""I don't get anything out of keeping in touch with her, and I love you. I'm going to block and delete her from everything. I don't miss anything about that woman."" (I haven't yet explained that she had cheated, he thought they were working on things, but it turned out she was sleeping with a different guy in every town, and he was just her guy in his city.. She was a flight attendant. He was pretty crushed, but after a while he said he started to heal and realized how bad she treated him and that it turned him into a person he didn't like and his family couldn't stand. Anyway, I digress.)

Fast forward another few months... Since then, I've found a few golf course scorecards from when they were together. I found a post it note she wrote him in his junk drawer. I found a card she gave him. I found the engagement ring he had bought for her.  I wasn't snooping either, and I usually said nothing. I would tell him I was going to clean and what area (guest room, bedroom, etc) so if he knew something was somewhere he could take care of it, but these things were always there.

Last weekend, we we're cuddled up and I asked him if he could look in his phone for a pic from when I went with him and his siblings to the mountains and we all took a sunrise pic together. He scrolled up, and boom. Pic of her. I mean.. there was literally only one, and he said he thought he had deleted them all. It wasn't a sexy pic, and I wasn't mad... But God damn it made my chest hurt. I just rolled over and told him I wasn't mad, I was just tired of having to deal with her all the time. I asked for a few minutes, and he gave them to me, and then we we're fine and cuddled up again. I don't lame him for all of this history with her. If it weren't for her, he might not be in love with the kind of person I am. If it weren't for her ruining their relationship, I wouldn't have him in my life. But I'm sick of her ghost. 

Today... Scrolling through my insta, and looking at what my friends like and BAM. There. She. Is. Again. A friend of mine, who wasn't her friend on insta not too long ago, liked her pic. Fan. Fucking. Tastic. 

How much longer do I have to deal with this girl?! I get it.. she's a world traveler now, she's a bombshell with the kind of fake boobs I want, and legs for days, and a gorgeous smile.

I haven't taken a pic of me with my SO since I saw it, and I always take a selfie with him when we're on the golf course. I just feel so unattractive every time I see her.. and I'm so afraid he'll want someone like her again instead of some plain Jane like me.

I’m posting because I’d love any guidance or to hear your experience dealing with experiences similar to I’m having! 

I’m no stranger to anxiety, at this point it’s like the obnoxious aunt everyone hopes doesn’t actually show up but she makes an appearance whenever she sees fit. Usually I can handle the panic attacks on my own pretty easy but lately new things are causing big panic attacks. 

For example... I went to see a movie this weekend and had such a bad panic attack I had to leave at the start of the movie. I went outside the theater and caught my breath in the bathroom and talked myself down from throwing up. And went to walk back to the theater but ended up spinning around and hiding out in the bathroom five more minutes while running cold water on my wrist trying to ground myself. 

I eventually made it back to the theater and held a cold water bottle the entire film to try and keep myself grounded to prevent another panic attack. 

Then I went to a baseball game the next day and was so anxious I went to the bathroom when we first got there and had to calm myself down. And then it took a while once we sat in our seats for me to relax.

17,"I usually get excited for video games. I'll get a new one and play it obsessively for about a week and beat it within that time frame. Then I'll try playing it again, maybe pick a different character and focus on different stats. But I never get more than a few hours in when I do this.

After fighting enemies or solving puzzles, the rewards are always the same. Explore this cave, kill these NPCs, get some loot. Explore this vault, kill some NPCs, get some loot. Rob this store, hijack that car, rope this horses...get XP, Loot, New weapons, etc. I just get bored with the game because the end goals are always the same and the tasks you have to complete them are always the same. 

I remember my favorite game of all time, GoldenEye 007. It was hard for 10 year old Me. Then one day I got a GameShark or something, and I had all the cheats available to me. My mind went wild with this new power. I had it all. I could kill enemies with one shot. I could never die. I was invincible, as Boris would say. I enjoyed this limitless power for all of about a few hours.

The game was boring. I could do anything. No one could stop me. No stone was left unturned. No mystery was left.

Life feels that way for me now. I have a good job and make a lot of money. I have a master's degree. I have my own place. I pay all my bills. Everyone thinks I am great when they get to know me. 

But I'm just not happy. I feel like I am playing a game and I know how it will end. It doesn't matter how hard or easy the game is, what metaphorical caves I have to explore or loot I'll get. It's just the same, day in and day out. Same trails I hike. Same vacations. Same food I eat. Same people in my life. Same conversations. Same same same.

19,"This is a therapeutic essay, designed only for the eyes of the writer, not to seek gratification or sympathy from the eyes of others. This essay is not only a manual for others, but myself. 

Love: 

My love is deep. I will sacrifice all in the name of love and I will not think about it twice. Although giving so much is no doubt taxing on myself and may even be taxing upon my partner I persist, and will continue to persist. I give so much love to others, because I find it hard to give love to myself. Loving me is a foreign concept. I don’t like myself. I’d rather give the love I’m supposed to be giving to myself to others. 

I need to be better 

Trust: 

My trust is a lie. Running through the motions of trust, I will give support, regards, rules and guidelines and freedom. Yet, in my minds mind I am all the while preparing myself to hear or discover that my trust has been betrayed, even though I expected it to be broken all the while.  I am weak, and authentic betrayal of trust will devastate and scar me. So I run scenarios and plots in my head, planning out situations and proper responses. I will pretend to be sad, I will express my hurt and disappointment, yet on some level, my emotions are premeditated. I find it hard to trust others, because I don’t trust myself, yet, I am the only person I feel I can trust because I am scared of being hurt. 

I need to be better

Emotions: 

My emotions are fragile, I need conformation, affirmation, and reassurance; almost at the same time. I need to be told that I am good because I am not sure in myself that I am good. I seek this from others because I can’t convince myself that I am good. 

I need to be better 

Thoughts:

My thoughts misguide me. Strewn negative thoughts, self doubt, self loathing, and automatic thoughts and assumptions, I am prone to believe that many feign loving me out of pity or obligation. This is why I am unable to exercise an extroverted nature because I would rather not hang with people and save them a step rather than trust that my company is actually enjoyed. 

I need to be better

My narrative is one based upon being a nice guy; wanting desperately to believe that I am indeed a good person yet never finding enough evidence to convince myself that I am. I haven’t recognized that my flaws are not my shortcomings and just because I am not perfect doesn’t mean I am not worth the love I should be giving myself. I need to hear that I am good, yet I don’t trust others that say I am good. I enjoy laughter, loving, my friends and family. I enjoy loving and being loved. Hugging is one of my favorite things in life, and I often find pleasure in days alone and with my loved ones. I am not sad, I do not need help, and I and very thankful that I have the life that I have. Sometimes..I just can’t convince myself that I am worth these things. 

I will become better",10Jul2018,3
20,"There was a short period of time in my teenage years where I have experienced undiagnosed chronic pain  around my abdomen area, my stomach could not hold any food. It’s not like food poisoning it’s about 5 times worse than food poisoning, I think it’s close to what could be diagnosed as Crohn’s disease, my parents thought it was colon cancer because my grandfather passed away from it. 

Looking back I think it is a form of psychosomatic disease because right after I started become accustomed to the pain I started to analyze my situation. I thought I’m heading towards death faster than my other siblings and parents, logically thinking : My body can’t store food long-term = malnutrition = death.

After I thought I was going to die soon, I started to feel at peace somehow with the pain and the illness went away after about a week or two. During this time where I thought I was going to die my parents said I changed from their child from hell to an angel. 

Pain in the right amount where I could become equanimous towards it and perhaps from fasting too, my mind becomes calm and at peace. I believe the key to become a good/saintly person is through becoming equanimous or living with pain without reacting to it negatively like what I learnt through Vipassana meditation but I’m still a novice at this and I still make a lot of mistake along the way leading my meditation to not progress like it should.

My main group consists of my best friend and a bunch of completely different extroverted people who I have zero connection with. I’m sorry, but I don’t give two shits about these people.

I’m a generally quiet and thoughtful person, and constantly hanging out with people who are so different than me in that regard just wears me down. I mean, I have social anxiety which hinders me in making new friends. But I still know I’m going to completely forget about these people in a few months. Their mindsets are so off and just *wrong* to me. Like it just comes off as immature to me

It’s sucks because it’s what I have to deal with when hanging with my best friend. Hopefully I’ll easily find a better group in college",10Jul2018,2
22,"I was hanging out in my apartment with a couple platonic girl friends, and they started talking about the men in their lives. In an intensely critical and specific way, talking about physical features. It's never even occurred to me to ever talk that way about a woman with a guy friend of mine, and I'd likely be very uncomfortable if any friend talked that way to me. The most critical one is no catch by looks or brains herself and whines that her current guy can't be the hottest guy she'll ever fuck. Is this really how women talk to each other?",10Jul2018,8

28,"So, this girl and I have known each other since we were little. We've only just started to talk during the last year of school.

So we began to talk after she came to me for help because she thought my friend was going to ask her out and she didn't know what to do if he did. We became really close, every time she had a problem, I'd be there for her, every time. We would talk 24/7, at school we'd always be together, we gave each other our accounts. It got to the point where people started to think we were dating. 

(This story would make somewhat more sense if I talked about every single situation we've been through but that would take too long and it's 6 AM and I haven't slept so please bare with me).

She ended up losing 2 of her closest friends during this time. But through this, I was always there for her. But, aside from all the drama, we kept getting closer and closer. But I think it was April when it all started to come crashing down, It was at this time where I started to develop feelings for her; I loved her, and I do. I told her but we started getting colder towards each other, we wouldn't hang out as much as we used to, I see now that admitting my feelings was a mistake. But our relationship was still strong. I was still always there for her when she needed me, I always made sure I checked up on her when I could, but we never really ever talked normally, we never had a regular conversation, we would only talk to each other when shit hit the fan. At this time I was extremely lonely, almost depressed because of it, I wanted someone in my life and I thought she could be the one. I loved this girl, so fucking much. She was the only one who saw me for who I really was, she was the only one who I could really open up to, I could be myself around her, that's why I love her, not because of the way she looms or any of that bullshit. I just can't accept the fact that it all came crashing down. I'm rambling at this point, sorry. Anyways, it's nearing the end of our final school year. At this point, we barely ever talk to each other. Our once strong friendship became so cold that it froze and cracked to pieces that can't be put back together. It's the last day of school and we don't speak a word to each other. A few days later she messages me, angry because I left without saying goodbye and that she was going to tell me how much she loved me because she never told me that in person. I didn't want to say goodbye to her because it felt like she was purposely trying to avoid me for the past month (during this month I was extremely depressed because of this. We managed to put most of it behind us and we started to talk again through text. during one of our conversations she indirectly told me that she didn't love me. This really fucking hurt me, at the same time I get where she's coming from but still. We haven't talked since. And now i'm here and I ask for help. Is our friendship still salvageable?  is it even worth trying? Please, criticism, advice anything is fine. If you've read this far thank you.",10Jul2018,0

I don't want to tell him that, i just need to get it out of my chest.

32,"**Backstory**

For the past 6 months, I've been trying to figure out what I'm meant to do. I have this tugging feeling that I want to be working with my hands creating things that people use, but I'm not very creative. I keep going in a cycle of finding something new and interesting (e.g sewing, furniture repair, woodworking, etc), getting excited thinking I found ""the one"" trade craft for a vocation, and then after realizing the skill gap between novice and professional I give up and get depressed that I'm mediocre at everything I do. It's a feeling of how most of the people around me had hobbies and interests growing up and yet I never really had anything that people knew me for. 

When I was younger, I simply escaped into video games and would play for hours, and I wasn't even good at them, I would get distracted in most of the RPG's with the crafting aspect because it had instant gratification. While other kids were playing bass, learning dance, playing hockey, I was sitting on my butt not allowed to go anywhere or interested in anything. Partly because when I was younger I wasn't interested in anything so I never asked my parent's if I could learn something, and partly because when I did ask my parents they were too busy watching tv (dad was in military so he came home stressed) and mom was busy cooking supper/cleaning. 

**Now**

This leaves me here at present day, with a wife of 4 years, my chunkster 5month old girl, and trying to find my passion/vocation so that I can eventually have the flexibility to spend time with my family and not be the dad that is never at dance recitals or softball games because work suddenly added 3 hours to my day. But majority of the blogs, videos, etc. I read, they say ""Think of what you did as a child! Maybe do that!"", well, what if I didn't do anything as a child?! **How can I listen to that inner voice that seems to be pulling me towards a useful creative area when I can't tell if it's my ego tricking me with baader-meinhoff or if I actually do feel what I think I feel? ** How can I figure out what I was meant to do?

Hell, maybe I've simply romanticized crafting from video games to the point that I think it's something I was created to do, maybe the feeling that if I could find the one thing that I had a talent/knack for that I would throw myself into the field and become an expert at it is simply a desperate attempt at escaping from eating the cow patty that is my job.

33,"I looked at the amount of classes I have left. I should have planned it out better. But I was a young first year who didn't know anything about college. Now I'm behind. It's frustrating and quite a let down. I have older siblings who finished on time and there's pressure from my parents who are also frustrated with me.



I'm not quite certain on my major in computer science yet I'm starting my third year. At this point I'm too scared to change it. I go to a commuter school and live with my parents. Most of my friends will be finishing on time, but with the few that won't be it's a bit comforting to know that I'm not alone. If I had taken the class I wanted to take over the summer I would be one class closer. But I backed out because I was scared of failing an accelerated course and lacked the discipline. I still do. I won't have another chance to take a summer class as most of them aren't offered during the summer. It's also too expensive. Now I'm looking at my possible classes for the new semester and I'm already feeling so overwhelmed. There's so much more to learn. I don't know if I'll even manage to get an internship. I get so stressed and overwhelmed that I just start avoiding things I need to do which starts showing in my grades.



I wish I could start over again and plan better. I know I just have to look forward and not make the same mistakes again, but it's hard to accept it. I need to stop comparing myself to others. I feel so angry at myself, guilty, and I'm tempted to just give up. But I know I can't.

37,"Some background information about me.  I am 19 years old and really overweight.  I am working really hard to get healthy, and that includes preparing for a gastric sleeve surgery to use as a tool for weight loss.  In order to get the surgery, I have to meet with this lady through the hospital who is a sort of addiction counselor.  I have been meeting with her every week for the past month and a half, and without her go-ahead, I won't be able to have my surgery. 

So this morning, I went in for my 8 AM appointment, and I realized that I didn't have any money.  One of the things that I am doing in order to stop eating out so much and going to drive-thru's is that I am leaving my credit card and debit card with my parents unless I need them.  So in the past, I have been bringing cash on the mornings of my appointment in order to pay the $60 fee.  I went up to the lady at the desk, and told her that I didn't have money, so if she could bill me then that would be great.  She told me that the counselor who I was seeing doesn't send bills because it is an individual appointment and not through insurance.  She said she would go ask her.  So I waited, and she came back out and told me I would have to reschedule.  This annoyed me because I had been seeing this lady for well over a month now and she knew that I would pay, but I said okay.  I can't go next week because I will be out of town, so I scheduled an appointment for two weeks from tomorrow and cancelled the appointment for next week because I didn't know I would be out of town when I made it.  Then I left.

I called my mother in the car and told her what happened, and she was kind of peeved, but then I moved on and headed to work (I am working a 9-5 summer job and I am proud of it.  Got it by myself and it's my first real summer job.)  When I pulled into the parking lot at work, I got a phone call.  It was the lady who I have been seeing.  The first thing she said to me was 

""Why did you cancel your appointment for this morning?""

Now this immediately got me kind of annoyed because I didn't cancel jack shit.  I was turned away.  I explained to her what happened and how the lady at the desk even asked her if I could be billed before telling me I would have to reschedule.  She then asked me why I didn't call my mom or dad and have them give the lady their credit card over the phone.  First off, I didn't even know that that was a thing, and second, I wasn't offered.  The desk lady literally said that the counselor I was meeting said that I would have to reschedule. She then went on to basically say that she was going to tell the surgeon that I wasn't being serious about the meetings because I missed last week due to the 4th of July, and I am going out of town next week.  I ended up scheduling an appointment with her this Thursday during my lunch break, but she is never on time and the hospital is 15 minutes away so basically I am going to lose 2+ hours of work.  

Am I right to be as annoyed as I am?  She basically turned me away then tried to guilt me for cancelling.  Let me know what you guys think.  Thanks!",10Jul2018,4
38,"Not sure if this should go in this subreddit 

tl;dr The European immigration policy in the last decade or two wasn't good and the people who are/will pay(ing) the price are the educated people from abroad, the native millenials and future generations.

I remember about 10 years ago (I was 13), I met a few people from Europe, especially from the Netherlands, Sweden, France, United Kingdom. All these people were around my age and we became good friends and are still friends until this day. The fact that I was a from the middle east made no difference to any of us: we visited each other, chatted online (back in the msn days), bragged about who was allowed an additional sip of beer from their parents, and all was good!

Time has passed, I grew up, became an engineer and decided to pursue a master's degree in the United Kingdom, and maybe eventually work in a large firm (e.g. JP Morgan, Google, ...) as these options were not available for me in my home country.

In the mean time, problems arose in Europe, especially due to the vast, uncontrolled immigration and open border policy. Back home, many of my friends and cousins who were also highly educated, were getting visa rejections (even tourist visas!) to many western countries and some were even humiliated in airports, while we observed people with very little to no education, with obvious traits of intolerance and fanaticism against western culture, easily get work and immigration visas.

Some might say that this is natural because the western countries need a cheap labour hand and does not want someone like me, taking away the job of a native engineer. But do these people also realise that the children of these immigrants will be raised in the same schools and universities as the natives, thus taking away the jobs of the children of the same people the state wanted to protect? Isn't this policy just plainly short sighted and aims at making the current economy better just to get more votes for the next round?

To continue with my story, I went to the UK and finished my master's degree with a distinction (A), and so I started looking for a job with high hopes in one of the big firms that I was dreaming of. To my great displeasure, there was absolutely no company that I was interested in that provided to sponsor a work visa in any country in the EU, UK, and the US... I even nailed some interviews, and as soon as I was asked about my legal status, smiles turned into frowns...

Some of my close relatives and friends blame Brexit, the Trump administration, or the rise of populism in Europe for my treatment. But I do not, instead I wonder if people would have ever voted for these movements if they didn't regard them as their only salvation from the mass uncontrolled immigration.

Sorry for this long post and if it seems offensive to anyone.
Looking forward to hearing your personal experiences if you have, otherwise just post your thoughts.

Cheers,

43,"A few months ago, I started talking to this dude in my uniform. Before this we knew of each others existences, but never really talked in person before. We had lots of mutual friends though. When we first started talking, we were completely platonic, then shit got real but I started catching romantic feelings for him. I liked how our convos felt, how we were similar yet different. The feelings for stronger and before I knew it I was stuck with an impeccable crush on this dude. I was terrified because everytime I developed a crush, it would end up with me eating ice cream and crying. However, the prospect of me and him somewhat excited me, he was someone I actually had a chance with. For a while I thought he liked me too, he would text me every morning and night, would offer to carry my things, check up on me (he knows bout my anxiety issues), invited me to hang out alone w him, he even told me about his family issues and stuff.

Well, turned out he didn't lol. One day when we were hanging out, his friends mentioned a girl who he was in love with since highschool. I found out he was still in live with her after he rejected her (he told me bout the rejection part but not the still in love part)  and he wouldn't fall for anyone else, even if meant waiting for her forever. He even has a pic of both of them in his wallet. Obviously it was like a stab in the chest do I requested to leave early with the excuse I wasn't feeling well. I felt so dumb for actually thinking there was a possibility that he had feelings for me. Compared to her, I must have been just a speck. 

It was really late at that time, and he followed me, I asked him why but he just smiled. He proceeded to tell me he wasn't sure if he would wait for her that long or not. I didnt say anything, then proceeded to cry in the cab. After that, things got awkward. We started to avoid each other. A while after the incident he came to ask if I was okay and if I needed someone to talk to.  He was probably trying to maintain our friendship, but it just hurt so much that I couldn't. We didn't talk for a while, and our relationship became realy awkward though we still hung out as a group. 

The past month, he suddenly started the convo again. This time, he tells me that he's learnt to let go, and there's someone he's interested IN someone now. At first I was like meh, leave me alone why are you telling me this. Then he hinted that the girl was someone I knew and started being abit flirty. At first I was oblivious but now I realize he's probably talking bout me. I don't know. I don't know what I should do it feel or think. Obviously I still like him, but it feels I'm a rebound. It's barely been 2 months since he's decided to let go. I feel if I let this weird, flirting thing to on, I'm going to get hurt once again,  and if the girl ever changes her mind, I'll be tossed aside like trash. He doesn't give off that vibe, but it's just something that crosses my mind. Am I over thinking it, what should I do? :/

44,"So I (m 20) have this problem that clothes, especially underwear and trousers are very unconfortable sometimes. I used to wear boxer briefs but over time I couldn't wear them anymore because they always felt wrong and constraining. Then I bought boxers and they felt better but after a while startet to feel wrong again. Because of how pants are made I have decide on which side to ""wear"" my private parts and it never feels symmetrical in the center and that bothers me. It's worse when I am stressed.

I have discomfort with other clothes too sometimes like socks that feel twistet or when my shoes aren't tied with the same strength.

I assume it is symmetry OCD because I was diagnosed with another type of OCD before. I asked this on an OCD Forum before but I'm not quite sure if it is. Someone also suggested it may be transitioning but I don't think that's that.

51,"And then proceed tp stare at the screen for five minutes because i cant really describe what im feeling. Awesome. 

I just feel so alone and like im a massive fuck up.  So lets start from the top: 

1. im unemployed. Have been for the last 7 months. I was lucky enough to be able to afford it but now im broke and need to get a job again. But job hunting and the prospect of working again gives me massive anxiety and i just want to hide in bed. I feel like any job i CAN get will make me want to kill myself but ill end up staying for years because i need that minimum wage bullshit to pay my bills. Which was exactly what happened with my previous job and why i decided the leave the second i could afford it. I just got out of school too but i dont have my full certification so i cant do what i really want to do so im stuck applying to things that im overskilled for and that dissuades me from applying to anything. Not that it matters, i can count on one hand the amount of jobs ive had since i started working. Im just one of those people that has troubling finding stable work. 

2. my best friend is avoiding me. We got very close in a very short amount of time. He refuses to fully acknowledge his marriage has run its course and is no longer healthy for him and as a result he developed feelings for me.  But i ignored those feelings and he wouldnt understand why. And for me, constantly hearing him go back and forth about loving his wife and then hating her was making me physically ill from how angry i was about it (previous abusive relationship so people who waffle like that is a bit triggering to me) Regardless, hes „taking a break“ from hanging out with/talking to me so he can work on his marriage. I feel like im being blamed for something i didnt do. Like im being punished. 

3. interested in a guy. Best friend had previously given my number to a guy who he thought i should date. Great, massive anxiety because ive never dated before and only had the one abusive boyfriend. Guy texted me and pretty soon after he invited me over to his place to watch the world cup. Hes so sweet and nice and delicate. We end up having sex and cuddle during the whole football match. After i leave i have the immediate feeling i dont deserve this. I messed up by having sex with him so he wont want anything else to do with me now. I text him the next day regardless of my selfhate and he agrees to hang out again but i still feeling ive ruined any possibility of it becoming something more than sex. But it doesnt matter because he cancelled because of personal reasons but i still feel its a rejection and he wants nothing to do with me. 

4. tapering off my medication. Two months ago my anti-depressants stopped working so i made the decision to taper off as opposed to upping the dosage (plus i cant afford it what with being unemployed). Its been pretty up and down. Thankfully i was in school and doing something physical so i wouldnt be stuck in bed. Except now im out of school and im on the lowest dosage before im off completely and its been the worst stretch of this whole trial. I cant eat, im exhausted all the time, i feel dizzy and sick, my mood is simultaneously all over the place but also completely rock bottom. Today is a pretty bad combination of feeling all this stuff so i just want to die. I keep thinking about self harm. But i dont have anyone to talk to because all my friends are dealing with their own crap right now and they really dont need the burden of my bullshit added on top. 

I feel like i have nothing right now. No positive prospects in my future. Im alone and useless. ",10Jul2018,19

55,"I just don't know if I can do it anymore. My kids don't get the full attention they need, my schoolwork doesn't get the full attention it needs, and I don't give myself the full attention I need. My wife does so little to help when she's home from work. She's a damn lazy slob who just wants to come home and watch TV until the kids go to bed. She leaves trash and dishes all over the place for me to pick up the next day. Her messiness has been the biggest argument of ours since we got married (even when I worked and she stayed at home) and it never gets better. The only reason I pick up after her is because I'm doing my best to create a better environment for our kids at home and trying to teach them to be more responsible about their messes than their mom is. Last night she made a protein shake and just left the banana peel on the counter for me to find this morning. She never finishes through her laundry. Our room is always covered in her clothes and she's always leaving the washer and dryer full of her clothes, which really inhibits my ability to do my laundry or my kids' laundry. I convinced her to let me get rid of our cable subscription and our time- and money-consuming dog so that we could afford house cleaners once a month, because I literally don't have the time nor energy to deep clean our house. The daily cleaning is already too much. 

I'm always listening to her rant about work and about her idiotic family who live five minutes away from us (for perspective, all of my family and nearly all of my friends live an hour or longer away from us; I'm fucking lonely). I can tell that whenever I need to rant about something, she's either not listening or silently judging me. A couple nights ago, I told her how much trouble I'm having with our wildly hyper six-year-old son who has a broken arm. I basically told her that I'm losing my mind like I am here now. She just stared at the floor with a sour look on her face and gave me the silent treatment, like she couldn't believe that I had the audacity to complain about my life, especially when it included one of our kids. I wasn't putting up with that passive-aggressive bullshit again, so I went outside for a bit to clear my head. An hour or so later, she acted like nothing happened and asked to watch TV with me. We haven't talked about it since.

My six-year-old has a gaming habit that I don't have the energy to break him out of. His arm is broken, so physical activity is limited for a while longer. I need to focus on my courses, so I can't spend hours a day interacting with him doing other things. I need him to chill out so I can focus, and unfortunately, the best way to do that is to have the TV babysit him. My daughter just turned three but she's incredibly easy-going. She's like the only thing going on in my life that isn't draining the life right out of me right now. I really wish I could give her more of my attention too.

My mother-in-law lives five minutes away from us and never, ever offers to help out with the kids. She watches my sister-in-law's daughter three days per week while she works and just loves to bitch to everyone about how little time she has to herself because of it. My wife's parents have never acknowledged how much I do, but they love to complain about their own lives. It's actually amazing that I haven't lost my shit on them yet. They badly spoil my kids and teach my son bad manners because they think it's hilarious, which is just more shit that I have to put up with at home. My son already has a bad behavior problem, and it seems to get worse every time he spends time with them.

Studies show that stay-at-home parents work sixty or so hours per week. Add onto that working full-time toward a bachelors degree and a wife who does so little to help out at home. Yeah, I'm losing my mind. I want out of this, but I can't. I'm stuck. I don't want a divorce because of how much it would impact the kids, nor can I afford one, so I'll just have to be miserable until I'm able to take full control of my life again, whenever that may be.",10Jul2018,1

58,"I swear it's like I can't react to anything unless its about to kill me. Everything takes until the last minute to do, regardless of how much free time I have at my disposal. It's like I don't want to succeed anymore. No motivation whatsoever. Doesn't make any sense. 

Could've probably taken over the world by now if I could just get off my ass.",10Jul2018,331
59,"Hi!! I graduated in 2015 with my masters in social work . My school tuition was 30k but I also took out some money for myself since I wasn’t working (full time school full time internship). With all of this , my school mom was 38K! So I applied for the loan forgiveness program (not thinking I was going to get picked). According to the program , it’s a lottery and I guess I was one of the lucky ones. I just wanted to say to all people in the helping profession take advantage of this great opportunity because if I got lucky enough to get picked anyone can ! It’s really a blessing . I make 52k a year and spend so much money monthly on my student loans and feeling depressed about it that this really helps a lot . They give 26k which means I would still have a balance but a balance I can pay off way quicker ! Do it !!!",10Jul2018,35
61,"So basically, my moms a drunk and kicked me and my wife and son out. We been staying with my gma but you can tell our welcome is gone. Can someone please tell me what to do. I’ve already try the HUD housing, 211, etc. it’s all full or a waiting list. I’m at a loss and don’t want to sleep in the car with my son. We don’t even have money for a hotel.

62,"For the past month a stray cat has been hanging around our house and I became pretty attached. We named her Bella. One day we noticed Bella got fairly skinny over night. I felt like a dumbass— she wasn’t fat, she was pregnant. We found the kittens and I placed them in a box with a blanket in my room (along with Bella, of course). A few days later we had an appointment to surrender them to the humane society and it broke my heart. She was crying in the cat carrier and I felt like shit. The staff at the humane society reassured us that they would take care of her and the kittens, and that if they couldn’t we would take them back. 

I know it was the right thing to do but I feel horrible. It’s been a few days and I can’t stop thinking about her. 

I’m sorry Bella.",10Jul2018,4
63,"Let’s start off this story with some background.

Btw, this isn’t a school shooter type of story I KNOW IT SOUNDS BAD BUT HEAR ME OUT AHHH lmao but ya read everything 


I grew up with extreme depression/extreme social anxiety/selective mutism. I grew up 100% isolated from society. While I saw everyone else attempting suicide and becoming bitter I remained positive. My parents were abusing in every way possible but somehow I still managed to get through. 

Okay so throughout the 11 years this went on I developed a “unique”personality. Here’s some highlights 
- Somehow I’m really really positive and optimistic. 
- I cannot stand seeing anyone being taken advantage of. I will literally step in even if it means I’ll get fucked up too (once I saw this guy getting bullied in the high school locker room by a senior (I was a freshmen) and told the big ass dude to fuck off and pick ok someone his own size then to come back and tell me how it went. Long story short I got beat up too lmao) 
- ANYONE who speaks BS in front of me is gonna get a piece of my mind 
- if anyone does anything morally wrong I don’t care who it is I speak up. That includes teachers/ professors/ parents 

Okay so what do I mean with the title? Even though I came out of my depression and all of that mental issues I’m still working on being “normal” so I have trouble getting in peoples faces.. 

Today, my white professor who’s in his 70s compared himself to “niggas” (YES HIS EXACT WORD) and Mexicans. In terms of what they go through (racial discrimination) at this point I could feel steam coming out to my ears. This professor REGULARLY talks about how he’s been all around the world, he comes from the British elite class aka he’s rich as fuck. 

His excuse was that he had been to japan and was arguing with this Mexican kid saying “you think you don’t know how it feels? GO TO JAPAN!” 

This guy is always comparing himself to popular philosophers/ other people such as the Buddha, Copernicus etc. he says those people have discovered “the truth” always says how to discover “the truth” you need to be humble and other bullshit. 

ANYWAY.. the point is, this guy is the most arrogant person I have ever met. When he compared himself to African Americans/ Mexicans in terms of discrimination I just exploded. 

He was talking about how he was discriminated against in Japan so I told him “you think you can compare that to the lifetime of discrimination a African american/Mexican faces?” “You think that because you didn’t have money to pay for your kids birth you went through anything??” “I am SO sorry you didn’t have your millions at that time” “I am so sorry you have faced so much discrimination that you’re able to travel to 30 different countries” “do something for me, imagine you were black instead of white in any of those 30 counties and tell me how you would’ve been treated different” “FUCK OFFF” (actual words I said) 

Kicked me out of class. Few minutes later he let me come back in, the same kid was asking him how he got a job in Japan in the first place 

“BY HAVING A CAMBRIDGE DIPLOMA!” 

BRUH FUCK OFFFF YOU THINK YOURE AT A DISADVANTAGE??? 

Hsidjdjfjfienfj long story short I’m going to the dean of the college. I’m tired of hearing this guy act like a victim and calling people niggas and fucking negros. 

So yeah.. I’m only like that when I get really mad I’m looking forward to being like that 24/7

64,"I feel like I should have accomplished more at this point in life.

That I should be doing something big- like selling all my stuff and traveling the world with my dog. Or creating art/ music/ etc. Or contributing to the world in some huge way- like building houses for people in third world countries or doing some other type of mission.

But I don't have any idea what to do or how to get there. And I'm terrified. Is this life? Just living everyday to work and pay bills? Or is there more out there?",10Jul2018,5
