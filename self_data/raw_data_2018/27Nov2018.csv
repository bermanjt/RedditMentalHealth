So now the buyer is holding off until it's fixed.. the result is my boss in my office yelling and swearing at me about this, because it's going to cost him an insignificant amount of money compared to what he's selling for.

11,"I think writing this out and being able to read it instead if just think it will help me overcome my moral issues with consuming meat. 

I’ve been a pescatarian for 3 and a half years. And I only eat fish because I hate to go out to eat and pay $10 for a salad just to leave the place hungry. Also, I’ve been able to justify eating sustainably-sourced seafood because baby fish aren’t torn away from their parent fish and shrimp don’t look at me with sad eyes. I’m a loon. 
Anyways, when I first stopped eating things that walk on land/fly, I was working out a lot. I consumed a lot of protein in the form of powder and was always experimenting with new veg-friendly recipes. Sweet potatoes, black beans, lentils, and chickpeas- I was all about all of it. 
Fast forward to now and I work 55-60 hours a week. I haven’t seen the inside of a gym in two years and I stopped taking protein because I didn’t want to get bulky since I wasn’t burning what I was putting in. But I don’t eat at work. Today, I ate a 6oz container of raspberries on my way there at 6:30a, stopped at Starbucks for my venti raspberry white mocha (hey white girl!) and didn’t have anything until I got home around 6. I’m 5’3 and about 110lbs and I’m so tired all the time. I try to eat good stuff when I can, but I know I can’t keep doing this. I can’t afford the supplements and vitamins my body needs and I can’t snack all day long at work. I feel like the easiest fix is to reintroduce meat into my diet and see if that helps. Maybe I’m wrong? I just know I’m tired of being tired and willing to try something new.  ",27Nov2018,1

17,"People often say that those who die from suicide are selfish since they leave behind friends, family and peers who will be negatively affected by their death. It’s often said to denigrate the person who died and a major reason why suicide is so taboo.

My question is can we admit that suicide is selfish but at the same time say that people still have a right to die if they want to?

Suicide for the most part is motivated by self interest (what the person genuinely desires). If someone is clinically depressed or simply unhappy for whatever reason and they no longer want to be in this world then they may see death as the answer to their problems (rightfully or wrongfully) regardless of whether people will be saddened or traumatized by their absence.

My issue is that almost all decisions people make are selfish in nature and based solely on personal desires. People go to college, get married, have kids, travel, build careers, do drugs, have sex, eat unhealthy foods, watch movies/TV etc because they want to with little regard to what others may say about it. Everyone has made a decision that someone else disagreed with but they still did it because why should you change your behavior for the sake of others?

I find it strange that suicide is seen as especially selfish but other harmful activities aren’t. Most people agree that you have the right to do things that aren’t healthy as long as it only affects you. People join the military during wars even though they could die and leave their loved ones behind but they aren’t seen as selfish. People eat junk food, participate in dangerous sports, do drugs etc even though their loved ones may disapprove or be saddened by their death. If a police officer gets shot or a lifetime junk food eater dies of heart disease it would be strange to hear someone that knew them to call them selfish for participating in an activity that wasn’t absolutely necessary that led to their death.

My personal view is that people have the right to do whatever they want as long as it doesn’t affect anyone else in an immediate sense. If you want to snort cocaine and drink hard liquor until you die then do it as long as you aren’t committing crimes to support your habit. If you want to be a construction worker even though you could be killed in an accident or a soldier even though you could be shot or blown apart then no one should stop you if you truly desire it. If you can’t do what you truly desire then what’s the point of living?

If someone wants to die because they’re depressed or unhappy then they should have the right to do that (after they’ve been offered resources to help them of course). No one should be forced to do something or not do something if it’s contrary to their desires and doesn’t hurt anyone else. If you think someone should be able to slowly kill themselves through drugs or unhealthy eating then it’s nit much of a rational leap to think that they should be able to immediately kill themselves despite what anyone may say.

None of the above touches on whether or not suicide can be justified or rational since it only addresses the selfishness of it in comparison to every other decision people make.

18,"Just as a prerequisite I have friends, I think, at my University. But I don't feel these relationships honestly have all that much depth.

I changed states when I went to University, including moving states. I left pretty much all my friends when I did this. I didn't mind all that much at first, but I haven't had the time or money to be able to go back at any point and since going to University I feel I haven't built any meaningful relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

I was just thinking about this since I had recently felt a compulsion to start dating again since I felt like something was missing but when I thought deeper about it it's not so much that I want a girlfriend but more-so just a meaningful relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like Emmet from that one scene in the Lego movie when he's being interrogated. I feel that if you mentioned me to people they'd say they know me and that I seem nice, but that I don't really have any outstanding characteristics about myself. Or that when they're thinking of hanging out with someone I'm never within anyone's top 3 people. It hurts, I don't really feel deeply valued by anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I find myself never really being invited to do things, or I'll be invited and when the event roles around someone neglects to give me the full information on what's going on. Whenever I actively ask someone to hang out I can usually get a response, and I don't feel as though they don't enjoy my company, but no one ever seems to actively seek hanging out with me. I can't really joke around with people like I could do with my friends back home. I feel as though there's a lack of chemistry. I could always make my friends laugh and they could do the same, but I find it hard to find something similar since I started going to my university.

&amp;#x200B;

I might be overthinking it, or maybe I'm being too negative. But I don't really know. I don't think I'm depressed, but I feel as though sometimes I just want to give up on maintaining relationships and just spend all my time in my room until I graduate. ",27Nov2018,1

20,"I don't want to say this like it's an achievement. If anything, it's probably a cry for help. I feel like I need someone else to know what is going on, even if that someone else is a random internet stranger.

It started Sunday night. I was getting ready for school and all the homework that I didn't do was starting to rear its head. I don't know what happened, but before I knew it I was watching bootleg RuPaul at 2 a.m., and I was doing my homework at 4. The night passed by in a weird haze, but I remember a lot of talking to myself and a lot of pacing around my room. Even though I had locked myself in my room for about 9 hours (20:00-05:00), the minutes just flew by. Before I knew it, I was looking out my window and watching the sun rise (which was a surreal experience on it's own, because the sunlight brought a sense of clarity and made me fully realize what I'd done).

That morning I got ready and, in front of my parents, tried to act like I'd just woken up. I was still on some kind of insomniac-high, because I felt awake and alert. The car trip to school changed that. Just sitting still in one place was enough to knock me out, even despite my attempts to remain awake (I wanted to believe that I could have a normal, wakeful day). Things only got worse from there.

During the school day the sleepiness set in. It wasn't the normal kind where your head feels like it's being weighted down, and you have to do everything you can to keep it up. The kind of tired I felt was worse. My body felt heavy and sick. I felt disgusting. It reminded me of when I had gone to school with the flu. It was very strange, because my friends didn't notice anything off, but inside I  felt like I was on Jupiter experiencing double gravity. I fell asleep in two of my classes, which I hated myself for. Normally I pay attention and I try, but I just couldn't. It was rough.

So, after getting home and having a napless afternoon, I have locked myself in the bathroom to go on Reddit. 

My parents don't know, and I don't know what they would do if they did. I don't want to tell my friends because it is such a weird subject. I feel like someone's just pulled a shitty prank on my life. I feel awful, and I am so tired of talking to myself.",27Nov2018,1
23,"I’m stressed. Finals are coming up. I’m having difficulty passing my classes. I’m doing everything right. I’m just suddenly an idiot after graduating high school. Two of my friends are in different states. One friend isn’t even my friend anymore because they turned into complete jerks. And my last friend is always so busy. So basically I’m all alone. Nobody listens to me. We have a group chat with my remaining friends and they make me feel so alone. I feel disposable. I say anything in that chat and I’m ignored. When I try to make conversation, I’m ignored. When I ask for advice, I’m ignored. 

I’m there for them whenever they need me. I literally do my best to help them whenever they need it as fast as possible. And they don’t ever return the favor. 

I was even going through a really really bad depressive period caused by my PMDD about a month ago and I was so scared. I was terrified by my thoughts and I tried asking them for help. I tried asking them to not leave me alone and I was ignored. At the first sign of me expressing emotions, they don’t respond. And they say it’s because “they don’t know how to handle emotions” 

I HAD TO TEXT MY EX BECAUSE MY FRIENDS WERENT THERE TO SUPPORT ME. I had just broken up with him three months ago and the break up was really tough for me. I was no contact and healing and I had to text him because I was so scared of my thoughts and he was the only one who knew how to calm me down and make me feel less alone. AND THEN THEY HAD THE AUDACITY TO BE UPSET WITH ME FOR TEXTING HIM WHEN THEY FOUND OUT. 

I just want new friends. I just want someone to talk to and I want friends who will support me the way I support my friends. I don’t want to feel alone. I wish I was able to make friends. I try. I really do. There’s nothing about my appearance that says I’m weird. It annoys me so much that no matter how hard I try to make new friends it never works out. 

So basically, I either have crappy friends or the sadness that comes with failing to make new friends. I don’t know which is worse. 

Just thinking about this makes me sad. It makes me want a guy to hold me and just watch tv with me. 

I really don’t want to text my ex again. He’ll respond and be supportive, but I don’t want to talk to him anymore. I need to move on from him but it makes it really difficult when he’s the only one in my life who understands my pain. 

I’m sorry for the long incoherent rant. I just needed to vent.

So a couple of nights ago I randomly wake up in the middle of the night, and since I couldn't sleep I text a friend, and he happens to be awake, so we chat for a while. Eventually he says he's going to sleep, and I decide to do the same.

So I'm just here, lying on my bed, and I kinda fall asleep as usual. But after like a few minutes, I'm randomly conscious again. I can't remember if my eyes were open or not, but I recall extending my arms. I then realize that my hands feel numb, and I try moving my fingers, but they don't seem respond. But my toes seem to respond just fine. I was already freaking out because of unresponsive hands, when I suddenly feel the numbness extend through my arms, to my shoulders, and down my back. It was such a strange feeling that I'm not sure how to describe. I realize the feeling is going up my neck, and I start to panic even more. I can't move. I can't scream. I can't do anything. And just as the feeling spreads to the top of my skull, I suddenly jolt and open my eyes, to which I realize I can move again.

I have no idea what I experienced, I'm not sure if it was some kind of dream or if it actually happened and I experienced some kind of sleep paralysis. All I know is that it was terrifying and I really don't wanna do it again.",27Nov2018,1

27,"I go to high school as a senior and back in August after making a joke on my Snapchat story titled “Ammunition for the back to school dance?” And a photo of tomatoes and avocados ... it is a very dumb joke but I have a sort of humor like this but it wasn’t a joke about harming people just a food fight joke that didn’t have bad intention. I think because of this whole humor I have that can be sort of edgy and impulsively made then people can be angry about it. A buddy messaged me on Snapchat telling me how it could be taken a wrong way so I took it down and sent out an apology of how the joke could be taken badly. 10 minutes go by after the apology and I get cops sent to my house which I was surprised about but then realized they were here for the original post on my story. They asked me if everything was okay in school and had to call my parents which was annoying but I was acting how I should’ve been with being innocent and literally just having a joke blown out of proportion. Police had to search my room for weapons and I felt embarrassed and then cops explained more about how many people anonymously sent a tip to school about post and that I had caused a ripple effect of parents freaking out and an email sent basically as a sort of warning of a potential threat for the school dance. I had to have a threat assessment at school which basically was me getting interrogated after not being able to go to school for 2 days and the freaking SWAT going to school for some sort of desperate measures even when I wasn’t allowed at school and searched by cops. I understand how we live in a scary age of shootings happening frequently but for this to be blown out of proportion (at least agreeable by a little bit). While this went down I avoided talking to people as rumors spread quickly of me planning to shoot up the school and so instead of my friends helping me they stopped talking to me and thinking I was mentally ill, rumors like this spread quickly online and in person. Most of the people I did think were my friends just started seeing me in a skewed way and some tips that the school got reported to me were random things like me walking sketchy in school or me pretending to shoot people. Obviously because of my already jacked up reputation I feel like as a sort of mob mentality or rumors then people added more to this. I was definitely questioning myself if I was a bad person but I just made an “edgy” joke that wasn’t supposed to be taken in a bad light and because of my impulsive humor this could’ve been avoided otherwise. Something hypocritical is these ex-friends of mine make worse jokes that I call them out for and at the same time act sensitive to things I say that aren’t as bad. There’s more to this I will explain but this is all for now so feel free to message thoughts or a sort of similar situation. Thanks",27Nov2018,1
28,"There isn't a super complicated story behind this, basically I (16m) have had this best friend (16m) for years, since we both were like 10, and we've gotten really close and we know just about everything about eachother.

But, recently, over the past month or two, I've grown to resent him for no apparent reason. I internally criticize every small thing he does, I don't find his humor funny *ever* despite him being known as a 'funny person', and I feel like I don't even want to connect with him or have a conversation with him. And I know he doesn't reciprocate these feelings because, 99% of the time he's the one initializing conversation with me and trying to hold it.

I guess you could say we just no longer 'connect' anymore. But what do I do in this situation? We're part of the same friend group and just by the social format of my school it's practically impossible for me to just 'stop hanging out with him'. Besides, what do I say, do I go up to him and tell him that I don't want to be friends with him any longer? I don't even know if this is true - maybe I'm just going through a phase where I don't appreciate him.

Use shitty pc but still had fun with friends. Recently all that is gone. Wifi wasn’t payed. Even though I work too I can’t afford that. Been working do a better pc but I’m stupid and don’t buy the proper stuff. 

Regarding my family.  I love them but We’re all pretty much going down a shithole. I work more than my sister who’s four years older than me, I get paid more than her. She has a 1 year old and her bf lived with us but they’re shit heads and always fought bc they both have anger issues. Now she’s stopped going to college again for the second time.

My days now are boring as fuck without being able to communicate with my friends on disc and have a fun time. All I do now is go out with friends which my mom keeps nagging me about though I’m 18 and don’t do bad bad stuff. Yes I do “drugs”. I occasionally hit one rip from my friend wax pen but that doesn’t even effect me. I’m always angry now bc my family’s always angry. It seems like the only time I’m happy is when I’m not with them or listening to them nag.

31,"Never have I ever thought I'd be clueless in my life. Whatever uncertainty I had, I would chalk it up to ""I figure it out. I always do.""

&amp;#x200B;

And to some extent, I did always figure it out. Me and my family moved to America when I was a young boy, around 11 or so. For those of you who don't know, other countries hold some sort of a Green Card raffle. You have to apply for it, as well as pay up a certain fee if you win the Green Card. Well, our family just had that luck, and we won Green Cards for the entire family to move here, in America. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom had to stay in Turkey, my home country. She still has a job there. So it was me, and my Dad when she left. I've had no English, no nothing. Had to learn to cook when I was 12 (Which isn't bad at all), because my dad was working two jobs. I still pulled my weight around, I had to be handy at a young age. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward past Middle and High school, here I am, a college Freshman. At Middle school I stared, having no idea where to go, and what to do. Graduated, and stared at High School, no idea where I go from here. Now it's the same cycle again. I'm staring at College, having no idea what the fuck do to anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this uncertainty's got to stop. I've gotta find a passion for myself, and I think it's always been right under my nose.

&amp;#x200B;

My family always have pushed me to find a passion. Whether it be Guitar, Singing, Music, Sports, Art, Drawing, Football, Cars, Books. Other than writing, I've never had anything that stuck with me enough for me to call it 'a passion.' Even though I am an avid writer, I still consider it a pasttime for me. Something to clear my head with. 

&amp;#x200B;

The one thing I can call my passion, can be developing video games. I would call video games, and the world, the elements around it, a passion. The fact that there are teams of people out there, developing universes, stories, and bringing a medium that can let you be something else in your life, fascinates me. Even though you have one life, you put your hands and eyes in place of other lives. 

&amp;#x200B;

It can be the story of a farmer like Stardew Valley, the stories of soldiers across many Battlefield and Call of Duty games. The themes Half Life plays around with tyranny, and power. The story of Deus Ex, and the line between man and machine. This is an element of the Entertainment industry. Video games have the power of bringing messages, presenting themes, and telling stories in a unique way that a movie, or a novel couldn't. This was my entire fascination with video games, ever since my parents gifted me my first PlayStation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to be some dude who plays games just as a hobby, I want to be a person who develops them. Who works in a company, with the same goals and achievements in mind, with like minded people. I want to flourish video games to be something more important in my life. I no longer want it to be sidelined, and I'd like to bring it to the spotlight, turning it into a career. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am scared. I am very, very scared. I'm scared that I will be stepping into the real world in my upcoming years. Hell, I already have, in a way. And being honest with everybody here, I am very terrified. Because I'm at a crossroads that might define where I go in my life. I'm scared that I'm making big boy decisions. I am afraid. I'm afraid that I will fuck it up too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was terrified that I always will be lost, not knowing what I'm going to do in life. But it feels like, recently, I've found my answer. I personally feel like working in the video game industry, is something I can put full passion towards, every day, firing on all cylinders. Law work? Not so much. (My current major is Criminal Justice)

33,"Reading the title, I know some will say ""But it is, you just have to do it"".

What I mean is that suicide should not be as taboo as it is, and we as a race would be better off accepting that the desire to kill oneself is one we will never eradicate from human behaviour. And by recognizing that tragic desire and its reality, I believe we can lessen the impact of suicide on those who suffer the loss of loved ones to that fatal, final decision.

I can barely recall a time in my life where I didn't think I would end up killing myself; ever since I was around 8-9, after seeing people jumping from the world trade center towers, after going through abandonment by my father and abuse from my mother, suicide has always seemed like a valid and dignified way to leave the tribulations of existence behind.

Now at 26, the desire to kill myself everyone told me would subside through hard work, therapy and meds, is still strong as ever. Regardless of the progress I've arguably made.

I wish there were suicide centers one could enter to plan for and reach their inevitable death while minding the feelings of those who would have to grieve. Centers where one could register, that would provide mental health guidancr for 5 to 10 years, to try and improve suicidal people's desire to live, before giving them the option and tools to kill themselves painlessly. I'm sure that for every 500 people that would enter, only 1-digit numbers would opt to die. But for those doomed few, such a death would truly be better than living a shell of a life trying to cope with existence.

If I had the resources, and the resources to acquire those resources, I would work to make that idea a reality. I think humanity would benefit from engaging with the thought of suicide and what it means for those who wish for it and those who have to deal with the loss. Instead, suicide is regarded as unnatural, cowardly, and as an insult/betrayal to those content with the wild amazingness of life. And I think that outlook engenders more pain than necessary to everyone involved.

I could go on - but this post is long enough, and typing on mobile makes me want to ki-- not gonna go there. ;)

For those who read this far, thank you - and I hope this post encourages you to take a different approach to such a heavy topic. And for those who might worry I'm at risk and who would post a list of helpline numbers to dissuade me - do not fret; after two unsuccessful attempts 5 and 3 years ago, I am not yet ready to try again, for a little while at least. And despite how some people react negatively when others post the list of phone numbers to call, I for one think it's an amazing thing to do, because any amount of exposure to support systems has potential to spare many people from unnecessary pain.

Have an amazing day/night wherever you may be reading this from. :)",27Nov2018,1
34,"today I saw a homeless person, he looked hungry so I thought I could get him somthing from the shops, I had 20 left and was going to get myself something. I looked at my phone and back at him and decided I could wait till I got home. i went to the supermarket and got heaps of food and a drink for him. the look in his face was amazing. (wish I got a photo) 

i know i could of just walked by (like most people) but I thought that he deserved the food more as I could get some when i got home.

 I've never seen someone open a plastic bag of food like he was a kid at Christmas. it made my day (my stomach not so much lol)

But point is the dingus didn’t think to space the uploads out over the course of a few months so combined with our regular WiFi usage we hit the apparent limit of 1250 gigabytes a yesterday and they shut our internet off. Being a senior in high school rn that is a serious problem I have shit I need to do. Any advice on what to do I’m pretty sure the only options here are to pay the 25$ for the additional 50 gigabytes which he isn’t doing, or wait for it to reset.

Reading this at first gave me immense pleasure, because, when he ended things he insinuated dating me put him in a bad headspace and that fucked me up and I've been feeling extremely guilty ever since. To see that he is still miserable despite NOT dating me for the past few months makes me so unbelievably happy. 

However, at the same time my stupid brain is also ""oh, but that's not good, he needs help"" and all I want to do now is reach out to him and let him know I'm there if he needs support or someone to just listen to him. 

He doesn't deserve that from me, but no-one deserves to feel miserable and alone.

42,"i usually get really fucking depressed in the winter and sporadically through the rest of year as well. up and down all the time. i can tell i’m slipping back into that place again. i’m doing the bare minimum in my classes to keep above failing. i know i could do better but i just. can’t. do. it.
i have zero motivation to do much of anything. i’m letting the few friendships i have fade away. i’ve been holed up in my room alone; i haven’t spoken to another person for 2 days. before that, the last person i hung out with was for casual sex just so i didn’t have to sleep alone. this is a pattern i’ve come to recognize as a form of self harm. i’m also cutting again— it actually helps me feel something.
the weird thing is i can’t even cry; i’m way too used to feeling alone like this but i don’t know how to connect with people. i’m simply apathetic to where my life is headed. i’m not sure i even want to help myself.

Unfortunately, as most people can probably relate, I don't have money or popularity to help people with. I'm about as average as average young adult males go. I'm white, work a part time job at a fast food place, and have pretty standard grades. Nobody really notices me except for the occasional awkward interaction where the other is left thinking I'm autistic because of how socially awkward I am. 

I am content with being unnoticed, but I still want to help. I want to help how the Phantom Thieves from Persona 5 do, or how Sliderman does, or any other superhero who just helps from the goof of his heart and doesn't need to be recognized personally.

46,"I’ve been in recovery from drug addiction for more than a decade. I’ve been in recovery from sex and love addiction for less than 4 months. My fiancé and partner of almost 5 years called our wedding off 30 days before the big day. I was devastated. I began to see that I was addicted to her, that I was addicted to us. I had no identity outside of that relationship. And that was only the beginning. 

What I’m learning now is that I have a need to be validated by other people, I don’t feel like I matter unless I am loved. I feel alone in a room full of people. I felt this way before my fiancé, I felt this way before my last fiancé. It’s always been here, I believe it fueled my addiction to narcotics too. What I think is my truth today is that because I suffered sexual abuse for the first few years of my life, because I wasn’t heard, I wasn’t kept safe, it’s lead me into an intimacy disorder. I attach to people to feel safe because I’ve never felt safe.

50,"I'm writing this at nearly one AM. I'm tired but I don't want to sleep yet.

I have never felt so cold, alone, and weak in my entire life.

It's a funny feeling. I realizer that the majority of my personal connections have little to no meaning. The friends I have are hardly close, as this self-post demonstrates. Turning to any of my friends seems alien and like a cry for help. I'd throw a wrench in their social dynamic if I spoke up about how cast aside I feel at times. Taking that from them seems wrong. Burdening them with this shit seems selfish.

Making new friends is an option. I lack the social skills the majority of my peers have however. Just never developed them, either through negligence or justification through other circumstances. I moved a lot as a kid and would resign myself to loneliness as an alternative to having my friends taken away from me again. It might be too late for me to ""get"" social interactions. I'm getting older and I feel my teenage years were squandered by my shitty behavior. That behavior is coming back to kick my ass right now and it hurts. It hurts so badly. I wish I could have the ability to talk to people and understand them on a human level. Despite my best efforts I'm disinterested in most people and their lives. I want to know people and connect with them on a more intimate level. However the walls I've built around my are strong. They aren't so easily toppled.

I don't know what the point of this was. I started writing it with tears in my eyes but now I'm just tired. If anyone reads this, honestly, I don't know what to say.

54,"My relatives have a skewed idea of what ""unconditional love"" means. My mom was dismissed by her mother, and she passed her coping skills on to me. Even if it was not intentional. She was not the role model she thought she was. She showed me weakness, she taught me how to lie and how to manipulate. I am not angry with her - that is the world that she knew. I have my own world. I need to establish mine, and break the cycle. Whether I have children or not, I'm also an influence among my peers, positive or negative. Learn from her pain, and learn to love yourself. You do not want to be 64 years old, while your daughter sits in a waiting room not sure whether you will live or not. Don't be that person. Be loud. Speak out. Don't be ashamed of your pain. Find ways to relate to people. Release your burden, and the world will give back. Every day, breathe out the stress. Tell yourself that today you are not the young girl that everyone was ashamed of. You are you. You are strong. You have somebody that actually sees that, and believe in you. You have somebody to teach you what unconditional love truly is. Accept it. Accept the world. You are insignificant, and you will never live up to the expectations on yourself - because they are not realistic. Start with every encounter you have. Try your best to make everybody happier than when they met you. People need to be heard. Don't roll your eyes. Have patience. Practice breathing. Listen to what they have to say.

I can already imagine the impatience and irritation from these people when they realize I’m a slow learner and also am not good at holding conversation.

But this statement doesn’t just apply to the job. It also applies to me in every area of my life. Simple things for other people take so much from me. I can’t be alive. I can’t even hang out with people since I can’t make friends. I cat talk to people and keep them interested in me for longer than 10 seconds. I can’t kill myself because I’m afraid it will go wrong.

I broke up with my ex a year ago. I keep telling myself that I'm over it, that I have moved on and that I am once again happy with life. I thought so , too. 

But last night I had a dream where I got back with her amidst some circumstances, and the dream brought back all the happy parts of the relationship. We were laughing, goofing around, and generally just ignoring the world in front of us for ourselves. We were telling each other the sweetest things. It felt like young love again, and I felt like the happiest man in the world... until I woke up. 

I don't get emotional very much...but that absolutely broke me. Once I realized it was all a dream I started crying. The abrupt return to reality was just too overwhelming and harsh for me to handle. 

More than anything, this dream made me realize how much I missed being in love. I've had a few short flings after I broke up with her, but none of them felt the same. I think this dream did something to make me realize the fact that I still haven't found complete closure. In a way, I think it has set me back significantly.

68,"Over Thanksgiving break, I decided that I wanted to learn a new language.  So I did some research, watched some videos, read some tips, and made a plan on what milestones I wanted to reach in the next 3 years.  I got excited thinking about the possibility of being semi-fluent over the next few years, and that only motivated me more.  I got some introductory materials and hit the books *hard*.

On Sunday night, I wrapped up another session of reading, writing, and listening practice.  By this time, the excitement was already wearing off and the doubt was creeping in.  Vocabulary wasn't sticking as well as I expected.  New words and concepts seemed to bounce off my brain by the next morning.  Being even semi-literate seemed so far away, and fluency seemed almost impossible.  But I told myself before bed that I had a whole lifetime to become fluent, that I was in no rush, that I could take my time.

Today, the Monday after a 4 day holiday weekend, I was exhausted.  Work was a particular drag as I was reminded that I'm overdue for a vacation.  I camehome early since I'm too tired to concentrate, and there they were: today's planned lesson, flashcards, drills, and listening recordings.  It took the rest of my strength just to do the flashcards and an hour and a half had already passed (double the time it usually took).  I gave up on the rest.

I already see the pattern.  Here's what I anticipate for the rest of this week.

Tomorrow, Tuesday, I will probably buckle down and plan on do a little bit more than I want to get over the guilt of not meeting my own expectations from today.  But Wednesday, I'll be too ""busy"" or ""tired"" and decide that I just need a break.  Thursday, I choose not to even look at the materials.  And by Friday, a whole week after I decided to pick up a new language, I will quietly resign and move on to something else.

This is sort of what's predictable about me: that I give up far to easily because of some setback or failure.

But here's the difference about this time: I'm planning on this failure.  I'm anticipating it.  Maybe I'm wrong above, and this week I'll do better.  But I know there's going to be more than one moment in the next 3 years where I will throw up my hands and quit. After that moment happens, however, and after the cursing and the tears and the disappointment, I will take solace in a simple truth: if I decide to start over again, it'll be easier and faster than the last time.  And the reason that I know this is truth is because no matter how much I let my new languge skills atrophy, for the rest of my life, it will never reset to zero.

72,"I am a male in my 20’s and am currently staying with my mother in her mid 60’s who lives alone. My younger brother is also here. For the past two months my mother has been receiving phone calls throughout the day from various numbers with no answer on the other line. I assumed they were telemarketers or something, and still have no idea as to what they were but they have stopped as of the past few days. Up until now my mother has been picking up the phone and ending the call without saying hello because it has been happening so frequently. 

The house is large, 3 floors and a separate garage that has a second story itself. Too large for a single person. I have been staying on the bottom floor and was watching a movie at around 10pm when I noticed in the driveway a tiny red light moving around. I assumed it was my brother going into his car, but the light continued past the car and onto a back bedroom sliding door. I could not see anything but pitch black darkness and a small red bobbing light. 

I immediately woke my mother and told her to phone the police, then out of anger or instinct I opened the door and said “hey, who is that?” No answer and no running. That terrified me, all I could see was this small red light start slowly moving back out of our personal driveway and onto the neighborhood driveway that connects to three other houses. At the foot of our gravel driveway the light stopped, and I grabbed a hammer lying on the ground and kept saying “hey!” half heartedly thinking it was a possible neighbor walking their dogs. The light stayed there pointed at me and I stared into the darkness at it maybe 20 or so feet away for 10-15 seconds saying “hey!”. No response, then the light slowly trailed off half-jogging/walking away into the darkness toward the major road. I didn’t chase for obvious reasons.All I could tell police is I saw a red light, the person must have been dressed in complete black. 

The only thing I could come up with was it was a possible infrared camera or something. It’s currently 4AM next day and I am officially spooked. I have a floodlight outside, am armed, however when this person was walking outside the room I was in on the bottom floor it was incredibly obvious I was right inside watching TV, there is a very large undraped bay window to the outside and I had all the lights on. Whoever it was clearly didn’t care and clearly didn’t run when I opened the door, they even stood there for an extra 15 seconds with the little light. We are in the county and no one ever enters our neighborhood drive who doesn’t live in one of the houses. We just went through bottom floor renovations and had a flatscreen sitting unused directly in the room they were approaching, I don’t know how they would know that. 

I feel paranoid and like I’m going crazy or something. It’s around the holidays and I fear something bad is going to happen and there’s nothing I can do, I have been fixing to move as well but that’s not a possibility at this point. What should I do now?

77,"So, I noticed that in the past months something weird has been happening to me. Whenever something puts me down, I take too long to come back to my ""normal"" mood even though I racionally do not care about what made me sad anymore.

Example: last week, I was upset with my bf because of something he did. We talked, he apologized and I was truly ok with it, but it took like 3 days for me to cheer up and feel normal and not down anymore. Yesterday we had another discussion and we resolved it, but again, I still don't feel like talking to anyone or smiling or seeing my friend who I have a meeting with.

My mood is not cheery, I feel I am more apathetic and neutral than I'd like to be, but I cant tell when I'm below the neutral line. Wish I could feel better faster",27Nov2018,1
79,"I guess the best, most direct way to phrase this is to say that I don't have any hobbies. I have scoured the internet for advice after 1) a bad breakup and 2) a psychotic breakdown (all in the same day! woot woot) and have been dealing with severe depression for over a year, and all of that is fine and good, but all the advice is like ""go out with your friends! focus on your hobbies! challenge yourself!""

And this has been hard for me. Until up about a month ago, I didn't really have any friends (I'd managed to scare them all off, or they sided with ex). And I didn't particularly want to challenge myself (I guess I still don't, really, but I have). The only issue is... hobbies. I don't really have anything I do in my free time besides play around on apps or check out reddit or sometimes smoke or drink. I used to have hobbies for sure, but I spent about a year in a relationship with a guy who was a fine, decent person, but who mostly just sat around all day and watched TV and drank, and because I lived with him, I started doing the same.

My hobbies used to be: I liked to write and to draw and especially to read. But now, whenever I try to start up again, with the writing / drawing I can't seem to think of anything good and when I try to start I just end up getting frustrated at ""how long it's taking"" (even though that should be a good thing! I want something to fill my long, boring hours with!). And with reading, my attention span seems to have shrunk to a horrible points where I can't get into reading a book (or at least one of the new ones I've chosen) without checking my phone, playing a game of Clash, checking twitter, getting up to refill my water bottle, etc.

I used to like to go on runs as well, but I've gained 80lbs in one year and it's no longer a stress reliever but rather a hellish exertion to run like I used to. I know I should be building up to where I used to be, but like....

... shouldn't hobbies be fun?

Does anyone have any recommendations?

80,"6 months ago I lost my baby. She was born premature and passed away hours later. Today I had a bizarre dream. I was in a garden carrying two eggs. I accidentally dropped one egg and it was full of blood, then right away the other egg began to hatch. I could feel my boyfriends presence with me although I could not see him. Once the egg hatched the chick inside of it was disabled. Although we didn’t care, we were just amazed with the chick, we loved it as if it were our child. I don’t know what any of this means. I don’t know if the bloody egg is related to my loss, or if the hatched chick is trying to tell me I’ll have another baby (with a disability?)

81,"So, last night I had troubles billing my paypal cash card so I thought it'd be a quick and easy fix as the merchant told me just to call up paypal to cancel the current authorization that was pending, so I did.

The call tree gives you no option to speak to a human being so you have to literally spit the words ""customer service"" or some other phrase the bot doesn't understand in order to talk to an ACTUAL person, so I was placed on hold for about 20 minutes - 30 minutes.

As soon as I got to an actual human being, he verified my info, read off the charges I wanted cancelled and told me he'll do that right away, puts me on hold for about 5 minutes to come back and tell me ""I'm sorry m'aam, but I just spoke to the specialist and I'm not authorized to take any actions on your account, so I'll transfer you over to the person I just spoke to"".... Once again I was put on hold, this time to never be taken off. I was on hold for 3 hours until the time that was their closing time and then finally hung up because according to their hours, they completely closed at that time...

It just honestly feels like paypal was just avoiding having to do anything and was hoping I'd give up, or just simply they don't know what they're doing at their call centers.

82,"I've like a guy before. Broke my heart when things didn't happen. But that's it. I've always ending up dating guys that showed signs of liking me, then realising that I don't feel the same way and screwed things up. And the most recent is finally giving me a wake up call.

We are both lonely. And we share the same love language. He really liked me. I liked being with him. I feel loved for once because we shared the same love language, and because he was not being shy about it. Then I realised I liked the company and how I felt. But not the person he is. I screwed up. It was too sudden because he is confused. I'm confused too. I thought I'd finally be able to like someone. People say that liking someone is supposed to be a direct feeling. You should know it. But I guess I made things complicated. I don't know if I would ever get into a proper relationship because I keep hurting people like this. I don't mean it. I really don't. I want to be able to be loved, and also love the person at the same time.

83,"I ended a very toxic relationship about 2 months ago and I can’t stop thinking about it. Not in a sad way or in a way that makes me miss him; but more in a “I can’t believe I stayed after he did that” or a “i can’t believe he thought that this was okay” kind of way. It doesn’t make me angry or sad or anything, more of a just a passing thought if I’m spacing out. Since I’m not experiencing any negative emotions when I think about it I’m not concerned about it affecting my health but it does get annoying that it’s still on my mind and I worry it’ll prevent me from being able to fully move on in a timely manner. I think part of the problem is that he didn’t care that what he was doing was so unbelievably wrong. And I just have a hard time understanding how someone could be so hurtful and ignorant. And when I did tell him he’d tell me I was wrong. (I had to ask him multiple times to not make jokes that triggered me, to not talk about how much he liked choking other girls while we worked on me being comfortable with trying choking, to not talk about other people while we were scening, etc. And even after I asked he’d continue doing those things). I’m a stubborn person and it drives me crazy when people are 100% wrong but they can’t see it. I know I can’t make him change (I found out that I’m not the first person that had to deal with his bullshit) but how do I stop having these arguments in my head at random times?

The cause of death is she got overdosed on  Marihuana , and before she died she left me a note telling me how she struggled through the months of the new country she moved in :

&amp;#x200B;

She was bullied for being diffrent , for being asian ( fuck all the racist go fucking kys ) , she hated herself for knowing the truth about her , she was  torrmented by the fact that she is the cause of her mother cheated with another man , she disgusted herself and her mother for it , her mother ( being a bitch she was ) ran away and left her with her dad , he was a nice man but after the truth was revealed , he became broken and end up as an alcoholic who also tormented her for the thing she had no controlled of ( he's is not deserve to be called a man , i wish he drown by the alcohol he consumed to beat up his daughter ) 

And it's all led to yesterday , she decided to that she had enough on her life and decided to let go , she took what left of her farther weed and smoke until she passed out and her heart stopped 

&amp;#x200B;

I was furious when i get the news , i blame it on everyone and even herself for keeping it till the end and text me this , i tried to text her back , tell her how meaningful she was to me but she ignored all that , i called her and she won't even picked up ( just later i got informed by her causin that the authority found her phone broken on the ground ) 

The furious continued till now , she was a wonderful person  , this life doesn't deserve her , all the people who is lucky enough to have her in their life break and destroyed her 

&amp;#x200B;

 i hoped that she's going to have the life she deserve in the afterlife ,  god owed her that and i would give up everything so i can turned back and helped her get through it

For me , i felt empty , after all those angerness mixed in with sadness and hatred thought about she left me behind ,  i hoped that she's going to have the life she deserve in the afterlife ,  god owed her that and i would give up everything so i can turned back and helped her get through it

85,"I’m back living with my parents as of a few months ago. I have a BS in biology and am very musically inclined. I was on the road to be successful as a musician but I wasn’t strong enough to make it work. I’ve tried to go to school in Sweden so i can study for free and live there (I’m half Swedish) but undergrad programs require fluent Swedish, and I’m worried I won’t get into any of the master level classes in English I’ve applied for. If I don’t get in, I’ll be back living with my parents. I’m applying for nursing schools for next fall here in the US because I just feel I need to do something, ANYTHING, to make myself employable and to have some semblance of a career by the time I’m 30. Midwifery sounds interesting to me, but I always felt art was my calling, so it feels like I’m just going through the motions by applying to schools. 

I can tell my parents don’t know how to help me and I don’t have a strong support system. I have no friends here and all my friends are back in school and have their own lives. I just wish I fucking knew what I wanted so I could feel good about my life and have something to work for.

86,"I've always been confident, I know I've been confident, comfortable in my skin... Its very hard to explain why you're afraid, even if you're not really afraid. I've never had a problem expressing myself or talking to people. I have great friends from highschool, from university, everybody knows me to be this really confident and cool guy. But nobody knows, I have never been in a relationship. I have never had any romantic affairs. I have never loved and I have never been loved.

So there's this girl, she's smart, she's kind, she's sweet and she's so beautiful. She's in two of my classes this semester, and I cannot get her out of my head. 

At first, I lied to myself, I denied this feeling for a while, I thought that it would be unfair to feel attraction without having developed a friendly  relationship first. But then it became impossible to speak in the same circle of people as her, I'd bite my tongue and forget my words. Her smile made me feel stupid and pathetic. I pleaded for advice from a mutual friend, she's been trying to help me for while now, but I have to admit that I'm not brave. She's been pushing me and I've let her down everytime. She says its fine, that it gets easier over time, that the more times I try the more comfortable I'd be, that I may do it on my own eventually. That I'd be confident. 

We'd steal glances all the time, whenever I get caught I concede, I grin and she just smiles like it didn't mean anything, because she'd just go about her business afterwards.

So here I am two weeks away from finals and I haven't spoken to her intimately... I have had every possible chance and yet I've failed everytime she has spared a moment to speak to me. She hasn't made a move and neither have I, but she's fine and I'm upset. 

I keep thinking, why don't I confess, why not just tell her I love her.. But this isn't like in my dreams where I can wake up if it goes bad. I'd be devastated if she declines. I might kill myself if she rejects me. Thats how far I've fallen in love with someone who's charmed by a mask I wear to hide from love.

102," Hello guys,

​

I originally posted this to r/relationships, but I was advised that this post might be more suitable for this subreddit. This has become more of a rant, but here is the TL;DR.

​

TL;DR: I start good in relationships, my partners fall for me fast, i then begin to neglect, controll them and overall being awful to them. How can I improve myself? (Already in Therapy)

​

For starters, I am 27 years old. English isn't my first language, so please bare with me.

​

I recently was diagnosed with being Bipolar Type 2 and having a paranoid personality disorder. Basiscally due to my upbringing it is very hard for me to take face value of things being said and I question everything. This stems from a very hefty divorce of my parents, which took longer than 4 years. Especially my mother involved me heavily, I was 9 at the time, using me and manipulating me, something which I just begin to realize with the therapy I am doing. As stated above, I question everything. Even when friends, which I rarely have, tell me something, I often times look for the hidden meaning.

​

But why I am asking this quesiton is as follows. My relationship with my Exgirlfriend just ended. When I met her, I had this she is the one feeling, which made the start very smooth and unlike any relationship I had. Rather quickly we lived together, but due to my issues, being undiagnosed at that time, the relationship went downhill pretty fast. It was on/off often, there where weeks where we shared an apartment and didn't talk. In the end she broke it up, then we tried again, then I broke up after being released from the mental hospital after having suicidal thoughts. She came over 2 days ago and stayed 2 days, in which we talked alot and in which I realized that I might be one of the worst partners of all time.

​

Basically she told me that I neglected her in every way. I wasn't able to be there for her when she needed me the most, be it when she was sick or be it when she was feeling down. She cried alot cause of my coldness, which in reality was just me having such emotional issues in my own head. I manipulated her often, unknowingly as in I didn't know I was doing that, be it when trying to mend things or just things like her having male friends. I seem to have a knack to say the right things when the relationship is nearly over, but then being to my own, cold and neglecting self when I got her to stay. We barely went out. Instead of pushing her to do things she loved, such as modelling, working out (something which I love aswell), or just meeting her friends and family, I basically made her not doing those things, by inquirying what she was up to and implying distrust in her, and thus making her feel bad.

​

These are just examples of my behaviour and after talking with her for so long, I came to the realization that this relationship might be the one where it was most extreme, maybe because of living together, but a few things are things which I tend to do often in every relationship. In the beginning I am the perfect boyfriend, caring, active and loving, but after a few months I get to my old self. How can I improve?

​

I realize that I need to work on myself before I start anything new. And to be honest I am not over my exgirlfriend. I think she was the one, and it hurt alot when she was able to tell me all the reason as to why it will never work and I wasn't able to say anything rational which is in favour of the relationship. I love her and I want her to be happy, which is why I have to let her go. But I will never be happy being like this, do any of you have experience and any hints for me? I am torn between being motivated and starting ""fresh"" and killing myself to be honest. I am currently alone with no friends, because I neglected them all in the past 2 years. What can I do, how can I improve? Is it something I can overcome, have I just havent met the right one yet? I dont want to hurt anyone, and it makes me deeply sad, that I was able to hurt her so bad, without even realizing it. I always thought of myself as a good person and it hurts me so much, that when reading posts on here, I cant help but realize that she, or other partners of mine, had thousands of reasons to post here, with me being awful.

​

I look forward to your comments, as harsh as they might be. I hope this is the appropriate subreddit.

110,"Yesterday I went to a popular haircut chain place that I've been going to for a long time.  I used to go to a serious stylist (I'm a guy btw) and I'm really happy with what I get now.  I waited and the woman who helped me had  dark fluffy hair on top but a buzz cut around the back of her neck.  She was very sweet, said she was 60 yo, and had some pretty sad stories about her parents who BOTH died of pancreatic cancer within months of each other.  She had to keep working so hired someone at $7/hr to stay with her mom while she went to work cutting hair and, I assume, didn't make much more than that.  

Anyway, so I sat down in her chair and got a look at her picture on her license, and in it she has a buzz cut all the way around.  Like all her hair is 1/8 of an inch long all over her head.  All that is fine, I don't care, but now I realized she's wearing a wig that doesn't come close to covering up her buzz cut.  She hasn't let her hair grow out, it seems.  She likes her hair that way?  But she wears a hair hat to her job, OF CUTTING OTHER PEOPLE'S HAIR.  

I'm happy with my hair cut, I just find it humorous.  I live in Las Vegas, so I'm not too moved.  My mom, years ago,  held a garage sale and an Elvis impersonator, in full costume, along with everyone else showed up picking through her stuff.  No, I live a normal life, is what I tell people.

Maybe i can spice it up and get suicidal.

I had to take a flight to the capital of my country, nearly missed it, panicked after the flight, took a train and felt enthusiasm for this new adventure, got to the train hub, decided to go to a take away fast food, ordered, paid, waited for the food, after 5 minutes i turn, probably they forgot me, dude from fast food chase me, give me the food with some kind of ""wtf, man"" look.
Ate it. Egg, bacon and cheese. Basically a gummy egg, cardboard bacon and cheddar colored glue.
Feel depressed, sit at the bus stop with a soda cup in hand.
I'm not a gorgeous man, plus most of my clothes are so patched up that no homeless with a bit of self respect will ever use.
Someone drops 50 euro cents in my half full cup of soda. For fuck sake.

Got to the b&amp;b, had to wait 30 mins because of Christ knows. 
Thank you random black dude selling umbrellas, you saved my life.
Enter the place, pay, got to the room.
Slept like 3 hours fully dressed because they forgot to give me bed things.
Out to ate, stop to a famous chicken fried fast food, always heard of, let's try it. 
Stop for some other soda and why not beer.
Drink all, turns out that mixing gummy food, beer, soda and sauce is not a good idea.
I'm sitting on the throne, feeling pain, and beer is starting to kick off. 
Damn, probably this is even the wrong sub, but i just want to say screw the exam and go home. If this is the first day, i don't want to live the others.",27Nov2018,1

114,"I'm probably gonna live in this shithole of a house with my parents until im 40, my dad doesn't even allow me to paint the walls in my own room. Why the fuck is it that no one can even afford rent when corporations and the stock market are doing so goddamn great. 
I'm looking forward to the time after college when nobody is going to hire me because I need at least 20 years of experience by the time I'm 25. Yeah and and 3 unpaid internships, all in different cities? What do you mean you can't live in another city without a salary? Oh and don't forget the semester abroad that is required, but costs about 15.000€. You couldn't afford that? Oh well fuck you then, it must be your own fault that you're so poor. Maybe you should spend less money on avocado toast.
Why do I live in these fucked times oh god this is hell",27Nov2018,1
115,"I'm 21. I've have been awarded the principles award in almost every grade that ever held it and everytime it's ever been awarded. I've always been a hard working, productive and sweet with perfect attendance. However, inevitably, life kind of tainted that. 





I am currently work at a call center with extreme high volume since it's the holidays. And I've called out. A lot. And I don't know why. Other then my mental health being the least stablest thing for yet another year. And I feel shitty. 




I dont want to be like this. At my other jobs, I showed up to work every shift and only called out when I *really* needed to. And these were at fast food restaurants, with shitty management. The job I currently have and the previous jobs were so much better, treated me so good and has given me so many opportunities to grow, if I would have just fucking went to work. 





And now I am probably getting fired. Because I called out after my lunch today. Because I hate my job. Because it depresses me. And I'm not necessarily worried or scared about it. I still live at my parents and they still are so supportive. But I hate being a constant financial burden. I hate feeling like I am failing them. And the reason why I feel shitty is because this is a new low for me. 





Call center jobs use to be for me, but what is missing is, ironically, unity. Being an introvert who's secluded herself for almost 2 years, has taken a massive toll on my mental health. Was great at first, but incredibly lonely at worst, of course. I need a job where I can see people and that's not so high volume to it. I'm super good with computers compared to my peers. I can pick up new programs old and new. 





But I dont know where to go from here. Because I dont want the loop to continue. Where I'd find a job that depresses me.  ",27Nov2018,1
116,"I feel like the stuff people say and speak about here, opinions, likes and dislikes and so on, is soooo different from what people in real life are like.


For example, users in reddit can be extremly mean and harsh, or very wholesome. When in real life most people are just normal.

Reddit humour is quite particular aswell (I like it). Usually self depricating humor and all me_irl and some of these subs are hilarous.

Finally, just to end my rain of thoughts. The sub askwoman, is a good example of very different opinions. Since I work with women mostly as a man, sometimes I  ask about the topics in there, and the answers are usually totally the oposite. I’m not ranting on that sib, it’s just an example.


So yeah some thoughts here I had 😝

119,"It's not totally unexpected because she's been suffering from alcoholism for many years and has been in the hospital with probable liver failure for some time, but I feel sick to my stomach that I had to find out this way. My step-grandfather, her husband, made the post. My grandpa, her ex-husband, sad reacted the post. Like what the fuck? It all feels so grossly casual and insensitive. And now I'm expecting a call from my mom where she's going to break the news and I have no fucking clue how to say that I already know. She's probably going to be livid.

Anyway I guess this is just a reminder to people to avoid posting online about a death if closest family/friends haven't been informed yet. I'm lucky I saw the post AFTER my job interview today.",27Nov2018,1

121,"I'm the first generation of my family born outside of Poland and I'm literally the only person in my immediate (and even extended) family who doesn't speak Polish fluently. Some family members are bilingual but maybe only half of them. I learned a little bit of Polish when I was very young, but my mom didn't enforce it at home since she needed more practice speaking English and I've since forgotten almost everything. I understand only maybe 20% of conversations and definitely can't form full, coherent sentences.

Every family gathering is in Polish and as a result, I never had any sort of relationship with a large chunk of my family; every interaction needs to be translated and it's embarrassing. I've spent most of my adult life being reclusive, anti-social and depressed and it's no fucking wonder, I barely bonded with anyone growing up. I spent a lot of time feeling helpless to my situation and secretly resenting my mother for engineering a language barrier between me and my family. But the reality is that although I missed the prime ""language acquisition"" period of development, I'm 31 now and have made zero effort in the last 10 years to remedy my situation for myself by learning even a little bit of Polish.

Yesterday was my grandfather's funeral and I'm wracked with guilt over the fact that I never once had a direct conversation with him in his life. You can imagine my embarrassment as Polish people approached me in a Polish church after a Polish service for a Polish family, offering their condolences in Polish, and I have to ask everyone to repeat themselves in English.

My grandmother is still alive and I've never had a direct conversation with her either. This whole experience has made me realize that although my mom probably made a poor choice when I was young, I'm an adult and there's no reason I have to continue feeling helpless to my situation. I missed out on so many memories and relationships growing up, it molded me into a very introverted person, but I have the power to change that going forwards. Force your kids to be multilingual in a multilingual family, otherwise they will suffer in the long run in more ways than you might realize.",27Nov2018,1
