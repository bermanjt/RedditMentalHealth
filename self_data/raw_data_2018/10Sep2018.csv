0,"I remember a while ago, at work, someone who used to work where i work (retail job), we were talking about music artists. And he said ""you give off a rockstar vibe"".

I was wearing uniform, though i wear slim (not skinny and not loose) black jeans instead of the trousers they give. And all black nike trainers instead of black work shoes.

I have short hair, nothing long, i dont have tats, piercings, dyed hair. Its just me in a uniform wearing things that were a little off, and i get this comment. I dont listen to rock, but for some reason it felt good for it to be said to me.

1,"Just a thing that's been crossing my mind lately since I've joined the wonderful world of reddit. Lovely helpful people, some assholes yes, some disrespectful and some who just like to jump on the hate bandwagon and have a full scale go at you for god only knows what. They look at your post history and start judging off that. Alot has been on my mind lately, a lot of things just happening all at once and I can't express how I feel anymore in r/depression since I'm banned there. 

I feel like even though I'm behind this curtain and no-one can get me, the anonymous account and accounts that lurk beyond this site...they still somehow get to me with their hateful words, and I don't know how to cope with that.",10Sep2018,3
3,"This past weekend I went to visit my friends in Florida. They go to what‚Äôs considered the biggest university population wise in the country. This weekend I went to bars/clubs. Last night was amazing I got called the life of the party by everyone there. Videos were posted of me leading the dance circle. There‚Äôs this real beautiful girl that was staying with my friends. Even though I wasn‚Äôt her ‚Äútype‚Äù she kept calling me babe around everyone, saying we were in a relationship and was frequently touching me and did not shy away from being super close to me in terms of face to face. 

I got her snap and Instagram which she hardly gives out. Before I left all my friends were saying please visit again soon and I was so much fun. I‚Äôm back at school now and it‚Äôs just really hitting me. I don‚Äôt have friends because everyone assumes I‚Äôm the stuck up preppy rich kid. I‚Äôm not competing athletically in college rn because I have a bad knee so my teammates alienated me. I guess if I had close friends at my own school and went out with them, it wouldn‚Äôt bother me so much or I wouldn‚Äôt feel so down..

Has anyone else dealt with this? Or just the feeling of being down after a crazy weekend or night?",10Sep2018,2
5,"hi redditors! ive been a longtime lurker but never really posted anything. right now, i'm finding myself in a situation where i really need advice and don't know who to ask.

i'm an 18 y/o college student, and i'm currently finishing up a summer class. 

my grandparents have been having serious health problems for a while, and my parents had only just returned from out of the country taking care of them - putting their full-time jobs and all of our lives on hold in the process. my grandmother was scheduled to go into surgery tomorrow, when we got the news this morning that my grandfather just passed. now my parents have been forced to drop everything and go out of the country again for an indefinite period of time to do his last rites. 

this class i've been taking - supposedly an introductory stats class? - has been the bane of my existence since we began. the concepts are a bit difficult, although par for the course with this class. however, my ""professor"" is just a grad student who cannot teach or even explain a single problem for the life of him, and is hellbent on making this class impossibly difficult. 

(for context, the average on the midterm was 37%, while other professors' classes commonly average around 75%.) 

he continues to insist that his exam was not at all difficult after putting a 75 minute time limit on an exam with 30 multi-step questions, ambiguous answer choices and no partial credit. he also refuses to give us more than one problem set or any practice finals, while saying that the reason everyone failed was ""due to insufficient practice"".

**tl;dr** with my family situation to deal with (having to take care of my sibling 24/7 unexpectedly and loss on top of it) as well as the likely chance that i will fail this class even if i work as hard as i possibly can, i just cannot muster up the effort to study properly.

i know this is long, but if you've gotten to the end please offer some advice - i would greatly appreciate it.",10Sep2018,2

Basically, I'm asking y'all to advise me on how to move forward in our relationship, where we don't really talk to each other cause neither is very social, or how to deal with not moving anywhere at all. We have some things in common, like we both enjoy anime, reading, and art. (She draws. I like looking at art that's good. I can't draw all too well, but I have been getting better recently.)

7,"I grew up watching how I met your mother and friends, and community, and every other show that thematically focused on the value of close bonds and relationships with others. In highschool I had tons of friends, but more the quantity over quality type, after graduation I kept in touch with 10, after my first year of college; 3. Since I go to college far from those three, during the semester I struggle to get by. To make matters worse, my school is very socially lacking, no events or clubs or general good vibes on campus. All the events are aimed towards dance (hip hop type) and rap music and sports. Those are three things I'll never have anything to do with. I just fundamentally dislike them. So those on campus that are social, have no common ground with me, so I just exchange pleasantries and move on. This semester i thought things would change, maybe there's still time, but it's not looking great. My roommate was almost a golden ticket as he's a foreign soccer star of the school, beloved by all. But he's very antisocial and dislikes most everyone on campus and is disappointed with the withering social life compared to that portrayed in movies and media. So I'm just stuck in a room again, no reason to talk to others and generally lost. I've dreamt of leaving, having all my credits transfer without a hitch, continuing classes like nothing happened, the same material covered the same way, just else where. I move to my own apartment and have a tight group of friends I consider family. People I trust and care for. But it's all a dream. Instead I'm just a blur in the background of other people's lives as they get the college experience. I'm not even a strange person, I'm not some basement dwelling anime binging, sexist, nice guy, wanna be, creepy neck beard. I'm just so different from everyone here I feel like an alien. Hell a friend from high school (the only one) came here with me but he ghosted me asap. Acts like he doesn't know me. Shits terrible right now. ",10Sep2018,19

18,"Long Post..

Towards the end of high school I started dating this girl that I ended being able to see spending a future with. I had dated a few girls before but she was the first person I truly saw a future with. But unfortunately things didn‚Äôt last and we broke up. I won‚Äôt go to deep into it but basically it was because of my lack of understanding of her faith and that fact that I myself am/was not a believer. That little fact would cause little disagreements between us but nothing that would lead to us fighting or ignoring each other. 

During the time we were together, we fell hard for each other. And it happened fast. It was maybe a month into our relationship when she first told me that she loved me. And I loved her as well. She became the first person that I really loved. But a few weeks later we ended things. She had lost a very important figure and her life and needed to be closer to family, and I had to let her go because things could not continue the way they were.. we were becoming toxic for each other in a way. By that I mean we would spend days with each other, ignoring our friends and would just focus on each other. To our defense we were both traveling a lot at the time so we wanted to spend as much time together as we could. But it did get a little out of hand to the point of us staying out together to the early hours of the morning just enjoying being with each other. She would try and convince her parents to let her stay the night even though she knew that they wouldn‚Äôt let her. Things like that. Looking back on it I really wish that I had told her that we needed to keep living our separate lives because spending so much time together had a negative impact on our relationship. And because of all of these things, we broke things off.

Now we go to two different universities. She remained in state while I moved half the country away. Since we broke up, my life has drastically improved. I‚Äôve always loved fitness but was distracted from it when I was with her. Since then I have dedicated myself to going to the gym, my iron paradise, and working on improving myself - and I have been successful. Before meeting her, it had been my dream to join the US marines.. but when I was with her I forgot that dream. I had lost my entire direction in life. Since then, I have found my passion. I have found the career that I want to spend my time working towards and achieving. I have associated myself with the Marines PLC program on my university‚Äôs campus and have been getting my sorry ass up early in the mornings to participate in PT with people who are willing to push me to places that I never thought I could reach. I have come out of my shell, made friends, joined a fraternity with a bunch of guys that I am proud to call my brothers. I am now happier than I have ever been at any previous point in my life. But now... I miss her more than ever.

She was everything that I wanted in a partner and more. I miss being able to call her mine. I miss the long phone calls at night where she would fall asleep on her end of the line just because she wanted me to be with her when in a sense when she did. She was comfortable with my silence. She didn‚Äôt care that I wasn‚Äôt a comedian. It might‚Äôve helped that my actions were hilarious to her at times but the fact that I didn‚Äôt have to try with her made being with her amazing. She was the most amazing woman I had ever laid my eyes on. The way that she would giggle a little bit after we kissed, the way that she would smile a little bit every time I quickly gaze at her when I was driving. How she never let the world knock her down. I literally couldn‚Äôt have asked for anything else. It may sound like I have put her on a pedestal with the belief that she had no imperfections but she had her fair share of them, just like we all do, but regardless of those imperfections I loved her. 

It has been a while now since we broke up. I have since recovered from the heart brake that followed the break up and have put myself back out into the dating scene, but yet, I have not been able to move past her. After every date I go on with someone, regardless of if the date was good or bad, my thoughts always find their way back to her. I can‚Äôt help but think how life is for her nowadays or how college has been treating her. Part of me just wants to call her or text her and tell her and talk about how life has been since we split up. To ask her about how she‚Äôs changed. To tell her about how I‚Äôve changed. But then again.. how much have I really changed. I know I overthink these sort of things but, what if she thinks badly of me now? What if she never responds if I do text her?  

I now more than ever want ‚ÄúUS‚Äù to come back together (that was a little thing that she thought of that she thought was cute about our initials), but yet I know that as of right now, I cannot have her because while I am so close to finding myself.. if I try to get her back, I might just lose myself again. But if I still want her when I do find myself, should I pursue her? I have no idea as of now and no hope of knowing what I will think when that comes around. I just want to see her smiling face again if I have the chance.

&amp;#x200B;

BACKSTORY:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a news editor for a local news television station. I've been working here for almost 3 years, and for the most part it's... meh. My coworkers are fantastic, the pay is great, but it does take its toll. Sometimes it's from depressing news days, most of the times from my bosses.

From the very beginning of my job, I was pretty much set up for failure. This is the most understaffed station in the city, and when I was hired the only other pm editor on staff quit 2 months after I arrived. I tried to step up, and for most shows I could get by, but these circumstances caused slip ups. I'd miss a sound bite that was supposed to play on air, I couldn't get a video put in on time, I put in file video that has the wrong seasonal weather. Various mistakes over the span of a year. With any late night show mistake I'll take the blame. I had a bad habit of procrastinating, and by the end of the shift it's hard to feel motivated. But we've got 2 earlier shows that seem impossible to edit by yourself. The workload is intense, and you've got no time to put details into your projects. That wasn't how I was taught to edit, and it was hard to adjust to a job like this.

Long story short of the past few years, they don't allow me to help with anything. The other 2 editors are given every special project, and I'm there as back-up help. I'm mostly okay with this, not because I don't want to do special projects, but because I'm fearful of messing up. My managers get incredibly angry with me when I'm a part of a mess-up. I've gotten written up for mistakes I never got a warning over. All of this has caused me to try and keep my head low and not ""rock the boat"" so to speak.

&amp;#x200B;

THE INCIDENT:

So our newscast has been covering an unhinged man's recent run in with the law. We've talked about this man (let's call him H) in the past, since he's got a colorful background here in my state. From politics, to his business venture, H has been an interesting character to talk about. He was arrested, and we needed to beat this dead horse. So when I started to edit his videos, I used the raw video we had in on our hard drives...

H doesn't have the cleanest language, but it's even more apparent when a camera's in his face. H had filmed a campaign video for a seat at the government, and he held nothing back.

I had been in a rush to get everything into the show's rundown, because people are slow to getting me scripts on weekends. Normally it's fine, but then I had one problem after another, and eventually it was 9:45 and half of the show wasn't online.

I didn't have time to watch the video I put in the rundown. My subconscious thought was ""get this in, deal with a flash frame or shriek-y audio later. I was also thinking ""well, this is a campaign video, it's gotta be okay!"" So I put the video in with the audio in the background after a sound bite played, and went about editing the rest of the show...

15 minutes later, I'm still trying to finish editing the show, and I get a call from the control room.

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey, did you know the 'S' 'H' 'I' 'T' was said on air?""

&amp;#x200B;

""...What?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah, did you watch the video? H said it really loud.""

&amp;#x200B;

""I... I didn't know""

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm getting contacted by the managers right now, but we'll talk about it later.""

&amp;#x200B;

The anchors apologize on air, the phones are ringing incessantly, and I'm sitting there shitting my pants while trying to finish the rest of the show. I'm forcing my body to not break down and cry, because I know what's to come. The News Director is that terrifying.  I once went on my normal lunch break during ""severe"" weather, and our helicopter caught a tiny spin up of clouds in the air. No one told me severe weather was happening, because I'm in an enclosed edit bay working my butt off trying to finish entire newscasts by myself. Because I wasn't there, and no one knew how to work the recording system, we couldn't immediately turn it over back on air, and I was berated to the point of tears for 20 minutes during my lunch break on my next work day. 

I'm called by the Assistant Manager first, and all we talk about is making sure the video doesn't archive. This is fine, she's the easiest manager to talk to. She's understanding, kind, and knows how to handle a situation. I can't imagine this news station functioning without her.

I'm then called by my News Director... and it was weirdly minimal. I answered the phone, explained what happened, and took full responsibility with whatever punishment she wants to give me. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Okay... okay. Goodbye.""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still very petrified as to what's coming next. This place has given me severe anxiety, but right now I feel numb. I've worked at a different station, where a person said they were fired after they let ""fuck"" accidentally air. ""But it's no big deal"" he said, ""because there's lots of turnover in this industry, and the good stations would understand things happen like that."" But I'm not in a position to be fired. Sure, unemployment exists, but I've got student loans and a car loan and credit card bills my mom caused under my name I'm trying to pay off, on top of rent and bills. Currently I'm going to try and update my resume over the next few days, and see if I can start doing any freelance editing.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Fucking Crazy Asshole cursed in video, I didn't hear it and sent it into the rundown, ""shit"" aired on television, I'm in major hot water, and could be fired.",10Sep2018,2
32,"Basically I‚Äôm at a stage of my life where girls are starting to notice me a lot more, and it‚Äôs been a little daunting and weird. I‚Äôve been used to getting no attention at all, so I‚Äôm pretty shitty at knowing how to react when a girl is blatantly flirting with me. Lately there‚Äôs one girl who I see every weekend who I have a little thing for, but until a couple of weeks ago we were only really acquaintances. It was one of those situations where hang out with the same group of friends, so we see each other a lot but we‚Äôre both pretty shy (honestly she‚Äôs so hot that it used to intimidate me a little lmfao) and until recently she had a boyfriend so I just assumed she was off limits and we never really talked too much beyond the usual friendly politeness.

But she split up with her boyfriend, and a couple of weeks ago we spent like most of the night talking to each other even while all our other were friends there. It was actually really nice. We actually get along a lot better than I thought we ever would. We were both just drunk as hell and laughing at literally everything the other person said. She kept getting me to dance with her later on that night, and honestly it just felt really flirty the whole time. She was even going up to her friends and going ‚ÄòMr_Jek‚Äôs my new boyfriend‚Äô lmfao.

Now I have one friend who is one of those guys who is just so confident and persistent with girls that he somehow hooks up with someone new every weekend. He‚Äôs had a ‚Äòcrush‚Äô on this girl for a long time, or at least as much of a crush as I think he‚Äôs capable of lmfao. Like he‚Äôs notorious for cheating on any girlfriend he has and he just really can‚Äôt keep it in his pants. I love the dude, but he‚Äôs immature as fuck when it comes to how he treats relationships. I think with her it‚Äôs more that she‚Äôs probably the only girl that‚Äôs really not caved in to his advances, so he sees it as a challenge. He‚Äôs constantly trying to flirt with her hard while we‚Äôre out, and honestly while I think she likes the attention I genuinely think she‚Äôs enjoyed talking to me more. She makes the effort to come to me, whereas she spends her time kinda just trying to keep my friend happy.

So at the weekend there that‚Äôs how things kind of went. My friends know I have a little thing for her now after how much we‚Äôve got along lately, but it was still the usual scene of him flirting with her, and her sometimes coming to me and we‚Äôd joke around a little. The other thing though was another girl we were out with was shamelessly flirting with me. Like to the point where she was literally just planting kisses on my face and trying to unbutton my shirt lmfao. Under different circumstances I would have said what the hell and went for it, but I‚Äôd much rather pursue the other girl that I actually like. My friends thought I was insane cause she is really hot, and while it was a challenge, I didn‚Äôt want to ruin anything with the girl I actually have a thing for. At one point the girl that I like even dragged me away from the other girl, and when I laughed and asked why she just shrugged and told me I should dance with her instead. She kept sticking up for me whenever someone made a joke about me, and when she was leaving she came up and gave me a massive hug, and was all like ‚ÄòI actually love you so much, I wish I didn‚Äôt have to go‚Äô, and honestly I felt pretty sad she left early too.

So basically what I‚Äôm asking is, should I pursue this girl even when my friend has his ‚Äòcrush‚Äô on her? I really don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be heartbroken over it, the dude has girls lined up at like all times and honestly I feel like we have a good thing going. I feel like how that other girl was with me the whole night is the way she kinda views him, we basically both had different people all over us the full night but kept gravitating towards each other instead. I also don‚Äôt know how to go about things like this, like I said my other friend just blatantly flirts with her all night and has had success with girls for years, and while I don‚Äôt to do nothing, seem uninterested and let him win her over, it doesn‚Äôt seem like she‚Äôs too into getting that kind of attention constantly. I dunno though, like I said I‚Äôm not used to girls actually liking me in that way and I completely suck at knowing what to do lmfao. ",10Sep2018,1

When you could've done everything on your own, pursued your own creative endeavours and become successful with them and lived your life on your own terms and be happy that you lived a life that was true to your own self?

40,"Hi Reddit guys and gals. I just want some advice here on things. I am a 26 year old male graduated college 2 years ago and am making my way through the world. I work 2 jobs (technically 3 but it‚Äôs the same industry just 2 different companies freelance &amp; a full time 9-5 job - not in my field) and still feel unhappy. A lot of people can‚Äôt get even 1 job or 1 they like and I have 3.

I live at home which is something of a trend nowadays for people my age which I‚Äôve become okay with however my professional life seems to be what makes me feel down. I feel like i‚Äôm working too hard but I need the income I receive to pay back old debt and to have a good base to start my life. I worry so much about money and being successful I feel like I never have fun or i‚Äôm always uptight. People that run into me who haven‚Äôt seen me in years notice the changes but sometimes it seems impossible to shake the mentality. My girlfriend, friends, co workers, anyone who chimes in seems to have the same opinion. ‚ÄúYou work too much‚Äù or my favorite ‚Äúyou worry too much.‚Äù 

Look, I understand it‚Äôs easy to say life‚Äôs more important than money and work and money doesn‚Äôt give you happiness. But I think money sets you up for happiness. My parents aren‚Äôt rich they didn‚Äôt go to college and have worked like dogs to have a decent life. I have even taken debt from them and helped them in the past which is not important.

I guess I just have this constant fear of dread that I won‚Äôt succeed or I‚Äôll never get my big break to be someone. I‚Äôll always be working multiple outlets to secure a higher income.  And most importantly let myself down as I‚Äôve always told myself I‚Äôd be something/someone. Maybe I just need to accept that the mediocrity of life can happen and I should be with what I have. 

I just want to stop and smell the roses or maybe just be told it‚Äôll be alright. 

Thanks guys would love to talk ",10Sep2018,4

She didn't react to me apart from saying something to her friend who looked at me.

Nothing happened after that and I terrible about it once I wasn't drunk anymore. She might not have been alright with me doing that and I was wrong to think that no reaction meant she was ok with it.

47,"I live in a coastal town of North Carolina, USA that is right in the middle of hurricane Florence's path on just about every projected forcast. I've lived here my entire life (24 years) so I've seen plenty of hurricanes, but nothing this strong. My mother and grandfather live here too, and are flat out refusing to leave. My fiance and I are getting progressively more concerned and are really starting to lean towards packing up our bags and our two cats and heading southwest until the worst of it has passed. 

I've repeatedly expressed my concerns (there are close to two dozen old pine trees in our yard/our neighbors yard within house-wrecking distance if they were to go down, we've seen record rainfall this year so the ground is going to be really soft and there will be a lot of flooding, etc.) to my mother, to no avail. She just hits me with ""if you want to go then go,"" which sounds nice, but isn't what she means. I know her well enough, and can tell by her tone and the other things she has to say about the situation that she wants/expects my fiance and I to ride this thing out with her. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to leave them here. I don't want anything bad to happen to them. But I don't want to risk the lives of my fiance, my animals, and myself because of their backwards ""well it was always fine before"" mentality. Yeah, maybe nothing too terrible will happen and it'll just be inconvenient and everything will be back to normal in a week. But it could also be a catastrophe. After Katrina and Sandy I don't really want to take that chance. 

Is it selfish of me to want to leave? They have a chance to leave and be sure of their safety, they just don't want to take it. I don't want to feel backed into staying in a potentially deadly situation because of their choice, but I don't want to be a bad daughter either. Advice/thoughts would be greatly appreciated. 

TLDR: My town is going to get wrecked by a hurricane. I want to leave, my family doesn't. Am I a terrible person if I leave them to be safe? ",10Sep2018,2

she likes him for awhile because that Plato line is good and sex only has merit when both parties are in the mood.

he writes stories that make him a poor living.

he tells her the old ones, keeps the rest to himself, and reveals what might be hidden in Socrates' thought.  sometimes she catches his spying eye, swiftly passing over the curves she's clad in.  most days she wavers between intrigue and contempt for a man who has nothing but the mind he lives in.

57,"Moomoo is a little beagle/Jack Russel mix that my s/o and I rescued from some people that left her in their backyard for 6 months and barely fed her. My grandfather is 60, has stage 4 brain cancer, and hasn't allowed an animal in the house since my mom was pregnant with me. 

He is not doing well at all. He has a lot of difficulty eating, sometimes just doesn't, and therefore can't take his medicine. He's having a lot of difficulty remembering things, and my mom says that he's so frustrated all the time that he's practically emotionless.

A few weeks ago he was talking to my mom and nana, and made a comment about how since he's going to be home alone so much, he could use a dog. My mom reminded him that I was coming back for a while, and bringing mine with me while my s/o goes to basic training for a few months. 

What I think is going to happen is that he's going to fall in love with her, and by the time it's time for me to rejoin my s/o, its going to be too hard for him to say goodbye, and I'm going to leave her with him until it's his time to go. I have to prepare myself for that. I know I'll be more than okay with it because I trust both of my grandparents to keep her safe and happy, and I know she'll come back, but I would LOVE for her to stay as long as possible.

Quite new to reddit.

I was bright at school.. but it's easy to learn because the attention is on you to grow. Now im 22 and have not much encouragement as everyone tells you to 'just get on with It' or don't have the time to really explore a question with you because they are dealing with their own

I am trying to set up a successful youtube career but keep coming to creative stand stills when trying to come up with a plan. 

In short whenever I try and self teach or converse with myself to develop an opinion. I get so lost and confused. What have people done/or doing to encourage improving ones self - when the problem seems like it needs to be changed within

To see an extra partner as harming your lover by sleeping with them is irrational. There is no harm, only more love. And to limit yourself to one is an unnecessary limit to your own pleasure/receiving of affection. I suppose religious belief may stop this sort of thing but that doesn't explain why irreligious people (who are many) are largely still only willing to have one partner at a time, at least for long term relationships.
