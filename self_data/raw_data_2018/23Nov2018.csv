1,"So I’ve been depressed for over a year now, but in the past 2/3 months it’s gotten very severe. Suicide contemplations creeping in. I’m on anti depressants now 

Around the time it got severe I’d just started college, and I met this girl in my class. On a college night out I kissed her in this club. Since that night we both developed feelings for each other and kissed fairly often, nothing much else sexual. 

My feelings developed quite strongly. Tonight I tried to kiss her and she told me she wanted to just be friends. I’m absolutely crushed. I’m already struggling day to day just trying to keep my mood up to get through the day. I have to see this girl every day and I don’t know what I’m going to do 

She was the only good thing happening in my life and now that’s over. I don’t know what to do, I need a shoulder to cry on ",23Nov2018,1

“The Characters We Love to Hate”  
The problem with attention seekers:  
Telling a story requires character interactions. Even without human characters, characters are generally personified and given personality traits we can identify, appreciate and relate to, or the opposite- Identify, criticize, and dissociate from ourselves. Good story telling will flesh characters out, making even the most unlikable characters still make choices anyone could make, giving them feelings considered only a ‘good’ character could have or making choices only a good character could make creating more than a ‘good vs evil’ dynamic. Asking hard questions, and getting complex answers. For many, these interactions can be a gateway into understanding other’s and their approach to life, love, trials, fears, anxieties, and so much more. Or even how we ourselves could handle unknown territory of our relationships with each other, our actions, and ourselves. These lessons are even more important when portrayed in children’s media. These characters experiences  are lessons to help teach but if you go beyond the end of the story where we talk about what we’ve learned and rather the focus is more on how scenarios play out, you'll find alternative lessons. You may say ‘making fun of people is bad’. But if the whole episode focuses on the proclaimed bad characters saying and doing mean things to other people, you aren’t showing children how to correct the behavior. The show usually shows the main character feeling bad about these actions, but why is the main character not capable of these aggressive traits? And why aren’t we seeing more repercussions, weakness, AND adaptability from them? I want to go over other scenarios that generally play out in children's media what lessons there might be on the surface, but if we look at how the scenario is playing out- what other lessons might we be giving our children about other people? Our reactions? And even about ourselves? But right now I want to focus on one particular brand of character:  
The attention seeker.   
These characters can range from the close unlikable friend to villain. The main character may ‘selflessly’ keep around this aggressive friend, or they may just be another side character who relentlessly tries to ruin things for the main character(s) or they are just pure evil. Regardless, these characters are usually the polar opposite of the main character. Representing flaws we don’t like to see in others, and even regret feelings (and/or traits) we have ourselves.   
We, especially as children, generally identify with the main characters who are ‘inherently good’.   
Characteristics we usually see in most media are ‘cookie cutter’ (meaning generic, a template used over and over again) emphasizing good and bad behaviors that feel more like an expectation and for many who don’t have positive influences the only proper route to take. Kids shows go a step further and generally demonize characteristics that very real normal people are capable of having. These characters aren’t always evil but generally unlikable, over dramatic, and will do anything for attention. They are everything you don’t want to be. So what’s the problem with that?   
The problem with that:  
Reaching out for help is really tough. I mean this is a really big issue we face here in the states. There are a lot of people dealing with mental illnesses or other issues they don’t feel comfortable talking about or asking for help, and it’s because they don’t want to be portrayed as the attention seeker, the ‘faker’ or obnoxious like these characters with these issues portray. For as often as we tell children to ‘seek help’ how often do we see unlikable characters (or at least the character we like to hate) talking openly about their issues vs the main character struggling saying “I can handle this on my own!” with friends jumping to their rescue, begging to let them help…. In real life, people don’t know what’s going on unless you tell them. We seem to still as adults expect people to know what’s going on and become disappointed when no one knows or is coming to our rescue. We seem to portray more of these ‘hero’ characteristics than we like to admit. The very portrayal of the attention seeker in itself creates this idea that this character exists in real life and that's partially true, the person openly seeking help. But within kids shows this kind of person is only looking for attention and has no real problems. I still see people often proclaiming others are making up their problems (even if this person is a stranger) Or we tell ourselves they were wrong for how the sought help, so deserve no help at all.   
The reasons for their attention seeking habits is usually non-existent when portrayed in television. These characters are shown to exaggerate their issues, and their issues are generally based on real problems other people have a problem understanding already. Like abuse from family members, assault, loss, ect. Demonizing real people with real issues, and giving ourselves an expectation of never being ‘that’. I cannot think of a single character who was the ‘attention seeker’ who had a real problem, unlike reality where very clearly these people are going to great lengths to find help, they clearly have problems, even if it’s not the problems they’re talking about. 

The portrayed attention seekers habits.  
The habits generally portrayed by villains, bullies, or the known unlikable friend are as stated before the polar opposite of the main character(s). This creates a well defined line between right and wrong to the shows standards. This doesn’t mean that all the characteristics and habits portrayed are actually right and wrong, but a favorite character doing something you thought was wrong can make you feel more comfortable with the habit. Or feel wrong for habits you have that are being portrayed by the villain.

My penis seems to be bigger when erect and my erections are rock hard (sorry if tmi). My beard is starting to slowly fill out and is getting thicker and my back is getting hairy.

I went through a quite normal puberty growing up; is this possibly a second/delayed puberty? Or is it my body responding to not feeling depressed anymore?

8,"I, 28F, have come to the realization that I am a piece of shit and that I am quickly damaging a lot of my closest relationships. I've always been pretty blunt but it's gone from being someone who ""tells it like it is"" to someone who is considered ""curt"" or just nasty. I am not someone that comes from an entitled background, I didn't grow up belittling people, quite the opposite actually. I grew up poor to lower middle class, the early part of my career was in social work (and despite all of this, I was very empathetic and connected well to my clients) but something about my personal relationships just hasn't felt right.

 I am realizing that I sometimes think I try to help people but I do this by strongly projecting my own opinions and I don't always understand why someone doesn't see my point of view. I tell myself I'm trying to help but really, I'm being pretty judgemental. Then, it's followed by an annoyance that someone won't take my advice to heart, followed up by a passive-aggressive (or flat out aggressive) comment about whatever choice they made. I somehow take their choice personally, even if it has 0 effects on my life. When I say something mean or condescending, I will apologize but my partner made me realized that after that, I just revert back to step one - being judgy AF. He does have a point. I find that because of this behavior, my relationship with my family, partner, and some friends have been strained. I want more than anything to rebuild these relationships and to not be such a judgy POS.

I can go into long detail about why I am like this, stemming back to childhood, relationships, etc but  I don't think that really matters. I find that when I discuss that, I am only trying to justify my behavior and feel more secure in having done whatever I did in the first place.

I know that it all starts with being more secure and taking things less personally but how? What steps do I need to take to become a better person for the people I love? I don't know when this all started but I'm eager to change and the harder I try, the deeper of a hole I dig for myself.

9,"I give up trying. I give up putting in more energy and commitment then what I receive. I give up waiting for time to heal, when every minute I'm on my own like this feels like a lifetime. I give up pretending to care.

I just feel so angry, so hostile. Towards everything. Myself, my passions, everything I thought I loved. I've failed. I've failed at everything I wanted. Failed everyone I loved.

There is no great plan. There is nothing but what we have in front of us and what we have in us. I want to make something of this life, because this is all we have. To change my world and make it a better, happier place for myself and the people I care about. I've failed that already. I'm letting myself lose everyone. I could have been more for someone, and now they are gone. 

Nothing compares to the pain of losing a parent. I am hurting so much. Why now? When the only thing I could give you was my suffering. Why now? When you won't ever see me make something of my life. When you won't ever see happier times. It's not fair.

I just want to disappear, but I can't. I don't want this life to be some meaningless will to survive, but that's what it has been so far. In having so much 'strength' to get through what I have, I have lost so much of myself. And I fear I am now losing more.

I just want a moment of weakness. To take a risk to be happier. But I know I'll wake up tomorrow, and continue the same routine. I know that no matter what I try to do or where I go in life, I will always be a prisoner to illness. This irrational part of me wishes I flare up, so I can feel that physical pain again. So I can feel alive. But I can't, I won't. This is my last chance. If I get sick again, there's no other medication to try.

Right now I feel nothing. I do not care. I do not matter. I am not needed anymore. I can be discarded and replaced. ",23Nov2018,1

13,"This is something I’ve been thinking about posting for a bit, so here goes. 

My friend and I watched the Shane Dawson documentaries on Paul brothers, sociopaths etc. 

He says to me that I’m kind of like that (in a joking way) like he’s always felt off around me

He starts to actually believe it, asking me all sorts of questions from quizzes he finds online, tests my ego and I’m fairly sure he tried to see me around other people , how I act

He says to me that I’m totally a sociopath and there’s no way I could tell him differently without “lying”....

So I notice things about myself, like how when I’m alone, I’m totally unreliable, very cruel. For example if I’m home alone, it’s totally ok to kick the dog around. I know it would be wrong in other people’s minds, but I don’t feel bad at all

What’s really got me believing this is that research says that a sociopath is formed, through rough experiences in childhood. My family drama is a bit crazier than you would believe, and I think it could be the circumstances to make me that person.

I don’t know if this is the right sub but I need help. I have to either confront it or just shake that friend off. Thanks everyone.

I was in college at the time but I pretty much just lost it and did a bunch of stuff that was super dangerous and also embarrassing at the same time. I just got out of the hospital after three months earlier this week. I hate it in there so much. I thought I would never be allowed to leave. Part of the reason they kept me so long was because a) I guess I’m resistant to a bunch of drugs, and b) I didn’t think that I was sick so I would be bad about taking any of it seriously.


I still don’t even 100% believe I am sick. Maybe like 50% chance. I know this is stupid but at the same time I know I’m not sick. I hate how the medicine makes me feel and I can’t not take it because they inject me with needles and if I don’t go to an appointment I get in trouble with my social worker and my parents, who at this point are completely supporting me. I really don’t like being dependent on people like this.


I wish that none of this had ever happened and everything could be like it was before. I used to be so good socially and now I can’t talk right because I am super sedated off of my Invega. This feels like one of those nightmares where you completely believe everything that is happening and are terrified. I hope I wake up from this, I say that completely seriously. 


But anyways, if in the case this is not a dream and I have to live like this for the rest of my life, that sucks. Whenever I have to talk about schizophrenia it makes me so uncomfortable. Even writing that word. I think my subconscious believes that if I don’t acknowledge I am sick, then everything will be ok. But where I am right now I think that there is a 50% chance I am sick.

28,"Bit of a warning but long read ahead

So a bit of background info:

Last year I left my parents home and moved to a completely new state because I thought I would be happier living with my girlfriend than being miserable with my parents. Since then we've got an apartment, for the most part we're happy, and I got a new job. I even obtained a license in Six Sigma and looking for a better job. 

Now Im freaking out because my teeth are in extremely poor condition. Here are some highlights:
*My top 2 molars are completely eroded on the inward sides. It feels like a downward hill when I rub it with my finger
*My bottom molar is cupped
*Im pretty sure I see a hole in one of my back teeth

There is no pain in my teeth, but I just know for a fact I fucked myself possibly beyond repair. This was all caused by a myriad of things:
1. I'm already complacent in terms of dental hygiene. I barely brushed my teeth even back then because of depression and laziness. This is because usually dental checkups/cleanups would put be back on the right track. But back then I was on my parent's dental insurance and I personally didn't pay a dime. I haven't had a dental visit in about a year and a half now and it shows. When I got my new job I actually decided to opt out of Dental because i work part time (5 days per 2 weeks). Now i work 8-9 days per 2 weeks but back then i thought we needed to save every penny. It was one year without dental, what could go wrong?

2. As I said I work part time. It's at a hospital and I work from 6 pm to 230 am. So I usually get up at 11 am usually and got bed at 3. At night im sometimes too tired to brush my teeth.

3. I am addicted to soda. 1-2 cans a day. Im pretty sure I swish a little bit too by accident

Im not ashamed to see a dentist, and i signed up for a dental ppo for next year. But im worrying about multiple things:
1. The cost. I only have about 1 month of rent in savings. I've been living paycheck to paycheck. I don't want to have operations done on me if i can't afford it now or in the future. And no, this is not savings all from my new job. These are savings that dwindled from my old job (I had 7k from an old internship now its 800).
2. While im picking up a lot of shifts part time, my hours are getting cut back (new staff). Im applying to new jobs since i got my certification by i feel that will process will be months long before finding a new job.
3. What happens if i just don't do anything about it? Will all my teeth fall out? Will that effect my chances of getting a new job and just cement me into poverty?

On top of the shame of the thought of losing my teeth im worried sick thinking about how much this will cost me even with insurance. I know what mistakes I've made. If i could kick myself in the past i would. But all of this have been driving me with almost suicidal thoughts.

I don't know what my options are at this point.

I now live in really close proximity to my family, and though I love them, they are a constant source of stress, and I just wish I could get some distance. By some combimation of the culture here and the psychological barriers I have from my past and my family, I am incapable of actually being happy or making a life for myself here. Whereas in the city I had a different attitude towards life and a wonderful love life / social life, now I'm just lonely and suicidal. Tbh I've thought about killing myself a number of times, but my studies have prevented me from doing it. That and I don't want to give people the satisfaction. 

I just feel like I'm now just wasting my youth in this stupid depression in this godforsaken state. Plus I know that when I graduate college it's going ro be extremely difficult for me to get a job out of state. Chances are I'm going to stuck here even more, which I don't think I can take. Suicide becomes more and more appealing. 

Is any of this reasonable? It's not like I live in North Korea or Syria, I'm lucky to have what I have, yet instead of being grateful, I just hate everything about where I'm at in life. Can anyone else relate, or am i just being a whiny piece of shit?",23Nov2018,1

40,"I'm a 30 year old male. I have a college degree in an extremely niche technical field. I got a job in that extremely niche technical field in a big city when I first graduated. It was entry level at the time, at a small company. Now it's been 8 years, and I still work at that small company. I feel that I am being seriously underpaid for the work that I now do, as my job has grown with the company to the point that I have a hand in every part of the company's operations, but I still have the job title that I had 5 years ago and I live paycheck to paycheck. It's also an extremely stressful job, as I have the highest position except for the owner and the VP, both of which are mismanaging the company despite my weekly attempts to steer them the right way, and it's my responsibility to execute their asinine plans, and it's my fault when their doomed plans and ideas don't work out. I've asked for a raise and been rejected. I've demanded a raise and been told ""the company cannot afford it.""

I live in an apartment with two roommates, one of whom is the leaseholder. The leaseholder roommate is fine, and until last spring, my other roommate was also a cool guy. But the cool guy moved out to live with his fiance, and so leaseholder's girlfriend moved in as the replacement roommate. Leaseholder's girlfriend has very strong opinions about how her living space must be arranged and presented, and how everyone must conduct themselves. Opinions that I disagree with. As a result, there is regular conflict between her and I, usually with neither of us feeling the issues are resolved and us both steadily building resentment towards each other. She took down most of the artwork I had up in the shared living space and replaced it with her own. She has rules about *how* I am allowed to cook things because cooking things the wrong way causes too much of a mess for her to deal with later (even when it causes no mess and I clean up after myself). She put up a list of daily chores to be done, completes them all before I get home from work, and then resents me for not doing enough chores. She also has a cat which is an insufferable bastard that attacks me if I get too close (which is a fucking problem because his favorite place is on the bathmat in our tiny bathroom). Cool guy roommate had a cat that I loved, and I love cats in general, but this is the second worst cat I have ever met in my life. Leaseholder's girlfriend also is simply irritating to be around even when nothing in particular is going on.

I have debt. In fact, I am in more debt now than ever before, and the amount of debt I am in slowly increases every year. The interest on my debt approximately matches the amount of money I am able pay into the debt monthly, so it's simply not going away. Interest rates went up recently as well. I cannot borrow more money either, as no bank will loan me more on account of my low income and existing debt. It is reaching a crisis point.

I can't move. I've been in this apartment for many years, and the housing prices have gone up dramatically in the past few years. A bachelor apartment in a basement costs 50% more than what I'm currently paying. I also used to live in a basement - it was miserable. Nobody that I know is looking to move or change their living arrangements either because the prices are so high that everyone is locked into their living situation where the maximum allowed rent increase per year is much smaller than the rising prices of new leases.

There are no other jobs in my niche field in this city. I would not be able to get another job in my field without moving to another city. But I can't afford to move on account of having no money and no ability to borrow any. I don't have a car, nor do I have anyone who can loan me money either. All my friends are just as financially screwed as me - my parents are broke too, and they live in a very small town far from here where there are no work opportunities for me.

I have depression on top of all of this. I see my doctor regularly, and while my maximum dosage of antidepressants can take the edge off the situation, the reality is that I have quite a bit to be depressed about, that medication cannot solve. I do also have another medical problem that causes me to have minor, but constant, pain in my abdomen. There is no way to alleviate this problem except to have a major surgical operation, which would leave me unable to work for several months.

I am developing a drinking problem because I cannot cope with my life. I am so miserable. I am so tired of being poor and unable to afford anything nice. It's been like this for a decade, and people like to tell me ""it get's better"" but it really doesn't. In fact it's been steadily getting worse. I never used to think about suicide but it's been creeping into my thoughts more and more lately. If life had a reset button I would push it immediately. Since there isn't a reset button, the power button is looking increasingly better to me as time goes on. It's terrifying.",23Nov2018,1

42,"tldr: I don’t like working with my lazy dick supervisor and no balls director. I know I should leave a job I hate but can’t muster up enough confidence to change jobs. So I’ll just browse reddit for $10/hr. ————

I’ve been doing the same task for 4 years, while not being paid for basically being a co-supervisor. I was hired on as a trash tech and now manage the whole linen department which is just me but I also take out trash and manage the team, more so when our supervisor is out or it’s the weekend. 

I’m so mentally checked out that I spend 80% of my day on autopilot while browsing reddit or listening to YouTube. I get my job done but never go above and beyond anymore unless it’s something I like, like organizing. I passively look for other jobs but without having any marketable skilled except for a basic understanding of IT, I cannot find any good paying jobs of $10+/hr

The slight depression I feel while here and the dread I have on my days off have bleed into my work ethic outside of work and my drive to stay fit. All I want to do is play video games which doesn’t help because I treat my job as a game and everyone as an NPC that after I leave, nothing that happened or is happening matters. Like each day is just a new experience with no impact from the previous day. 

Since I got this job as soon as I got out of high school, I’m worried about having another job and not preforming enough and losing my job. Here, I have absolutely no worries of getting fired unless I royally fuck up. My boss has only fired 1 person and even then, they quit before he even had the chance to say it. People have cussed to his face and talked behind his back, yet they stayed here for years until they quit. Our team has so many shitty housekeepers yet he doesn’t want confrontation. 

Even after saying all this, this job is perfect. It’s a 5 minute drive, easy work, job security being at a hospital, crazy good benefits and most of the staff is nice. But if I were just supervisor and my current one, Mr. S, wasn’t here, I don’t think I would feel like this. He’s a dick and I haaaate working with him so much and everyone hopes he doesn’t come to work on some days. Even he’s lazy too, I’m sitting down writing all this while he’s watching Facebook videos a couple feet away. ",23Nov2018,1
43," People feel I don't have a choice but to only try and date unattractive obese women cause i have to ""know my place"" 


25 never a girlfriend or been kissed still a virgin never a date No attractive women like me only unattractive obese women like me and that's who people tell me to learn to settle for i hate my life cause of it I'm 5'5 230 lbs. 

5 dating sites and never has an attractive or decent looking woman matched or message me only unattractive obese women or unattractive women do. 

When I go to bars and clubs I get rejected and ignored every time I cant win. 

The women i try for and who i want to attract are Ria Ciuffo from Barstool Sports attractive. 

I get told to aim for girls as unattractive and fat as the girl from youtube Christine Syldelko. 

Big difference in what i try for and what people tell me to get used to aiming for instead of offering advice that would help me attract women as good looking as Ria. 

And if any of my friends saw me dating a fat ugly girl they'd either laugh at me or worse think we're a good match saying I'm as bad looking and as much a loser as her. And if any of the women who rejected me saw me with a fat ugly girl I'd be looking for a bus to hit me. 

To give more context into what people read

 NO I do not hate women.  who I hate are the guys who women choose because the guys who women choose are always the type who have always picked on me and bullied me and then they rub it in my face on how they were able to get the girl I try for


**TL;DR**
Here's a list of all my experiences
1st Friendzone/Rejection ""**SARA**""

The girl i tried for in high school (24) but who friendzoned me is getting married to a scumbag piece of shit. (21) who cheated on her with a teacher She started dating him when me and her were seniors and he was a freshman he was caught sexting a teacher caught on the news and now the girl I want is marrying him and A TEACHER HERSELF 

and now everybody is happy that they're getting married it's like I'm living in the Twilight Zone that people forget that he cheated on her with the teacher and got caught on the news. And the only type of women who like me or unattractive and obese so when it rains it pours. i hate my life and i hate her fiance. 


AND THEN 2nd Friendzone/Rejection "" **ASHLEY** ""

**TL;DR**

Girl i love has a boyfriend and she's in love with him and it depresses me beyond comprehension that she loves him and she will never love me. I'm absolutely fucking depressed. 

Everybody else wants them to get married except me, i fucking hate her boyfriend he ruined my life. I asked girls on here if he's better looking than me and they all said yes he was and theyd rather date him than me. Can anybody give me advice thats beneficial for me? Not advice that only benefits her boyfriend, cause reality is if you say ""If you really love her youd be happy for her"" or ""move on"", that has no benefits for me it only benefits her bitchboy punkass boyfriend.


And again to recap she doesn't love me she loves him nobody feels bad for me because everybody else wants these two to be married already and the only type of girls who like me or unattractive obese girls so I don't get a bright side or a silver lining or happy ending that benefits me all of those is a losing situation for me or I end up with either nothing or what doesn't make up for what I lost out on. 


I told her I love her she rejected me then a week later she had me meet with her only so she can set me up with her fat ugly friend

3rd Friendzone/Rejection **ALEX**

My high school prom date whose a family friend and who i had a crush on for years, she made out with another guy in front of me and fucked him in his car and because she stayed at my place she invited him over to make out with him on MY DRIVEWAY.  

Me ending up alone or with an ugly girl after all that shit is insult to injury.

All of my friends have good looking attractive girlfriends and their lives are better than mine I want their lives my life sucks

44,"Hello all, TLDR at the bottom. I just wanted to share my little piece of happiness this Thanksgiving. 

My day started with going to work, it was an easy and simple day at my security post which pays my bills, puts a roof over the head of my girlfriend and I, and puts food in out stomach.

I bought the sound bar I've been wanting forever, along with God of War, which I've also been wanting forever.

My girlfriend picked me up in our car, which we just had fixed because it wouldn't start and drove me to her familys where I had some drinks and alot of food. Surrounded by the love and support of her family who absolutely adore me.

After that I played a long game of 'monster' with the six or so kids there, they didnt quite get the game they just wanted to run and be picked up. 

Then I went home to the bed that I own, ( this is the first bed I've ever owned ) and went straight to sleep!

What I'm really thankful for though is the fact that two years ago it was a very different story. I was homeless, strung out on IV heroin and coke, it was cold and rainy. I was literally sleeping on an old dirty matress on a dirt lot behind a gas station. The only thing that I had to eat was Subway, because my mom had dropped me off a giftcard for Subway a few days before. I didn't see or speak to my family that day. The only person I talked to was my drug dealer. 

Anyways, I am SO thankful for my life today compared to how I was.

TL;DR Two years ago was strung out and homeless for TG, this year ( sober now ) had a great and wholesome one.",23Nov2018,1
45,"**Backstory:**

For the past few years, I've been sick. I  get chronic pancreatitis. In the last 6-8 months of it, my labs stopped being elevated. Which from what I understand is typical of chronic pancreatitis. Usually, a pancreatic flare nowadays looks something like this: 

I get dizzy, then pain skyrockets, after that I start to vomit uncontrollably, soon as I get a break from the vomiting, I head over to the ER. They then treat me with IV Fluids, non-narcotic pain medication, antiemetics, and a few other things. Nothing addictive. After my labs come back normal I get a confused ER doctor to which I have to educate. Then, they discharge me, and I go right back to being really ill again. Ultimately, I require a hospitalization, but because of my normal labs, they won't admit me anymore. So, something that would've lasted 2-3 days lasts 4-7 and I'm miserable with it.

**My Grudge Against the ER:**

A month or so ago, I went to the ER and the triage nurse scolded me for coming in for the same issue again less than 10 days from my last visit. This particular flare hadn't let up and I was in excruciating pain. The nurse got a doctor and the doctor told me they don't treat chronic pain. I countered with, ""this hasn't let up, and I don't ask for narcotics 'nor do I want them."" she proceeded to tell me that the wait was 4+ hours long and the likelihood of the doctors on staff giving me what I need/request/want is slim to none. They gave me 8mgs of oral Zofran and I left feeling really sick. The vomiting continued for 4 more days before letting up. I was non-functional for a week after the vomiting stopped because of the pain issues.

**Here's where I am psycho:**

Fast forward to today. I haven't been to the ER in over a month and suspect I now have a UTI. All my regular doctors are out of town or booked because of the Holiday. I have a low-grade fever of 99.8.

I'm so done with being treated so poorly in the emergency. All my doctors said to go to the ER. I know I'm not sick enough to justify a visit to the ER and since it's just after Thanksgiving I know it'll be a mob scene there.  Therefore, I'm going to hold out on going to the ER for 3-5 days or until I have a solid fever. Whichever comes first. I know it's a bit dangerous to do that, however,  at this point I want to avoid going to the ER. 

I can't have my doctor just call-in antibiotics because I'm allergic to a lot of antibiotics. Thus, I'll need a culture to determine which antibiotic to use. 

Anyway yah

**TL;DR: I'm so sick of the ER treating me poorly that I'm going to let my UTI get a lot worse before I seek treatment at the ER for it. All my regular doctors are out of town or booked solid and I can't just have them call in antibiotics because I'm allergic to a lot.**",23Nov2018,1
46,"Immunologists have diagnosed me as having an allergy to H2O in itself, not to any additives in water, meaning my body produces antibodies that bind to any water molecules they see and causing the same kind of reaction someone who is allergic to peanuts would have if they accidentally ate peanuts.

I cannot drink any water at all, pure water causes me to go into potentially fatal anaphylactic shock. I once drunk a mouthful of water by accident and almost died but thankfully I was injected with adrenaline.

I am also allergic to having any water present in my bloodstream since I had a saline drip after surgery and almost died when the water got into my bloodstream.

Just traces of water cause a reaction. For example I only eat dry cereal and toast. I cannot eat gravy or fruits because they contain some water.

Life is very hard and I am publishing a book called It's Only Water but having trouble finding publishers for some reason. I have touched the hearts of everyone in the UK and I have appeared on TV.

All of this makes me very glad the human body is not mostly water and blood doesn't contain water, because if they did then I'd be in anaphylaxis 24/7 and I cannot imagine that. I survive by drinking four 150 ml glasses of whole milk each day and I am 32. Sometimes I drink a special mixture made of orange juice and milk.

If this is you, I want you to know that you're not alone. This is something that many of us are going through now and figuring out how to deal with it.

In the deepest, most protected area of your imagination, you know that you're capable of more. There are things that you intend to create, accomplish, do. But you keep wasting your time, YouTube, Netflix, video games. You've tried a handful of ""self-help"" ideas with short-term results that were later totally erased. You're depressed.

But no matter way, the part of you that knows what you're capable *doesn't go away*. Maybe you've even tried totally giving up, but you can't. You're intelligent and talented - this isn't flattery, it's just true. You have gifts to offer the world, and *they won't let you rest until they're completely expressed*.

And here we are.

I've gone through this myself, and it's been rough, but now it's getting good for me. I've been spending the last several years learning how to get my shit together so that I can start contributing more and creating the life that I see in *my* imagination. I'm becoming successful, I'm getting my shit done, I'm actually starting to do it!

48,"Hi Everyone,

I am having a hard time after I said something really stupid at Thanksgiving yesterday and need some help getting over it.

For the most part, I'm a pretty socially aware person. My biggest problem is that I don't know how to react when someone tells me something. I always forget what to say so I kind of stand there awkwardly until something comes out of my mouth. But most people thing its kind of endearing I think and hasn't effected my life too badly. I am not going to win any awards for ""most witty"" that's for sure.

Anyway, I digress. Yesterday was the first time my husband and I hosted Thanksgiving at our house. It was all of my husband's extended family.  I was very nervous/anxious how this would all go. We had 10 adults and a couple kiddos and our house is pretty small. So anyway, things were going well let me fast forward to where I screwed up. After we were finished eating another relative was helping me clean the kitchen. I repeated said ""go enjoy yourself, I want to take care of this"", but he wouldn't take no for an answer. I don't know why, but all the anxiety I'd been feeling all morning kind of came out and I meant to say it in a funny way, but I said ""You're driving me nuts!"". It didn't sound funny at all. It sounded like I was a mean bitch and my true colors just showed. He went quite. I didn't know what to do, so I just said something else in my normal nice voice. And that was it. But it's been eating at me all night and I've woken up with a stomach ache. This poor guy was just helping me clean up and I was so rude to him. I didn't mean to be. I meant to talk to him like one of my friends, just a joke, but it went awful. I didn't tell anyone else what happened because I'm so embarrassed. I'm sure he told his wife on the way home was a total bitch I am. I feel so bad. I don't think there is any way I can fix this, but wanted to come here to get it off my chest.",23Nov2018,1

Ive spent about 6 weeks talking to a girl from Tinder. She was super flirty, but whatever. She said that she just kind of wants to be friends, and I was really crushed by it. (We didnt meet for so long because she lives several hours away).

I worry constantly about if I will die alone.  I'm 25(M), never been in a relationship, never had a girlfriend, only had three dates in my entire life, and its been years since Ive had sex.  My lack of relationships causes me to get extremely attached to people really easily (hence with the girl I mentioned above).  I dont know what to do, because I feel Ive tried everything.

Ive tried Tinder, Bumble, OKCupid, Plenty of Fish, Eharmony, and get nothing. MAYBE a conversation once every few months. No one I know is single, everyone is either married or engaged at this point.  Because I am in Graduate School and in the middle of my first of two internships, I have little time.

I have almost no confidence whatsoever.  Ive been going to the gym for about 11 months (I haven't been recently because I dont have the motivation anymore) and lost a bit of weight.  I'm about 165ish.  Ive started over the last year or two to really watch how I dress.  My hair, unfortunately, is thinning, which I am super self-conscious about.  However, Ive come to realize that I'm not the horribly unattractive monster I thought I was a year ago.  I dont think I'm some amazing catch, but Ive finally come to accept my appearance as “average”. But due to severe depression and being an extremely shy introvert, I still look down on myself, and find it impossible to strike up conversations with even people in an elevator, let alone a woman.

I had a breakdown a few nights ago at midnight to my poor mom, and I genuinely believe I'm going to die alone.  I dont know what to do.  People have told me “Being single isn't so bad!”, but its not something I want in the least. I am single. Im fucking tired of it. To me, it is not only bad, but it is the worst thing ever.  Its gotten to the point where Ive researched suicide in depth because I refuse to live my life alone.  I would rather die than be single for the next ten years, let alone the rest of my life.  Ive started looking into escorts for sex, which also scares me because I dont want to go to jail, but my sex drive is right now the highest its ever been.  One of my friends has also been telling me a lot about her sex life, which has been turning me on to no end (shes into some really weird shit..).   

How do I bring up my confidence?  Women always say confidence is key (honestly I hardly believe it.  Money, being tall, and looks are what matter) but I dont know how to raise it.  How do I get confident with myself enough to be able to go up to someone and just start a conversation with them? How do I get the confidence to go to a club or bar and try and chat up a girl, and not be emotionally devastated when I get rejected, and have my self-esteem plummet?

After I read some, I went to Reddit Search and looked for ""nice"" Secret Santa stories on Reddit. I don't know if they truly don't exist or if they exist and I asked the wrong search words. I decided to come here because I wanted to share two of the nice secret gifting I did with others in December near Christmas. (I didn't sign up for Reddit's Secret Santa.

There was a time I used to be an actress and on local TV. I never thought of myself as a star, though people stopped me, wanting to chat because they saw mw on TV. One time, I and my castmates after an acting project was done, had another get-together. Courtesy of one of our directors, we arranged for a white elephant game to play with each other.

For anyone who is not familiar with a white elephant game, I will tell you about it. We didn't buy things for our chosen recipients. We got something we already owned at home and gifted it to our fellow castmate.

I gave something I owned. I got a beautiful framed wall hanging (and I still have it). It is sky blue in the background color. It has a cream white matte with decorative hear holes around the squared edges. In the mainframe of the picture is a cream white dove and a beautiful quote: Love like friendship lasts forever.

Online, there was a sort of Secret Santa I did with two graphics designing groups I was a member of. We designed graphics for ourselves and each other. I kept getting lots of requests for things to make for others after they saw I made them. (I don't do that photoshop-enhance/change-pictures thing) I participated in the secret sharing that had started. I participated in both groups. It was not just fun for me, but very needed and quite healing in my offline life.

I sent my info and I got info for my secret recipient. I am an observant person. I could figure out who my recipient was based on the way she painted things on her graphics outside of the Secret Santa graphics designer style. I kept quiet though. I have many ways of designing graphics, so I am unsure if she knew it was me or not.

While there, my partner's doctor told her that they think she may have cancer, but they would do some tests to rule it out.  My partner called me, extremely upset, and I texted her quite a bit throughout the day.  My sister viewed this as taking time away from her which, yes, it did, but I think it was understandable.  I ended up leaving a few hours earlier than planned from my 3 day stay with my sister. My mom thinks my partner was being manipulative and trying to get my attention.  My mom's excuse is that my partner had other family around she could have turned to while I was away.

In my opinion, if I had been the one with the cancer scare (it wasn't cancer, by the way), I would have wanted to talk to my partner as well.  Not to take time away from her family, but because I needed her.

My partner also has kids who I love and am basically a step-parent to.  I never wanted kids, so my mom is concerned about that as well, saying she's just worried about my happiness.  She and my dad do not believe me when I say that I am truly happy.  I am over 30, so I don't think it's just a matter of them being concerned about me being young and making big life decisions.",23Nov2018,1
61,"I mean, a false alarm is best case scenario so there is that. But I still feel like a dumbass. Let me just tell this short story from the start.

I am a 20 something man living alone and my apartment is on the ground floor in one of those small apartment buildings in the suburbs (like 20 apartments). I woke up hearing what sounded like a baby or small child crying, but not like for hunger, like a wailing in pain sort of sound. I don't know how else to describe it.

For a couple of moments, I tried to figure out if it was even real, and then I was like, oh shit, I am awake and not dreaming and this sound is not stopping. I leaped out of bed feeling a strong sense of danger, fumbling/stumbling into my bed side table and things. I sleep in sweat pants/hoodie when it's cold so I am already dressed, I keep a torch/swiss army knife by my bed in case of emergency alongside my keys &amp; phone. I pocketed the keys and swiss army knife, I almost left the knife behind but then I had flashbacks to seeing stuff about criminals using crying babies as bait, and then I called 000 while going outside to look for the source of the noise.

Over the course of the call, which feels like an incredibly long process. Like, if you being murdered, you will definitely get murdered before the operator even figures out whether you need police, ambulance, or firefighters... lol. But anyway, finally, I get put through to the police and I have already looked around outside and I can't hear anything and now I am like... fuck, was it just inside my head or was it just an animal or something. Anyway, I give the police my details and apologise for wasting their time. I was a bit worried I might get in trouble for a false alarm, but the police operator didn't seem to care and just said to call back if anythings.

And now I am sitting here feeling dumb so I thought I would share. I mean, it's probably best that it was nothing, but I feel like a total idiot. I was just stumbling around and I am sure I sounded moronic on the call as I wasn't fully awake. Probably derping my words and struggling to keep my voice coherent as my throat cleared and such. I suddenly really feel like I wish there was an adultier adult than me around.",23Nov2018,1
62,"I am trying to understand who I honestly am. And evaluating it is making me afraid.

I'm trying to understand whether or not I am a Narcissist or not. I was initially assuming my parents were. My dad is negligent and my mom skimps out on my emotional needs as well. They both seem at least concerned for my health but their love doesnt feel genuine. They told me they would disown me if I was gay from a young age and thats what I am.

 Its confusing to me. Internally I feel like I am worthless and this selfish person. I dont feign ignorance and some grand personality. I think outwardly im clumsy, ignorant, and aloof. I question everything I do and every action I take. But it feels like they never do. They are always so confident about themselves but I am not. 

Whenever I think about what I want in life I think about wanting to protect and help other people. I can't tell if its because im genuinely generous and want to help to be kind or if its because I want to feel needed by someone. Like is my altruistic self a facade or inflated ego? Am i really a terrible cruel person who uses other people as fuel? I can't even tell if my empathy is genuine. 

Other peoples criticisms wound me deeply. I am really sensitive I guess. Which is a trait of narcissism.

And i always have a habit of directing conversations back to myself in some way, saying what I think about things. And this post may even be an attempt at achieving self validation. I just don't know.

People say if you're a narc that you wouldnt be able to reflect. Im not sure about that.

I really dont want to hurt people i care about or make them want to leave me.

Someone please be honest with me. Do I sound like a narc.

70,"Hello everyone! I am here to tell you my story which I hope gives you some inspiration for the future! 

All throughout my elementary school years, I was doing great. I had so many friends, I was ambitious, I was having fun, I loved my sports, and most of all I enjoyed life a lot. So, in 5th grade I would say is my favorite year. I had a lot of fun in 5th grade. That year I would graduate and go off to middle school; and I was happy! 

When 6th grade started, I was pretty happy to start. I remember going over to my group of friends and seeing all these new kids. Life was still great. By October though, things started going downhill. 

I really lost my old friends at that point and was then started to be made fun of by them. I tried all I could to act cool and fit in, but nothing worked. I ended up going from group to group at lunch but really I wasn’t that happy at all. I remember I was made fun of for being ugly, having acne, my shoes were ugly, and so on. No one was really my friend. I was being fake to at least look like I had friends. 

I was just so jealous of everyone else and their popularity, it made me try to fit in with them but it never worked. I was never “as cool” as them. This made my self esteem much lower and I felt like a no one. 

So, my birthday will roll around. I had almost no one to invite. I ended up going to eat with just one person. I was saddened but I tried to make it seem like I was happy. I also forgot to mention I played video games with people from school who didn’t really like me. I polluted the truth though when it came to my parents asking me. 

Now, April rolls around. This is when things went FAR downhill. Around early April, I told off a teacher in the middle of class for bad tactics and what not. I gained some popularity since no one liked that teacher and felt pretty good after. I didn’t really get in trouble since I Never cursed and didn’t it in an orderly manner for what I did. 

But, I then also thought I would just be able to not go to school after. I ended up missing 40 days between April and the end of the school year, all not going to school. My grades, once 90’s and 80’s, just plummeted down to the 60’s and 50’s. Everyday I would beg my parents not to go and at first it would work because I would just fake sickness, but then it got so bad that the teachers had to come to my house to make me go.Even when I did go, I didn’t go to certain classes that I didn’t like. I just sat in an office and got work from the teachers to do during that time. I was just depressed for the time being, sad, and all over the place. I was made fun of and didn’t know what to do. 

I was also really dysfunctional at the time. Even so I ended up threatening to kill myself a few times over school. Thankfully, I didn’t. I ended up seeing a therapist my parents sent me to but he did nothing for me. 

By June, my parents were able to get me out of the school as I was still very dysfunctional and all over the place. I didn’t know who I truly was. I just tried to fit in with the rest. That summer, I don’t really remember if I had a good time or not. I think not, but I don’t really remember. 

The next year, I would be sent to private school and I would see a therapist who was new. For the first half of the year, I still was really in a bad state and dysfunctional. I still didn’t know myself and would always hide the truth of what happened the year before to anyone who asked. By January though, things started clicking. I was starting to find myself and I would start to get really happy by February. I had a lot of new friends and was finding what was best in me. 

Now, I’m about to go into high school next year. I’m extremely happy with who I am, I love sports, my friends, my family, and I am really thankful for life. I try to give back to people in need and I’m very ambitious and positive for the future of me and the world. I even one day started crying in my bed because of how thankful I am for not actually ending my life in 6th grade after watching a video on YouTube of a sister who’s brother did. I didn’t know how many people I would impact at the time if I did so. I’m just really happy with life now and enjoying it to my fullest. 

If you were wondering; I don’t speak with anyone from my old school anymore and I’m scared to see anyone from there but that’s dwindled down to almost being nonexistent anymore. 

So, yeah. That’s my story. I just wanted to share it for anyone looking down on themselves. Just know things will get better and the pain with leave one day. Thank you if you enjoyed this. ",23Nov2018,1

I violated yelps terms and conditions easily a dozen times, but it's still sad to see Will M's escapades die.

Here is one sample review of Chuck-E-Cheese.

Mr. Cheese,

I brought my young son to your establishment for his 9th birthday.  I fail to see why he would choose such a prole-sty when I campaigned for a family dinner party at P.F. Changs, where we have a family discount. Nevertheless, he begged and pleaded to take himself and half a zoo of his near-illiterate peers into the festering swampland that is your play area. We paid a minimal sum, as would be expected from a low class facility. The price was not the issue.

Imagine for a second.... you stuff a dozen churlish, undisciplined children into your once pristine 2019 Chrysler Pacifica (whose suede seats have now seen untold horrors). Bring them all,  \[I was asked to keep them off leash by their 'parents' mind you\], into the Chuck-E-Cheese. I open the doors, my hands slid off the greasy handle collecting bits of grubby slime along the way. 

The smell hit me like my fathers belt: a miasma of foot fungus, unrestrained bowels, and poverty. The smell of poor people attempting to enjoy themselves. I felt I was watching a 40 year old plumber duct-taping a slip n' slide back together for his spawn. 

I was rightfully disgusted. The children checked in, while I covered my mouth with my silk handkerchief. In a brief and regrettable moment of curiosity, I wandered around. The slime-pit may have had a few balls floating in it, and the decayed eyes of small bloated children who drowned clawing their way out of the pit still haunt me in my dreams. 

There was a live rat running around, scampering from child to child begging for slices of soggy pizza. It had somehow acquired a purple shirt, no doubt from one of the many children it accosted.

It had taken me a total of five minutes to finally come to my senses. Of course I was right when I had told my son we weren't going to 'sty in the first place. But I had been weak. I was wrong to cave in, it doesn't build structure to show your children weakness.

So I pulled the little runts out of the establishment. In fairness I allowed my son to pick one friend to bring to the family celebration at P.F. Changs.

Once we were at an environment with ATMOSPHERE I was finally able to relax. My son was given a smaller meal, as he had argued with me on the ride home over our change of plans.

Luckily he didn't talk back to me after that, I was hoping the squalor hadn't infested his morality. I couldn't be too careful, so for good measure my son was severely disciplined when we got home from P.F. Changs for suggesting we attend your 'cheesenarium'.

I am giving you five stars as my yearly act of charity. Use it wisely.",23Nov2018,1
75,"I live in the garden apartment of a two story building. 4 months ago a single miniature blueberry pancake, the frozen kind, was found on my roommate and I's welcome mat. Since we live in the garden/ basement unit our front door is on the side of the house and the welcome mat is at the bottom of a small set of steps that leads to our front door. I mention this to stress that the door and entrance to our apartment is not clearly visible from the actual front of our house. It was weird but I wasn't alarmed at the time. 

Two weeks later some French toast shows up again on the welcome mat. We don't have any French toast in the house. I start thinking my roommate is fucking with me. Or maybe our neighbor's cat named Baby is bringing us gifts. I still was not too worried. Then it happened again but in a more deliberate manner. Some salami and provolone with human bite marks was placed delicately on a window sill outside our living room (still in close proximity the front door). The bones of chicken wing were balanced on the brick ledge of a cornerstone right outside of my bedroom window. A cookie was leaned up against our mailbox.

It keeps happening. Usually occurrences are separated by a few weeks, but t's been consistent. I work pretty late and usually don't get home till 2 am.  Then I am up for another hour or two. I've been checking the outside before I go to sleep for food sightings but I never find any until the next day. Which means they are probably coming around in the early morning hours. 

Should I leave a note? I've been thinking about setting up a camera but then what? Do you think I should feel threatened? I'm really more curious then scared at this point. Me and my roommate are both pretty big dudes so I think it strange that we would be targeted by a serial killer. Maybe they are just lonely and hungry.

80,"This happened just before. My best friend is broke, he hasn't worked in over a year, he's running out of savings and has even had to ask his parents to support him. We're both in our 30's.


I asked him many times why doesn't he try to get a job that's not in his field. He's got a computer science degree but has never worked in the field a single day in his life since graduating. He's turned down lots of jobs because reasons. They don't pay him enough, they won't give him a higher up position right off the bat, etc.


I'm well aware he's deluded in that sense, but he has many other good qualities and that's why I love the guy. So since graduating the only job's he's done is Share marketing, something like online investing, in ForEx.


He said he made about $20 a day and that it was enough for him. He's single, lives in a shared house and doesn't spend much. Whatever makes him happy right?


The thing is he's totally broke. I don't think he really is making even $20 a day on the shares because he's run out of money. He's stressed out and won't stop complaining about money problems. This is confusing for me and I think it comes down to his pride not allowing him to get a job that's not fit for his ego.


Now, I work as server in a very nice restaurant and have offered him a job as a server many many times. I have a great relationship with my boss and after telling him my friend's situation he didn't hesitate to say he wanted to help and would like to offer him a full time job. My friend has been turning it down for months not really giving much of an explanation.


Today he called me saying his parents have cut him off and asked to borrow money from me. I said that as a personal rule I do not lend money to anyone, but that he was welcome to start working tomorrow with me. He again turned down the offer and I got a bit frustrated because I'm offering him a solution to his money problem but he won't accept it.


So we got into a bit of a banter and he finally confessed he thinks being a server is low and doesn't get you people's respect. I told him respect is earned by getting off your ass and doing whatever you have to to make ends meet.
I asked him if he thinks I'm low and he back-pedaled saying he didn't mean I in particular was low, but the job itself was. He then straight out told me nobody can respect me working as a waiter in my 30's. Wow.


Tbh I'm pretty upset, he thinks I am low for working as a server? I got a degree too but I couldn't find a job in my field so I had to take the first job I could, I'm not some prissy prick thinking I'm too god to serve others. I take pride in being a waiter and doing a great job. I'm so hurt by his comments. Why is he my friend if he thinks I'm low?


I didn't want to say something nasty or get into an argument with him so I only told him he was being very offensive and I felt like he needed time to think about what he said to me. He replied saying there was nothing to think about, then gave me a list of 'low' jobs like street sweeper, cleaner etc and said it's a fact those are low, not respected jobs. I asked him to apologize before this snowballed into a full blown argument and he said he stood by what he said.
I don't wanna over react but I don't know if we can keep being friends after this. I really don't know what to do. I don't wanna badmouth him but he should examine his life and learn empathy. I'm a very easy going and forgiving person but what he said hurt me and was idiotic. The man who refuses to work calling me low. I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of this year i lost basically all of my friends at once. One friend (X) got upset with me and started some bogus rumor that i was talking shit about another friend (Y) in our group. Everyone likes Y so they all took Y's side and just like \*that\* they all cut me off. I tried reaching out to Y but she wasnt hearing it. I guess they werent my real friends to begin with if it was that easy to cut me off. It was a very painful time, because those were my ""friends"" since high school (im 21).

Its been a very hard year and this whole time ive been trying to heal and move on from it. I stopped going to parties/events in fear i would run into them but i recently started going again. They're kind of petty and will indirectly make you feel bad for being an outcast but luckily I havent ran into them so far. I finally started taking baby steps towards feeling secure within myself and seeking forgiveness for them.

Just as I was starting to feel better, someone posted a picture of this huge friendsgiving party and it triggered me. they were all there laughing, smiling, fixing their plates. theyre all happy without me there. it was so easy for them to forget about me when it took me forever to stop hurting over it. im having a pity party but how could they let a rumor outweigh all the good things ive done for them? ive went above and beyond for these people and thats what i got in return? ive kept all secrets, never bad mouth anyone, stood up for them, but one scandalous person makes up a rumor and they believe it? ouch.",23Nov2018,1
