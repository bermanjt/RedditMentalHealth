0,"I have never, ever, told these stories to another human being, that said i whish to understand if im normal, as i m having second thoughs.
So, it all starts when i was born in 2000, in Portugal, being the third child of an immigrant couple from Brazil with two other girls. My father worked as a gardener and my mother as the housekeeper, in the same house. They obviously werent well paid but they managed to rent a house to start my family. When i was born, my sisters had 9 and 7 years, and while obviously still very occupied with work, my parents could provide for them, and they raised them like an happy family.
After a while, when i was about 3-4 years things start to go wrong, my father left the house. About 5-6 years, i was in a private school, very expensive for immigrant children obviously. At this age my father stopped paying his alimony (food pension) and my mother had to raize me and my sister by herself, because there really wasnt anyone else, no family, who could help her. I love her so much for that, i owe her my life for the sacrifice that is working 10 hours per day, 7 days per week, every year, just so that me and my sister could have an education and a place to live in. But today i look back and i think i was left alone. I know its ungratefull to write it, but thats what i feel. Because she was always working, she had to leave the whole thing of raising me to my sister who were by that time 16 and 14 years, so i dont know if its easy to charge girls of that age to babysit an agitated boy every day with almost unexisting adult supervision.
I even have this vage idea or though that i feel in my brain that its an old memory, in which i was submitted to some scenarios where i would say i was sexually abused by my sisters, but i cant be totally sure as i cant just ask them today. Later, with 10-11 years, puberty arrived. And i started growing a beard(i didnt know how to shave), i quickly became the tallest, probably the smelliest, and while i was cute with my curls before, i turned into the ugliest(a lot of pimples, really big ones), and looking back now im certain i was depressed for a long time because of that. I suffered from bullying because i was brazilian, had curls and was poorer than my colleagues in that private school, but i have never told anything to my mother, as i understood from that young age that i had to endure that to protect her. So i switched to public school with 13 years, i told my mother i didnt want her to spend that enormous amount of money with me. Things changed, i didnt had to be afraid of being somewhat poor, i think my self esteem increased but i was still that shy guy, with very bad skin, very bad haircut, and few friends, good ones, the type of ones which i could be myself and develop a good cense of humour, but still, i know i was depressed. With 15 years i entered highschool and things stayed preety much the same, only this time, my grades had to be high. My mom always talks proud of my sister because she got into college and she was a model for a while, and i had to live up to the expectations they had for me. Grades werent bad, they just werent great and i really felt obsolete when i got good grades and they just increased those expectations, and then i would have worse grades and they would show their disappointment. I continued being bullied, because of the way i looked. I think the only thing that saved me was God, as i would ask Him to give me strengh and hope. Its true many times it seemed this prayer wouldnt happen, but at least it kept me out of the suicide route. I managed to do it without touching a cigarrete, pot, alchool nor any other drug. In early 2017 i convinced my mother to take me to the dermatologist, and i can say that it worked out very well, all my pimples and blackspots disappered. I started taking care of my stubble and getting haircuts way more often. I think my self esteem skyrocketed, i really think im very handsome and mature, more confident, and i enjoy having lots of fun around my friends. What saddenes me is that even thou i feel awesome, have good humour and look preety good i never had a girlfriend and havent kissed a girl in ages. I also never entered a night club, as the majority is only for 18+.
Also, the whole reason im writing this post is because althou i passed all my final exams, i couldnt get in a course my mother believes is worthy, defenitly could get in some interesting ones like biology and pharmacology but yeah, i feel crap. Then i reallized how little me and my mother connect, i mean, she never congratulated me for anything, i never asked her to, i just dont remember doing anything fun with her, to me she is the woman who literally worked day and night for me, yet i dont know her, i totally love her for sacrificing so much but when you are absent like she was in my childhood, the relationship just doesnt grow. I definatelly took refuge in playing sports and videogames, then puberty hit and i got depressed, and theres not a handfull of moments where whe could learn about each other. Is it normal that i love her by the respect of  her sacrifice providing me, and not feeling the loving connection emotionally?

3,"It's been 3 weeks since I found out my sister was murdered. 1 week ago people stopped calling. 1 week ago people stopped asking if I'm alright. Everyone said they're here for me but most of them I haven't heard from in more years than I had been in contact. And I continue to not hear from. I went back to work. I've kept it together and only missed one day since. I wish I could afford to fall apart. 

Something this has taught me is life doesn't stop. This huge world shattering thing has happened and no one really cares. ""She's no longer suffering"" is it really your place to say that she was, or isn't now? 

Nothing will bring her back. I remember fighting over spots on the couch. Or the one time we traded clothes. Now all her clothes are gone. They're gone. Her body ruined them as she laid decaying for a week. It's just stuff, but it was hers and it matters. She matters. Mattered. 

Everything hurts and I'm so damn alone. ",14Jul2018,18

5,"This magical moment happened as my boyfriend and I laid in my bed with the guinea pig I'm pet-sitting (named Bhutu). 

Bhutu has been crying a lot lately, because he's a lone guinea pig, which is really bad for their health. He's been super lonely as of late, but there's nothing I can do until his owner comes back in two weeks.

Me and my boyfriend took Bhutu out of his cage, and after playing with him for a while, my boyfriend played a 'baby lullaby' playlist on Spotify. Bhutu loves music, particularly Zayn Malik (lol). We wanted to see how this music would affect him.

To my amazement, Bhutu burrowed into my neck, and then into the crook of my arm, laid his head down, and closed his eyes. The fact he felt safe enough by me to sleep, let alone close his eyes, was amazing. He even burrowed as close to me as he could. (For those who don't know, guinea pigs don't sleep very much, opting instead to take short 10-15 minute naps throughout the day. Sometimes they don't even close their eyes, since they're probably the most useless prey animal in existence). That was the first time I had ever seen him close his eyes. 

Then, my boyfriend said that this music was making him sleepy, and laid his head down and closed his eyes too.

Seeing these boys that I love, so relaxed and content, made me indescribably happy. Evening light was shining dimly through my curtains, and everything felt perfect. The three of us just laid there for a while. Feeling safe and relaxed.

It just made me  happy.",14Jul2018,82
6,"Over the past few months I've had many issues feeling negative, unsure if I'm going the right direction, or what I should do with my life. I realized one thing today, and that thing immediately made me realize that I have nothing to worry about. I read an article and it talked about doubt. Doubt causes negative thought patterns that spiral out of control. When you are feeling down about the direction of your life, say this to yourself:

""I'm never going to doubt myself again""

""There's no reason for me to doubt myself""

""Doubt doesn't serve me""

""No matter what, I'll deal with it""

""I can do it, I don't care what anybody says!""

Say it like you fucking mean it. Say it like your life depends on it. Say it like you believe it.

All my worries disappeared in an instant, I started not giving a shit about what I do and stopped questioning my every move. Hope this helps some people today.",14Jul2018,3
7,"This all feels inescapable. I feel like I’m doing everything in my power to take these feelings away. They get in the way of everything I do.

8,"Hey guys, this is gonna be a little long and I kinda all over the place but I am going to try my best to keep it on track as possible. 

I wanna preface this by saying a male in his mid twenties that is a compulsive gambler. I am 23 days clean today. Because of this, my mind is in a really dark place and am emotionally unstable according to my therapist...my brain chemistry is getting back in order. 

Now, onto what’s making me go crazy. I wanna say all these thoughts and things happening in my mind are true and am in no way exaggerating these thoughts. 

For the past week and even happened like 3 months back. Whenever I would smoke weed, I would hear voices in my head that would say “you’re gay, you’re gay, I’m gay, I’m gay, you’re gay”. I never paid it no mind as I thought it was the weed playing trying tricks on me. 
This past week however it’s gotten a lot worse. Even when I’m sober, I hear those thoughts in my head. I want to state that I am a heterosexual male and 1) have always been attracted to women and never men 2) never have I fantasized about being with a man 3) I don’t feel any attraction towards the opposite sex and don’t feel like this is some repressed feelings popping back up. 

I talked to my therapist about this yesterday and he and I came up with this theory. Because I am recovering from compulsive gambling, my emotional and mental state is not normal right now. Essentially my brain chemistry is messed up and I am not to able to think or feel okay. I am currently feeling depressed and have bad bad anxiety (hence why I smoked but it’s only made that and my paranoia worse). Also, I have been very open with my feelings emotionally and feel EXTREMELY vulnerable. I am Mexican and come from a traditional Mexican household and in our culture we are taught to bottle everything in and not express our feelings or emotions. And so my therapist thinks that there may be a voice from my past that used to call me gay (bullies, father, siblings-yes they used to taunt me and call me gay) and now because I am being so open and crying almost in every GA meeting and in the therapy that somehow my mind is reverting back to those times and am hearing those voices thus causing me to feel this way because I am being emotionally vulnerable. Idk if I buy into that but it’s a theory. 

This morning I woke up and those thoughts came flooding back and started fucking with me mentally. Let me give you an example of how my thought process is working. Earlier today I was vacuuming my room and I had to get on my knees to vacuum a spot in the corne of my room. When I did my mind worked like this, “on knees=that means you’re gay and want to suck dick”. Completely irrational. To those thinking that I might be gay or am in denial I want to say that in no way, shape, or form do I want to do it or have even thought about it. All these thoughts are irrational and are fucking with me mentally. 

Because of this I took to the internet and saw if anyone has experienced this. In turns out a lot of people have and supposedly there’s a condition called “HOCD” which is homosexuality obsessive compulsive disorder. Which means people have obsessive and intrusive thoughts of them being gay. I don’t know if I buy into this condition as I believe this invented by people who were in denial about possibly being homosexual. 

Because of all this I have broken down a few times today because I feel like I’m going crazy and am in no way in control of my thoughts it feels like. I have never thought about making love to a man, kissing a man, never have I gotten an erection from a man or have even watched gay porn. I have been with countless woman and have been in a few serious relationships as well. In this very moment I feel like I’m straight and I feel like that’s normal for me. 

I understand people exploring their sexuality and all that but I don’t feel that’s something I have to do because being heterosexual feels RIGHT to me. I am not homophobic, I have friends who are gay, and I simply love gay people. All people, so these feelings are not stemming from that if that’s what anyone is thinking. 

If someone could just offer advice, words of wisdom, or anything really so I don’t fucking kill myself...that’d be great. I don’t feel well at all guys. Feel like I’m going crazy. Rant over thanks for reading. 

It’s like I’m trying to convince my self of my normalcy. 

TLDR; please read it all. I poured my brain and thoughts into this. ",14Jul2018,6
9,"I feel guilty that it bugs me, but I just noticed the habit a few weeks ago and now I can't un-hear it. She's an intelligent, well educated woman, and she doesn't do it all the time. When she and I are relaxing by ourselves, she doesn't. It happens a lot more when we're in a group of people or if she is stressed out and trying to explain something. Once she gets going, its every 3 words and it hits me like sandpaper.

How can I talk about this with her without sounding like an asshole? Every approach I've thought of makes me look like a dick. Thanks for any advice.

10,"Sometimes, when I wake up *but haven't opened my eyes yet*, I have a very weird sensation that I don't know where I'm actually am laying down. For example, I remember that I went to sleep on my bed, but sometimes I don't remember which side of the bed I'm in. In other times, I'm not sure if I'm actually on my bed, or my brother's bed or the couch. Sometimes, I'm not even sure if I'm not at that hotel room in which I slept once years ago.

It doesn't seem too weird, but here's the thing: I am completely awake, able to think properly even about complicated stuff, but, if I don't open my eyes, I actually have no idea where I am. It's almost as if my brain has records of all the places I've slept in and it just assumes that I'm in one of them, but it doesn't know which one. It's super freaky. I simply do not believe that I'm actually in my bed just because that's where I went to sleep (just typing this out makes me feel ridiculous, but it's true).

The second I open my eyes, though, it's like I snap back to reality and it becomes obvious again. But I still remember that a second ago, I literally had no idea where I was. It's not very common, I'd say it happens once every 3 months or so. Did any of you experience something similar?",14Jul2018,1
11,"So, I have OCD. I was diagnosed by a doctor around 18 or so but looking back through my childhood some of the things I did that make no sense start to add up when you factor something like OCD in, so I’ve probably had it for most, if not all my life.

I don’t like telling people. I’m not in the slightest bit ashamed of it, as a matter of fact I’ve never denied it and if anyone has legit questions I’m always glad to answer. However when people find out and *don’t* want to look past the stereotypes of the illness things get quite... odd.

So, I am not an orderly person. My room is commonly a mess. I don’t have to have things perfect like the old adage goes. But if someone finds out I have OCD, they’ll do things to try and “trigger” me, for lack of a better term.

“Oh you have OCD?
*moves book a millimeter*
does that bother you?
What about this? What about *this*?”

Like a mental illness is a cute little quirky thing worth setting off.

I try not to complain because, for one, that’s not my kind of OCD so it truly won’t bother me anyways, and two, there are people who have it way worse than me in this world. But it seems sad because these people have been taught that it’s ok to mock people with a real issue, because they’ve been taught it ISN’T a real issue. They’ve been taught that mental illness is a quirk, or a weakness, and it’s not. It’s a lot of things, but it’s not that.

Fortunately most people aren’t like that, but there’s enough that keep me from being the advocate towards the issue I sometimes feel I should be.",14Jul2018,13

15,"Censored because assuming saying it the way I wanted would get this auto-modded.

She's flirted with me before but we're both older (though she's got at least ten years on me which gets my insides more aroused for some reason), I'm hyper-aware of the potential consequence.  Not literal neighbor but a minute walk away.  I was driving and saw her outside today sitting under a tree with a book in her lap.  Really nice out so already in the mood to begin with, didn't even notice initially but I was giving her the eyes hard and she totally caught it.  All I wanted to do was pull over, pin her down on her front lawn and bang the hell out of her for everyone to see.

16,"Today while I was at work for 9+ hours I did some thinking about my relationship history, a little background I've never been on a real date (movie,dinner ect..) and I've always said yes to nearly every person to ask to date me,ive only broken up with 3 of my 7 or 8 girlfriends the rest either chose another man over me,or they were playing with me and I ended up alone. (Im not looking for pitty this is just mere reflection of self).

 I began to think about why I said yes to all of these women. Why say yes to some women you may not have intrest in? 

Well at first I really beleived that I could show these women that they can be loved, they shouldn't be so negative about who they are or what they look like. I kept an open mind because they found me attracive for some reason. I truly had intentions of trying to show them that. From high school up until now Ive said yes and I was hoping to learn about what kind of person I'd like to be with for the rest of my life if that is in my cards. 

I've kept in contact with them,spend time as permitted (even got in trouble after breaking some rules to seem one of them, at the time it was worth it to me). Ive put forth all the effort I could, however in my last relationship it really hit me that I do put forth to much effort. 

After learning x amount of things about her father and how he wouldn't get a job because he has rent and kids I told her to move out. She did a couple of moves later to a couple of cities,being there for her during her bads and goods she asked me essentially to always come and drive for her. 

I had that moment of clarity. I asked her would she take the bus to come and visit me? She then asked why I couldn't come to see her. It all came together right there. She wont put effort, so I cant stay. 

After 2 years of making it work by me walking to her house before I had a car have my folks picking her up to be around her,I simply her that. I look at her then said I cant do that. Cut to sometime later I had reflected on my relationship with her as a whole I didnt feel liker her boyfriend I felt more like the father she needed. So I chose to let her go.

Now that I take a look back at my history what have I learned? Don't put forth so much effort.
Have I found anyrhing inpaticular I would like in a wife? Honestly no. Everyone has unique traits that I enjoy about every women Ive been with. One was artsy the other shy, another was outgoing and enjoyed music, another was into anime and enjoys family. 

Its kind of sounding like the 31 flavors of women here hehe but nevertheless maybe I did make them feel loved/appreciated at the time. As for me I feel like ive done it more for there sake.

I don't beleive I've been in love.That might be because of my mutual feeling hasn't been attraction at the beginning but only grew as caring and trying to show affection.

Just looking and thinking back on this. Where do I go from here? I've advanced in life, have little experience in dating however, my head is in the clouds because I want to love and give a person my all. I'm not sure how to find something like that. 

Tldr: a lot has happened and I wish I could of felt what love is like but I'm here now after many trys for what could be considered relationships and I feel like I'm starting a new.",14Jul2018,1

21,"I feel like a defective person. I break into these weird crying fits every now and again. I've done 3 in the past week which is mildly exhausting. A lot of things went wrong with me before I knew that they were problems. Now my brain is settling into place and I'll never be able to change those things completely. 

My brother killed himself about 4 years ago. I kept telling him not to do it but he'd say that I was too young and inexperienced to have any opinion. Sometimes I really want to ask him for advice. We were quite similar people, as he shared my upbringing, and that can't be replaced. I get jealous of people with close siblings. But I'm not angry with him for doing it. He was depressed and psychotic. He needed more than I do. I'll put my parents in their graves and my other (mentally disabled, can't communicate, needs a caregiver etc) brother in the right hands. The dead brother can rest. I respect his decision.

An acquaintace I knew in high school killed herself last month. I'm not sad because our friendship meant anything to me, I hadn't really spoken to her since we were sophomores. I'm sad because I wanted to see her fix some of the weird fucked up shit in her life. But most of it she was pretty helpless to change. The fact that you really can be helpless scares and saddens me.

I feel worthless, but I want to make people happy, and do something for them that hardly anyone will. That's a big reason that I draw niche porn for people but most think less of me for it. I also like it since nobody told me what it was or what to think about it, I just picked it up and made it mine. It's something nobody in my real life knows but I can share it with people who enjoy it anonymously. That's something really special to me.

The other day my laptop's motherboard failed spontaneously. I have a shitty old one to use in the interim but it's hardly usable for drawing. Having the ability to send drawings out stripped from me suddenly upset me. It made me feel quite isolated and lost.

I'm not at home in a lot of cultures. I didn't get the ideal amount of human engagement as a kid so I went to the internet. I grew up on old school forums and chat rooms. Those are dying or dead. I'm adapting to newer platforms but it seems that the idea of anonymity on the internet is slowly dying. I don't enjoy that because anonymity makes me feel safe and in control of myself. I feel like I'm caught in between pre-internet people and the kids who use social media to supplement their real life identities rather than create anonymous ones. In other words as a child I invested myself in a culture that's slowly dying. I'm having trouble connecting with people outside of that culture too. Don't like the same things. I'm too weird. I like the people I meet but I don't have a tribe.

Also I can't get along with other women's vibes. Can't get on the same page. I talk too much like a guy I think. And guys will always think of me a little different since I'm a woman. That's another reason I like anonymity.

I have little interest or urge to explore new things like many do. I don't want to buy shiny things. I don't want to go big places. The allure isn't there. I suspect that this is a factor in why I feel alien too.

I've felt this worthless from time to time like this since I was about 6. My understanding is that long-standing patterns gained during early development tend to continue throughout life. I suspect that my occasional bouts of crying and misery like this can be patched up but not lifted away. Many of my habits that annoy me are just parts of my brain that I'm powerless to change. That frustrates me. There's a lot of shit I can't fix and a lot of shit I don't enjoy.",14Jul2018,1

24,"So first off before I give you this story I want to tell you that I am 15 years old with 2 older siblings and both of them had got into a relationship at my age and had a pretty good social life. 
Me? Well i rarely see the friends I have and have never been in a relationship or even kissed a girl so my dad (who I think was a player in his youth) is asking me constantly when I am going to get a girlfriend. 
Why am I telling you this? Well because I'm not really like my brother and goes for the thing with the biggest ass around so I have standards (Pretty damn high ones I say so myself) witch makes it that I rarely if ever find someone who meets those standards.

So about 3 days ago me and my family where at lisseberg and we were going to get lunch, when we get to the restaurant I see an empty table and next to that table i see an angel without her halo or wings. 
I thought to myself that she probably had a horrible personality.
So we sat than next them (the girl and her dad)

26,"The whole point of giving the ring to the hobbits is that it is secret. It's on a secret journey to Mordor. The ring is the most important thing to Sauron bar none - if he gets it, he wins. So Frodo shows the ring to the Nazgul and the Nazgul is just like 'oh look the ring... ' and then it's like nothing happens. Well fuck that. If Sauron knew that in that moment the ring was at Osgiliath he would have sent every Nazgul, and every creature under his power to Osgiliath to get it. Imagine Frodo trying to get up to the morgul vale but instead this time the Nazgul's army had left early because Frodo showed him the fucking ring at Osgiliath? 

How did they even make it back over the river with all the orcs on the other side?

This is why you don't change the books too much. It's stupid. Of all the changes they made, this one is the most idiotic because it makes it look like Sauron doesn't really care too much about the ring and where it is.

And then they scripted Sam saying 'by rights we shouldn't even be here'. No shit you shouldn't be there. Is that some kind of easter egg?",14Jul2018,0

29,"I stay in bed almost all day and go out at night. I don’t enjoy going out anymore, it was fun for a little but after being out almost every night for the past week I’m so fucking tired of it. 

I’m 17, I just finished school. I can’t go to college until next year so I have to wait just one more school year until I can finally break free. 

It’s 4am now I can’t fall asleep and I’m at someone’s house. There’s a bunch of people who are all 19-21. They all just took tabs and are spending it playing fortnite and being on their phones. They’re in routine too. They wake up, smoke, talk about smoking, smoke more, brag about smoking, sell Xanax to 15 y/o, and sleep. This is the group of friends people idolize and are intimidated by. 

I can’t connect to any of them, only because I don’t smoke or do drugs. I just have no other friends. It’s so difficult for me to form legitimate friendships with people. It makes me so sad, the only form social interaction is through random people at parties or people who invite me for god knows what reason. 

Not being able to connect to these people used to make me feel like shit. It doesn’t anymore. I could care less about it, or anything for that matter. I just want to crawl away and become a hermit. 

It seems like my routine now is scrolling through social media, (simply because I am bored and I’m doing nothing else) posting my art which really is not good. I have little talent, I just have ideas and pens and pencils. I want to make things I love, I am so passionate for it.

30,"So first off before I give you this story I want to tell you that I am 15 years old with 2 older siblings and both of them had a relationship at my age and had and have a pretty good social life. 
Me? Well i rarely see the friends I have and have never been in a relationship or even kissed a girl so my dad (who I think was a player in his youth) is asking me constantly when I am going to get a girlfriend. 
Why am I telling you this? Well because I'm not like my brother and goes for the thing with the biggest ass around so I have standards (Pretty damn high ones I say so myself) witch makes it that I rarely if ever find someone who meets those standards.  

So about 3 days ago me and my family where at lisseberg and we were going to get lunch, when we get to the restaurant I see an empty table and next to that table i see an angel without her halo or wings. 
I thought to myself that she probably had a horrible personality.
So we sat than next them (the girl and her dad)
and I look over to their table to see a smile that I would kill to see again

So about 3 days ago me and my family where at lisseberg (an amusement park in sweden) and we were going to get lunch, when we get to the restaurant I see an empty table and next to that table i see an angel without her halo or wings. 
I thought to myself that she probably had a horrible personality.
So we sat than next them (the girl and her dad)
and I look over to their table to see a smile that I would kill to see again and hear a laugh that could cure any depression, I look her straight in the eyes and she notices me and looks straight into my eyes and those eyes man, they were as blue as the clearest ocean and I thought time stoped when I looked straight into them.

We were at the restaurant for about 80 minutes and I spent about 60 minutes just looking at her because she was so beautiful.

I thought to myself that she would probably be at a ride after lunch and that I can strike up a conversation in the line or if I just see her walking around.
She left the resturant with her dad about 5 minutes before we did and I was basically running to se if I could catch up.
I searched the park about two times and did not find them.
They went home.

After 3 days I still can't get her out of my head because she was everything I was looking for and I had one chance to get it and I failed thinking I had more chances (I don't live in Gothenburg, where lisseberg is so I can't just hope to see her again)

So in short. I saw the girl of my dreams and just let her slip away.

32,"Liberalism = associated with idealism, hope for the future, progressivism.  
  
Conservatism = asssociated with realism, protecting our own, taking care of what’s already happening.  
  
This seems to be the gist of it. Basically both types of views are needed for different situations. I’m guessing that as the needs of a society change, so do the views of the people. For example, in an economic depression or a war-torn or conflict heavy countries, there would probably be a trend of conservative views rather than liberal due to lack of resources. In today’s developed societies, food/resources are readily available for the average person. Therefore they have more emotional resources to give towards others as well as hope/idealism for the future. Thus, a bigger trend of more liberal views.  
  
Note that I think racism, sexism, and the like are typically associated with conservative views but I have no idea why that would be. Maybe because conservatives as a rule focus on “us” vs “them” and so others are seen as threatening, no matter if it’s a justified fear or not.",14Jul2018,2

34,"Background - my mother and I have long had a rocky relationship, especially since I was a teenager. I have never met my father. I am an only child.

Last weekend she had asked me if I wanted to spend some time together. This was kind of significant as a) I have only seen her once in the last 12 months+, and that was at Christmas and b) the previous time I had seen her had not gone well and there was a lot of 'fallout' after.

I just happened to mention something funny that had happened to me, when a woman in the queue next to me had pointed out that we had the same biscuits! It was pretty funny, we did actually have two different packets of biscuits that were just the same, and neither of us were buying much to begin with.

So my mother said that I should have asked her to marry me and have babies. 

That struck me as an especially odd thing to say, since she knows perfectly well I have had a vasectomy (something she was extremely squeamish about and really avoided talking to me about at all). She also knows I am not planning on ever getting married. Actually, I have almost always been single, and have had a lot of difficulties in my relationships, dating etc. I have some 'history' in my childhood that I don't tend to go into online. I was in counselling for two years.

What do you make of her saying that? I can't understand why she would say that, but I don't want to bring it up, because I'm sure she will just get defensive, and it was good of her to come through to see me.",14Jul2018,6

I have two bank accounts. I couldn’t remember the pin to one, so I called to have it reset. WELL I go to the ATM last night to get some cash. THEY RESET THE WRONG CARD and it says too many pin tries.

It never used to be like this, i used to have plenty of friends. My close friends would see me every week. Now i cant even get a text back off people. You see, a few years ago i was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Its a lot for people to wrap their heads around and i honestly feel like they just dont want to deal with having the crazy friend around. Theyve all made new friends without so much baggage who can drink alcohol and do drugs. 

I always ask if people want to do something. Theyre always too busy or too tired or usually just have better things planned with better people. Nobody ever thinks to invite me when they go and do and something and even if i just message for a chat they act like they cant wait to get out of the conversation.

Problem is, every exam I made so far came clear, so she has no idea of what I might have. We are waiting for another exam to be made (MRI), but it takes so long to schedule it that I'll probably only be able to see her again in 1 month or so (and, even then, she will probably still have no idea what is going on). I've attempted to schedule an appointment with another neuro-ophthalmologist of my clinic, but he only has time in October. Today I noticed another blind spot.

It felt nice but I’m really unsure if it’s healthy. Am I going mad?

56,"Several weeks ago, I decided to start seeking professional therapy to address a few long standing issues. The results have been a bit of a mix, not entirely what I was expecting. I was expecting much more practical everyday advice on things I could do to feel better, but they have largely been me, talking about my feelings, with the therapist asking me to observe and understand why I’m feeling the way that I am. Whilst that helps, to a degree, it still hasn’t materialized into tangible improvements from my side - although I do understand that the onus would largely be on me and that a therapist cannot offer a magic pill of sorts. 

The real point of this thread is this; I feel tired all the time, feel a complete lack of energy and no motivation to develop and pursue any hobbies and passions. I feel like I have become extremely boring as a person, and that is effecting the people around me including my partner. For quite some time I have associated low energy levels and therefore related moods, to work - I told myself that I would feel exhausted due to just having finished work and therefore need a few minutes to recover mentally, however as rightly pointed out by my partner, the low energy levels seem to be increasingly prolonged. I would appreciate advice on how to battle this.

My partner is the love of my life, and I care for her more than anything. She has been extremely understanding and supportive throughout this process but it’s not fair on her - I want to become a better, happier person, for myself since naturally I owe it to myself to be happy and be the best possible version of myself, but I also want to be happier for her since she is an amazing human being who deserves to be happy herself, as well as enjoy the companionship of a happy partner. Often we get into arguments because of my moods (please refer to the above text that despite my moods she is super supportive) and I get the feeling that she sometimes feels that I am not happy when I am around her, and maybe even not enjoying her company - the truth is that yes, I am low on energy often, and quiet a lot too, but she is one of the few sources of happiness in my life - I would hate to make her feel that she makes me unhappy.

This is not to say that I have not tried my hand at things that would make me happy - I recently started watching tv shows again, and they have helped slightly (at least they give me something to talk about with others), however I cannot bring myself to actively pursue new hobbies on a regular basis. I want to learn how to draw and paint, but with the aforementioned exhaustions and life admins, it becomes difficult to pursue it on a regular basis - I looked up some local art lessons, but I can’t afford them at present, especially since therapy sessions are expensive and put quite a dent in my monthly income. I have started working out again (at least at home for the time being) and have set myself a target weight and general fat loss, and that helps.

I also need to stop being overly pessimist, paranoid and apprehensive in general. I have this mental stigma that everytime I feel that things are going smooth, something negative will happen since it is all too good to be true. As a result, I am actually afraid of allowing myself to be happy, and sometimes feel that I am not deserving of being happy.

I recognize that there is no real structure or core outline to the above, but I would love to hear thoughts, tips and advice in general.

Thank you.",14Jul2018,2
