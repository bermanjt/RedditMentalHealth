0,"For example let’s say management agrees to increase everyone’s pay by 2-3%. The new hourly rates are approved and given to payroll on Tuesday and are to come into-effect the following Monday. Does the employer have an obligation to notify their employees of their increases prior to them coming into work on Monday? Have they failed an obligation to their employees if they instead communicate it later in the week, days after the new rates have already been deployed? Why or why not?",13Apr2018,0
1,"Hey I just got curious about how often the average person sneezes and it turns out nobody's actually bothered to figure out how often the average person sneezes, so I made this [poll](https://strawpoll.com/bbd1db2x) to try and figure it out. If you're curious I sneeze pretty much once a day, I got thinking about it because I realized that I sneeze once every day like clockwork in a certain class, every single class. The people in that class must think I have allergies or something lol",13Apr2018,1

5,"Just remembered this crazy thing that happened...

I worked for a husband and wife who ran a chiropractic office out of their house. They had an old golden retriever who seemed to only be suffering with hip pain but other than that  he seemed to be a happy healthy dude. 

Having used this vet for years, my bosses were able to get him to make a home visit.  (It was hard on the dog to go in and out of a vehicle) I can’t remember if it was a routine checkup, the dog was supposed to be given a shot or something? But during work, the wife went upstairs to use the bathroom and when she came back said that the dog was put to sleep, her husband was extremely upset, and that we had close the clinic for the rest of the day.

Apparently, the receptionist or whoever at the vets office had mixed something up. The husband was around the house, let the vet in, left him alone to do whatever he had to do, didn’t think much of it so wasn’t paying attention until he felt something was wrong and saw that the dog was unresponsive and of course it was too late.

6,"I hate the new reddit format, it is so bad and not user friendly at all.

First off I can not middle multiple click image links in a row anymore because the cursor turns into a scrolling cursor.  I have to click in a blank space to turn that off.

Second Hover zoom, a plugin for viewing pictures without opening links, it only working selectively, so now reddit is no better than a common media agitator like  buzzfeed.

Third, it is no longer possible to collapse comments so you can not see them anymore.  There is no hide option either, but I don't want to hide them, I liked to collapse comments because in posts with thousands of comments collapsing a top comments is easier to get to the next top comment with out having to scroll 100 feet down the page to find it.

Forth, when you LMB click a link like a reddit video or image link it pops up as the comment section instead of a direct link to the image or video.  This I hate greatly because I wanted to see the picture not the comments.  links like gyfcat and imgur still work properly.

fifth, when you go to a comment section the page is a pop up like I said in 4 but if you accidentally click off of the popped up area it goes away.  It like so local news website nonsense.

sixth, all the subs that have custom banners and stuff are not working.  Solid colors only.

11,"I’m still fascinated by traffic.

Traffic is a man made wave carrying, not just H20 molecules, but entire individual stories and intentions all over the world. There’s traffic everywhere I go. Driving to drug studies I’d be lost in the sea of cars clogged in the bleak and concrete of Chicago suburbs. Driving through Fort Wayne, I feel as though I’m right back in The Region with fatter people and more to eat. Evansville rings the same. It’s probably an Indiana thing.

I know the math that plucks “stars” from the sea. I know calling someone a star to regard them as something special and different is an irony we ignore pretty heavily. Without the media coverage, we find stars at every level. People rocket to the tops of their industries. People have a way of navigating social waters or difficult situations like no one else around. A family man can be the star of his castle. A child can always burn brightest in the eyes of their parent.

Driving from the hotel to the training facility, you learn very quickly that Fort Wayne likes to speed. What doesn’t occur to them is there are about 90 stoplights between them and wherever they’re going 5 miles up the road. Speeding to slow down. Speed to cut off and then immediately hit the breaks and halt. Speed to knock the shit out of one of a myriad of potholes. Speed while they smoke, and put on makeup. This is a place where people are trying to get somewhere, and the reality in between doesn’t register.

This area also has an abundance of liquor stores and churches. I didn’t make a count, but when a thought like that occurs to you, it suggests it’s at least more liquor stores and churches than you’re generally used to seeing.

Traffic grabs me because that’s what I’m becoming. I get up early, put on uncomfortable clothes that flaunt sweat, grab my coffee and hotel breakfast, and make my way to presentation after presentation about how to treat LGBT kids like they’re people and not let it slide when a parent who’s just had their kids taken away tries to talk me out of not reporting something that could put me in jail. The “standard” of interaction I’ll have to meet is 22 hours of facetime with clients, with apparently a gigantic backlog that’s increasing if I want to be a go-getter and shoot for 35-40.

The leadership, once I begin doing that, will start to tell me I’m “changing lives.” They’ll say they had a feeling about me and were waiting to see how it played out. I’ll get offered a company car. I’ll interrupt hanging out or free time with phone calls or paperwork. I’ll ask questions, *in the way that I do*, like when I asked a VP of the parent corporation if there was a finder’s fee for finding them a rich disturbed kid, who they cater to, to haul off to The Dominican Republic for 10 months at $5,000 a month. It will make people chuckle and uncomfortable, but they won’t be able to do anything, because it will speak to a truth they like to polish and my numbers will be undeniable.

If I get paid like I anticipate, it won’t be a daily struggle to squeeze the tips out of frat boys, but a weekly reliable paid in full to the professionals story of things that get done on my house. $300 here or there? Yes, please do. I could pick up some small pricey-enough indulgences like collecting cologne or springing for a nice watch. I’ll be able to put a plan in place for my week that I politely berate (hold accountable) my fledglings to where we work on goals and fill out paperwork together. I’ll endear myself to some, alienate others, get paid either way. I’ll think about getting on a healthy meal plan delivered to my door and expanding my gym membership to include a trainer.

I’ll even potentially have the time to have my weekends, or long weekends, to travel and visit. Instead of all day wasting away in a parking lot for a week, I’ll have hard and fast start and stop times to my “free time.” I’ll have stories for days about people suffering a circumstance I’m in no way approaching holistically or with the naivety of my employers. It’ll be routine. I’ll have my snippets about how Florida was rainier than I hoped, but at least there wasn’t snow!

I will meet very many pleasant people. They will have their families form right before my very eyes. They’ll have their woes and story about what brought them here. They’ll tell me what they believe and use that tone for signaling discomfort for the topic or type of joke. “You see, what *it’s really about*.” I’ll be asked a dozen times if I have any questions, and I’ll watch them die a little inside when their 5th dad joke in a row fails to land.

By any normal measure, I’d be fine. I fit. My cultural conditioning worked. I can sit still. I can play a semantic game as earnestly as any convoluted Christian. I’ll have money. I’ll garner praise. I’ll be able to merely mention my job and wear the gear to be regarded as a “good person.” My hairline, gut, and humor will grow to match the rest of the ensemble. All us jaded old-types will be in on the joke. I’ll disregard the implication of the 40 I guzzle down every night.

How long have you been enthralled reading my familiar story? Are you jealous? Do you wish you had that measure of *security* to look forward to? Do you wish you had a job that burns out the sincere do-gooder, but makes you laugh at the idea that there’s a single stressful thing involved at all? Is someone going to scream my hearing away? Am I going to be unable to leverage, “Um, hey, I’m the road to getting your kid back, duh.” Will I have to drive even half as long? Is a sick kid puking in the back of my car or filthy apartment my worst nightmare? Will I have to work as many days? Don’t forget, I organized my life where a McJob would pay my yearly bills in 1-3 months, and they want to pay me to be a *professional adult*.

I appreciate what I have. I find the value in the things that piss me off. I know there’s always work to be done, and when I want to improve, upgrade, or change something, it’s not because I’m living in some unbearable hell. I know that my skill or malleability is particular. I know my perspective has been beaten out of hundreds of thousands of words. I know that I’m the speeding Fort Wayner who dares potholes to break my axel. While most of us might find change uncomfortable, I find the idea of forgetting what really matters to me unbearable.

I didn’t/don’t read so much about the world so that I could put it on the backburner and become personally snug and “mature.” I didn’t get my ability to cut to the heart with a single question or tone by playing along. What Christian organization charges $60,000 a year to send some teenager looking at porn to another country because their rich parents are equally deluded and naive? That’s the question they feel when I ask if there’s a finder’s fee for luring another one into their trap. These righteous lambs spent half this “training” literally trapping us into a church sermon, pitch from Wells Fargo, and insistence we treat gay kids like they’re normal, but also “respect” the “different views” of their parents who act like you assume southern Indiana parents will. I chose to withhold telling them like 90% of my friends are at least bi, and I’m not trying to get fired for calling some old cunt a bigot.

I think my next tattoo, or set of them, are going to symbolize resistance. No matter how good I get at this world, or have already been, no matter how many rewards, no matter how relieved you feel that, “He's finally figured it out, shut up, grow up, and get paid,” it’s wrong. I want self-sustaining creativity and new culture building. I want the old guardians of my ideals. I want to create the constraints to wiggle around in. And I want my focus to be primarily on the **big** evidence and trends. I want to shape the world, not pretend to save my region from opioids and several generations of child abuse. To be fair, I don’t want to deliver food, didn’t want to sell alcohol, didn’t want my spine tapped, didn’t want to finish college, or drive a cab, or do yard work, or probably the vast majority of things that constitute my life, so saying what I don’t want to do amounts to less than piss in the wind.

I’m still always going to be looking. I’m looking for the way out. The funds will, at the very least, fuel my business speculation. I am actually going to be “in the world,” so I’ll scrape together bits of information that may prove useful. I’ve learned I can still 9-5 and still get my TV shows in, likely the thing that will accompany my paperwork, which I’m sure I’ll streamline. I won’t get lost in this world. I won’t get comfortable. This cushy bed in the hotel they’ve comped? It’s not mine, and it’s over tonight. The food allowance for dinner? $15 and doesn’t include alcohol, the fuel of any proper social worker, or human in general. I want the gig that hires those who know how to responsibly drink while doing it and to sleep when I want for as long as I want.

The main reason this path has concerned me is that I’m aware I’m not an island. I can be shaped and persuaded like anyone. No one ever tries because they don’t really care or are too stupid, but it’s possible. My mind normalizes things pretty quickly as a what I take as a self-protective adaptation. It’s one thing to write pissy blogs, another to start creating new holes in my arm to pick at, or clenching my jaw until teeth wear down. I spent a year a CT. I swear I started there yesterday. Every happy memory of my past was yesterday too. Tomorrow I’ll be 60, bitching about the nuclear fallout not-that-long ago that these goddamn kids are already forgetting! I’ll regret I didn’t do more or prepare or speak explicitly because I was a little too busy, a little too selfish, and too old to fight about things I know I can’t change. Then I’ll wheel my lonely wretched body out under the sun and burn to death like that Furyan in The Chronicles of Riddick.

It hurts just enough. Like pants too tight in the waste. Like a neck propped staring at the wall projection. Like the cut in the eyes and the tongues of the pretenders lecturing you on their nobility and morality. Like the indignity of turning your head and coughing. Like the disrupted quiet as you crumple the remnants of your calorie mistakes. Or the hum of traffic, beckoning.",13Apr2018,5
12,"I feel so many things and I just want to get them out in a way that can affect other people the way that the work of so many others has affected me. I replay so many of my daily interactions in my head as though they were a movie of sorts, and I am just in a constant state of wishing that I could compile every moment that ever meant anything to me in a medium like that -- a movie, a novel, a zine, a song. Anything. I write in a journal constantly, but any time I try to create anything else, I always just end up reverting back to that same journal format. I don't want to write about myself, anymore.

14,"I couldn’t study today and I should have. I mean, I have time... about 10 days before my finals. Still, I should have. The thing is, I *tried* to study, alright? I sat there for hours with the intention and progress that was not slow enough to completely discourage me. The book was in my lap and my notes were on my laptop. (I should text you now, right?)
My mind was filled with every good and bad thought about you all at once. Every 3 seconds how I felt changed; I’m right dammit! You were being an ass and you know it.  I know you didn’t mean to hurt my feelings, I know I always act like very little gets to me. I do it because I know how to control the stupid fucking voices in my head that constantly tell me to fuck things up. I don’t need some therapist to tell me how. 

By the way, the total amount of time my brain worked without a thought of you interrupting lasted maybe 10 minutes max. Obviously, I can never tell you that, at least not yet. I don’t want you to know how much brainspace you actually take up, I always have to play it down because I want us to stay healthy. I’ll never tell you that today I tried so fucking hard to forget about you and just get through this damn economics chapter; my will to continue two more years of university literally depended on these fucking grades I get. Nothing really matters to me, I don’t really give a fuck where I end up as long as I can make enough money to be comfortable and afford weed. (And you. Should I text you? I’ll wait for you to text.)

It should be a priority over this stupid fight we’re having, I just need to get through these next couple of hours (Why won’t I text? Because I’m mad as hell. Because I’m too proud to.) I should focus on my work until you decide you feel like talking it out with me. Or maybe... Breaking up with me. You probably hate me after I treated you that way yesterday. I know I’m a bitch. I try not to be, I really do, and you’re the first person I ever managed to control it with for this long. (He secretly doesn’t love you. He’s using you, and you know that you deserve it.) I know that this shit is in my head and I know it’s not your fault. I always made sure you knew it, I know you never cheated and I know you wouldn’t say you’ll love me always if you didn’t. You never proved otherwise to me the entire 18 months of our relationship. (You just haven’t caught him yet.)

Hell, this is our first fight, but it’s a big one. I got angry out of nowhere, you probably didn’t see it coming, I ignored you and said I’m leaving to my place... I was hurt, and being this vulnerable to you scares the fucking shit out of me and being this fucking terrified makes me so angry. If I could turn everything off you bet your ass I would. And yet... I still love you. Even when I feel like you don’t. (He doesn’t.) I miss you when I know that you (rightfully) dont because you’re as busy and even busier than I am in school. (Would he miss you otherwise?) Shut the FUCK up.

Sometimes it’s like we are on two different planets but we’re the same soul. You’ve convinced me that we’re truly inseparable more times than I care to admit, no matter how much I try to remember that us going our separate ways is a possibility. (Just text him and see what he says. Swallow your fucking pride.) The idea of soulmates is fucking stupid and ridiculous but you’re my fucking soulmate. How else do I let you know how much I fucking love you? 

I know that we’re in love and we’re being “chill” about things, but I actually do want to spend the rest of my meaningless life with you, and that’s why I was totally not being chill, man.

When he goes to bed he dreams of a fire burning his house down he manages to grab the two youngest but his brother slept through the fire. Other times he doesn't make it through the fire or wreck. He says he wants to experience death he has no use here yet something is holding him here. I'm public he is the smart one who you go to for answers when he's alone with headphones he is on the verge of tears thinking about everything he fucked up.

20,"I don't have opinions. Everything is possible. Everything connects but without ends. I end up in loops and tangents of thoughts sometimes. And sometimes blank. I think I can do anything and that makes me want to do nothing. I still do things and it's gone after the moment. I don't remember much. I love the feeling of adrenaline rush after a nightmare or jump-scare. I'm thankful to be able to experience this life which should never have been, though it may be through pain or pleasure. It's beautiful and addicting how depressed and lonely I am at times. It makes me want to give in to the pull of the void. I like how I tell myself that I'll be okay. When I'm okay, I forget the void, I float free in the world. Being in the moment. I don't know what this experience is, I'm here clueless. 

Sometimes I think I'm being played. Sometimes i feel like god. Very rarely like The Devil. sometimes normal. I once felt like I was an abandoned ancient city inhabited by birds who sang choreographically. 

I understand a lot of things and I don't understand how. All my childhood, I hoped someone would tell me what all this was about. I now know that no one really knows the answer. Everyone chooses the most comfortable delusion they could find and stick with it. I don't know what my delusion is. I seek connection, I seek solitude. I exist in a dream world. I am socially anxious, I'm great with people otherwise. 

I'm insecure, I'm lazy, I'm calm, I'm restless, I'm frustrated, I'm numb, I'm at peace, I don't know how all of these could exist at once. 

I'm super aware of my self. I'm confused of which of the parts that makes me up, is to be prioritized. Physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, or my awareness. I'm aware of my awareness. I feel connected and disconnected. Sometimes, I forget how to think, remember. I rarely flow freely. I try to make everything most efficient, with the least expense of energy. That is I do nothing I don't have to. 

I want to experience death. I want to experience immortality. I want to transcend. I want to taste sushi. I want to lay on a dark ice cliff staring at the clear sky listening to ambient music. I want to free fall endlessly forever.

My husband has been gone to a course since the beginning of the year. We have 6 more weeks to go before he comes home. I'm a stay at home mom, so I've been home all this time alone with my 3 kids. two of which are toddlers. i live about 4 hours from anyone i know. i never made friends here. it doesn't help that i'm too introverted for that. just thinking about it makes me feel bad. ever since i moved away from home and everything i know, i got this bad case of social anxiety, no idea why it happened once i moved. 

anyways, we're selling our house and its super stressful. i have to keep it show ready 24/7 and it's really hard with the two little ones. i alone had to pack everything away, to declutter and ready the house. i alone had to clean like there was no tomorrow, i alone have to keep the kids entertained with all their toys put away, i alone have to make sure nothing it out of place, i alone have to take care of three kids. i know i'm not the only person who has to go through this. my situation is only temporary and i know for some, this is their life. which makes me feel horrible for feeling this way to begin with. 

like i don't have anytime for myself. i'm at fault for making my kids so dependent on me. but how are they going to get used to other people besides me if theres no one around? i never put them in any type of daycare since there was no need for it. plus, its super expensive here. 

no lie, i can't remember the last time i showered. i make sure my kids are fed and showered. like i'm only keep going for them. i'm on anti depressants. maybe its time for a mg change.

On the day it happened it was lunch time. During this time we have two shifts and everyone is on the sales floor doing lunch nobody is in the offices or in the back warehouse. 

My dad was in a meeting with a lady and his door was open and they were chatting. I went back to the copy room to check my mail box 20 mins later when I notice that the copy room door was shut.

30,"Let me give you some background.

I was driving home for lunch on my lunch break from work. I live about 10-15 minutes away from my office depending on traffic and what way I take (grid road system in my city). I decided to take the interstate to get back to my house as it is usually the quickest with 65mph speeds. 

So I am traveling north bound on my interstate. The road is currently at 3 lines. I am in the middle lane. There are roughly 3-4 cars in the right lane and 2 cars in the left lane pretty even with where I was.

I was approaching passing both sets of cars on either side of me when the second card in the left lane decides to get over in my lane to pass the car ahead of it. The only problem with this scenario is I'm there going about 65-70mph. The car comes within about 6inches of hitting me so I swerve to the right inbetween two cars narrowly avoiding hitting both. 

As I am swerving to the right I am now in the shoulder heading in a direction that has me about to go down a hill. While this is happening my mind is only thinking I am about to fall down this hill and my car is going to go toppling over. 

I slam on my breaks and try to straighten my car to the left more while I am in the shoulder. As I do this my car begins spinning back into the 3 laned interstate. I narrowly avoid hitting cars in the right lane and middle lane as I spin the first time. 

I spin again from the middle lane to the left lane heading directly to the shoulder on that side and a median dividing the traffic traveling the opposite direction. As I am spinning I am seeing SUV, sedan, convertibles I mean any type of car swerve to narrowly avoid me. My thought process the whole time is that I am going to get T-Boned and die for sure. My heart is now in my throat. I'm sweating like crazy. I'm shaking uncontrollably.

As I stop spinning I stop just shy of the median facing the direction as if I would be driving into traffic. I didn't hit another car, another car did not hit me. My car was shut down and unable to do anything in it for a couple minutes. I look around to make sure everyone else is alright and if that car that swerved into my lane was around. Nope they were long gone. Everyone else was getting corrected and safe and then on their way. 

At the end of the day I couldn't believe how lucky I was to not hit anyone, for anyone trying to avoid me to not hit anything. My life flashed before my eyes. 

After this experience I feel like letting go of all my petty feuds and to forgive those that wronged me or ask for forgiveness in those I wronged. It was really a life changing event that really opened my eyes to how quickly your life can change or be ended or anything. 

I was shook for the rest of the day. Didn't go back to work. Hard time falling asleep. But today I am feeling a bit better and I thought maybe sharing the story would help me move forward.

My parents are a mess that ruined my childhood, made me grow up way too fast, gave me anxiety and PTSD, and failed to teach me how to be socially adept. They still fight and I still have PTSD all the fucking time

My SO and I recently started a LDR because different schools and whatnot and it's been really grating. She's been getting mad at me and acting more and more seclusive and I just keep thinking that she's cheating on me

The few friends I have had all disappeared. Some moved way out of town. One of my best friends told me that she couldn't deal with my sadness and depression and that I'll have to deal and solve my anxiety by myself because she's sick of me being mentally ill and promptly cut ties. Other people constantly tell me how I'm unlikable and an antisocial loser, how I'm a piece of shit and that nobody likes me

I hate living. Fucking hate this shit. Nobody cares about me and my existence so I just want to do everybody a favor and kill myself and disappear. Nobody will even remember who I am so I just wanna jump in front of a train and do everybody some good. People constantly tell me I'm useless so I just wanna fucking commit suicide.

36,"I wanted to post this to r/getmotivated but they don't accept self posts until tomorrow but I wanted to post it today. I saw this post about how you can't please everyone because you're not chocolate... But not everyone likes chocolate. It made me think of this story my old family doctor told me after I broke up with the first boy I had unrequited love for.

This is a diner story. The owner tells his waitress that they received an extra shipment of ketchup and that they need to get rid of it before it goes bad. She needs to offer ketchup to everyone. He insists to *everyone*. 

She starts her first table and the customer orders pancakes. She wants to keep her job and the owner is watching her. She offers the ketchup and they look at her weird. They're like no, thank you. She doesn't insist. 

Next table orders eggs and bacon. She offers and they say sure but they don't end up using the ketchup after all. 

Next table orders waffles and fries. They accept and end up using the ketchup on their waffles.

I'm not going to draw this story out longer but basically you're ketchup. You're a condiment that isn't going to be a good fit for everyone. It could be because of the wrong placement, the wrong time or just because they don't like you. That's life. If you get rejected by something, don't take it personally. It's easier said than done but it's something to think about it.",13Apr2018,5
37,"I am so sincerely sorry.

But he doesn’t want to hear that anymore. What he wants is evidence I’m willing to change my behavior. He’s heard “sorry” enough now. 

I keep taking the love of my life for granted. I’m emotional and irrational, and have depended on him to put in the effort to improve this behavior for me. He teaches me. He coaches me. He calms me down. He thinks with me. Sometimes for me. 

He’s measured and has been working on being honest and deliberate for many many years. He’s consistent and wonderful and loving and generous. But I kept taking taking taking all of his efforts, and putting minimal efforts into changing myself. 

At his expense, often, I would react quickly and without consideration. I have accused him of so many unloving things that I have no real evidence for. It’s so mean and hurtful and I just am not thinking well. He deserve better. 

He’s not tolerating it anymore. He’s distanced himself for the past week. We are typically so affectionate and close and physical and loving and I miss it so fucking much. He has been sleeping on the couch for the past four nights. He hasn’t tucked me in to bed with kisses and reminders of his love. He hasn’t called me ‘honey’ or ‘my love.’ He won’t sit next to me on the couch while we watch TV. He’s expressed that he’s cautious and worried and can’t keep putting in all of the effort to change this problem I have. And he won’t accept the consequences anymore of what I’m doing. 

That’s fair. That’s wise. That’s what he deserves. I will change. But I’m so sad. I miss him so much. He deserves the best and I love him with all of me, but this engrained behavior requires effort to change and I haven’t been putting it in. He has every reason to be disappointed. I’m disappointed in myself, too. 

Four days ago our fight started. We talked and I took responsibility. He felt very apprehensive of me and frustrated. 

Three days ago he helped me out when I was running late for work, gave me sound advice to handle my emotions because it stresses me out, and wished me a better day. He brought my jacket and a coffee to work (asked if I needed it....I did). He couldn’t really look at me. When I got home, we watched his favorite tv and I heard him laugh and saw him smiling toward me and I was overcome with joy and love. No touching.

Two days ago he initiated a hug and rubbed my arm while watching TV, laughing again. 

Yesterday he put aside everything to tell me I looked nice. He made a joke about me and we laughed. He came to the couch and leaned on me and rested his head on my back. He told me he was worried about me acting out against him again in the future. We talked again, and he explained exactly what has been upsetting him. I acknowledged what has been happening, and I admitting to needing to change. I will change. He just needs to see it to believe it. He will help. I just have to put more effort it. I hugged him, and he seemed to only sort of want it. He came in to the bedroom for the first time last night to pull the covers over me as I laid down. He left with a “good night” and slept on the couch again. 

It’s progress. This stuff takes time. I understand. It would be selfish to be expectant of him to “get over it” and be so loving toward me. I’ve been trying to help him and be supportive of him and just pleasant and letting him guide the recovery. 

But I’m so sad. I miss him. I miss the love in his eyes. I miss his arms and his kisses and his snuggles and his body. I miss the typical jokey dynamic between us, followed by genuine and whole appreciation for each other’s awesomeness. I miss knowing he’s happy and fine. I miss talking on the phone during my lunch break and telling each other about our days. I miss scratching his head just how he likes it as he lies in my lap with his eyes closed, and I know he’s relaxed and safe. I miss waking up to his sweet sleepy face and starting my day next to him. I miss him opening the door to our apartment as I am about to walk in, greeting me with a huge smile because he’s so excited and he heard the elevator ding and knew it was me. I miss him casually playing with my breasts or running his hands over my body. I miss running my hands on his big arms and chest. I miss holding his hand while we watch TV on the couch all snuggled up. 


It’s silly. We are recovering. It’s only been a few days. I think we’ll be okay, because I know what I need to do. But we just have never been without these things every day pretty much since we’ve met, and now I’m faced with the evidence that I have really hurt this loving and incredible man and it’s affecting him so obviously.",13Apr2018,5
38,"Hello fellow Redditors, I'm not quite sure where else to put this so I'm hoping someone here can help me figure out how to move forward. This is a throwaway account because I don't want friends/family to think I can't talk to them, but I feel like they're biased and I need a stranger's point of view. 

Yesterday I had a dentist's appointment to get two fillings put in, one on each side of my mouth. This was not my first rodeo, I've had several fillings put in during my life and I'm very familiar with the process. I've been going to the same dental clinic for ten years. I've always had excellent experiences with them, they've always been very gentle and stop immediately to administer more numbing if I indicate I'm having pain. I recently moved and decided to go to a different branch (same company) at a different location closer to home. 

So, yesterday's appointment. The head dentist (I'll call him ""doctor"" for simplicity) explained what we were going to be doing, then grabbed the numbing gel they use before giving the numbing injections. He swabbed the areas he was going to inject, but immediately grabbed the needle without allowing more than thirty seconds for the gel to set in. The left side injection was uncomfortable but I have a decent pain tolerance and knew it would be over soon, so I just breathed through it. 

Then he moved to the right side and I knew immediately that there was NOT enough numbness over there. It was incredibly painful and I immediately made a noise to let him know. In my experience, that's all it should take for them to stop and give you some more numbing gel. He did not. I made more noises and tensed up off the table, trying to get him to stop, and he just said ""I know, we're almost done."" At one point he hit a nerve or something and pain shot down the side of my tongue, and I was afraid he might be causing nerve damage. So all I could do is lay there and wait for him to pull the needle out of my mouth to reload, and when he did I said ""Would you please give me more numbing gel on that side, that was too intense."" He did, but I was shaken and tearful at that point and withdrew into myself for the rest of the (2-hour) appointment. He was not gentle at all and often had so much cotton and fingers in my mouth that it was hard to breathe, even through my nose. When I finally got out to my car I had a panic attack in the parking lot and it took about a half hour for me to calm down enough for my bf to drive me home. 

Since then, I've been shaky and near tears. I keep having flashbacks and I haven't been able to eat since about 10:30 yesterday morning. Not because my mouth hurts. That's the kicker, as far as I can tell he did a great job fixing my teeth. It's all anxiety, whenever I try to eat something I feel like gagging. I'm at work and I had to hide in the bathroom and cry during my lunch break.

I feel like my trust was violated, I feel like what he did was wrong, and I don't know what to do about it. I don't know if he's just inexperienced or what, but I never want to see that doctor again. I don't want anyone else to have to suffer. What do I do? Leave a negative Yelp! review? I know that we've made leaps and bounds in the medical field and anesthetic is a new luxury, in the past agony could be expected from a dentist visit. Am I just being a big baby? I have never, ever been afraid of the dentist before but after that experience, I'm afraid I'm going to have to have them gas me every time I go in for a cleaning now. 

I needed to get this off my chest. Please, any kind of serious advice would be appreciated. I feel incredibly lost. ",13Apr2018,1

44,"Throwaway.

I'm a huge geek out of college. I work now for a large company.

A month ago I had to wake up and attend a webinar from home. Our largest client was on it, as well as half of our higher ups in our company.

I took a shower beforehand, and when I got out, I dried myself with my towel, threw it in the hamper, then I looked at my phone.

Holy shit, it starts NOW. I can't be late.

My laptop is in the living room, my bedroom is all the way across the house and upstairs. Shit.

I panicked, leaving my towel in the hamper, put on my glasses, and went running in my birthday suit in a panic to the living room.

Log in now, show I'm there, and get dressed right after.

I logged in, and clicked the video icon to start the presentation, and then right there was my nightmare as the screen opened.

There I was, in HD on screen.

I was NAKED.

I'm a virgin at 22. And here I am, all my secrets exposed for 35 people to see if they just glanced at their computer screens.

Eyes wide, mouth open for 5 seconds. My 5'6 bare body on screen. Lily-white from the neck down. A smattering of hair on my chest and rounded belly. Not ""fat"" but definitely a belly on a geek who never hits the gym. 

And my 4 inch limp penis for the world to see.

In a panic, I spammed the icon to turn off the cam, and all it did was maximize it.

In pure fear, I clamped a hand over my penis and balls, turned my big, round, bare white butt towards the camera (my friend Ashley always teases that I have a ""bubble butt"" that she says I'm ""hiding"" under my ""nerdy khakis"" all the time) and ran out of the room for cover.

I came back, fully dressed. Everything was fine. No laughter. No commotion. Nobody must have been paying attention before the training started.

After it ended, I received an email from Mrs. Jenson, the (very attractive, and very married) 47 year old Senior Vice President:

""Next time don't go traipsing around your house with absolutely nothing on before a big meeting. You're lucky nobody else saw. Don't worry, I won't tell your boss, naked boy. Nice BUTT! haha.""",13Apr2018,0

Ever since I was young I’ve wanted to be involved with computers and now here I am in high school finally given the opportunity to build networks with Cisco’s PacketTracer, working with bulky Lenovo Laptops with ISR’s to follow labs all set for the curriculum with Cisco, and building computers. I’m very eager to continue to learn more and progress until I graduate and go beyond what I know now and I’m incredibly grateful for my instructor David Bayne for running the program. I hope that other people all over the world can have opportunities like this, to be able to take classes like this and to learn more even if just for a year and not the full course because I know if other people had opportunities like this in high school they would take it in a heartbeat because it’s cool!

50,"My account is under 18, that means I have maximum settings for not viewing NSFW content.  

In spite of that, when browsing /r/all/new there is always pornography in the feed.

The flag function funnels the report in a way which only to reports it as a violation of that specific subreddit's rules, and to manually enter text-input for a reason.  Therefore the report is only ever seen by the moderator of that specific subreddit, who may or may not care - or could even possibly be getting off on it, like a flasher would - knowing that by not flagging their pornography as NSFW it will likely be getting seen by hundreds or thousands of children.

The flag function does not have a relevant report that goes to the website administrators, in a global context - and it does not remove the offending post until it can be reviewed.  

There needs to be some kind of image scanning, which would prevent pornography from being posted without the NSFW tag, and there needs to be more robust tools in the flagging function where someone can report, globally, that the post has pornography but is not labeled as such so as to bypass the NSFW/-18 filter.  

This is totally unacceptable, and I am not going to continue to use this website that continues to promote the sexualization of children by showing them pornography in a way where there is such little effort, if any at all, in the ability to prevent, block and report this offending content.

Here is an example, [NSFW Warning] found in browsing /r/all/new :  https://www.reddit.com/r/normalnudesafterdark/comments/8c3ddt/staright_dm_hirls_if_interested/  and this just keeps happening, this website is obviously broken and in a very disgusting way.
