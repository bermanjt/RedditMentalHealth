0,"When I was 17, I thought I was really mature. The scariest part, is how self unaware I was of how immature I was. Now 20, I feel like I've grown a lot, and I still feel immature. How did I go from this polarity of thinking I was on top of the world and knew all and was all, to now being underestimating of myself and my strengths? When I was 17 and 18 I hung out with very obnoxious others. I came across a rich french man who was about 10 years older than me, very good looking. We went on two... ""dates"".. and my ego was so huge, I could not see that he was using me and predator. I'm actually baffled by immaturity and lack of rational thought, getting lost in fantasy and idealizations. I was chasing so much bullshit in my life. All I cared about was clubbing, social media attention, designer things, and having guys think I'm hot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well anyway, I used to be one of those people who literally wanted designer everything and lived off social media. I now feel amish because I don't have wifi at home, I sold my phone so I could eat and I live very frugally. The highlight of my boring and mundane day of school work, grocery shop, schoolwork, pay rent, sleep, grocery shop is eating a bowl of rice and  I'm actually okay with it... I'm actually okay with it. This simple life. 

&amp;#x200B;

And one day if I do make money, imma spend it on traveling and educating myself. Some people see value in designer things, and that's cool. My realm of seeing the world has changed and that shouldn't negate anyone else's experience or personal interests.. but it is fascinating to see how values change as you grow. I used to think people didn't really change. ",01Dec2018,1

2,"I don't feel very productive when I realize that I spent the entire day listening to music on my laptop instead of, at the very least, just simply starting homework let alone stepping outside and going to the gym, things I put off until much later than I should and wish I didn't.

To answer my own question, someone who's productive is the exact opposite of me right now; someone who has a gym routine and agenda full of homework that they are not following. I just wish I could push myself to at least start. The thought of it is simply frightening though, that's why I put them off in the first place. I wish I didn't have what feels like such a mental block, stopping me from just getting on top of my shit, being productive and **respectable.**",01Dec2018,1

5,"I feel hopeless and have no-one, mom died few years ago from cancer, best friend just died in car wreck and my long time GF took our kids and won't respond to my messages about joint custody. I've raised them and been there sole financial supporter for there whole lives. A beautiful boy and girl who I miss sooo much it's killing me. Never been the type to cry or show emotion but I'm overwhelmed and have no idea how to cope. I've been on Reddit for couple years and read all the advice given and the support, figured I'd reach out to complete strangers to cheer me up a little. I feel horrible, I have a nice house, truck, nice things but nothing seems to keep my mind off of my kids and GF. We both played a huge role in our demise maybe me more.  I don't have any social media no close friends to open up to. I'm literally sitting in the chipotle parking lot waiting to go in and eat which I'm dreading cause I'm hungry but can't eat, I can't sleep I'm self employed so I have no co workers. Don't get me wrong I have alot to be thankful for but fuck me, this hurts so bad. I want my kids I want my life back. I screwed  up bad. I've never ever in my life contemplating suicide like I do right now. I'm definitely not gonna do anything like that but what else to live for if no-one needs me. Even my long time dog died couple years ago. I go home to a big empty house. I probably did this to myself but it hurts so bad. I just hope they are ok and safe and hopefully she'll finally reach out to me. Rant over. Feels a little bit better to open up like this.

6,"His name was Odie, but I called him big fluffy. He was a dachshund. We rescued him in 2009 and he was the happiest, silliest pupper in the world. We have another daschund, Luna (bear) who is the same age but the total opposite of my big fluffy. 

On tuesday we took him to the vet because he was having trouble breathing. The vet said he had a pinched nerve and gave him some medication. 

This morning, Odie was standing in the kitchen and fell on his side. He couldn't walk. My mom called the vet, who said to take him to see a neurologist at the emergency vet hospital. 

2 hours later, I get a call telling me that my boy has heart failure and our best option is to put him down. I drove there as fast as i could. I brought him his favorite food, cheese, but he didn't want it. It seemed like he didn't even recognize us or know where he was. It was like he was empty. I rubbed his ears as he took his last breaths. 

Everything was fine. He was acting normal. He just died out of nowhere. 

It's funny how life works. My dog and my dad, the 2 men in my life who never left my side and gave me the most unconditional love died, suddenly and unexpectedly, from the same heart condition, almost *exactly* 9 months apart. 

What's more is I'm frustrated because my boyfriend is incapable of feeling bad for me. Of course he is sorry and gives his condolences, but he just doesn't understand. I can't blame him though. He has never had the honor and privilege of being loved by a dog. He likes them, but has never owned one. So he can't know what it's like. 

They say dogs are man's best friend. They are right. 

Thank you for 9 years of unconditional love and friendship, Odie. You will always be [my best friend.](https://imgur.com/a/aqgJ71y)",01Dec2018,1
7,"It was overall pretty awesome! We went to a state park and hiked, saw some waterfalls.  I went because my daughter has a neuromuscular disorder and wears afos (leg braces).  She gets around alright but hiking on uneven surfaces, steps, and just long distances she needs help.  She was all excited when they announced the trip earlier this year but I know how she does hiking as it’s not her first go round.  

I talked to the teachers, did all the background check crap to be able to volunteer, rode a school bus for hours for the first time in decades, endured loud ass kids (lol why do kids yell all the time?), but it was all worth it.  It went as I knew it would and everyone was always way ahead of us, but we made it to two different waterfalls and she did great.  I took good pics including one of her chilling at the bottom of a giant set of steps going down a hill that she conquered.   

She never felt like she was a burden to the group (which is what she gets anxiety about because she is slower than everyone else).  I’m just happy she was happy and was able to enjoy the field trip.  

Also happy that Reddit provides enough memes for me to fit in with her age group lol.

Lol and if you’re looking for a Christmas gift for a teenager buy them a battery charger for their phone—those kids were super popular on the bus ride home.  ",01Dec2018,1

I was amazed at how easy it was and began to slowly start stealing a couple of things here and there from the self serve. Now it’s on average $10-30 each time I do a shop. I still pay about $25 each time for other things. 

When I managed to walk out I felt high. I wasn’t caught. But today I did it and walked out and felt regret and a fear that maybe they had me on camera. I feel paranoid and terrible. I don’t want to do this again but I know I probably will. I’m going to try and stop. ",01Dec2018,1

My main concern is that I’m not doing these things because they are making me happy but because I feel very much unloved and lonely.

17,"Christmas usually means a happy time for me, because I'm Christian and I love celebrating it with my friends and family (especially the latter). I enjoy coming together at my parents' house and eating and laughing and playing board games, and exchanging gifts.

But this year, I am just not at all looking forward to it, because I am in the midst of a separation from my husband, and I would be the only one among my family who would not have a significant other (all my siblings are married). 

I am also feeling out of sorts, as right now I am in limbo, and that's one feeling I detest; I am neither single, nor divorced. It's a feeling I'd never had before now, and I don't know how to deal. I just know I feel a lump in my throat quite often. 

I honestly wish I could fast forward the rest of the days in 2018 and go straight into 2019, like that Adam Sandler movie (I forgot the title, but it was a one-word title). 2019 SHOULD be a better year because 2018 has been absolutely horrendous for me. There were some great moments, but it has mostly been bad.

I feel more tired when I wake up than I did when I went to sleep. It’s currently 3:31 AM as I’m writing this. I’ve just spent the last hour and a twenty minutes trying to sleep and decided I was getting to that the more you try, the more difficult it gets point, so I stopped and decided to rant on Reddit. I’m maybe going to go get a glass of water, I don’t know. I fucking hate sleep. I never want to go to sleep when the time comes that I ought to, and then I become its prisoner.

25,"I'd posted this on Casual Conversation, but I don't think it reached a lot of people. So here it is again:


I'm someone who cannot do much for myself, unless I'm answerable to a person. I've been wanting to change a lot of things in my life which include exercising, reading books and not watching Netflix so much, to name a few. 

Is there anyone who wants to change a lot of things too, but cannot do it alone? If yes, maybe we can be accountability buddies?


Rules are simple
A) First we will decide what our overall goal is. Mine, for example, is to not eat sweets and to drink lots of water. 

B) Now that our goal for everyday is set, we decide a punishment for every time we fail to do our chosen activity. It could be something that is challenging for you (like going to the movies or having dinner at a restaurant all by yourself)

C) This way, even if you missed a day, the punishment will take you out of your comfort zone a little bit. Therefore you end up doing something beneficial for yourself, no matter what you do. 

It's just a thought. We can add a lot to it, of course. I don't know if this is the right sub for this, but hopefully I will get some like-minded people who are looking for something similar. 
I've even made a group on telegram, and we're three members in it right now. I can send the link if you want to join :)

I have no money, the car I drive is in his name. I have bad credit. I got in trouble a year ago &amp; can't get many jobs because I won't pass the background check &amp; I don't have a driver's license. I'm not eligible for re-instatement of my driver's license until at least December 30th, that is if I can come up for the money 
for the SATOP class, along with the re-instatement fee. I won't be able to find a decent job until I can come up with $5000 to finish paying my attorney.

I am currently driving 55 minutes one way, to work at a restaurant. The owner pays me $40 a day, cash under the table, whether I work 8 or 12 hours. She hired me to be a bartender, I thought, but I serve maybe 3 drinks all day since I work the breakfast shift, &amp; there are hardly any customers at the restaurant.

31,"I'm 30 and I work in a call center making 30k. For years I worked more hours making much less than this just to get by. I have my sights set on a job making 45k hopefully by next year. The last ten years have not been easy. I've been abused, harassed, threatened, had my wages stolen by employers, generally treated like garbage, and have had two serious mental breakdowns from stress. One of the worst things I've experienced is constant gaslighting. Being told my life can't be that bad or because I'm not working a ""real"" job and someone somewhere has it worse. And, of course, the isolation is horrible. Most middle-class people want nothing to do with someone in their mid-twenties who makes a low wage unless they're a student or an intern. I have been shamed and laughed at on dates for my job and mocked by exes' families. I began to lose friends the year I didn't go to college and everyone else did. At this point I have almost no one left except my family.

Most of the time I try not to compare myself to other people. I've been suicidal for most of my life. I consider any day I'm able to meet all of my goals a good day. I consider the fact that I've been working full stop since I turned 19 an accomplishment. I don't act impulsively or have any addictions. I don't even ""like"" to have ""fun"" the way most people do and try to spend the majority of my time working towards long-term goals. Going from being essentially homeless to owning a newer used car and being able to pay all of my bills on time (if not early) every month is a big deal to me and it took a long fucking time to get here.

My therapist and my boss are both younger than me. I try not to let that bother me either.

Today my boss and I were chatting. She made a comment about moving to Canada for health care (our health care doesn't cover a medication that is both necessary for her and very expensive). She then followed up by saying she was joking and had hope for our state following a few progressive (for us) measures passing in the recent mid-term. I said that I was glad that the minimum wage was finally being raised.

She said that she didn't believe in raising the minimum wage because she thought that people who make that much don't believe in bettering their lives or want to ""be"" anything. The ""minimum,"" she said, should be little enough that people feel ashamed to work that job, and that the ""better"" people won't be able to tolerate the shame for more than a year before looking for a ""real"" job.

People who work low wage jobs DO feel shame, though. Frequently, people kill themselves because they don't know a way out of poverty. I personally have the emotional and psychological scars to show that being poor has long-term effects and getting out of it is far from easy. I worked over 50 hours/week for over four years just to afford my rent. Then I lost my job and had to move back in with my parents. It took me three months to find a part-time job. Two years to find a better part-time job that I could walk to. A year to get a beater car. Two years to get a better beater car, though I didn't know it was a beater at the time. Two more years to get a newer used car after the last one died. I didn't qualify for it by myself so I had to purchase it with my brother. We have to wait a year to take him off the title so that he can get his own car.

I slept on my mom's couch for five years. My best friend died of cancer while I worked my butt off for $800/month three thousand miles away. I went to school when I could. I have a sleep disorder now and cry almost everyday. I don't want to be alive but I'm still here, at least for now. I try to remind myself that I've done the best I can and should be proud for that reason. I beat poverty. I did it by giving up almost everything most 20-somethings get to enjoy and working. I didn't party or date or get to have fun, even though I wanted to.

When someone younger than me who has never worked a minimum wage job tells me that people like me are losers, it hurts. It sucks to remember that this is how most people think, even if they don't say it out loud. I've heard it before and I'll hear it again and it will hurt every time.

I'm not going to self-harm tonight and I'm not going to cry all night either. I cried on my way home and now I'm going to get myself a small oreo mcflurry and watch something funny.

I am now seriously contemplating the idea of meeting rich guys both at uni and in the future. I guess this is unrealistic as most rich people either date among themselves or someone super good-looking (I would say I look somewhat above average). 

I guess there is always the chance that it will work though. I know a girl who dated countless wealthy men (and she is neither super rich nor attractive). She met them through school, the web, and various events. I am thinking of using the same approach as her to meet rich guys. If I am bound to join various groups to make new friends, why not join one with more rich people?

The thing is while I play around this idea, I feel somewhat guilty about it though. I have never really acted upon it as a tiny part of me see it as morally wrong. I guess a part of me also fear being mocked as a loser who failed if these guys do reject me. Any advice?",01Dec2018,1

Then and there I decided that I don't want to have regrets when the time comes. I'll just do what I need to do and put everything else aside. It was my breaking point moment where everything changes, I get my shit together and live a better life.

None of that has happened. Everything is pretty much the same.

Fastforward to when I moved to Norway, I noticed how fast I learned speaking the language (less than half a year, not fluent though). It made me realize how quickly I could learn a language, so I tried to focus on latin based languages like Italian and took courses at school in Spanish. Hell, they are fun to learn.

However, because of my desire to fly and travel, I took up, as major subjects, advanced mathematics and physics. They were two required subjects to enable me to apply into this aviation school North of norway. 

I love numbers and problems but damn, these are difficult. Algebraic expressions, functions, derivatives and the like were my favorites, but when it came to graphing functions, finding the tangent bla bla bla, I lost my shit.

I feel like there’s such a big stigma when it comes to relationships and losing your virginity before a certain age etc and I just think it’s such a sad way to live. There’s a lot of people my age that are in a rush to be so adult before their time instead of being young and just living life to their fullest. 

I’ve had my first kiss which is something they don’t know, I’m a quite and reserved person who believes in living life first and finding yourself before you take on someone else and their lives.

50,"I'm 35, lived in apartments since I was 26. As the years have gone by, I keep feeling, with a sense of compounding discomfort, that this crazy feeling from when I was young -- home -- just doesn't exist.

I lived in a relatively big city. And, three years after the fact, acknowledge I took it for granted. But even in the big city, it felt so lonely. When I go home to my parents' home, it feels so different. It feels warm. Like there's hope in those walls. It feels like the flames of my youth has kept a fire burning. One silent and invisible, but warm.

Is this some form of nostalgia? Some pretension that makes me look at my family as a beacon of awesomeness? No. My parents have severe faults - my mother is severely depressed (and on medication), my father is emotionally distant and repressed (until the last few years - cancer scare changes everything). 

But now, being home the last five years, for an hour or six, I'm stuck. I love my family - so much. I loved them before their changes and I love them after. I go to their home, and my own feels so empty.

A man on a string, looking at men on a web and wondering, ""how did you make all that warmth?""

I've lived in apartments for multiple years, and it all strikes in my mind as temporary. I put up a couple pictures. Get new ones. Refuse to put them up because, well, I don't want to put someone else off later. 

I keep staring at a picture I got this summer of a sailboat. It's quite nice. And I keep thinking, ""You're leaving soon. Why put it up?"" while I'm not moving for 18 months. And the answer is that my distinction of home and visitor are broken, I think.

52,"When you think of best friends, you think of those people who are really comfortable talking with eachother. They seem like the people you can spill all what's in your mind about and have the craziest moments with. Well, in this case, I have a girl who is my best friend. But we barely talk during school. I still am in high school and I only have a small circle of friends I usually talk to, and I'm afraid she only pops up on occasion.

She only talks about things. Since it's December, she talks about the things and gifts she wants to give certain people. She has this long list of cosmetics and make ups that she wants, which to me is quite amusing but at the same time interesting. We rarely ever talk about any other topic like her past relationships, her life, her hobbies and such. 

Now and again, I can catch her in her chair sometimes chatting with her seatmates, sometimes being all sweet and too friendly stuff. Whatever, I think. It's not like I haven't seen this before. But I do see her just being quiet and looks rather lonely. Being an introvert, I could bear loneliness, but I just have that feeling that I should go over there, while the other part says that I'm too awkard that if I so much as approach her, I would just make things worse. So I just sit there, staring and contemplating if I should go near her seat or not. I really have no clue on how to start concersations with her, of all people.

Any advice would be appreciated, even if you only read this, it would be so kind of you. Thanks in advance!",01Dec2018,1
54,"In June I moved out of my house. The house was built in the 1920s and hadn’t been properly maintained. My roommates were extremely messy. There was bugs, rodents, and mold. I lived there almost one complete year because I didn’t want to deal with the hassle of breaking my lease. I believed that moving out of this toxic environment would be beneficial.

I didn’t know where I was going to go after moving. This was the first time in my adult life that I had to move from one lease agreement to the next. I did not prepare.

I thought I could live in my car for some time. I didn’t want to move in with my grandma, the only other place I could. I wanted to be independent and plus I still had resentment for the last time I lived under her roof. Also I didn’t want to pay for a storage facility. Therefore I needed to downsize so everything I owned could fit in a 1996 Toyota Corolla. Oh, but I was also a pizza delivery man and needed my car’s cabin to be clean and free of junk. All my belongings needed to fit in my trunk.

I wrote a book in sixth grade. Visitors to my room would often have their eye caught by this book. It was funny and enjoyable and people said they really liked it. I liked it a lot. I spent a lot of time effort and creativity making it. But I had no room in my trunk for it. Or my mother’s Bible. My mustache I grew, harvested, and framed. Yearbooks, photo albums, scrapbooking material from high school and college. Awards, certificates, trophies from my youth. My nintendo that I meticulously saved up $120 dollars over the course of my short life for which I bought myself in 3rd grade. My guitar. My late mother’s guitar. Music books. My movie collection. Every book I owned. Every note I saved from friends, family, and lovers. My furniture. My collection of coins, and rocks. My journal I kept for almost a decade. I cried and told myself that this was a good pain. I was relieving myself of my material bonds. Everything sold on craigslist for dirt cheap or thrown in the trash bin. 

Weeks later my father let me know that he had room in his storage unit if I needed to use it. But by that time I had moved into another place. It wouldn’t have mattered anyway. I hated my father at this time. As of writing I still do. What I hate more than him is the fact that I want to die. I don’t hate myself. But I can’t escape the feeling that my life is an uncontrollable waste. I don’t think I could kill myself. I wonder what is more cowardly, living miserably or choosing to die.

I’ve been sad all of my life. I always thought that one day I would grow up and things would get better. Seems like it’s just the opposite. 

I attempted to get better. I went to a counselor before I moved out of my house. I went to a doctor. I had a psychiatric exam set up for a couple months out. I was tired of being sad and wanted medication. By the time the appointment finally came, I was in a good headspace and decided against going. I guess that good headspace didn’t last long. It’s almost 6am and I have work in 4 hours. I haven’t slept. It’s hard to go to sleep.",01Dec2018,1
55,"Thinking about X thing then perceiving X thing with no apparent causal relation... Well, it's perfectly possible there is causality playing here too:

Subconscious Mind perceives X &gt; Conscious Mind thinks about X thing &gt; Conscious Mind perceives X &gt; Conscious Mind is ashtonished by the coincidence. 

You may argue that there are coincidences that are more separated in time and space so, there's another possibility:

Conscious/Subconscious Mind calculates an array of possibilities [x, y, z...] &gt; Subconscious Mind works in order to put yourself in that context (confirmation bias?) &gt; Conscious Mind thinks about X thing in the achieved context &gt; Conscious Mind perceives X &gt; Conscious Mind is ashtonished by the coincidence.

56,"If it's not the correct subreddit guide me to the right one.

I am seeing a therapist to help me with my communication problem.

I have a lot of problems with roommates considering me a bad person for not being too chatty like them and give them attention.

One of them is very mean and i was told that by an old roommate as soon as I moved in. First i didn't notice the pattern of his shitty and mean behavior until recently i was able to crack it and noticed that he always took me for a bad person and criticized me from the very beginning because he is dirty as shit and I was asking for the place to be kept clean(not super clean, but have the minimum of cleaness)

The other roommate needs too much attention, talks constently about her bf, needs constent validation, all the conversations with her are one sided, she is very rude, she doesn't clean the shit that is stuck on the toilet bowl and she hit me once, way too agressive, at least 2 hours phone calls with friends everyday, shows off what she bought with her dad's money...

I am not agood person, i have my ethics about cleaning and respecting people's private life and the shared space.

My therapist seems to not be willing to acknowledge that some people are bad and toxic and the only solution is to stay away.
She seems to be encouraging me to stay and work on my communication skills, but i keep telling her that at some point some people are just nice people.

So now i am confused, i either stay in the same appartment and work on my communication with my therapist or move out and stop therapy because she is not guiding me well.

61,"I can't believe how accurate the Myers Briggs Personality Test is. I scored ENFP (extroversion, intuition, feeling, &amp; perceiving). 

While reading the information on ENFP, it felt as though it was calling to me specifically. It described so much of my life in ways I didn't even realize. 

Out of curiosity I typed in ""dating an ENFP"" &amp; ""who should an ENFP"" date and it once again got everything perfect. 

ENFP's are best matched with INFJ's or INTJ's. My top 2 ex-girlfriends both likely had those personality types. 

The articles on dating as an ENFP / dating an ENFP are extremely accurate too. 

When an ENFP &amp; INTJ meet, there is an instant spark of attraction. This is *exactly* what happened with my top 2 ex-girlfriends. 

One fascinating thing stood out to me- it said ""Be Gentle On Criticism"" (to the person dating the ENFP). 

While with my last ex-girlfriend, things were great. However circumstances got difficult between us due to issues that were out of our control. 

One huge mistake she made was give me way too much criticism, and not in a healthy way at all. 

This criticism shut me down and made me withdraw from her. It destroyed my trust (there was also a boundary broken) which led me to hesitate on moving in with her.

This of course hurt her, and thus the falling apart began...

I learned a lot through this last relationship, but the articles gave me the road-map for exactly what kind of girl I should go for and most importantly it helps me better understand myself.

And no, I'm not desperately searching for someone or something to tell me ""who I am."" 

These articles genuinely describe me. It is exciting to better understand myself especially in terms of dating. 

Now for the next INTJ / INTF chick that comes along I now ""give her the key to my heart"" by telling her the things that hurt me and the things that make me feel loved. 

All in all the Myers Briggs personality test helped me understand myself faster than if I were to slowly learn over time.

66,"* No Regrets 
 * Learn from past mistakes to make sure you never repeat them but always remember that you cannot change the past. Do not dwell in the What If world, but instead take action to make sure it will not happen again.
* Stay Positive
 * Most things are usually of little consequence in the long run but it's hard to realize and see that in the heat of the moment. Always remind yourself to take a step back and look past the current moment.
* Be Uncomfortable
 * Constantly force yourself to go outside of your comfort zone. This is the best way to grow as a person, become more open minded and form better opinions.
* Delay Gratification
 * Instant gratification can feel good, but if you look ahead you may realize that delayed gratification can feel many magnitudes greater instead of instant gratification. There are times that you need to move fast, but there are times where patience is a virtue and we need to take a step back to see the larger picture.
* Stay Healthy
 * Personal health is very important. It might hurt now or make you uncomfortable to workout or force yourself to cook/eat healthier but in the long run you will be grateful for a better quality of life. This is a subset of delayed gratification but something that is overlooked easily.
* Respect Others
 * Do your best not to speak ill of others, it doesn't help anyone achieve anything. If there is someone who is a negative influence in your life, cut them out and avoid them if possible. If not possible, pay as little attention to them as possible. Revenge is almost never the answer.
* Self Awareness
 * Self Awareness is very important and quite possibly the hardest one. Being able to reflect upon yourself and realizing you've made a mistake and admitting to that mistake is very difficult but necessary in order to grow as a person. It's alright to spend time to play video games and watch tv but you need to be careful to distinguish your reasons for spending time on those. Are you doing it because you're having a good time or because you are avoiding a larger problem, are feeling depressed or down? Be able to recognize the latter and do your best to remedy the situation.
* No Procrastinating
 * Do not use procrastination as an excuse to avoid tasks that may seem difficult. Break it down. Start with small steps and increment gradually and you will be surprised at how easy the task was. Do not get bogged down on details and tell yourself you will figure it out later, figure it out NOW!
* Stay Organized
 * If you do something repetitively, find a way to organize it as it will help you immensely. At first it will be difficult, but over time you will make a habit out of it and will start doing it subconsciously. An example is putting your keys/wallet in the same place at the end of the day, everyday.
* Write It Down
 * If something is too difficult to remember, don't tell yourself you will remember it, write it down as soon as possible. You will not be able be to recall everything.
 * Do your best to offload your thoughts in the form of writing so you can reflect upon yourself later and analyze how you have changed over time for the better or for worse and adjust your goals.
* Set Goals
 * Set long term goals that you are working towards and constantly remind yourself of the end goal. This ties in with delayed gratification. Always work towards your goal and push through. Set your aim high, higher then it needs to be and do your best to achieve as much as you can. However, be careful not to create an unattainable goal.
* JUST. DO. IT.
 * If something can be done in under a minute, just get it over with. You will be surprised at just how much you can get done by doing just this. It may seem tedious when there are many things to do, but if you just do one thing at a time over a period, the results will be surprising.

So basically, when I was around 3 or 4 years old and in kindergarten, every Christmas (or at least as close to it as possible) the workers there would call in someone to dress up as Santa Claus and talk to the kids about what they wanted for Christmas.

But I remember this one year where the man had asked the kids to sit on his lap - as you do with Santa, of course - and he would ask them ""What do YOU want for Christmas?"" and when it came around to my turn, me being the last one left if I remember correctly, I refused (I was a VERY stubborn child)

He kept trying to convince me to play along but I just didn't want to at all. It came to the point where, since I was the last child, he had probably gotten really frustrated and probably had to leave soon and wanted to get it over with, so he actually yelled at me.

It wasn't anything scarring and I don't remember what he said exactly but I think it was probably something like ""Stubborn kids don't get presents"" or something like that.

When I got home I decided that - no, Santa Claus is NOT real because Santa Claus would NEVER yell at kids!

And that's the story of why I stopped believing in Santa Claus.

I want to ask him next time what he thinks it was, but I'd also like to know what you, people of Reddit think.


When I started high school, there was this guy I kind of knew from before. We've been in the same middle school, but in different classes. We've briefly interacted during middle school. My parents suggested I invite him to a trip held by my maths teacher, so i said why not. We didn't have much contact there, either. But we started talking through messages after that. We ended up being classmates in high school. I have fallen for him really badly after 2 or 3 months. I had someone to talk to, even though it was usually related to school or science and very rarely personal. I was scared of my feelings. For some reason, I have felt my feelings were wrong, very wrong. I wasn't physically or sexually attracted to him. But I wanted the best for him. Though I knew I couldn't provide it. I felt like I was the biggest idiot. I couldn't even befriend him, I didn't want to. It was incredibly hard to look at him. It was so weird when I heard his footsteps when he entered the class. Yeah, I even knew what his footsteps sounded like, but I wish I didn't. I couldn't pronounce or write his name. If you wonder about it, I could clearly see he wasn't perfect. But that didn't help me.


High school was agony. I didn't have friends in my classroom, so i was all by myself, having to deal with his presence every day. These feelings have disappeared some time after I have graduated from high school. I have never felt something even remotely similar to that.

88,"I used to be obsessed with sharing my life with complete strangers. At one point even became a  partnered streamer. I felt famous. Loved. It was great. The problem is, with these types of apps. You are spending too much time behind a screen. You are literally spending hours speaking to people you will never meet. But it gets worse, it is also very creepy. People fixated on you. They know you, but you don’t know them. After all, you become your own reality tv show. 

These apps are bizarre. I have many on my phone and lurk in my spare time. It blows my mind to see all these people spending hours upon hours. Sleeping on the app even. A few that come to mind, BIGO live, periscope and liveme. Very toxic apps. Full of very sad. Lonely. Depressed individuals. Who spiral into a state of insanity, slowly. The more they go on the apps. 

It is really a big social experiment. I’ve never witnessed such insanity.

91,"People always complain about how Public Schools are failing the youth of today’s society. While, I do not deny  that there are flaws in the public school system, I think people need to shut up. For 6 years of my life, I went to a god awful private school. I didn’t like it. I didn’t have any friends, and there wasn’t any excitement or variation. I’d wake up, go to school, maybe take a test or two, then go home, do homework, fall asleep, repeat. This school didn’t have any after school activities, and the kids there were bullies.   You would think that the teachers would notice all the crap going on in a school consisting of 50 kids at max. But no. 

After my sixth grade year, my parents offered me the opportunity to leave that dump and go to a public school. I didn’t think twice. I ended up having the best year of my life. I started playing the alto saxophone in a band where I actually learned about music, I made friends, and I maintained a 4.0 GPA throughout the whole year. I learned how to maintain a busy schedule with all the sports I played and all the after school activities I did. I learned how to deal with my problems, and for the first time ever, I was being challenged without being OVERLOADED with homework. 

Now, I’m in the eighth grade, and I’ll never forget  how many kids say hi when I’m walking through the hallways. I’ll never forget all the opportunities that public school has provided me with. And I certainly won’t forget how stupid private school was. ",01Dec2018,1
92,"So I suffer from social anxiety, and it's always stopped me from doing what I really want to do. About a month ago a friend asked me to join his band as the lead guitarist. Even though it's something I would usually say no to, I wanted to move on from the anxiety and agreed. Around the same time I joined tinder, and actually got a lunch date the same day as our first gig. 

Well the date went great and I was feeling really good about myself, although I was still nervous for the gig. Right when I got on stage, I could feel my fingers shaking, I fucked up an intro to a song and we had to start over. I had a miriade of fuck ups throughout the show, I hated every second of it. I felt (and continue to feel) fucking awful and embarrassed, despite all my friends (and the rest of the band) telling me I played great. But whatever the date went well so I have something to look forward to right?

Well the girl ghosted me and only used me for a free lunch. This is the third date in a row for me that's resulted in nothing. I feel absolutely ruined and emotionally distraught. I don't think I'm ever putting myself out there again. Thanks to everyone that reads this",01Dec2018,1
94,"Sleeping has always been a serious problem for me. I just can't adjust a consistent sleeping cycle. I sometimes sleep too early and sometimes too late. I sometimes sleep for 1 hour straight during a class. It makes my teachers feel insulted, my classmates mock me, I can't even talk to one of them without this issue coming up:  


\+Hey, how do I solve this question written on the blackboard?   
\-Oh, I guess you just woke up honhonhon  


\-How many hours do you sleep a day honhonhon  


\-Hey good morning XD honhonhon  


It's a really embarrassing situation. I feel really guilty too so I apologize to my teachers but then do the same thing again two days after. Hell, I even sleep during a goddamned private class. But I don't really intend to sleep, it just happens unconsciously. It's like a fucking disease. One minute I listen to the teacher carefully but suddently I get sleepy so much that I can't resist. I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do. I try to sleep earlier but I either roll on my bed or browse reddit on my phone because I don't feel sleepy at all. Should I drink more water? Maybe more coffee? What would you recommend me to do?

We remained best friends throughout life changes such as moving cities and boyfriends etc. Now she is living in the next city over, but the last couple years it feels like shes no longer interested in a relationship, and has basically ghosted. We used to keep our connection by occasional messages, sharing meme's and jokes relevant to eachother's interests. 

Now she wont respond to anything I put out there at all. 


When we used to meet up she always talked about what was going on in her life. Never asked about mine. If I did try to open up about what was going on with me, she would get weird and not know what to say about anything. Thats fine, I know we both can be awkward but cant friends just listen and be there?


So our friendship was mainly kept on the surface. Nothing too deep. We still shared a crazy sense of humor. Thats all I needed. I didnt even mind that she had no interest in my kid. I mean, she works in a library and is in charge of children's reading time. She doesnt like kids all that much but she still respects them and works with them. But my own kid? Never once has asked about him in the 5 years that Ive had him.


But she stopped inviting me out a long time ago. She stopped commenting on my dumb posts. Stopped liking pictures.

Fine. We dont have to be ""friends"" but in the occasional times I log into facebook to check on relatives/old friends, I dont want to see your self-righteous rants about your library patrons or random people you encounter anymore. They used to be funny things to read once in a while. But I realized that all you ever post are bitchy rants about other people. Im not going to be that wall you bounce negative shit off anymore.

99,"I've been pulling through a depressive episode lately and trying my hardest to be functional and social. 

We had a mouse problem come up recently (living in a very rural area) and have been working with a company that stresses humane trapping, and I love that. We had some repairs done that the mice chewed straight through. Without thinking, I put some glue traps around the area. I dont know why, because even in my anger I should have known glue traps are just awful... but I didnt. It's just the only thing I had and figured itd finally stop them.

A week goes by and nothing shows up so I went out last night to get rid of them after thinking about how cruel they were. Of course, there were 3 mice stuck. 

I immediately started crying. I sat in the kitchen and sobbed. My husband reminded me they they're pests and are wreaking havoc on our home and deck and I cant free them or they'll just come back before the rapair company can come fix the issue. But I couldn't let them just sit out there and suffer. I asked him if I should kill them and he didnt seem to understand why I was so distressed. He figured we should leave them there and throw em away once they've died.

I'm a vegetarian and have spent many hours doing volunteer work for humane societies. I love animals. The fact that I put those traps down hurts me. But I cant let them suffer. I should have gotten snap traps or something else. 

I went outside bawling and submerged the traps in water. The mice died within 10 seconds. I guess I'm absolutely bonkers and beyond depressed because I cried even harder and kept talking myself through it.  It was the first time I killed an animal. I'd read it was the right thing to do if we insist on killing them. 

I dont wanna be reminded that I'm crazy or silly or anything. I just needed to get it off my chest. My husband said I am compassionate to a fault but if that were true the traps wouldn't have been there or I would have freed them. I think  I'm just a sad mess who made a bad decision.

Needless to say, we will never ever ever get those boards again.",01Dec2018,1

101,"I didn't get my license when I was 16 because I just wasn't all that interested I guess. At age 18, I finally got my first license which meant I could drive a car with a licensed driver in the passenger seat. Completed drivers school, all in car lessons, but my instructor was kind of a dick and we didn't get along. He didn't make me feel relaxed or confident, all he did was stress me out. So, after finishing my lessons, I just had a negative view of driving. It made me anxious.

By age 19, people start to laugh at me for not having the next step in my license and... I let it get to me. I avoided driving because I was embarrassed that I was still learning, and that continued until I was 24. It was horrible. The jokes stopped being funny to people and my anxiety about not having my license was just getting worse and worse. I hated it and it was making me depressed and lingering over me at all times. Any time driving came up with someone who didnt know that I couldn't drive, I would just lie. Any time people talked about cars or driving around me I would panic, get super flustered, and even leave the room because I didn't want anyone to mention that i couldnt drive.

And then I said ""fuck this"" and took more lessons. I had cancelled a few times because I was so anxious about learning, but I eventually went. My instructor was nice, but she also made me feel like shit for not driving - but this time I wasn't going to let that stop me.

I passed my driving test on my first try last week. Drove with my sister once, briefly, but today I drove myself to the gym for the first time ever. I was so nervous before getting in the car but once I started I was having so much fun. It was amazing.

102,"Sorry for the long read but I needed to get this off of my chest.

I am a female college student and so was the guy, let's call him B.  About a year ago I had gone to a party of a mutual friend with my boyfriend where B happened to attend, and that is when this happened. My bf and I were enjoying ourselves and letting loose after a long semester. Neither of us had too much to drink which was fine, because so many of our friends came to the party. About an hour into this I notice that B is face down in a couch.  Some exposition here, B was someone I considered a friend. Not a very good one, but we had classes together, we had gone out to eat with friends, been in study groups etc.  So of course, being sober, my bf and I tried to keep him upright, get him water, just try to take care of him.  B mentions he wants to vomit so my bf and I lug him over to the closest bathroom. B is very drunk at this point so I had to physically hold up above the toilet. His arm was around my neck because I was holding him up. My bf left momentarily to get some water for B and that is when it happened.

I just feel one of B's hands on my breasts and he starts squeezing. I froze completely and I don't know why. Maybe it was the fear, maybe to keep B upright, but I didn't immediately push him off because if I had let go his head would have fallen in the toilet and he could have injured himself. B continues this and eventually works his other hand under my dress and forces it in my underwear. He keeps trying to penetrate me and I keep having to shift him away while trying to push him off of me. If I am giving little detail here, I apologize, one year later and it is still hard for me to talk about this without breaking down. All of it was happening too fast and I just remember how I have never felt so terrified and unsure of what to do in my life. I wanted him to stop to badly but I didn't want to just push him off because his head would have been in the water or hit the ceramic tiling. My body seized up and though my heart was beating rapidly I just couldn't move.  Eventually, I am able I push him off (he had about 60 lbs on me give or take) and my bf comes back and sees me crying and shaken and asks what happened. 

I remember getting up and getting someone else to take B and trying to verbalize what I had just experienced.  I don't remember much of what happened after, as it all seemed to be a blur. I just wanted to go back to my apartment to shower.  I just...wanted to go to bed and pretend none of this had happened.  The next morning I texted B and explained to him what happened. He tried to apologize and explain ""that's not who I am"" and if he had just left it there I might have given some thought to forgive him. But then he tries to explain that he probably thought I was his long distance gf and how his semester has been hard and how he misses her. At this point, I am fuming because not only did he assault me but now he is trying to justify it. I told him I don't believe that as he had said my name repeatedly during the assault.  He tries to apologize more and laments that he doesn't know how to tell his gf what happened. I told him I had no pity for him and to never message me again.

I wish I could say it was over then but it wasn't. You see, B and my bf had signed a lease for the apartments off campus. They were going to be roommates for the coming semester.  The contract was binding and neither really had time or resources to get a new place so I ended up having to see the guy who assaulted me anytime I visited my boyfriend. Things were awkward and painful to say the least. Every time I saw him, every single time, my mind immediately flashes back to the assault. How painful it was, the low murmur of the party just outside the bathroom door, the cold and clammy fingers trying to hurt me. It all comes back every time. I wish I could just stop those images but they never seem to leave. 

Fast forward to the present day. Yesterday, I attended a party thrown by that same mutual friend at his place where the initial assault happened. B and this mutual friend weren't particularly close, so my bf and I thought it might be safe to come. At this point, I was very nervous but we were going in a big group so I thought it was okay. Of course, B ends up at the party about 3 hours into it. I see him in that same bathroom where he hurt me and I finally have my chance to take him on. I hadn't spoken a word to him since the assault but I could only stay quiet so long. For one year I suffered in silence. I downplayed what happened to me, tried to forget and tried to move on as best I could. I told no one about this. I felt then and still feel now this overwhelming shame. Not that I got assaulted but that I didn't do anything. For someone who talked a big game of being upfront and honest, I never talked about what happened. I just couldn't do it. I was angry. So angry that I didn't report it, so angry that B just got to continue to live his life while I suffered. Angry that now anytime I went to help someone I have to think twice. He took away my peace of mind and he was here at this party in the same goddamn apartment where he stole my sense of self. Here and now I had the perfect opportunity. 

I ended up going towards him (bf was close behind) and yelling. All that one year's worth of pent up anger and sadness came out at once.  He kept martyring himself and explaining that ""yes I deserve it"" and that ""I was an asshole."" In my mind over and over again I could only think, you're not an asshole you're my rapist.  I could feel my fist curling. I could feeling my lower body tensing and core tighten in anticipation of that one swing to just knock him out and then it just stopped. My arm was shaking. I couldn't do it. I, for one year, had fantasized about getting to beat the shit out of my attacker and when I had the chance, I couldn't do it. My bf and I left soon after that as he saw how violently shaken I was. 

I just feel...disappointed in my self. I wanted this so badly, just for him to experience some kind of consequence for his actions and I couldn't do it. So many women would kill to be able to face their attacker and get their justice and I couldn't do it.  I am sorry for the long read but I just needed a way to reflect and verbalize some of what I felt. I spent a year being silent and I don't want to be silent anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I was assaulted at a party and kept having to see the attacker because he was my bf's roommate. Saw him at a party at the same place one year later and couldn't bring myself to do anything to him. ",01Dec2018,1
103,"Where is our home?
What does home mean to us?
Is it where our friends are? Is it where we consume until our bellies ache? Or is it where we consume our friends? Their lives in bitesized portions, set before us, easily digestible for our viewing pleasure.

Or is our homepage the endless chasm of ever-answers, the wildcard query and knowledge with the breadth of a million lifetimes? With this thirst for knowledge, where does it stop? Should every corner of the internet be catalogued and ready for search, find and consumption?

What if something wants to hide? What if something wants to exist without being viewed? What if, like the face of God, it should not be known by man?

What if darkness serves a purpose? What if there are things in the stars we are not meant to see? What if this universe is screaming at us to stop stripping it naked with our violating light?

What if we're too focused on what to view next to notice whether or not we should be viewing at all? 

We can't make everywhere our home, or nowhere is our home. There should be an outer space. A hidden space. Somewhere safe from the sweeping metacrawlers that crunch their way through the net. 

A web the metacrawler spiders don't travel... they'd call it something like the Dark Web.

104,"I could start this going back 5 years but for the sake of not creating a super long post, let's start 6 months ago. 

I've always been overweight my whole life, still athletic but overweight nonetheless. It felt as though I was in between being actually fat and being fit. Well, 6 months ago, I forced motivation to better myself physically. I kept with it and really grinded on the physical fitness aspect of my life. I'm now in the best shape of my life by far, lost roughly 80 pounds (went from 255 to 175) and feeling great in that regard. It took awhile to give myself credit for accomplishing that as I deal with heavy anxiety issues and often I am very self destructive. Honestly, I thought losing all that weight would help me start loving myself. 

I still find myself throughout the day beating myself up mentally, constantly second guessing everything in my life and every decision I make on a daily basis. I thought the self hate would stop but it has gotten worse. Now I feel as though there is pressure to do things a typical 25 yr old male would do. Without going into much detail from 18-24 my life was hitting new lows every year. Lost some close friends and family members back to back, was cheating on in 3 straight relationships and lost the man I truly idolized, my step-grandfather. Now, I don't regret any of that because it made me a much stronger person but it took quite a toll mentally and more relevant, I didn't experience much of what your typical 18-24 yr old guy would experience. 

Now I'm here, finally I can say I beat that portion of my life and I'm ready to step up and see what the world has to offer. I've got a job I love, working closely with special needs, and get paid well for it. I have great roommates, a supportive family and amazing friends but constantly am dealing with dark thoughts. I'm always thinking to myself that everyone would be better off without me. That I'm a burden on those around me, that I'm not worth it. Even though I know that none of that is true it's hard to actually convince myself that I am worth it. I don't know, I'm not even sure why I'm posting here, I thought if I type this out and present it to the world I can finally come to terms with everything.

Lets talk about my other interests. Music is a big part of my life, same with about 7.5bn others. It feels like every song worth making has already been done and better. There's such a finite amount of chords and melodies. Music is just finding different ways to put them (or Not even, considering the trillions of songs comprised of the same four simple chords). I don't think any song I've ever made has taken any skill to actually do. It's only taken patience and could have been done similarly by pretty much anyone else with enough time. I don't think there's any higher order to music either. I love psychedelics but every other psych users always has some grandiose ""dude ive loved music for as long as i can remember... its my true passion! i feel like it's the universes language!!"" or somethint of the sort. Nah man we only like music cause we like symmetry (440hz and 880hz sound nice together cause of a 2:1 ratio). And it's also because our ears developed to hear and our music sounds this way because our atmosphere is comprised of these specific elements. If we lived somewhere else or breathed somewhere else our music would sound completely different.

I don't think I will ever find a mental partner. I don't think I'm even mentally or intellectually demanding in any way but still nobody romantically gives me the depth I require. I can't even put into words what I really mean by that but I guess someone could assume if they cared to.

I was a pudgy child when very young and got put into sports early.  I remember frequently huffing and puffing after minor exertion but was always told it was my fault for being out of shape.  By age 8 or 9, my weight was normal but I still had problems.  I would usually need about 30-90 minutes to catch my breath after aerobic exertion of any kind.

We lived in a remote area and I remember being sick at least once a year with chest congestion to the point I could barely breathe at all.  OTC flu meds did nothing for it.  I often had to lay in bed gasping for several days before symptoms subsided.  My parents just let me ride it out and I don't remember seeing a Dr more than once in all that time.

At school in gym class, I was scolded and laughed at (by teachers and some classmates) for being out of breath before even doing a single lap of the field.  I believed it was my fault for not trying hard enough so I started running on my own outside school.  It was difficult and didn't improve my conditioning at all.

While in high school, I started doing more strength training and, even though I made solid gains in muscle mass, it did nothing for my breathing.

In 11th grade, one day when I was wheezing and coughing and red in the face, someone actually asked if I was ok.  It's a bit hazy how it all played out but I ended up in the ER in another town with a breathing mask over my face.  I was asked what medication I take for my asthma.  Huh?

All told, I think I was literally close to death dozens of times as a child, thinking it was my fault for being out of shape.   I know the real reasons now but it doesn't really feel like vindication... just feels depressing, actually.
