0,All my life I never really had that one close friend or group of close friends so I always counted on my family. But I’m currently on vacation with my family and don’t even feel like I fit in with them. I just sit here silently and listen to their conversations. Sometimes feel like moving far away and “restarting” my life. Sorta hate my life right now. ,22Jul2018,7
3,"Imagine being stuck in a world where intellectually you are above average but lack the ability and social skills to say what you think in the proper way so you are not accepted anywhere. This is how I feel as a man who is attracted only to trans women or the rare Cd. Recently I have been trying to get into the dating scene and I feel it impossible, In 250 characters you can not explain or relay why you want a relationship or coffee, well i cant anyways. My attraction stems from my personal thoughts and logic on what genders truly are, without getting into it I believe there are 4 genders Female, Male and then you have the combination of the two genders producing two unique biological entities, females with male genitals and male with female genitals. This is my thought process on attraction. I'm sure some will say ""how can you tell if they are female with male genitalia?"" Well, That can be another post if people want to learn more about my thought process.  ",22Jul2018,1

I thought moving away for a career type job was going to bring me the satisfaction I needed to be ok with myself and where I am going in life but it was the opposite. I left all of my friends and my family and now I just feel alone. 

I am terrible at making friends despite working in sales where I talk to strangers all day long. It just is getting to be unbearable and I am too scared to try and get a new job or go back to school and meet people. I smoke weed any time I'm not working and just sit and feel sorry for myself. I tried working out and being healthy but I just can't commit to anything and I end up screwing up. I really just miss being happy.",22Jul2018,6
7,"So, I finally went to my doctor and started on antidepressants a couple of months ago. Well, a couple days ago I started having this feeling of anticipation. It was pretty constant, and it wasn't that something bad was going to happen. I was kind of feeling like something good was going to happen, right? So I literally went to Google to see if this was a side effect of Wellbutrin, and then I realize the feeling I'm describing is optimism. Optimism. I have been so depressed for so long that I thought optimism was a side effect.",22Jul2018,108
8,"Hi everyone, avid Reddit user using a throwaway because some people know my regular account. I've wondered about public opinion surrounding this topic and this sub came to mind. Anyways, I'm turning 20 soon and I've never been kissed. Never even gone on a date. I think I'm pretty average looking but who knows, maybe I'm ugly. My body is decent as is my personality, as far as I can tell, but I'm just worried. I'm hoping I'm kissed soonish being that one year of college has already gone by without any action, but I'm fearful that the person that first kisses me will be able to tell I've never been kissed. I could ramble on about this forever since I never talk about it in real life. Just give me your opinions. Thanks!!",22Jul2018,1
10,"Every now and then, usually in waves of a few days when I am having issues with the path I'm going I'll have this insanely bad feelings in the pit of my stomach that I can't speak normally because I'm constantly judging every word I say and nothing I say is good enough. When this happens:

* I feel a deep sense of guilt in my chest
* Anxiety
* Sadness

When I speak words I feel like either I don't genuinely mean them, or I can't express it the way I want to. I feel like I'm not heard.

It's the worst feeling in the world when I feel it. It feels like the negative emotion is constant in my the pit of my stomach and no matter what I say or try to do, it's not good enough. There's something wrong.

I would really appreciate advice on this, because it's a big challenge for me when I feel this way. Thank you",22Jul2018,2
12,"...and today I received confirmation of that.

Today at work during downtime, my coworker was showing me something on her phone. A Snapchat group chat notification popped up. The group chat name? “Don’t add ineedfood16, (other co-worker’s name)”

The other co-worker (let’s call her J) added me to a group chat that several of my coworkers were in before. J and I are cool. Then sometime after I got added, they apparently went and created another one without me in it.

Why do I feel like a lot of my co-workers don’t like me? Well, I can be a little slow at times. They get irritated/annoyed at things that I do (unintentionally) sometimes. I get it. Guess I’m “that” co-worker. But I’ve always tried to be nice and friendly to them, and this is what I get? What irks me is how fake they’re being. They act and pretend like everything’s cool, when I feel that most likely they’re talking shit about me behind my back.

My assistant manager is a part of this clique (his name popped up as part of the notification) and I noticed that ever since he started doing the schedules, I’ve only been getting 2 at the least and 3 at the max shifts per week (and this is with WIDE OPEN availability). Now, I don’t wanna assume things here, as it is summer and mostly everyone else has open availability too; we also just hired a couple more people...but...yeah...

I’m putting in my two weeks as soon as I find another job. Fuck them.",22Jul2018,2
15,"I pulled into a parking lot at a nearby park the other day to get out for some quick fresh air.  When I pulled up there was some college-age girl in her vehicle, she was just sitting there, but due to her age and sitting in a parking lot, my first thought was she was waiting for a drug deal, but not like I'm going to intervene or make a fuss about it.  I know it's a discriminatory snap judgment based on her age, not like I can know 100% anyway, she could be waiting for a friend to show up to walk with that's late, she could be meeting someone from kijiji/craigslist there for that sort of thing who's late, double checking address, etc., even if totally innocent the longer you wait somewhere the more anxiety you're going to have from feeling out of place.

Anyway I was only there for about five minutes, I got back in my vehicle, while I'm sitting there some older guy out with his dog turns the corner, walks by (he had to pass the front of my vehicle first but he didn't stop or look at me) and looks at her, I think he made the exact same snap judgment.  Rather than just moving on, he stops right in front of her vehicle and meanmugs her.  She immediately starts her vehicle and begins backing up to leave, he quickly walks to the only exit she can leave from and stands in front of it, staring at her still.  She slows down and stops, he holds for a few more seconds, then steps to the side so she can pass, but meanmugs her the whole time.

Nothing I can do, but it really bothered me for some reason.  It's one thing to make a snap judgment internally, it's another thing to force that upon someone when you have no idea, and ultimately even for me as soon as I had that snap judgment it was followed by ""So what if she's picking up drugs?  It's really none of my business.""",22Jul2018,2

I come from a verbally abusive relationship with my father. It’s been that way for years and I don’t think it’s going to change.

My dad has been planning a vacation for me, my mom, my sister and himself to go on to hawaii and I don’t think I want to go anymore. I had a long talk with him about trying to fix our fractured relationship and I don’t see him changing even if he can tell it’s hurting me on my end. I cannot stand to spend time with him but I know my mom would be crushed if I didn’t go. I want to remain strong and send a message to him that I’m done taking his shit but don’t want to hurt my mom.

23,"Tonight is a self hate night. 

I opened my high school year book from 2014. I had a really hard time in HS- Socially,academically and psychologically. 
Everything and everybody seemed to tell me I wouldn’t make it. 

Even though I’ve done better than anyone expected, I graduated my state’s flagship college with zero debt and a good GPA, got a *professional* job offer paying 45k a year 60 days post graduation and am fit enough that I routinely get flirted with...

But I can’t shake the feeling of being a failure and worthless. I have a fantastic body, socially I’m adept when I choose to have social interaction, i’m considered smart, I’m going to be able to support myself financially.. I’ve outdone 80+% of my HS peers, many of my college cohort, both my sisters and according to my father- him too..

But after opening this year book a tsunami of regret, self hate,bitterness, lost opportunity, failure and stagnation hit me like a wave. 

If I had been better then I could be so much better now. What was I thinking, why was I such a fuck-up??!? Why do I still feel like a fuck-up?!? Why am I living in the past..?? I deeply deeply regret not making more of my time in HS.. but then I remember how helpless and barely hanging on I felt... argh.. i’m just full of despair tonight.",22Jul2018,1

27,"I’ll give some background first. I’ve been married about three years, have my own apartment and have a stable job. I’m also overweight and can be very lazy. And that really gets to me. It upsets me and makes me sad but I’m not sure if I’m depressed or not. I think to myself “you have a job, wife and an apartment, what else could you want”? But then I think about how I’m not good at my job, my wife and I argue and I’m always broke. I have no energy to do anything and kind of just want to wallow in my own self-pity. Why eat healthy when I can eat like I want and die earlier? It’s a win-win right? I thought that earlier after a particularly bad fight with my wife, and I realized often times I feel no joy or purpose. Like I’m just a fat lazy sack of shit husband and there’s no point in trying. I don’t feel like trying anyway. 

But I always think about what I have and tell myself “no you shouldn’t be depressed you have a good life”.  And sometimes it works and others it doesn’t. But i still feel that sadness. It always comes back. And I can never tell if it’s justified or not. ",22Jul2018,4

After 4 years of being sick im finally starting to feel good, my brain is thinking more clearly, and I think I actually want to get a college degree but my grades are horrible because I didn’t know I was sick for a while.

29,"Tonight I was sitting at a rooftop bar, staring down at the street by myself, thinking about what it must be like to have a big group of friends to go out with and make good memories.  I've always been kind of a small group of friends guy, although I've gone through various stages in my life where I've had larger circles. Now I'm 32 and I've just gone through a phase of going back to college, finishing in 2014, then not landing any sort of career. All my friends are gone and I've moved so much that friendships have dissolved and never really been solid or long term.

So anyways, as I'm sitting there a beautiful woman comes up to me and starts talking to me. I could tell she must have been looking at me, it seemed like she had spent a moment thinking of what to say. I was caught a little off guard because women like that usually don't approach me, probably don't really have to approach men at all.  I've been trying to quit drinking so I take this medication that basically prevents me from getting drunk. It's like I can't win, I'm so boring and stiff when sober, but then I say stupid things when drunk or buzzed. 

She sounded like drama anyways, she grew up in my city but she was visiting from somewhere else. She mentioned that she still had a boyfriend but she thought it was going to be over soon.  I met a woman at my last job that was like this too. I just don't want to be involved in anything like that. I don't get it, why can't I just meet a single woman? I guess I'm not a catch anyways, useless college degree, weird personality.  In closing I will say what I took away from tonight is that I shouldn't bother looking for a partner when I have no career and social status, because I'll never be confident enough to follow through even if she literally falls in my lap.  I am deeply frustrated with life. ",22Jul2018,12

A cheesesteak was accidentally called by another server. When the mistake was discovered, I asked the cook to continue cooking it as I would go ahead and purchase it since it was already half cooked, half raw.

The cook refused, put the half cooked half raw cheesesteak on a plate and put it back into the fridge with other raw meats.

The cook then wanted to use said cheesesteak in a hashbrown bowl for one of my customers about 20 minutes later.  I refused to allow this as I don't believe my customers would want a half cooked put back in with raw meats recooked and put in their food. They'd want a fresh uncooked steak made for their food.

32,"Well shit. This is the worst feeling I could have right before flight. It was a morning of madness as I was packing, ironing and doing laundry at the same time.

Just as I was done with ironing the last shirt and packing my clothes, the main fuse box tripped, leaving the whole flat without power and the laundry in the machine with 5 mins to go.

Once I sorted out the fusebox and finished up the packing, took out the clothes from the machine and ran out the door.

But now I'm drawing a giant blank as to whether or not I had unplugged the iron after the last item I ironed as I was packing things one at a time as I finished ironing.

And the fuse box going off now has completely blanked my memory as to what I did with the iron and the exact moment of the fuse going off is leaving me with doubt. 

No one else has a key to my place and there isn't any other possibility of having it checked out by someone else. 

I'm coming back home on late Tuesday night. Only thing that makes me feel a little comfortable is that the iron was standing up and not touching anything and there isn't anything around (pets, etc.) that would knock it down or whatever. 

Having said that, it's still a terrible gut feeling of uncertainty which won't be gone while I'm on my mini vacation break. Will update on Tuesday as to what happened...

33,"Life has been going alright, for once. 

I got a leadership position and I would say that I've been doing a good job proving myself, especially since I was the newest and freshest kid in the leadership team. My lessons for music have been going well, and I've been steadily improving and gaining confidence. I've been able to talk to more people and help them out when I notice they need it, without feeling nervous or awkward. 

But I guess I haven't been very focused on myself, because I realize that all the things I've been doing have just been things I used to distract me from the bad feelings. I was alone recently, and no one was really online to talk to, and I had my thoughts all to myself. Let's just say these thoughts weren't good at all, as I kept criticizing myself and insulting myself. I still believe it all, honestly. Intrusive thoughts were more frequent, but I tried to ignore them. Later on in the day, I experienced one of my worst anxiety attacks. I was hyperventilating, trying not to cry (but failing), dizzy, and getting numb. It was hard to stop, and I could not breathe. 

I only talked to one person at the time of my anxiety attack, but had to stop because I could not text back well with my dizziness and numbness. I guess the normal thing would be to talk to someone after, but I couldn't even do that. I was so scared during the attack because I was alone, but I didn't want to talk to anyone after because I felt that I was bothering them and not worth their time. Old habits die hard. 

It sucks to know that you can always drop back down to square one, even when you've been improving. I thought I had enough self confidence to be able to talk to my friends about my problems, but now I can't tell them anything. I just hope I get out of this slump soon. ",22Jul2018,4

The only way I've protected myself in the past is by putting up walls and numbing myself. Deciding to not care what happens to me has unsurprisingly not exactly led to self improvement.

39,"I'm going back to college soon after taking a semester off to work full time as an intern with two years left in my degree. Every semester I always have a lot of anxiety about making friends, roomates, classes, classmates, etc. to the point where I can't even leave my room to participate in anything. I worry about so many things like what to say to people and what they will think about how I look or what I do or say. I stress endlessly about where I want to sit in the lecture hall on the first day of classes because I think it can make a huge difference on how the semester goes (which it probably wouldn't). I hate walking around campus between classes because there are so many people and I don't know what they think of me even though most of the people I'm around I have had classes with and am fairly aquainted with. 

I generally feel that I'm a likeable person whenever someone new does talk to me, but I'm afraid everyone always thinks I'm too boring because I'm afraid to come out of my shell around most people. And when I do, I still feel like they just don't like my personality. I have many people in classes who I would consider friendly aquantances but none I have ever hung out with outside of class or studying at the library. 

My school has lots of activities and events at the beginning of each semester to help newcomers meet people and make new friends. Last year I really wanted to go to one because I was so lonely, but couldn't work up the courage to go. I took a nap instead and woke up a few hours later. I realized there was about 30 minutes left in the event and something just came over me and I literally forced myself to get up and go. I ended up meeting one of my closest friends. This was the major point when I realized my anxiety was seriously affecting me.

I have always felt this constant social anxiety since junior high and I have finally had enough. I have been thinking about trying anxiety medication for about a year now but I can't get past the anxiety of actually going to a psychiatrist. I know that I want to start this semester off not being afraid to put myself out there and make new friends.

Any advice or experience with seeing a psychiatrist for the first time? I know I could have bad experiences with medications and have to try several before finding a good fit, but I think it will be worth it. I just need a little help to push me to see a doctor. 

TLDR: Finally want to get help for anxiety before new semester of college. Any advice on seeing a psychiatrist?",22Jul2018,46
40,"It’s a funny title isn’t it? Being the creator of my own stress. But I realise I am…and reality showed me that with the following:

I was alone in my apartment. I usually work at home, so I was at the table doing my work. It was quiet outside with the occasional chatter of my neighbors. I got no demanding texts from my boss that triggered stress – I found the stress I had come from me PRESSURING myself in a sense of urgency and impatience to get my work done as soon as possible so I can move onto other things.

I became like an authoritarian, suppressing the life and voice of the calm, common sensical me and pushed and drove myself hard within rigidness and no mercy within my work.

I found the back story or reason behind my personality – the honesty point being “I don’t like my work and this is not what I want to do. I have no choice but must do it” so within a state of helplessness (cause I have to do it) and anger (because I dont want to do it) I then push myself to do my work in a state of impatience and stress – wanting to get the work done as soon as possible so I can move onto things I want or need to do.

Memories of doing math homework with my mother represents this point well for me. When she would help me with my math homework both of us would be angry and stressy because I had to do the homework (but didn’t know how to and needed my moms help) and both of us wanted to do other things but essentially felt locked down we had to do it. So my mother would get impatient with me (because I was slow/didnt get it) and I would get stressed/scared.

The bottom line being: we were reacting accordingly because we didn’t want to do what was in front of us in the moment – but it had to get done – but we knew it was going to be a process and struggle and cause some discomfort in between. It was going to test our patience too. And we made it worse for ourselves reacting on top of what we were expecting – the struggle, strife and pain.

And let’s be honest – no one wants to go through that. We rather avoid or cope or suppress from the hard painful things because we know if we jump in and walk in the challenging moments we are going to struggle, fall, maybe cry and punch our pillow – so who has time for that and wants to go through that?

We see challenges and things we don’t want to do but must as these jaw clenching obstacles – but we make it worse for ourselves by REACTING towards what we have to do and thus create stress.

We miss out on the journey itself if we are already reacting towards it. The journey being the ups and downs, realizations, and yes experiencing the emotions that’s also a normal natural part when you embark on a journey. The key is to work through them as much as you can in every moment of breath.

This is something I’m still learning – is slowing down and being more attentive to what is going on internally while having to do work externally. For so long I would lose myself in work, in the moment, hardwired and driven I wouldn’t eat or drink. But now I’m learning how to balance being present internally and externally.

Though it is hard if you are expected to act fast in the job. At this stage in my life my job does not require me to work and act fast that is something I created for myself and added all the stress to it.

Now I will be practicing slowing down as I work, and seeing what it’s like when I walk with me on the journey of work from my start time to end time.

I will also redefine the word JOURNEY since it will be a journey for me to walk my job Mon-Friday.",22Jul2018,9
41,"I'm a 20 year old male. I made a new Reddit account. On my old account people were being very mean to me and judging me because of my post history. Whenever I made a post on a subreddit, people would look through my post history and judge me because of it. They wouldn't answer my question, they'll judge me instead. I liked posting on multiple subreddits for advice. People were calling me a weirdo and an attention seeker because of that. I'm not an attention seeker and I'm not a weirdo. The comments were hurtful. People were judging me when they don't know me in real life, they only know what I post. They don't know the full-details of my issues.

I learned my lesson from my old account. From now on I'm being very selective on what I post on Reddit. I'll use throwaway accounts for posts I don't want on this account. And at the most I'm only crossposting on three subreddits for a post of mine.

42,"My husband and I made arrangements to move in to a house with multiple rooms for rent and agreed in a Facebook messenger conversation between that lady and the two of us that we would be renting for $400 plus bills divided among the number of renters. When we arrived to move in this changed to $600 because we were two people in a room, despite being told that it would be $400 originally and full well knowing there were two of us from the beginning. At this time our hands were tied because we were in an other country. So we decided to pay the $600 without a fight. When we moved in all the other roommates were moving out at the same time, we didn't think anything of it, and another girl was moving in at the same time as us. This makes a total of 5 people in the house: the lady, her brother, the two of us, and the extra girl. Water, electricity, internet and food is supposed to be divided between us. Her friends frequently come over to wash their cars, she allowed a woman to stay in the house for absolutely free for 2 weeks without asking us (keep in mind we are paying 1/2 the utilities as she is not charging her brother or this lady, and as a added bonus, everyone one leaves lights and fans on except for us and takes long showers while ours are 5 minutes each.) We voiced our concerns about the water and electricity due to this, and we were basically ignored. She also insisted we wash 10+ loads of dirty sheets and curtains left over from other tenants. In addition to this she has friends come over and eat our food, and the majority of them do not bring something to share or help clean dishes. Come half month and the water department sends us a notice that we have been using a lot of water, she blamed us! She also puts us in danger when she steals her abusive ex boyfriends dog so she can spend time with her, he drives by and luckily thus far has not come into the house but why risk the lives of 3 innocent tenants! She is charging the extra girl her part of the grocery which includes meat and yet she is a vegetarian, when I said something about it, she didn't care how unfair it was that she had to pay for things she absolutely couldn't eat. Our grocery bill is absolutely outrageous at this point, way more than what we would have spent shopping for ourselves.

On top of all this, we are the only ones cleaning, and cooking. I got maggots on me when I took out the trash and complained  and offered a solution, I was ignored.Hubby and I are the only ones taking the trash out. Yesterday morning we woke up to maggots all over the floors all over the house. We also have ants in the kitchen, bugs on the table, flys, and an infestation of mosquitos. Now she is kicking us out! Little does she know we were already looking for another place.

TL;DR: lady promised us in writing $400 rent and changed it to $600 when we arrived; lady also spending our money carelessly as we are paying 1/2 of utilities and food yet she lets people wash their cars and eat all our groceries; she says we are being unreasonable in our complaints.

46,"Got banned today from r/LateStageCapitalism for replying to that thread about nationalizing the internet. I brought up the way socialism destroyed my country, Venezuela, and said that rather than nationalizing the internet, we should enforce an actual free market, with competition and net neutrality, rather than putting it all in the hands of the state or allowing the ISPs to continue monopolizing local markets. I mean, look at how fucked up the American government is right now. Putting the whole of the internet under its control is the stupidest idea I could think of. But rather than come up with a good counterargument, nope, it's straight to the banhammer. Just like dissention and opposition gets squashed in Venezuela. That kind of behavior shows they aren't to be trusted.

Full on socialism is plain stupid. It destroyed my country, left Cuba in squalor, and brought down the Soviet Union. No doubt there are other examples too. What we really need is a hybrid, merging the positives of capitalism and socialism while patching up their weaknesses, something akin to what we see in Scandinavian countries. But never something like in Venezuela... That just brings ruin.",22Jul2018,4
47,"I am 19, going off to university in September to study History.

When thinking about my future the ideas that appeal to me are creating my own brand through YouTube channel, blog, podcasts etc. Helping my community and most importantly helping my family. I  am prepared and understand that anything in life takes lots of hard work over years with ups and downs.

However, I am stuck because currently I’m just a 19 year old with no vision,no passion. For instance I want to start a YouTube channel but I feel like I am an expert in nothing. I have nothing to work towards. The only things that interest me are self-development,studentlife,public speaking (since I have been a student these years).

Does that mean I have to put everything on hold until I get older and experience more? Because literally I feel like I can’t think of anything original. People I look up to who are on their way to achieving success started when they are around 21/22 but I really want to start now. I really want to make something of my life and make the younger version of myself proud.

It’s bad because I have so much free time and I am doing nothing because there’s nothing I can do. (Although I am learning a language, learning to drive, reading self development books and I go to the gym everyday) that still leaves me with a lot of hours in the day which I spent on Overwatch which I uninstalled now because that game makes me angry. Also I pretty much have no friends which sucks (majority of my friends I made these past 2 years pretty much don’t care enough to invite me anywhere even after me asking)",22Jul2018,1
48,"Today I attempted to bake a cake. It was supposed to be banana fosters. Very delicious.

Well after wasting three hours of my life this morning, I’m left in a puddle of tears and frustration. Anything that could have gone wrong did.

First of all, the second layer crumbled. I don’t know why. Layers 1 and 3 were fine, so I thought, “heck let’s just make it a two layer cake. I’ll use the last one for cake pops later.”

Secondly, the fosters “sauce” that I was supposed to make cake out as more of a mush. This might have been my bad because I let it sit in the pan too long. I thought “well I’ll just repurpose it and put it as a crumble in the middle of the cake and in the frosting.

Then I made the frosting, the recipe online called for 1 whole cup of heavy whipping cream. And me, as an experienced baker, thought “wow that’s way too much cream.” But I gave it a shot. About half a cup in I realize this was a major mistake. The icing is runny and way too sweet. So I thought “oops, I guess I’ll just use the frosting for the middle and then on the top, leaving the sides bare.” So I did it.

I frost the cake, slice up some bananas and throw them on top. Despite all of my setbacks, I think “heck this thing doesn’t look half bad! And the ingredients are all there it should taste delicious.” So, happy with the results, I move to place it in my cake transport device to take it to work with me tomorrow. And then, I realize...

I forgot to put a cake board beneath it.

Now, this was the last straw. I thought “how in the hell am I going to move this cake from my decorating wheel to the cake box without it completing crumbling on me?” I contemplated and then decided the best way to do it would be to slide the board underneath the cake and hope it didn’t completely destroy the entire bottom layer.

Well, it did. Kinda.

So now I’m super upset, the cake is lopsided because the bottom layer is practically broken in half. I’m sitting here thinking how this cake is literally my life crammed into 3 hours. I roll with the punches and keep moving on trying to do my best, only for everything to fall apart in the end. Yeah. That’s it.

TL;DR: cake from hell has me crying and upset thinking about how this resembles my life to a T. /rant

51,"To start it off, I want to tell you guys a litte bit about myself.

I am 20 years old soon to turn 21 from Los Angeles CA, I'm currently taking my last couple classes at community college so I can apply to transfer to a UC and potentially finish up and get a Bachelors degree in either Business Information SYstems or Business Administration.

I work as a Freight Broker whilst going to school and earn anywhere from 12-17k a month from my job as I am one of the top dogs at my office. I have been fiending to make more money on top of this as I have realized I'm very passionate about the process of making money.

My job as a broker at the moment is very stressfull as I work from 3:30AM-3PM on a daily basis and go to school after, it is stresful like I just said it is, but also at the same time I love it I don't know whats wrong with me.

I wanted advice from some people on this forum, if they can reccomend any steps that I can take to go up and take it a little bit further and what my potential options are.

I really didn't know how to formulate this post, so I'd appreciate it if you guys can help me out if you maybe understood what my question is!

TLDR; I make 150k a year and I'm only 20 years old still going to community college and I want to make more money",22Jul2018,1
52,"Another empty feeling. Life is just so meaningless. I can't find any meaning. No one means anything to me, nothing matters. It's just another day filled with nothing. Tomorrow, I go back to work and fulfill nothing. Then, I'll race to the weekend to proceed to do nothing all weekend. 

I'm so sick of living this life. Everyone assured me that life will be better in my 20s. Now I'm here, now it sucks. Everyone assures me life will be better in my 30s. I won't even pretend to be surprised when it isn't. And, I don't want to waste my youth waiting to get old. I wish time would stop. Sometimes, I wish life would stop. I ultimately wish I was never born. Life is not a blessing or a gift. It is a curse. there really isn't anything good about it. We just sit here and try to convince ourselves that it is. That the burdens of every day life is somehow worth it. It isn't. We all die alone. We all live alone. Love and compassion is a complete myth. People don't actually care about other people. We just pretend to care because society tells us that we're supposed to love our mom or our dad or that we're supposed to love our friends. None of that is true. I love no one and no one loves me and thats because love simply isn't a real thing. Neither is happiness or joy. It's all fake. And if it is real, then I don't know about it. I don't feel it or I am incapable of feeling it. 

Either way, I'm sick of being alive. IF only I wasn't such a fucking coward. ",22Jul2018,4
53,"I'm a pretty young lad (a mere 17 years old) with some issues I guess you could call them. Every time I crush on someone, which is pretty often, I get kinda obsessed. Or, not obsessed but just really sad whenever they do not respond or whatever. I'm currently talking to a girl who lives far away and next time we can see each other is in like 3 weeks, we recently started flirting so there's that. Anyways, we use snapchat as our primary mean of communication. Whenever she won't open a snap for several hours (yet talking to other people using snapchat) I get super sad. Idk why, because when we do talk it's amazing. But when she purposefully doesn't respond for hours upon hours I just get sad. Is she doing this for a reason? Is there a way I can chill out before we see each other?

54,"I'm living abroad for 2 months, and have about 3 weeks until I return to the states. My very long term boyfriend just broke up with me and I'm completely blindsided. I really thought everything was going fine. About 3 years ago we had a bit of a hiccup, but everything seemed to be fine. I even told my friend the other day that things were 'better than ever'. On Amazon prime day he told me that he bought me a bunch of gifts. Yesterday when I told him about a conference I was going to attend, he was excited and said we should go together. 

He said things just 'didn't feel right' and it's not negotiable. I have no clue how to handle this, other than the obvious stuff like keeping myself distracted and all that. But I already have very few friends, and he was basically the only person I talked to regularly. On top of that, I'm in a foreign country and have nobody to talk to about this or to go do things with to distract me. 

I'm already a pretty lonely person and this will certainly not help. I think I'm pretty pragmatic but this still has me extremely upset. I genuinely thought (and not without reason -- he said the same things to me) that we were going to spend our lives together. we planned on moving in together in december when I finished grad school.

55,"Had a really trash last few weeks (months?). Got a day to myself today so I dragged myself to start cleaning it a bit, being neglected for way too long. It took a lot of self internal dragging, and a lot of procrastination, but I managed to clean up a bit.

Also started off today watching the latest [Funhaus video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ph2XmzFIKw). It made me laugh crying for the first time in what felt like 10 years since.

56,"I never really learned how to flirt/pursue/attract women. Now I'm in my mid 20s and I look around and see that my friends have no trouble getting dates, hookups, and relationships, and it just makes me feel like a pathetic loser. These same friends (male and female) tell me, unsolicited, that I'm motivating, inspiring, attractive, fun to hang out with, etc. But it's all a facade. In reality, I'm just a broken husk of a person who desperately craves intimacy, sex, and companionship... and I don't even know how to go about finding it. Nowadays, I meet girls somewhat frequently (more than in the past), and I generally don't have much trouble making fun conversation, joking around, making them laugh, and having a good time. But I never make moves or try to ask them out... not only do I not know how, but the idea that I'm undesirable has been so deeply embedded into my psyche that I'm literally uncomfortable with the idea that anyone could be interested in me... like if someone suggests it, I have to suppress the urge to yell ""fuck off, how dare you, you don't know what you're talking about"".

I've tried to contact multiple therapists but none of them ever get back to me... I don't know what to do anymore. I'm being crushed by this feeling of worthlessness... I try so hard to self-improve, but this is the one constant in my life that never seems to change... I'm incapable of romance. I just want to be normal.",22Jul2018,5

59,"I'm writing a drama story, and one of the main characters (a human girl of 8 years old named Heidi Falconer - if the name sounds too 'fake' do tell) has an unusual weakness - she's allergic to H2O. She has to avoid water at all costs - for example in the story, one time she accidentally drunk a mouthful of water, and went into anaphylaxis, requiring adrenaline shots to reverse. She has to wear a special spacesuit like apparatus in case it rains as a single drop of rain will kill her, for example if she gets a single drop of rain in her mouth by accident, she will go into shock.

She also has to avoid things like surgeries, her parents told the surgeons not to use any water on her as she's allergic and the surgeons took them seriously (in a world first - beforehand the surgeons always used water while operating on a patient), but after the surgery she had to be put on a medical drip (having water injected into her veins), and then went into anaphylaxis because the drip was water based.

She hydrates herself by drinking 4 small glasses of milk or orange juice a day, which because of their chemical composition bring her no harm. She's 100% healthy as long as she avoids H2O as her immune system sees H2O molecules as foreign. She becomes famous in her country because of her allergy, stealing the hearts of residents near her.

Another aspect to the story is she becomes a tragic hermit after a gang of cruel thieves break into her house and steal her 'spacesuit' and tear it up. She was born allergic, and while in her mother's womb she was kicking around a lot in pain.

61,"Love just isn’t what I thought it would be.

In the end, the only person you can love for certainty—for all time—is yourself. People are fickle and they can fall into and out of love.

My advice is to save your time and, more importantly, your heart. Don’t fall in love with someone that doesn’t love you back. It will shatter you; that’s how you know you loved them, in case you ever wonder any of it was real.

I can’t go through this all over again. I’m just going to stick to focusing on my career. I’m not massively worth anyone’s time or effort: at best, I aim to eat some nice food and read some nice books before I die. If I work hard at those things, I can succeed. There’s just no guarantee of a relationship succeeding, irrespective of the effort you invest.

63,"Fuck I'm worthless, I'm not sure why I still try. The only thing I've got going for me in life is my family which only loves me unconditionally because they have to. Even though I just graduated college I pretty much just slipped through. I feel like it has lead me to feeling no more qualified to work in the field I want. My friends like having me around but I really wonder just how much they care about me. And I have the impression the girl I likes only reason to ever want to date me is in an attempt to not depress me.

67,"My gf and I started dating around 7 and a half months ago after being friends for few months. We met through the same circle of friends and when we did get together it caused major rifts in numerous friendships. After losing one of our best friends in this, we pushed ahead and remained together.

Before getting with my gf I knew that she had a couple of mental health issues but didn't know the extent. However, I knew I could be a good listener and be patient because I've had my own share of experiences. I thought I could handle it. And I did for a while. I tried to listen and comfort her. But I realized that the littlest things could set her off. If I was busy for a few hours and couldn't reply, if I genuinely needed space, if I wanted to hang out with my other friends without her. She would end up crying and then spamming me with calls and messages.

Yesterday was the tipping point. She made me upset about something, and although I don't blame her for it I needed time to just sort out my emotions and deal with it myself. She called me 20+ times while I was out with people in a show. When we met later in the night she had drank more than half a bottle of alcohol and she was screaming at me to stay. I wanted to put her to bed, sober her up a little and leave. She ran out of the house and said she was running away and we chased after her. She made threats about killing herself or hurting herself. She hit herself in the head and now has a bump. I told her I can't deal with all this myself and to let me call the police but she said no. She throw her phone at my best friend and although she says it was an accident, she's thrown stuff when fight so I don't know if I believe her. Last week she started yelling in the middle of the street and grabbing my jacket and hair. I told her we could move it inside but she said no.

She has gotten better though. Before, when we would fight she would leave my apartment and yell in the hallways. I had to beg her to come back inside so we didn't make a scene. She gets insecure about my best friend who is also very good friends with her. I haven't given her any reason to feel insecure, but I do my best to convince her I love her. I told her I can't continue like this and she needs to go to therapy to sort out her emotions. She went once, almost a month ago now and is always saying she'll go but doesn't.

What I am tired of is that whenever I need space, she doesn't leave me alone. She takes very drastic actions to get my attention from self harm, suicide, running away, dropping out. She threatens to harm herself and so I always come back because I'm scared of her doing something. My friends call me telling me to come over and take care of her and they're getting tired of getting involved. This is affecting my friendships now too. It is mentally exhausting to get no time for myself and at the same time make her feel better. She doesn't understand that me not spending time with her doesn't mean I don't like her. I am an introvert and need space.

This morning she called me, hungover and said she'll get better, get help, apologize to our friends and fix things. But these are things I've heard so many times in the past few months. Outbursts like this are guaranteed atleast twice a week with her. Should I end it reddit? This is only my second serious relationship and her first. Can she get better? Should I be a little more patient and help her get better? Really appreciate any advice.

Tl;dr: Gf is really putting alot of mental stress on me and our relationship. I'm not sure if I should stick it out or not.",22Jul2018,16
68,"There's a white line in front of me, waiting to be snorted. I'll do it after this post. Horse painkiller, apparently that's safer than heroin and most drugs generally. Bravo me. Alcohol to my left, plenty of it. The girl didn't reply to the message 'are you asleep?', she is probably sleeping. Or not in the mood to talk to me, maybe she's with someone else, what the fuck can you do.

What do I want to say, why am I posting this, I don't really know. I suppose we seek connection with other human beings, even on the internet. Fuck it, snorted the line. Much better. Music is playing, painful music, lyrics with emotion and kaimo, I like it.

Things are escalating lately. I'm starting to not care to a scary point. I ran from cops the other day, successfully. Saved me from a heavy fine and the court. I felt so alive while doing it- adrenaline rush. My feet are fucked since, I was wearing no shoes- still made it tho. Bravo me, again. I'm so fucking brave, when are you going to write a book or make a movie about me. You praise Jesus and Mohamed instead, you fools.

I started to apply for jobs abroad. That's what everybody is doing, looking for good cash opportunities. I don't know what I'll do with the money, maybe keep fucking my brain, or not. Flip the coin. Does it matter?

I'm sad, angry. With myself. Self-destructive, friends and family says. So what? That's me, fuck off, my life is my life, no? Why do you care? Do you really care? I think not. 

La la la bla bla bla. Words words words. Should I call my ex? i've been bonding with that girl for 4 years. Yet it's been 5 years since we split. Was she the one? Am I going to find love again? Was it love, what I felt then? How can one tell? Oh fuck off. Fuck life and humans. We're just fucking animals, there's no love.

I'm considering to take my BB gun and go rob a super market or something. For the money and the adrenaline. If I fail, they'll put me under a roof and feed me- at least there I'd be away from drugs and women. There I'd be forced to be a monk of some sort. Would that really be bad? I mean, survival is above all, no? What if jail is the right place for a loco like me. Can you tell what's good and what's bad? Everything's subjective, yo. 

Meh, go fuck yourself, reader. You don't care about me, I don't care about you. Yet here we both are. Interacting, in a weird way. Information is being transferred. Is there a point to all this? Is there, really?? Argh.

I did ask for help. I asked it from my friends, and from my mother. Yet, mother says, I don't want to help myself. And maybe she is right. Maybe I'm one of those who will leave this place early. So, fucking, what. It happens. I want to believe my 'energy' or whatever will then be used for something of more value.

Hurrrrr durrrr, let's see how all that goes. There are 5 lines to my whiteboard. Each line represents a day that im sober from weed, heroin, gbl and what not. But xanax is fine. and horse painkiller is also fine, because fuck sobriety. I can't stand myself! Or most people. 

So yeah- my will to write and interact has been diminished. I'll go back to snorting horse shit. Because it's easy and there's instant gratification. It's a trap. I see the trap, yet I fall into it. So based on mathematical thinking, I should not be alive. It'll be solved soon anyway. I hope my fam and friends won't be too bothered with it and make the most out of my absence. Oh, so much drama.
