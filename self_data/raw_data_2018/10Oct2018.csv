0,"Started I got a job as an assistant in an office in my preferred industry. My job description was loose and it was a tiny office. I thought nothing of it until my boss told me be handling all the scheduling. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, all my life I've been terrible at managing my own schedule. Remembering dates, not mixing up times in my head, or putting down the wrong event at the wrong date. And you know what? I keep fucking up. I just got a text from my boss who showed up somewhere when the event was not taking place. I haven't been set up to fail. I just suck at this.  I should have said no to the new responsibilities but I just graduated school and I needed money to pay off my loans. Now, I'm prepared to get chewed out tomorrow, or at worst, fired. Idk I'm gonna dust off  my resume and try not to cry to hard. ",10Oct2018,1
1,"So just for context, I was born a full month and a half premature. My bowels and excretory system were not completely developed when I was birthed, and for my entire life I have always struggled with doing number two when I go to the loo. I have problems peeing as well, but that's much more manageable.

My mother, when I still lived with her, would always tell me stories of how I would go days without pooping as an infant and how it'd worry her, and I'd cry for hours on end because of the fact that I'd have to poop but I just *couldn't.* It hasn't gotten much better with age.

As a late teen, hospital visits were frequent, and I was trying all kinds of medications, diets, and supplements to help with my issues. If I ever had to poop during the school day, I'd have to call my mom and have her come get me. My junior and senior years were filled with days where I was absent because of the abdominal pain I was experiencing, and days where I'd go to school anyways and have to cry in-between classes to relieve some of the physical stress.

There was one especially dreadful point in my life where, after not pooping for a week and a half, I had to have the poop surgically removed from my body.

However, with time, I've come to grow used to specific things I can do to make the experience slightly easier. I can eat a certain way, add pure fiber to a glass of water, do stretches to relax my muscles, and of course: the holy grail of laxatives. I wouldn't be able to poop at all without them.

Even *with* laxatives, though, there will be times when I'm on the toilet for hours on end, in pain and crying, and if I'm not crying during, I'm crying after— simply because I'm so relieved to get it out of my system. My boyfriend will actually sit there with me, hold my hand, and soothe me, but I haven't always had that intimate support.

My bowel issues impact me a lot in my day-to-day life. The pain is manageable at this age, sometimes it's better and sometimes it's worse. I'll be out with friends when I suddenly have to drop everything and go home. I'll be on a date with my boyfriend when all of a sudden we have to pay for our food (when we've only just gotten it) and rush back to our house.

Work? Absolutely dreadful.

&amp;#x200B;

And don't get me started on sex.

&amp;#x200B;

Point is: taking a poop is actual hell for me, and it always has been. I am used to it. It is my life. I do what I can to manage and get by with it.

Today was strange, though. See, I pooped around four days ago, and I've been feeling light since then. Usually, whenever I have to poop, I feel it days beforehand, but in these last few days I haven't felt anything. Absolutely nada. No baseline of pain. I'm not a heavy eater, I can't afford to be (in both senses of the phrase), but I still tend to *have* to poop just as often as anyone else. I just can't.

I got home from work today around a few hours ago before writing this, took a shower, washed my face, then had some microwaved popcorn with my boyfriend while we browse through our Roku. I get the urge to pee, so I go to the restroom real quick thinking that was all I had to do. I pull my pants down, take a seat, and I pee as per usual, but right afterwards I feel myself pooping!

I'm initially gripped by dread and annoyance-- I hadn't been expecting to poop lately and I wasn't prepared nor in the mood to go through this whole fiasco.

But just as quickly as those feelings set in, they were replaced with shock and surprise. The movement had passed quicker than it started, and I sat there bewildered. I just pooped. Just like that. No real pain. No blood rushing to my head because of how hard I had to push. No grabbing onto my own thighs because I need extra support.

And then I started to cry. I grab the roll of toilet paper sitting on the edge of the tub, wipe as quick as possible, and albeit without washing my hands (I'm sorry! I've washed them now, I promise!) I rush out of the bathroom to tell my boyfriend about it. I'm still kind of emotional and surprised, because it seems like it wasn't a big deal at all, especially when typing it out, but I'm so happy. I don't know if this means my bodily systems are catching up, or if I've changed something in my dietary routine without being aware of it, but I really don't care. I'm not going to take this for granted. I haven't been so jubilant in such a long time. I felt this was too noteworthy for me to share with only my boyfriend, but there's very few people in my life I can talk about this with comfortably, so here you go!

I'm actually so happy, goodness gracious.",10Oct2018,1

4,"Last night my bf and I broke up on the phone. I knew it was coming for a while but kept hanging on and we finally ended it. He needed to work on himself and didn’t feel ready to be in a relationship although we’ve been together over a year. Marriage and kids were a big thing to him as I want them and he doesn’t. 

Anyway, I’m terribly heartbroken. I want to cry every single minute and don’t want to be left alone. I don’t have many friends and my support system right now is my mom and cousin. Last night I couldn’t stay asleep, I kept waking up with anxiety. 

I just want to feel normal. I obviously miss him a lot and still love him but I won’t be contacting him, except to pick up my stuff from his house. I’m ok with feeling a little pain but I don’t want to be devastated anymore. I know it’ll take a while to get over it but how? ",10Oct2018,1
5,"Last night I was up really late, chatting with a friend. The conversation was so interesting that, without me realizing it, time passed and it was suddenly 2:30am. 

I wasn't tired in any way, so it took me a bit to fall asleep again. By then it must've been like 3 am. Thing is, I have to get up at 5:00 am to go to University. Usually this would be a huge problem, messing with my sleep schedule like that usually has horrible consequences on my mood. Yet for some reason I haven't felt tired during the entire day. I've been functioning as if I got 8+ hours of sleep.

I think this is it. I have transcended the barrier and become one of the Sleepless Elite.

12,"I haven't responded to his messages in weeks. He is now begging me to respond just so he ""knows I'm OK"" and that he's ""called police stations and hospitals"" but he can clearly see I'm active on Instagram and knows where I work so it's not like I'm completely unreachable. I just told him I'm done with him once and for all, and he isn't taking it seriously. 

We were friends for over 3 years. We got really close but in the last year he's been an increasingly crappy friend. My last straw was admitting I had a crush on a mutual friend and him ""forbidding"" me from pursuing it. I more or less told him to get bent, as he had no good reason for it besides having had benign arguments with that friend in the past. I stopped hanging out with him but was syill responding to his messages intermittently. I start dating the mutual friend right after. He puts 2 and 2 together a few months later and loses his shit on the friend, all but threatening him directly. Now the friend is scared and says we can still talk but he won't see me romantically anymore. We work in the same industry so he's ok with work time meet ups and hanging w mutual friends but that's it.

Now I was only seeing the guy for a few months but it was awesome. I don't put myself out there. I don't mess with dating apps or sites or singles focused things. I really only date people I know because I like to let a friendship build over time without romantic implication in the beginning. This was the first guy I was remotely interested in since my divorce 4 years ago, and it was going extremely well. Now he's scared for his safety and says if I'm still single maybe we can try again once the friend I cut off moves (he's supposedly moving out of town but I won't hold my breath).

Needless to say I'm both disturbed and pissed. I told him he's absolutely out of line, is a shit friend and a shit person, and to delete my number. It's been 3 weeks and he's still texting me daily, acting increasingly ""worried"". I'm on the fence about telling him one more time to stop contacting me or just letting it be.

I know you worry about being pan sexual and that a girl wouldn't date you because of it. I know you are one of the sweetest people I've ever known and I am so glad that you chose me to be your boyfriend. But. I feel a little weird about you hanging out with your friend who you dated and it didn't work out. The other night at that get together you sat next to her, secluded from me and I sat next to your friend who has always made me feel a little uncomfortable because it felt sometimes like she was being flirty with me. 

I am well aware that this is me being insecure because I don't think for a second that you'd ever cheat on me, nor do I think you have the time because we literally talk in some way immediately after you're  off work, every single day. So why do I feel this way? I should be glad that you told me that you two used to date, I'm not thrilled that she said some shit to that made you uncomfortable and feel self-conscious but she's just a friend now. I also know that you could tell I was uncomfortable and thats why you kept trying to touch me, and I appreciate that. I just get uncomfortable thinking about the two of you hanging out alone because I'm insecure about it. 

I will never tell you about this because I don't want talk about it, there's nothing really to say. because I won't ask you not to hang out with her because I wouldn't do that, and I trust you. It's just that sometimes I feel a little concerned is all. I do love you, and you are the perfect girl for me, but that does make me feel insecure and I either need to relinquish those feelings or talk to you about it.

Women are a bit more split in their opinions of the situation, but overall, more likely to listen. I've heard everything from ""that means she love you"" to ""that's hers to claim"" though I've also heard several supportive comments as well.

28,"This has been the most surreal day of my life. It still has definitely not hit me. I just need somewhere to put this down.

A little backstory: my dad was hospitalized with several heart attack symptoms last June, and ended up staying there for a month to recover and get back to better heart health. This was definitely due to the last few years of unhealthy dieting and some alcoholism as well. (Disclaimer: he was not at all the ‘alcoholic’ type of father that most people picture. He was a great loving dad that never harmed me, just liked to drink cocktails nightly later on in his life.)

Anyway, my dad was in a much better place more recently. He was very excited about how he was finally transferring to another department at his job and getting a little more pay along with enjoying the work much more. He was happier with life in general, as the last few months he no longer felt bouts of nausea from heart complications and the amount of daily medication required daily. He was feeling happy.

Then, I get a call from my mom (divorced 10 years ago) that they were supposed to meet somewhere about selling our old house, which we all lived in as a family at one point. He’s always very prompt and responsive through text, and she hadn’t heard from him all day. They had a great post-marital relationship. She tells me to try calling him and to maybe stop over at his apartment. I had just gotten off of work and had moved out of my parents’ places a month ago.

I speed over with some worry, but mostly just a belief that he had fallen asleep with his phone in another room. I unlock the door, run through, and find him in the bedroom with feet on the floor and his back on the bed. He had few clothes on and had a fan pointed up at him. He wasn’t responsive or moving at all when I tried shaking him awake or shouting Dad. I call my mom, then call 911. I moved him to the floor, administered CPR per the caller’s instructions, and they came within minutes.

After the first responder on the medical team examined him, she told me there were definite signs of rigor mortis and that he had been gone for some time. At that moment it felt like I had fallen through the floor and the alternate universe had kicked in.

I am very new to this whole death thing, as the only one I have really experienced is that of a family dog. I would just so appreciate someone reaching out with a story or sentiment of how they’ve had to cope with the same thing, or any kind of support from kind strangers in the internet.

I blocked out all memory because it was easier for me to not have to see what they did to me

As if when I smile to my friends I signal ""everythings alright""
""Cant you see I'm just like you guys""
When I pretend that my life is normal because it's easier to ignore what you can't remember.

When I'm unhappy 
It tells me everyone hates me

When it tells me to stay quiet 
When it tells me to stay in my room

I am a  gluttonous and anxious eater. If I'm not stuffing my face I try and see how long I can go before I eat another large meal. I feel weak if I can't make it the day without food.

 Obviously, this is unhealthy. I wouldn't say I'm anorexic because I've never heard of a 200 lb anorexic but I certainly feel the most satisfied when I'm challenging myself not to eat. 

The biggest problem, for me, is knowing that the solution is simple and easy. I'm just too much of a lazy fuck to actually do anything about it. I struggle with the thought of diet and exercise. 

I am not obese, I'm a 5'10 22 year old girl so the 200 lbs gets distributed. But I'm not skinny. It's the kind of thing where people call you ""curvy"" or ""thick"" even though the word makes me feel like a piece of meat I'm assured by many men that it's a good thing.

I'm 22 now, and I'm looking back at how my life was from when I was 14-18 and what it incredible struggle it was. I went to a fundamentalist, abstinence-only sex ed, 6-day creation Evangelical Christian school and my family was (still is) very religious. I didn't know what was right and wrong, I gave up on religion but I couldn't tell anyone. I hated everyone and everything, but that was only because I ultimately hated myself.

Getting out of there and going to college was a huge break. I was so horribly anxious and confused every day growing up that my first year away from home was like heaven on earth. It felt like I could finally be myself, and I got to discover what that meant. I've been able to be myself every day for four years, and I'm sitting alone in my own apartment just taking it all in for the very first time. There was a time when I wanted to kill myself, every day. I was scared, alone, and I didn't know how to be vulnerable to anyone. That's so faraway now. It's like those experiences weren't even mine, it's just some memory that's been implanted in my brain. 

Sometimes I'm scared whenever my life is going ""good"".

47,"With today being world mental health day (Oct 10th), I'm reminded by how much of a colossal struggle just finding the right path towards a healthy mind can be.

School can be an absolutely brutal place. Witnessing the naive and often unjust ways alpha girls and boys would exercise their power on the more vulnerable kids in the playground was a constant reminder that school was first and foremost a place you had to survive in order to then learn.

As the only black kid throughout junior school, and one of perhaps three in secondary, it was important for me not to become fixated upon how I differed from other kids, and instead, look for the things we had in common and could enjoy together. I figured that having friends in various different playground cliques meant there should be less chance of me being seen as an outsider who couldn't fit in, and so kids should have less of a reason to find beef with me. 

The more I was accepted into peer groups, the more it confirmed that I was similar to them after all, which led to a sense of belonging and safety, a feeling that seemed important to have in order to get the most out of being in a learning environment. Acceptance from fellow pupils became a source of validation and self-esteem, which in turn led to having more confidence and a general contentedness.

As I grew older and my sense of who I was became more defined, problems started arising. Particular groups I wanted be a part of, and thought had things in common with, wouldn't allow me to join and often gave no reason why. The decision to yay or nay my requests resting in the hands of the more domineering kids in the group for whom passing judgement in this way was fun, but for those unfairly condemned it could be a soul crushing experience.

There was an obvious flaw in the soundness of my high school survival strategy. Was it wise for my sense of well-being and self-worth to be at the mercy and whims of the other kids? My mental health felt like a commodity on the stock market whose value rose and fell with each acceptance or rejection, reinforcing a hunch the world was just this indifferent and cold arena that rewarded the strong and dominant with the most freedoms. 

Why should membership to desirable peer groups have such a powerful impact on my mental health?

I remember being 18, standing awkwardly in the garden of my friend's parents one bonfire evening. One of 10 blokes who, without any prior conferring, had assembled into a perfect man circle on the lawn; the work colleagues of my friend's dad, plus myself. I was shooting the breeze with real men of the world. We were getting to know each other through the mutual exchange of our vast life experience as we flaunted our chequed shirts, held cans of Fosters to our chests like they were trophies, occasionally glancing behind to scoff at the poor excuse for a ire while we shooed away any giddy child that asked us to play with them.

By donning the correct costume, performing the appropriate gestures I'd seen other blokes perform, as well as regurgitating stock answers to most of the common ice-breaking questions a bloke will ask another fellow bloke he doesn't yet know, I could tell I was on the verge of entering blokedom proper, and was a hair's breadth away from assuming my position as a functioning member of the privileged patriarchy.

After about half an hour or so of trying to assimilate with these learned elders, I noticed there was one main bloke who did the majority of the speaking, and was the default focal point if you didn't know what to do with yourself; like stand properly, or hold your can of beer with a convincing level of manliness. Despite his irritating braggadocio, he was a welcome diversion that deflected group attention away from my poor quality man acting. Occasionally he would look over to another bloke, who I concluded was his deputy, for those moments when he needed his more audacious claims backing up.

An hour had past, the Fosters was flowing and I'd gained the ability to hear things beyond the cacophony of anxieties in my head. I felt at ease. I could focus on the actual content of what us guys were sharing with each other, and could think about how I'd be able to shoehorn myself into the conversation. So I listened eagerly for an opening in order that I could make my mark. 

What I heard was a series of banal accomplishments, mainly home improvement based, presented to the group as though they were scientific breakthroughs. Disdain was being flung at nearly everyone and everything, designed it seemed, to exemplify their own strengths. Their incompetent work colleagues, their illogical and irrational wives they couldn't understand and regretted marrying, their children who were unaware of what good music was, the idiotic tactics the manager of the football team they supported would use. The weather. Modern life. Vegetarians. It just went on and on... The best I could manage was a couple double-entendres and an innuendo that brought a ripple of chuckles, but it felt completely contrived. I was being a fraud, ticking boxes to gain status. I did consider the possibility that everything they were saying was valid, but for some reason I didn't feel like I was in the presence of 9 Nobel laureates.

At a certain point during the exchange I felt a bit off. Waves of disenchantment about what the hell I was doing and what being a man actually involved began swilling around inside. Then one of the guys began to regale us all with the time he heroically got out of his car to give a lollipop man a piece of his mind for walking into the road too abruptly...

Sam - Former friend

Paul - The guy that's dating my friend.

Alice - My friend  


So, my former friend had recently gotten out of a relationship and she was kinda crushed by it. Relationships for her never seems to really work out. She is what some might call a ""slut"" cus she has a tendency to sleep around a lot.

Now after her break up she went back on the road and had some one night stands every here and there.

There was one day she showed up unannounced at my SO and I's place. She came in, threw herself on the sofa and started talking. Sam told us that she'd slept with Paul. My SO and I asked her if she knew if Paul was still together with Alice, cus as far as we knew they were pretty much still together. She said she knew and I got kinda irritated that she actually knew and still slept with him. Her excuse was that he was really good in bed. She said it all in a way that made my SO and I feel like she was actually bragging about it. 

I expressed my feelings and said that it wasn't right, I didn't like it and that Sam should tell Paul to tell Alice what had happened. Sam just shook it off like it was nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Now a year later, it doesn't seem like this has ever been talked about. I'm not that close with Alice and we never really hang out, but I do run into her every now and then and it's killing me that I know something about her boyfriend that she doesn't seem to know of. I mean shortly after the incident they seemed pretty ok on the instagram photos and like in the public eye. Paul even lives with Alice. Alice even told me just now today that they are thinking about finding a place of their own cus living with her father gives them less privacy. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm not one of her closest and we rarely talk, but she deserves to know and she deserves better than that. She's a really good person that has been through a lot. 

I don't feel like it's my place to tell her though, so that's what makes this so complicated. I don't really know Paul, so I can't really tell him to tell her either.. I mean I don't have him on any social media or anything. I just feel so bad.

I mean I am friends with her best friend too, but it feels weird coming over and being like ""Hey, does Alice know that Paul cheated on her with Sam?"". I don't feel like it's the right thing to do.

And since I've kept it from her so long, I feel so bad. It feels like I'm lying straight to her face.

49,"I recently (going on 5 weeks ago) moved out of my parents place to live with my boyfriend. The thing is, I love living with him and having our own space/control/independence, but I think I hate the area we’ve moved to.

I used to live in a beach suburb, where I could walk 7 minutes and have my toes in the ocean. I could see the stars from my balcony and hear nothing but birds and the waves. I had tree lined streets and a duck pond in my little suburb, and salt mist in the mornings and evenings. My home was sunny and open. I could walk out my front door and head in any direction and spend hours walking along the ocean, or parks, or quiet suburban streets. 

Now we live in a beautiful modern apartment and I should love it. My work commute has dropped from 2 hours to 20 minutes. But our bedroom is dim, the view is onto a highway. Everything outside is concrete and brick and traffic. With my short commute, I now come home and sit in the apartment for a couple of hours until my boyfriend gets home, because I don’t feel like I have anywhere to go that isn’t a concrete noise factory. 

We moved here because it’s where my boyfriend lived when we met and I thought I loved it (for the bustle and cafes and bars). Now I think I loved it because it was associated with him. 

Anyway, just looking for advice or even reassurance that this will eventually feel like home. 

TL;DR: moved from beach to city five weeks ago. Feel like I’m stuck in a concrete box and I’m not handling it well. Advice? ",10Oct2018,1
50,"My mom and I (33M) left my dad when I was two. He reached out constantly when I was a kid. Would drive 5 states to bring presents to me, only to leave them on the front step or with another family member. I only know what my mom tells me. He was a drunk, drug addicted asshole who beat her.  

He  got a hold of my cell number from my mom when I was  25 because my mom said he sounded like he had changed and thought it would be a good idea for him to contact me... I Never answered, but he'd leave drunk messages bashing my mom, saying that she screwed him over, but he has property for me. He's called about 12 times in the last 8 years, always in bunches of 2 or 3 calls. I Never answered, but he always left drunken messages. The first one was always nice, saying he missed me or that he had things for me like boats or property. Then the next message(s) immediately escalated to bashing my mom or other family members. Claiming my moms dinking and drug habits were much worse than his ever were and that she's screwed him over. 

My mom is no Saint. I know she did what she did when she had to for me to have a good childhood... I was introduced to several men that I had walked in on having sex with my mom at least twice before I was 6, witnessed lots of drunken nights, and I know on several occasions she's read me bedtime stories while smoking weed that she laughs about today. So my dad's claims don't sound too far off. 

My cousin from my dad's side found me on fb and he's a really cool guy. We've sent presents to each other for each other's kids. We text, but have never spokeon the phone.. I just feel weird for some reason. I don't know if he's telling my dad anything, but he tells me that my dad is poor and lives in a trailer park.

I don't know if I should leave it, or reach out to find out his side of the story. I have a great strep father, who I was raised by since I was 10. I have a great life, wife, and kids.. Is it worth it? Anyone with similar story? It just all feels weird to me...

TL;DR
I (33M) haven't seen my dad since I was 2. He has substance abuse and alcohol addiction and he still tries to reach out every couple years, but I never answer. I have a great life right now, been sober for over 2 years myself. Should I answer his next call or just let it go?",10Oct2018,1

54,"Alright. I’m bracing myself for what I expect to be some unsavory responses from those who choose to read... 

Recently, I (24F) have been getting increasingly annoyed by my bf’s (40M) preference for video games over me. I think this stems from him getting upset about me doing anything that excludes him, yet he plays these games for 4-5 hours every single day (minimum) while I’m in the other room watching TV by myself. I also have to say, for context, I love games and understand getting consumed in them—I have even competed in gaming tournaments. However, it’s really annoying to me that he’s away on business trips for a few days of every week (brings his game with him), then just comes home to game more. The only thing we do together is go to the gym first thing in the morning, which, contrary to his opinion, is NOT spending time together by any means. We have headphones on and two totally different workouts. As soon as we get home, it’s games until night time. His argument for that is that he’s in the same house so technically we’re together. Then at night he just wants to bang and go to bed, which is also an issue for me because I don’t feel inclined to be intimate with someone who just spent all day talking to his friends in the dark on a mic in the other room while I waited bored for hours for him to be done. Spoiler alert, he only comes out when he’s ready for bed. *I don’t want him to not play*— I just want him to cool it a bit. 

Last night, I told him this and he essentially just said “You’re grossly exaggerating, we do more together than any couple I know, and fine then I guess I just won’t play anymore”. He made me feel like such a bitch, and acted the way I’d expect a 16y/o to act under the same circumstances. I’m really hurt by the fact that the only time he wants to hang out with me is when his friends aren’t texting him to come game, but I don’t want to give limits on playing because I’ll know he’s only begrudgingly hanging out with me when he’d rather be playing. I’m really disappointed in his reaction and I don’t know how to proceed from here or feel about the situation. ",10Oct2018,1

I never had a problem with 'becoming an adult' in itself, I do adult things just fine. I am independent and live alone. I don't particularly miss being a child, I just wish I could stay in the range of 16 to 24 forever. I'm someone who needs a decent, constant level of excitement, new things happening, new discoveries. Milestones, doing things for the first time, making memories with new people. As a student and in my first job I was around so many people my own age and life seemed exciting and worth living, just to see what would happen next. But now it seems like every day is the same and it's just meaningless work, work, work until I die. I don't even mind working, I just wish something interesting would happen now and then. Almost everyone I know is in a relationship and doesn't spend much time with their friends anymore. People are starting to get married, buy houses and even have children which is something I have exactly 0 interest in. I don't want any responsibilities or do anything mature. I want to wake up at 9am, go to university (or the first job I had which was really fun), hang out and have fun with other people around my age, get drinks and stay up until 7 am and have cold leftover pizza for breakfast.

I've been feeling really bored for the last 2 years or so and it's just getting worse. I try to combat it by trying new hobbies, traveling and partying whenever I can get someone to go with me. But it's not the same somehow. It's like something has sucked the fun out of life and now it's just so grey and empty.

I sometimes think about calling him and confronting him to relieve my anger about it as at the time I did not know it was abuse and thought he was my friend. I since then have had a lot of time to obviously grow up and think about my experiences and realize that he was never my “friend” and that he was sexually abusing me. At that time he was no longer teaching but I still recall conversations we have had in which he confided in me that had he known me better when I was in middle school he wouldn’t started talking to me much sooner (13 years old.) I also remember him telling me that he was attracted to more students that just me while he was teaching and had been tempted to act but never did.

65,"I feel like I should preface this post by saying I have absolutely no problem with guys being held accountable for their shitty behaviour, guys who knowingly creep on girls make the world a far worse place and it fucking boils my blood seeing some dudes make my friends feel like shit while we’re out just cause they can’t control themselves and don’t have any respect for them at all. There’s been times guys have been harassing my friends for ages even after they’ve made it clear they’re not interested, and only stop if I step in and pretend to be their boyfriend or tell them to fuck off or something, which makes me even more angry because it’s clear they (for some reason) instantly have respect for me but not for them. I’ve seen it happen many times, and while I have no idea how shitty that must feel, I can sympathise completely and I try my best not to make anyone feel like that.

That being said, I have a major problem with being overly worried about creeping girls out, to the point it completely fucks up my dating life. I’m 20, so I thought I’d grow out of this, but clearly I’ve not. I constantly worry about how a girl might react to every little thing I do, and whether it’s gonna make them feel weird. I realise it’s stupid; girls are just humans and if I’m not being a complete creeper then there’s a good chance things will be fine. But still, I’ve heard enough stories from friends and seen enough shit online to know that girls have to be on their guard pretty much all time time, and I constantly think about how anything I say would be perceived. I’m the type of guy who, if I happen to be walking the same way behind a girl I don’t know for a pretty long time and it’s just us two, I’ll change my route just to make sure they don’t feel threatened. Sounds stupid, but I just hate feeling like somebody would see me as a threat, and I’d hate making anyone feel uncomfortable or whatever.

It really fucks me up. I have friends who will go out at the weekend and just strike up a conversation with some random girl at a club, and probably end up going home with them. I could never do that. I’d be terrified of them telling me to fuck off if I went up and said hi, I wouldn’t have a clue what to say cause I’d be trying my best not to seem weird, which inevitably would just make me seem weird. Even when I’m drunk I just can’t work past that, no matter how brave I’m feeling. The two times I’ve made out with a girl we’ve both been wildly drunk to the point I’ve just said ‘fuck it’, and both times they actually had to explicitly tell me to make out with them cause all I could worry about is how awkward it would be if they pulled away. It’s like a kinda paradox; most girls I know want a guy to make the first move, but make the move too quick or misread the situation and you’re gonna risk coming across as a creep. You kinda have to be willing to risk that rejection, and I just can’t without feeling shitty. There’s been times I know almost 100% that a girl is flirting with me, but I never make a move because I’m so stuck in my own head and thinking over every last detail, and thinking it’s probably just in my head and I’m reading too much into them being friendly.

Like for a recent example, there’s a girl in my college class who I’ve got a group project with who I have a little thing for. I know she at least thinks I’m a decent guy; she volunteered to be in my group when it was looking like it would just be us two, and even when we’re in our group we both kinda talk the most and always seem to find an excuse to talk for a bit just us two after the work’s done. It’s clear we could probably at least become friends, but I still worry about her thinking I’m weird, and it’s probably worse since I like her a little. Today we were walking to class together after our work was done and I was worried in my head in case she thought I was being weird for waiting on her to walk with. Like we get along pretty well, there’s absolutely no reason for me to worry about that, but it’s the kind of thing I sit and think about constantly. The prospect of asking her on a date is just insane to me, cause I would never want her to feel awkward having to work with me afterwards if she said no.

Honestly I just wish we lived in a world where there’s wasn’t complete fucking assholes who feel the need to behave like freaks and make women have their guard up all the time. But we don’t live in that world, so I constantly worry about not wanting to be one of those guys. Anyway, to cut a long post short, how the hell can I kind of snap out of this and stop worrying about this so much, while also not crossing any boundary and coming on too strong? I want to get dating, but I just don’t know how to show I’m interested in anyone without worrying about whether they’re gonna take it the wrong way.

66,"I'm in my late 20s now and I'm just figuring out that the way my parents raised me had a horrible effect on my self-esteem/confidence. Growing up, my parents were never satisfied with me/my performance unless I excelled in school and did really well in sports. 

These are the two most vivid memories I have from my parents and how it's affected me today...

1) I was studying hard for a HS exam. It was getting late in the night so I took a study break and played a computer game. My Dad walks by the room and sees me playing games and yells at me for playing games and said ""no wonder you're doing poor (\*to my parents, anything below an A was poor) in school, you don't work hard enough"". I got yelled at all the time, shamed for not doing well in school, and compared to others who were ""doing well"". My successes never got celebrated. My ""failures"" were always nitpicked and magnified. Eventually I started sticking up for myself (and talking back) and I've found that I get very defensive even with strangers if I feel like they're ""attacking"" me in some way. So now, I feel like no matter what I do, it'll never be good enough so I find myself always busting my ass and never being happy with my accomplishments.

2) During a tennis match in HS, I was having a pretty off day. Nothing I hit was going in and I already felt like shit about it (\*I've learned to beat myself up pretty hard over my shortcomings). I walk over to my Mom after the match to hopefully get some support and to feel a little better, because she's my Mom. But as I walked towards her, she walked away and went to the car leaving me behind, didn't say anything. All I could remember seeing was her scowling face and angry eyes. I've never felt supported by my parents when I needed it the most. I've always felt not worthy enough of anything. Now, I continue to have low self-esteem and confidence in my abilities and I know it's affecting my life in more ways than I want it to!

How do I move on from the shit my parents put me through?! Wtf do I still seem to want their approval after all these years?! I just want to move on with my life. I don't even talk to them anymore today...

&amp;#x200B;

69,"I’m currently a college junior in the honors program of my university with a good scholarship that’s basically paying for everything. However, I don’t really want/need the degree I’m getting (BA in Health Promotion), and the high standards I have to meet every semester in order to stay in the honors program and keep my scholarship are very demanding and incredibly stressful. I’m not the best student, and I know I don’t deserve what I have like most other people do. I’m looking into doing Phlebotomy, and the community college nearby offers a free all-expenses-paid phlebotomy program. I’m trying to get a part-time job to start supporting myself, though I’m still living at home. I can see myself doing phlebotomy for quite a long time, and I wouldn’t have a problem with going back to school in the future, but I don’t feel that school is right for me right now. The problem is, is that my mother would NOT support this decision at all—her view is that a college degree gets you everywhere in life, and I can see that that’s true to some extent, but I’m also of the view that college isn’t NECESSARY if what you’re wanting to do does not require it. It might set you above, but I’m not looking for any fancy high-paying jobs. I’m very minimal, so the job I want would be a fine amount of money for myself. Would it be reasonable for me to at least take a break from school? I might consider just dropping the honors program and the scholarship, but that’s still putting money down the drain on the loans, however few, that I would require to finish my degree.

78,"Hello all! I’m new here and looking for advice on what my husband and I can do about our 5 yr old daughters bully. 
Less than three weeks ago, a child punched my daughter in the chest while standing in line. The teacher apologized and told me that she would switch up the line so they didn’t have to be near each other and whatever she needed to make my daughter safe. 
I got a disturbing call on Monday that my daughter had been in a scissor accident. Turns out it was no accident. The teacher allowed the students to pick their own seats. The bully sat at the same table as my daughter. There was one child between them. The child kept pretend jabbing the scissors at my daughter and then actually took out a chunk. The nurse advised that I have her seen by a doctor. I work for a hospital and our pediatrician was out so that meant a trip to the ER. She should have had stitches as it was deep enough for them but she was upset about that so we elected to have it glued shut. 
My husband and I had a talk with the principal. We don’t feel like we really got anywhere with her. We don’t feel any better about what happened. The school says they were doing fine for a while so they tried it. The child had to go around the one in the middle to get to mine. That is not an accident. That was intentional. 
We are not allowed to know the other child’s punishment nor the parents. The principal admitted that the child had been in trouble with other children as well. It wasn’t just with mine. So, if you know the child is capable of mean acts why not do something about it before it gets out of hand? 
The school says they are not financially responsible for the medical bills and not allowed to put us in touch with the other parents to have them pay, so where does that leave us. All we were told was that the child has been moved to another class. Now what good does that do? Why would you switch classes? To have her find another victim? 
So where does that leave us? How do we get justice for our girl that received an undeserving laceration to her left hand? ",10Oct2018,1
79,"Edit: this is a repost due to r/relationship_advice does not allow non-question related post being posted. Hopefully what I wrote can help someone!

Hey everyone, today marks the 5th day of a breakup from a casual relationship. I can finally say I feel good, and the whole day has been great! As someone who tends to get attached, I'm pleasantly surprised on how quickly I've healed for the first time in my life. Here are some advice and process that I've taken in, hopefully it will help you as well!

1. **Process the pain** \- On the contrary, most people would advise you to actively do fun things and be with friends. However, this is a form of distraction, and you will inevitably feel the pain again when you are alone. When there is negative energy within our body and we actively suppress it, we aren't doing ourselves any favor. It actually feels great to speak out or even cry when we are alone, and say I have a problem and I feel hurt.
2. **Do pleasurable things -** I know I just said avoid distractions because the importance of processing pain. At the same time, we should also try to keep our lives with minimal stress and problems. A good way to do that is to put stressful things on hold, and be around good support group such as friends and family. The key is to balance and give ourselves the personal time and space to process pain.
3. **Socialize** \- Rather than just socialize with our friends and family. We should give our best effort to talk to new people, be it at work, new hobby or at school etc. We have to teach ourselves that the person we are moving away from isn't the only person in the world. When you recognize that there are plenty of amazing people out there, you will believe it. This will help steering you away from negative thoughts such as: my ex and I are so compatible and I'll never find someone just as amazing.
4. **New Goals or improve on existing goals -** Think of the life you had when you were single. You had to squeeze some out to make room for your new romantic interests. Well you are alone again, and there is nothing more valuable than to use this new found time to work on yourself. Personally, the reason that caused the fallout in my relationship was me being needy. I told myself that I'm sick of losing romantic interests because of it. So far I've bought self help books, and am planning on seeing CoDA (codependents anonymous support group). I'm making a personal goal fix my problems, and I will be socializing with new people within a support group. This new hope makes me feel amazing.
5. **Self love and** **Be positive mentally -** After processing pain during alone time, it is also important to focus on a positive mentality; because that is the only way you will move towards healing. I personally have a sticky note widget on my phone, and when my emotion goes out of control, I will pull it up and read it. On the note, I write positive things about myself, and reasons I shouldn't chase after her. I also cut out all the sad songs on my playlist and listens to a lot more upbeat, energetic workout music. Lastly, what helped me the most was listening to YouTube/Podcast dating coach on moving on, constantly... This is my method for meditation, because when I listen to positivity over and over again, I can't help but to believe in it.

Hopefully this helps, and remember it takes two people to make a relationship work. If they want to walk, let them. No amount of begging/pleading will fix anything, because you have to let them choose you in order to show that their love for you is genuine.",10Oct2018,1
81,"Yesterday, I went to a gas station to get some ibuprofen for a raging headache I was trying to shake. Before I even entered the store I saw a group of 5 guys inside and immediately felt that overwhelming sense of “fuck, why today. “  

So I go in minding my own business and look at all the different pain relievers. At this point I could hear chatter and people talking, but I was so deeply investigating the 2 pills for 2 dollar packets I was zoned out. 

Out of seemingly no where I get hit hard in the leg with something. I look down at a bottle of Pepsi laying at my feet, then up at this exiting group of guys. In that same moment I hear, 
“ you ain’t got to ignore me, rude bitch.” Everyone else in the gas station is just looking at me as I stand there throughly confused. I never even saw these guys faces. I was in the store for literally 2 minutes tops and within that time I had a bottle thrown at me. 

I couldn’t help but think of the women who get assaulted or have even been murdered for turning a man down. I legitimately didn’t even hear the guy talking to me and now I have a bruise on my leg to remind me of how this could have escalated. It’s trivial, but has been actively boiling my blood since it happened.

82,"In my novel, Mrs. Harris - a dignified, decorated, always well-dressed married 39 year old professor, goes out for a silly, old-school drunken night out with the girls.

They even play beer pong.

Mrs. Harris, not drunk but a tad buzzed, gets shut out, 12-0.

The table of women giggles. Her old rival, Rachel Collins, who defeated her, says:

""Well, you know the house rules, Mrs. Harris.""

""What house rules?""

""If you get shut out in beer pong, you have to run all the way around the block...hehehe...NAKED.""

Can you please answer these questions?

How old are you and are you male or female?

How do you imagine Mrs. Harris reacting to the word ""naked""? What does she look like outwardly? What does she say?

Does she self-consciously cover her breasts over her shirt with her hands? How do her friends react? What does she think inside?

How do you imagine her stripping down and running? How fast? What items in what order?

How do you imagine her run going? What funny things can you imagine happening as she runs around the entire block?

As she makes it back, her old rival Rachel SMACKS her bare, white, jiggling ass with her hand and says WHAT that makes Mrs. Harris blush and the friends all laugh louder than ever?

83,"Hey guys,

Tldr at the end.

13 months ago I met the most beautiful girl I‘ve ever seen. She is absolutely gorgeous, has a wonderful personality and is just plain perfect in my eyes. Fast forward 3 months and we are a couple. The time with her is great, we love each other without question and we have a chemistry made in heaven. These facts still apply today. But there is one thing, that drives me crazy: my self-hate.


6 months ago I had a car accident and I was injured heavily. Couldn’t walk for 3 months and I got my full mobility back just now. But in this time I put on some pounds onto my already bulky figure. 


My girlfriend still loves me and is proud of me, that I managed to walk again after the docs said I might need up to a year.
But with all that weight gain I feel...ugly next to her. 
Example: We went to a club a few days ago. Me, her and a few of our friends. She danced, she laughed, she had a blast. And while I was watching her dancing on the floor I felt...miserable. I saw her, gorgeous as she was moving her hips to the beat, while was standing at the bar afraid to show myself next to her or my nonexistent dance moves. 


So I started to hit the gym. 5 times a week. I started to eat healthy, prep my meals, counted my macronutrients and started to teach myself Cutting Shapes. But still, I hate myself for what I have let myself become. 


How do I stop this self hate? Some time will pass until I reach my desired weight and I don‘t want to hate myself up until that point.


Like I said, my girlfriend loves me dearly, but I know she is suffering as well from my self hate.


Tl;dr: I‘m a fat fuck, who hates himself for being fat. And until I reach my desired weight, I want to 
stop the self hate.
