0,"Saw the most beautiful guy on the train and I, roll my eyes when people say love at first sight but now I can see why because he was drop dead gorgeous imo. Wish I could talk to him but he was surrounded by family also he was speaking Korean and generally looked like a tourist, which really sucks because that means he's gonna leave some time later and I'll never have the chance to see him again

Trying to draw his face from memory because I am a decent artist but not good enough to get all the details right and plus his face is fading from my memory too!!!!! and I know I sound super creepy right now I guess but it's not like I'm gonna see him again so whatever.... plus I'm a guy and he's probably not gay.",20Oct2018,1
1,"Usually before major exams I get 6 or less hours of sleep. Today I got 4. I was super tired while studying (before the exam) and couldn't focus so I decided to try an energy drink. It took me 3 hours to finish it (my last sip right before the exam started) and I was so awake and energetic during my exam!! No problems focusing at all, and I feel very confident I got a good score. 

I can also have some me time now that I'm home instead of crashing immediately. 

So, thank you bang, although your peach mango tastes kinds bad and next time I'm getting the blueberry one.",20Oct2018,1
2,"I’m a really introverted guy and I have social anxiety (partially due to childhood experiences). I haven’t had any friends since early high school, I just stay home as much as I can. I basically just keep to myself and my only real interest is making art: music, poetry, stories, you name it. Otherwise I just watch tv shows. The rest is university and homework.

Anyway I’ve just grown more and more distant from people until the thought of actually getting intimate with someone is terrifying. Obviously I’m a virgin. I don’t talk to anyone, let alone girls. I feel like I would never get over the nervousness, like I would never actually be comfortable around other people.

And here’s the conflicting part: I actually kind of daydream about having a romantic partner all the time. I’m pretty good looking and fit, I could just use tinder and hook up no problem, (I think). But I don’t even consider it an option because it’s so far out of my daily comfort zone.

Also I realize I’m afraid to have sex even though I daydream about it all the time, and I’m even afraid I won’t like it. I go to therapy but I don’t want to bring this up. I don’t talk about sexual stuff with other people, not even my therapist. The only person I’d ever feel comfortable talking about this stuff, ironically, is a significant other, not even my own brother.

So basically does anyone else have these feelings? I don’t know, I just had to kind of get it out there.",20Oct2018,1
4,"I am not a TV person. I haven't watched a show in 6 years. But after living under a rock for a good while, I decided to give a shoot to the entertainment industry and see what they offer.


I watched and finish Rick and Morty and that was awesome. I really did like it. I've heard about Bojack Horseman in passing for a while now and how some people sympathize with this animated cartoon. So I gave it a shoot.


Although it being a depressing and cynical yet still displaying the humorous absurdism that is expected in animated shows -- this really made me feel understood. 


Life is in fact a series of ups and downs. Sometimes you will never find closure. But I always thought it was just me who suffered with finding a meaning or finding closure in something I can not control. No. I realize that it's everyone. And that makes me feel a little more sane.


Of course there are other things the show touches on like mental illnesses and the entertainment industry as a satire, but thats just one of the things I've got out of this phenomenal show. 

I definitely recommend you watch it if you haven't already. It's funny but damn is it heavy -- fair warning. ",20Oct2018,1
6,"All of my friends from that time know me as the gay retard they graduated with. I liked wiener at the time.

Like a year ago i stopped liking wiener. I don’t know why, but now i’m just retarded i guess. 

So now there’s a dispairity. I can never have friends over from high school and college at the same time, because one group knows me as gay, and the other knows me as straight.

And it’s not like i even lied to anyone. It’s just too hard for me to explain in person to anyone. 

But now there’s this girl i like who knows me as gay, so i’m all fucked up inside.

8,"Yes, most of these may be circumstantial or situational but take it with a grain of salt

1. If something is meant to happen (usually relationships, still chase yo dreams), it normally will just naturally happen. Yes you need to take chances, and yes work is needed, but at least with friendships and relationships, if they are truly into you they will gravitate towards you naturally

2. If someone truly loves you, they will put in work too because they want to help and see you happy, and you wont have to beg for it. Yes, you need to communicate your needs. Yes you need to talk it out. Yes, people love in different ways. But you dont need to tug the relationship. Its both ways dog

3. Partying and getting drunk/high (at least for me) probably fun because of who im with, not because im drinking or getting high. I want to party because of who im with, not usually just because I want to party (this isnt always the case but sometimes for sure)

4.  Sometimes people dramatize their life because they feel like they arent good or interesting enough on that alone, and want something to talk about. Some people dont communicate or talk things out because they want to see how it plays out

5. If youre as you as can be, you see who fucks with you and who doesnt so might as well be weird and unique than covered up (of course this is to an extent, as anything)

6. Sometimes, you just have to make a fucking mistake. Sometimes although you know you shouldnt, you just gotta do something fucked up to learn. Make it _sometimes_ though, not always

7. You can talk it out to your hearts end, but sometimes shit doesnt work out. Sometimes what you says doesnt click with them or make them feel differently. Hell thats probably most times. You did what you could, try something different or move on

8. Crying isn’t bad. Crying is ok. Just fucking cry. 

9. You may not know what you want and sometimes thats ok.

10. Therapy is a lifesaver, talk about your shit because sometimes, what you got is too much for the people around you to help with",20Oct2018,1

10,"I have been told I’m too nice a couple of times recently.

I don’t like confrontation but also I’m not a pushover. I stand up for myself when I need to. But when someone is being aggressive or unfair toward me I generally just try to remove myself from the situation (bad jobs, toxic relationships, etc.) without having a big dramatic moment of telling off the other person. I just create distance. 

My reasoning is that people will do what they will do and it’s not up to me to teach anybody lessons about how to live, and I don’t need the drama of having those intense conversations with people who I don’t really care about keeping around in my life. I’m more than willing to have serious, sometimes uncomfortable conversations with my close family and friends.

I just don’t feel the need to defend myself against people who don’t matter much to me. I’d rather just walk away. And I’m fine with it. Is that being too nice?

It's short, and one of those crazy vibrant colored hair, something I'm not sure I could pull off.  She, over the last few years has looked the best she's ever looked. It really made me feel bad about myself. I have gained so much weight and have not been taking care of myself the best. I don't have some great job. I don't have anything amazing! Things since high school have just been going. I understand that people always post only the best things... BUT she looks amazing! Even on my next day I do not look like how she looks! 
And she was my bestest estest friend ever, many years ago. We stopped talking because I felt like when she went off to college she was so into herself and forgot where she came from. I swore she slept with the love of my life but couldn't prove it. We just drifted, but she was like my sister! I'm not sure if I should get back in touch with her or not. I think about her often.

13,"This relationship started out really well, and with absolutely NO red flags. We had been friends for a while, and I was best friends with some of his friends. A lot of this might be annoying because I should have left way sooner than I did, I really did feel like I deserved all of this though. 

We realized we had feelings for each other in January, and from then until May everything was perfect. We were best friends, he cared about me, he was so sweet and loving. Before we stared dating he knew I had a few really close guy friends. He also knew I had never messed around with any of them ever. I even had strict boundaries in place after him and I started dating so nothing could ever happen. 

He started expressing to me he was uncomfortable with me hanging out with them alone. We talked, and I thought he understood where I was coming from, so I stared making sure if I hung out with guys it wasn’t alone. Then slowly that made him uncomfortable too. So i started making sure if guys were there, girls were there too. 

Then if I even was with a guy with girls around he would freak out. He demanded I delete guys from my Snapchat so I deleted a bunch of guys but kept the ones we were mutually friends with. This made him freak out. So he made me sit there in front of him and delete every single guy off of everything, block every single guy off snapchat, and block their numbers. 

Later he said he couldn’t trust that so he got all the passwords to my stuff, and made me turn on my Snapchat location. Everywhere I went I had to tell him who was all there, and send update videos every 10 minutes. It eventually got to where I just sat in my house all day because I didn’t want to fight, or remember to constantly update him while I was trying to spend time with my friends. 

Me sitting at home all the time resulted in me being called a lazy piece of shit who never did anything. I couldn’t go on walks alone without being accused of being sketchy. I couldn’t go to Walmart without it being weird. If I went to friends we had to sit at their house which nobody wants to do. 

I started getting fed up with it and arguing back, not caring if we broke up. That’s when he hit me and started telling me every problem in our relationship was my fault because I couldn’t be trusted. He was doing me a favor by still being with me because nobody else would put up with me. All of this stuff I started to believe. I felt like I was the one who kept making mistakes and that I was the one who had to fix it. 

Then it got to where if I was asleep and didn’t answer his text fast enough he would freak out. He made me download life 360 because he thought I was leaving my phone at home, lying, and saying I was sleeping. There were two times my snap location just randomly disappeared and he LOST it, accused me of turning it off, and lying about where I had been when I had been snap chatting him pictures of what I was doing the entire time. 

He pulled up outside of my house and started cussing me out and threatening me in my front yard. I was terrified. He said he wanted me to tell the truth but I was. No matter what I said or what proof I had to show I hadn’t turned it off he didn’t believe me. I slowly stared coming out of the fog and realized I need to leave. I’m going to turn my phone off, change all my passwords, leave my house and stay with a friend for a week, block him on everything, and hope that that works. If there is anything else I can do to make sure I’m safe let me know please! ",20Oct2018,1
14,"Me and my friend frequently go to Walmart at night and so we see the same cashiers sometimes. I like one of them in particular, and and today she seemed to be having a long day. 

(Kinda irrelevant to the title but worth saying anyway) I asked if she had any social media like Instagram and she said she didn't have anything like that, and I feel like she may have not wanted to hear that question while she was having a long day at work. I mean, hindsight 20/20 and all, but also when I made up my mind that I wanted to maybe keep in touch with her, I didn't see her for another month so I figured fuck it, now or never, right? 

Anyways... So I don't think she likes me and that's okay. But what's something I could have done to make her long day better? I'm not aiming to date her if she's not interested but I'd still like to liven up her day if I can ",20Oct2018,1
15,"Mark Twain once said it and I believed, so I took a career in Computer Sciences because I liked programing back in High School. I think that was one of the biggest mistakes in my life.

I am currently working half time in a small project financed by the University in which I studied. In a beginning it was a good deal, I worked, got the stuff done and go back to my house with a smile on my face. But suddenly the systems and the project got bigger, but I keep working same half time. So I try to end the stuff that I've to do in the same half time which is impossible. 

I lost count how many extra hours I've worked because there is some kind of emergency and stuff that needs to be done by the end of the week. I've also done some freelance work, but I always feel that is the same eternal cycle of I have to do task A, which gives me problem PA, look over solution, solve PA( If solution of PA exists), then go to task B. Always the same unrewarding tasks all over again. 

I was also thinking in working in a company, but for what I've hearing from my ex classmates it's not so different outside if you are a developer. I like to work with people. I don't like to be isolated the whole 8h in an office without talking to anyone. And I hate IT support, oh god how I hate to give support.

I am ashamed. I am not in control. I am in control. I am ineffective. I am a prisoner but the idea of accepting that i am a prisoner implies that i cannot do anything about it. Is there a gaol break that i can achieve? I don't know. My thoughts on the matter go round in circles. I wish for resolution but i don't think it's possible.

Like the philosphers of old are we destined to cognitive dissonance? What would life look like if we were always happy? Can you even call it life? Life is messy and complicated. We all have shit to deal with. Any attempt to pacify yourself from that shit is a lie. A lie to yourself. It makes you boring, immute, an object, pointless.

Weather you numb yourself with drugs or philosophy. They achieve the same purpose. Perhaps the philosopher only lives longer. So. We accept and suffer or we numb ourselves.

What kind of life does one who accepts leads? On the outside it appears more impressive. To be real. To be down to earth. But what kind of suffering do these people have? Do they even have any? Do they realise what they are doing? Confusing...

These thoughts...they are likely transient. If someone from a certain disposition were to read them, they might dismiss them as the ravings of a sad sap. It is all so fleeting. These words i write, they have meaning. I am trying to put into paper the emotions that i feel. I am looking for something, but really...why? I know there is no resolution, but yet i search for it.

I rushed to my next class, ended up being 5 minutes late and decided to wait until the end of class to turn the homework in because I didn't want to disturb the class anymore than I already did (I wasn't the only coming in late...all due to this midterm) I thought that was the right decision because I respect my peers and want to give them the best chance to learn. Every single class I've attended, I've been able to turn in homework at the end of the class period and it was okay (especially since I sit in the front and am on generally good terms with the professors) -- it's not something I would do often, I'm usually on-time/early to class. (Midterms sometimes throw a wrench in the system)

I went to turn my homework in at the end of class to the TAs and they told me they need to mark it as 'late'. I told them I had gotten out of a midterm and was late to class and they told me I should've given it to someone in the class who was here on time.

I don't know what the 'late' punishment is, but honestly, COME ON. 

The deadline did say today's date at the start of class, so I really am in the wrong.

This feels different, I've had some upper back pain about two weeks ago, that came and went.
Now I have middle back pain and it's radiating to my chest, and coupled with being paranoid as fuck from having panic attacks, I just feel like shit. My chest is sore, and I just don't feel healthy, ever. 

I want to eat better, and exersize, I enjoyed many active hobbies such as skating and bike riding up into my mid twenties, but have fallen into a rut of being a skinny fat lazy gaming nerd for the past 5 years. And I can feel it all the time.

My chest is congested, not sure if it's allergies. I cough when I smoked weed tonight, like always. Although I enjoy it, it just eventually makes me paranoid, even anxious, every time. I don't know why I do it to myself. I've gone so far as to type out my name into discord chat in hopes that if I'm so paranoid anxiety attack stoned that if I really have a heart attack I can send out a message to my friends who I'm in the channel with so they can call 911.

27,"So I realised recently that in my head I have this weird idea that the perfect girl for me should be into the basically the exact same shit I am, be just as nerdy or whatever else. I always seem to fall for girls if I found out they’re into the same shows or like the same movies or whatever else. My ‘soulmate’ would ideally get my stupid references and whatever else that other people don’t. It kinda makes sense, after all having that much in common with someone seems like a great thing. I actually met a girl like that who I fell for for so fucking long. We’re really good friends still, but I ignored for so long the signs we’d be fucking terrible romantically. Beyond the common interests we’re just insanely incompatible, and there’s really no romantic chemistry at all. I just liked to imagine there was. 

I think that bit in 500 Days of Summer where Tom gets told that ‘just because she likes the same bizarro crap you do doesn’t mean she’s you’re soulmate’ sums my point up perfectly. Recently I’ve started liking this girl who I’ve known for a long time but (kind of arrogantly) never even gave a second thought to cause she doesn’t fit into that image I’d built up. On paper we have very few common interests, on a surface level we seem so different. She’s a dancer who’s into reality shows and all that shit, I’m a nerdy student who reads books and shit. We both just happen to have similar social circles. On paper that seems a weird couple. For a long time I kinda wrote her off as a bimbo, which I realise now was just me being a judgemental asshole.

The surprising thing is that we bounce off each other so fucking well once I decided to sit down and actually get to know her as a person. Our senses of humour are so in sync, and our personalities are remarkably similar too once you get past the different interests. We’re both kinda the awkward, quieter ones out our friends. That spark is 100% there, whenever we’re around each other we flirt like hell to the point people always comment on it. One of my friends said he can actually see something going on between us just by the way we look at each other. We just have a really good time around each other. But the main thing for me is that she actually wants to get to know me. It always felt like in the past I was forcing my ideal image onto girls who weren’t interested, but this girl just genuinely finds me interesting and wants to get to know me. And that’s honestly the only thing that counts. 

And I’ve come to realise this is what makes dating fun. Going for a girl just because she fits your image of what an ideal girl for you is is just stupid. If the spark’s not there, then nothing else matters. I’ve been having a blast getting to know this girl cause while we are similar enough to get along well, we both have such different interests and shit that it feels exciting. It’s interesting and sexy as hell when she’s passionate about something that I never really gave a second thought to, and like any good relationship I think she’s honestly broadened my horizons and being around her makes me a more well rounded person.

So essentially what I’m saying is don’t chase a girl just cause she seems to fit some image of what your perfect girl should be. She’ll never live up to that and it will never work out. Just be a bit more open to the real people you know instead, and maybe try get to know someone you may have wrote off before due to your own misconceptions and judgements. You honestly just never know who you’ll connect with, you can’t predict it at all and having chemistry with someone doesn’t really follow any logic whatsoever. It can just happen, no matter how different you both seem to be.

From the outside I guess back then in highschool it might have seen so. I was still skinny put I played football. Even made varsity before quitting and drinking/partying until graduation. But I never felt tough. I was the only boy in my family. The youngest with 4 older sisters. 

I think my parents pushed me towards sports to offset that. When I was young I tried wrestling, basketball, baseball but none of that sticked.

Not the greatest of back stories but here I am mid-20s still trying to act tough but at the same time not really. I know I'm not. This is why I'm so damn insecure. I'm intimidated by every guy bigger than me because I know if I say soemthing they may not like that I'd get my ass beat in a fight. 

And I'm a weird dude who struggles with tact, ask my girlfriend. That's who I am. I'm a weird, dude. Insecure about his masculinity and deathly afraid to be himself because I know the problems it would cause.

30,"I've always been a vulnerable, impressionable person, and I have never had much constant contact with people and their everyday lives. At the time I was in college, it was pretty much the only consistent safety net in my life, but for some reason or another, I came to see it as a scam, another means to just a job like any other person in life. Yet, I was so wrong, and the advent of click bait articles and misleading memes didn't help at all.

If you do quick google searches for ""dropping out of college"" or the like, you get a ton of search results leading to articles that suggest things to do during your ""gap year"" or how dropping out of college can benefit you, complete with the classic ""top ten things"" or ""5 reasons why you should,"" etc. These articles are clearly designed to attract people thinking of dropping out of college, to attract views and ad revenue.

The video that stood out to me, and was one of the big reasons why I dropped out, was an obscure text video I watched about 5-6 years ago that I can never recall the name of. It talked about a looming ""higher education bubble"" that would occur in half a decade or so, among other things. When I saw this video, I thought to myself ""maybe I should cut my losses and stop pursuing this dream - I wasn't really meant for college anyway."" In actuality, getting a bachelor's degree might have been the only way to avoid being in a persistent slump in my life.

One of my deepest regrets is dropping out of college. The main difficulty and challenge of college for me was learning to cope in a new place with people who were already more adults than me. I couldn't care less about the difficulty of the course load. It was the prospect of coming across other students who could afford to be in the dorms. I wasn't able to tell myself that there are millions of students everyday commuting to college. It was just another excuse I made in my head. And as I looked on the internet for answers/support, enticing click bait pushed me to the edge until finally I just gave up.

Nowadays, when I look at top 10 lists, I find a constantly re-emerging self-hatred (and hatred for click bait in general). After years of teachers telling me not to trust stuff I see on the internet without a valid source, I went and read the things I wanted to read, listened to the things that I only wanted to listen to. And it was worse because I had little human contact to bounce these views off and either confirm or deny them.",20Oct2018,1
31,"I’ve had problems setting boundaries/standing up for myself in the past, so I’d be grateful to have some outside perspective on this.

For some time now, our close (3 years) group of 9 friends (17-19 M/F) have been planning a big holiday for the summer. There’s one problem: none of us are certain yet when we’ll each be free over the summer, and some of the dates clash (we go to different high schools/colleges). There is one date where *most* of them are likely free, but I’m definitely not (exams).

So on the group chat last night (I was asleep when this happened), one of my friends (Kevin) said that “To solve the problem we could  just dump OP and go in May/June” and earlier saying that “we could do it later, *if* we want OP to come”. *if*?? What was he implying? He said right after “though that’s not a great solution” but I still felt disrespected and really hurt - it wasn’t any of his business whether I was going or not, and to suggest leaving me out, right to my face and to everyone, made me feel so humiliated.

Normally I wouldn’t feel so hurt, but let me explain why I felt like that:

1) He’s a serious person - not the kind to make those sorts of jokes - normally if he says/considers something, he means it. So I know he really did consider it.
2) There’s another date where all but one of us can likely make it. He immediately dismissed the idea, saying “pick another date, I think Jake has plans on that day”. He didn’t even consider “dumping him”, like he did to me.

I considered letting it go, but then he would think it’s okay to say things like that to me in future. I decided not to call him out on the chat, as it would hurt his ego, so I directly messaged him. I told him it wasn’t nice. He said sorry, but he kept trying to justify himself “well I did say we could ditch me instead” and “but I said afterwards it wasn’t a good idea” etc etc. Why suggest it if it’s not a good idea?

It made him look quite insensitive on the chat - one of the other friends replied that of course we’re not going in May and he didn’t admit it wasn’t nice to say that. So when I asked him if he wanted to take back what he said, and he said yes, I told him to do it on the chat.

I don’t know if it was the right thing to do - letting other people see I accepted his behaviour (nobody directly called him out) wasn’t good for either of us, and I’d upset him if I was the one calling him out in front of the whole chat. So he sent a long sarcastic message onto the chat, saying that it was very, very mean and he was very, very sorry. It was obvious I’d told him. I played along, but inside I felt like I was in the wrong.

This is the first time I’ve decided to stand up for myself in a long time, so I don’t know if I was actually being over-sensitive and horrible and should’ve just let it go. I’d really appreciate some thoughts on this. Sorry for the long post, and thank you for reading:)",20Oct2018,1

I just can't watch a movie with an actress who has had sex with a black guy. I won't date a girl who has had sex with a black guy, either.

Do I believe miscegenation should be illegal? No. If someone wants to sleep with a black man that is their prerogative - I just do not wish to watch their movies or date them. Truth is, once you go black. we don't want you back. I have black friends and co-workers, and believe it or not, I've told them this. They shrug it off and tell me they don't like seeing black women with non black people either. We are all tribal on some level.

BTW, I am not white. I am a Latino. I have dated white and Indian women before, and I am well aware that many people would call me a hypocrite, but again, I really don't care. Black people are the most racist people in the United States - every black guy I know pretty much hates black women and if they have enough clout, will only date non blacks. If they are currently with a black girl, if they manage to get a non black girl they will drop the black girl like a shoe ASAP. On the other hand, if they see a black girl with a white or latino guy they hate it. Many times they even get violent with them.

40,"Hey, you guys, I thought I'd post my story here, so as to get it out of my head and perhaps stop feeling so perplexed about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start off with saying that I work as nurse in a day clinic and I love my job, I really do. And also, I love my favourite artist (have loved him every day since I was little, so over 22 years), and who has by now sadly left this world. Let's call him Jens. I have my own family too, a husband and two kids.

&amp;#x200B;

And last night I had a dream about Jens. We were at my workplace, which is a doctor's office with an examination bed at the back. As usual, I was there before the doctor and all our patients, to set the place up and prepare. But this time, Jens was there too, he was lying in the bed, all exhausted and frail like on the last photos of him. Resembling nothing of the man he used to be. And I was taking care of him in this day clinic office. All his meds and stuff were there.. and I was just making sure he felt comfortable, doing all the things an exemplary nurse should do. And while doing all these caring things, I felt my love for him being so deep and selfless that it took me so much by surprise that I woke up briefly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Clearly quite eager  to continue the dream, I fell asleep again and luckily my brain delivered and continued where it left off. So I was really doing every little thing I could think of to make sure Jens was comfortable and taken care of. It came naturally for me and I could see he was feeling it. Suddenly he was out of the bed and I embraced him into a hug, willing it to be the warmest and most comforting and reassuring hug he has ever received, so as to alleviate his possible pain and fill him with love. And during this hug I felt just how emaciated Jens had become and it DIDN'T break my heart, because I just loved him so much, there wasn't room for any other feeling or emotion, just love love love. I really made sure to embrace him wholly, so as to make him aware I felt his body and continued to love him regardless.

&amp;#x200B;

Then came the time for the doctor to start taking in patients, and I wasn't at all nervous or all over the place like I usually am when I am not ready and doc comes in. I was just like ""Let me tuck you in real nice and draw the curtains and I will be right here with you."" Really making it clear that he was not going to be alone and that I had him in my heart and mind all the time I was going to be busy working.

&amp;#x200B;

Then my dream ended. Crap.

Couldn't even go back to sleep because I was still feeling this massive love for him. It wasn't an intensive or crazy feeling like manic fans have toward their idols, it was something very different. Like my love was trying to make up for everything Jens had to endure while still alive and wanted to make his last moments even a tiny bit better than they had been irl.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, in the dream, it worked. I sensed he was feeling it. But outside of the dream - I am not feeling it. This love. As I said, I have a family of my own and I have had other crushes before - never have I ever felt anything this deep, this genuine, selfless and warm. My whole dream was wrapped in a warmish yellow glow, it was just so warm.

&amp;#x200B;

And it got me thinking what if that was it. What if my dream let me know of the maximum extent to which I was able to love and now in real life I am left with the memory, because I am 28 and have never felt anything like that before, at all. Pretty grim outlook. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I am hoping that maybe some of you guys took the time to read it and perhaps offer some words of wisdom on topics of love or dreams or just anything, really.

I'm a recent college graduate, and I'm currently living with my cousin's wife's family because they were gracious enough to take me in until I can get on my feet.

My student loans kick in at the end of November, and I'm by no means making enough money to pay them off right now.

She asked me if I have a plan. Well yeah, I have a picture of what would be ideal for me, but it's not exactly panning out as quickly as I would've hoped. I've been looking for an apartment, roommates, and a full-time job, but it's been rough. I'll be honest and say that I haven't been looking nearly as much as I probably should be. She's such a nice woman, but I knew what she meant when she asked. They're happy to do this for me, but she and I both know that I should be doing all I can do get the hell out of here. I need to bite the bullet and go back to working at Culver's so I can get more income, because I'm not getting enough hours at either of my positions right now.

so i am 16 years old. I don’t see myself as having any kind of abnormal social skills. I am here because of my friend situation. The friends i have, i don’t like, and we rarely ever hung out.  and even since early on as a younger boy, hanging out with people was with one family friend that had to spend the whole days with me because his mom was at work. this was years ago, but i remember, that when he first came over, things were eh on the comfort level, but as the day went on, i remember i would get comfortable with him being there and felt i don’t need to act like a host anymore. I haven’t felt that with somebody since(we r no longer close). so i am trying to expand. met friend A. he’s cool, we went to 6 flags and i went on my first few roller coaster rides with him. great time, felt easier to be around him however is a little immature. Friend B is also cool. we joke and talk in classes. We saw a movie today. it’s late at night and the movie finished. at this point, i am tired, but willing to do more. i don’t know what to do though. So i dropped him off, and drove home while
it’s 1am thinking I sort of failed during that hangout because i didn’t feel the comfort to be around him. I guess i only picked him up to see the movie at night and we only watched it, not crazy amounts of talking went down, but non the less, it’s was a ok time at most. I have 1 thought right now. what now? next week i wouldn’t wanna watch another movie, and i am sure he wouldn’t ask to hang(i had to ask, it’s very draining to do so aswell). so i don’t know, i guess my subconscious plan is to get comfortable hanging out with guy friends, so i can be ok with maybe going on a date with a girl. I don’t know, like low key, being a teen is difficult in a sense that u r forced to be trapped in a ballon while reality is all around u. everything u know is inside that ballon, but really there’s so much more, but u can’t realize that because your trapped once again, in ur own little ballon.

I called the cops on my uncle for beating his elderly dad. Problem is, when my uncle was a child his dad was a raging alcoholic who beat him a lot, and also beat my uncle’s sister who is my mother. 
His dad is 77. I feel guilty for calling the cops, because there wasn’t justice for the abuse my uncle and mother faced when they were children (they grew up in a third-world country). 
Is it right for me to feel like maybe he just received revenge for what he did to his kids?

The uncle’s an alcoholic, and did this in an alcoholic haze. Like father, like son. 

The uncle has four kids, and one’s merely a child, while the others are teenagers. 

Where is my heart supposed to go? No charges have been pressed yet, and I don’t even know 100% if he was beaten. I just feel like a dick, but I know a lot of this backtracking-guilt I feel is because I also got beat by my mother’s family as a child. 

It’s such a mess. What are your thoughts? Where should my moral compass be? I never want to hurt people, I just want justice. But my idea of justice feels wrong sometimes. ",20Oct2018,1
68,"Uhh so I’m new to reddit and I don’t know if this is the right subreddit to ask this in but I’m unsure of how bad I fucked my knee up. For background, I’m 17 F and live in the US. (So it would cost me extra to see someone professional) I was gearing up for a really important swim meet for me and I was putting on my Tech Suit, which was really tight (so I can go faster I guess) and usually you need a helper to help get it over your ass and everything but I was pressed for time and everyone else was busy so I tried to jump into mine and I jumped putting all of my weight on my right knee in a super weird angle way outside the bounds of where a knee should bend. I heard a crunch and a crack and I was on the ground. I couldn’t bend my knee out well but it was really important for me to earn points I guess so I swam through it, it hurt like a motherfucker. I’ve been icing it every night and it still is uncomfy. I can stand on it now and sit but it pulls differently than it has ever before? It no longer hurts unless I put weight on if for more than 10 minutes, sit with it bent crossing my legs, flipturn or do breaststroke. So like, when I bend my knee out in the direction of the fall is when it most hurts. I’m too embarrassed to say that I fucked it up in front of my coach and peers so I just use a kick floaty if I’m having a rough day and then ice it down when I get home. At what point do I do anything more? I’m too nervous to tell people I think I got hurt. (Idk why??)  ",20Oct2018,1
