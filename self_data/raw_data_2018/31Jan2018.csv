0,"Yesterday i got a phonecall from my stepmother. She asked me to sit, and explained it had to do with my father. She tells me that my father is in police custody, (I know know he’s been sitting there since thursday, after armed officers searched his house, his mothers house and their vacation home.)
Now I’m an 18 year old guy, and during the last year, I’ve been living primarily with my real mom.  So confused I of course ask about the charges, to which she answers that he’s been looking at some pictures of persons under the legal age of 18. I was stunned.

My father has always been the life of a party. He could make anyone laugh, and always had an interesting story to tell, and honestly, I’ve never met a person whom disliked him. He’s NEVER made any advances or mentioned anything that would make me suspicious, and I’ve always very much looked up to him. I should add that he’s a social worker, and has often worked with kids.

Yesterday was a shit day, however I thought he might be redeemable if all he’d done was look at some pictures of 17 year old girls online. Today was an infinitely worse day.

Today I learned what his charges are (which he has pled guilty to). My father has been charged with storing, sharing and taking pictures of underage girls, but the kicker for me is the age. I know the pictures he took, was of two 7 year olds on the beach, luckily (if you can even say that) those are the only action he himself has done. The girls were unaware of him photographing them, and they are wearing swimsuits.

My father has to stay in custody untill mid february before sentencing, and right now I’m freaking out! I love (loved? Idk!) my father, and truly respected him. I know multiple of his siblings want nothing to do with him anymore, but he’s my father!? I’m told a letter is on the way from him, but I would really appreciate advice from you guys before opening it.

Also, can anyone tell me whether or not he’s name is likely to be published once he’s been senteced?

4,"How does one define a person? Not in the sense of what counts as a person, but of what makes an individual themselves. How can one define their limits, their strengths, their tendencies, their beliefs?

Trying to systemically define a person is an inherently difficult task - and one, of course, that has been tackled by RPGs for decades with the sledgehammer of subtlety that games trend towards. Any individual metric will inevitably be flawed, any combination of factors will inevitably still simplify, and any system too deep risks becoming a Kafkaesque black box. Even the difficulty of the problem is hard to accurately convey.

I tend to think of the challenge in the terms used by AI research, although my understanding of the subject is only comprehensive enough to have emerged from the Dunning–Kruger fog. As we currently understand it, any intelligence must be motivated by maximising a 'utility function'. In the case of an AI, this is usually defined as a points system, wherein producing a cup of tea awards ten points, obtaining the right solution of milk awards another five, wiping out the planet with thermonuclear weapons subtracts a few million, and so on. The immediate issue, of course, is that Goodhart's law applies: ""When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."" This leads to unwanted behaviour wherein a rogue super-intelligence wipes out all life by using nanobots to render all the matter in the solar system into its component atoms, then reconstitutes it all into trillions of paperclips, because you told it to maximise production of paperclips and that's what it's going to do, dammit!

This concept of a utility function doesn't merely apply to artificial intelligence, however, but all intelligence, and most especially ourselves. The only reason this isn't immediately obvious is that our utility function is biological: our endorphin release mechanism. People attempt to maximise endorphin production, in the short and long term, by doing things they like, and by planning long term to allow them to continue doing things they like, even if that necessitates some things they don't. This is complicated by the fact that the human utility function is, indeed, a Kafkaesque black box, a series of self-referential multi-variable equations of byzantine complexity, that we cannot see and must infer from the patterns in the level II chaotic system of human experience. Or, in other words, it's a bit tricky.

When framed in those terms, many things become clear. Why is it hard to create an AI that convincingly simulates human intelligence? Because we don't understand how our own utility function works, and thus cannot parse it into code. Why are humans such varied and conflicted creatures? Because we're barely-rational monkeys, whose intelligence is an accidental evolutionary byproduct of complex social hierarchies, trying to satisfy the hidden demands of a convoluted utility function in a way that makes some kind of sense and alludes to some kind of internal consistency. And why is it difficult to create and simulate convincing three-dimensional characters in art? Because to do so we cannot yet rely on rational means, and instead must look to some strange alchemy of empathy, tapping into circuitous patterns of our subconscious to bring to life a person who does not exist.

Once one has grasped this, the immense difficulty of many of our unsolved problems comes into focus, and many elements of human achievement become dramatically more impressive. The challenges faced by AI researchers are gargantuan, as are those facing psychologists. The talent that storytellers possess, no matter the medium, of creating compelling and convincing characters, becomes that much more impressive - and even more so once one tries for oneself and discovers how difficult it really is. It frames the human experience in a different light, and highlights the problem faced in attempting to divine and deal with the motives of others, a problem that challenges every one of us in the course of social interaction, and to to an even further extent in many professions.

The puzzle becomes darkly ironic when one considers the evolutionary theory, alluded to earlier, that human intelligence was a byproduct of an increase in the complexity of our social hierarchies. We became smarter so that we could understand one another well enough to live in large groups, which in turn made us more complicated to understand. Oops.

So, to return to the initial question, how does one define a person, capturing their behaviours and understandings in a comprehensive yet digestible manner? The answer: With great difficulty.

Oh course, the most interesting thing is that the reader has likely formed a profile of myself, the writer, simply from my musings on the subject. The human mind is surprisingly good at the impossible.",31Jan2018,1

15,"I’ve been at my job for a year and have bonded so much with a coworker who is 10+ yrs older. I rarely shared good news with my friends because I felt they didn’t care or would think I’m boasting. I hesitantly shared small good news with her and she was so genuinely happy and proud of me. I almost cried and realized I never got such a genuine reaction from my friends and even family. I confided in her something that’s heavy in my heart that I haven’t told any of my friends. None of them, because I thought they wouldn’t care, I didn’t want to burden them, or think I’m too whiny. She cried with me and comforted me. She made me realize how toxic some of my friends are, and how I kept contact with some just to not be lonely. 

It’s taken me 25 yrs to find such a genuine, kind soul. She has taught me a lot in just a year and made me much more comfortable with expressing my feelings. I used to hate hugging but after daily hug greetings, I actually kinda like them! I’m so happy I could cry.

18,"I am 23 years old. I am a student who is planned to graduate next year. Should of graduated about two years ago like the rest of my high school class, but I struggled with a horrible opiate/drug addiction (heroin mostly) that put a halt on a lot of my goals and ambitions. I am now in recovery, transferred schools from the one I initially got kicked out of. I go to a good university now, however I never felt so alone. I have friends (very very few close ones however), people that I can call that support me and want the best, but I feel trapped inside of my mind. I don't feel connected.

I find it hard to empathize with people these days. I'm so jaded. After being in the program, I have come across many amazing people. However, none of them have stuck around in my life. Either cause I didn't make a good effort to or they didn't. I blame myself because I really don't make good efforts at all. It's hard for me to call people. Or text people. I'm scared to open up to people. To be vulnerable.

My best friend overdosed 2 years ago and passed away. I have many other good friends too that are dead from the disease of addiction. I don't know how to grieve. I don't know how to live. I wish I was normal. I wish I didn't live trapped and crippled by my OCD and anxiety. I wish I wasn't an addict and could drink normally like other people. I wish people didn't take advantage of me and steal from me. I wish I could see the best in people. I wish I could look the world in the eye. I wish I had self-esteem. I wish I could show the people the real me. I wish I could form meaningful connections with people. I wish I could say I had a best friend today. I wish I could feel again",31Jan2018,1

I’m talking about words like “cringe”, “literally”, “legit”, “like” and other shit of the sort. Cringe is a facial expression, not a word used to describe something that grinds your gears. Literally has been morphed into a connecting word such as “and”. Legit is another word for real, used to say that an object is not fake, “that game is the legit version, not some shitty spin off”. Umms and ahhs have been replaced with “like” for some reason, and often go behind the word legit, “like legit”. Parents and schools need to step up their game and teach proper writing and typing.

32,"Just like the tittle says, I am just coming to terms with the fact I was drugged and raped by my boss at a work Christmas party.

I am just looking for a place to get this off chest and so I am telling my rape story to you reddit. I am a long time lurker and a first time poster. This is going to be a long story but I think you need to hear most of it to get the big picture. I am sorry any spelling mistakes and grammar errors. 

Here's my story:

I am a 28 year old male Canadian male. My boss is a 55ish year old male, who is a large former Persian wrestler. He is an immigrated from Iran and he came to Canada about 20ish something years ago. He was also former coach at a local college wrestling club. He is the owner of a health and wellness clinic and I am the marketing coordinator for it. 

 I have  always known I was drugged and  raped by him, but I choose to do nothing about it. It made me feel like shit just even thinking about it, so I kept trying to convince myself it didn't happen. I didn't want to face the fact I was rapped by another man. I couldn't believe that someone could do that to another person. The really sad part is that I still work for him and this happened  4 years ago(November  2014). 

This rape happened during a office Christmas party. It was the end of November in Canada and the weather conditions were pretty bad. We had  a few snow storms. But Ever year my boss would have a big office christmas party at his house. So there was 30+ people that show up at his mansion for the party. Everyone was drinking and mingling. I was expected to come early and help set up, so I did. So we partied, played secret santa and ate dinner. Now everyone started slowly leaving and I was one of few last one to leave. I had a few beers, so I decided to stay longer and make sure I had some hours between my last beer. I had about 4 beer through out 7 hours of being there. So it's was about 11-12ish(i don't remember the exact time) and I was leaving. But the my bosses house was in the mountain area, so you would have to go up and down though these winding roads to get there. And the road conditions were really bad that time of year. A huge storm had hit a few days earlier. It was below 0 that night and there was a lot of black ice and snow on the roads and I didn't have any winter tires. I was driving really carefully because of the road conditions . But My car hit some black ice and started sliding out of control. I wasn't moving fast or anything but my tires couldn't regain traction when I was sliding. I was pumping my break but it wasn't doing anything. So my car slowly slid off the side of the road and I got stuck and would need a towtruck to get me back on the road. 

I called a few towtruck places but they wouldn't come to my location in these weather conditions. So I decided to call my boss and see if there was anyone still at the party that could grab me because I was stranded. The area wasn't too far from my bosses place. So, he and his girlfriend ended up picking me up. I decided to leave my car there over night and call a tow-truck tomorrow  to get my car back on the road. My boss offered me to sleep over and take the guest bedroom, so I accepted. 

When I came back to his house, there was 2 other people from the party that were sleeping over because they came together and didn't want to risk driving in these conditions. They were still up and talking but I decided to go to sleep.  After my boss showed me my room, he came with a large glass of water and 2 pills. He told me to take it but I usually never take any pills so I refused. But he kept telling me to take it but I kept refusing. He wasn't backing down and I thought that was kind of weird that he kept insisting me to take them. Then he was like ""just take 1 then "" and I knew he wasn't backing down so I gave in and asked him what of pills these were. He said Tylenol and I remember myself looking very closely at the pills and it seemed like a Tylenol. So I finally gave in and ate 1, after having refusing to take  like them about 10 times before. And then I passed out. 

I remembered having this really fucked up dream that night where I was being held down but couldn't see, couldn't move and i was trying to speaking but couldn't. It felt like I was being held down and I was trying everything I could to move but still couldn't. I kept struggling and trying to move, until this weird sudden sensation (not exactly sure how to describe it. Somewhat like a thud or impact) and I remember after that my body just started relaxing after that. I remember that's the time I gave into it and quit trying to move. And then I woke up. 

I was feeling fucked up the next morning. My head was throbbing and my stomach was in pain. I was really confused and remembered not drinking too much and thought there's no way I should be hungover like this. This literally was the  worst hangover in my life, I thought. I also had this bruise on the back of my head, which was very tender when I touched it. I was trying to remember what the hell happened and how did I get it. I knew it couldn't be from my car accident because I was going so slow and it wasn't much of an accident. My car just slid off the road and got Stuck. I was in a lot pain and had no idea where it came from, But I just brushed it off and tried to forget about it. 

My bosses made breakfast for all 3 of us that morning. I couldn't eat anything because my head and my stomach was killing. This female work was really concerned about me and had this concerned look on her face. But I just told her was fine. And  I thanked and apologized to my boss for pick me up after my accident. 

 So after breakfast I called a tow truck company and told them the location of my car. My boss agreed to drop me off at my car so that the towtruck can pull my car back on to the road. When he was dropping me off to my car, he kept grabbing and rubbing is hand. I notice that and asked what happened to his hand, and he looked at me and gave me weird as fucken smile and just said that he had hurt it. I didn't think to much of it. 

I came home and I still live with parent, so I had to explain the whole story to them. My mom bitching me out but there wasn't much damage to the car, just cosmetic . But I knew that night wasn't right and there was something off about that night, but I still brushed it off. Throughout that day I kept remembering that night how my  boss kept insisting me to take those pills. This was when I started to suspect that I might have been rapped. I ran to my medicine cabinet looking for Tylenol but mine were different so I Google a bunch of tylenol pill images and none of them matched the one my boss gave me. I specifically remembering  the pill he gave me having a mini octagon pattern on the outside edge of pill and It didn't have any writing on it. So that when I pretty much knew I was rapped but I decided not to believe it. I kept trying to keep my mind away from it. 

After that day my boss started calling me George Michael.  He said that I look him and I was like wtf who's that. He told me he was a really good looking singer for 80's. I didn't think too much of it but I didn't know he was gay. After I found out that he was gay, I knew it was his fucked up way to say that I'm his bitch and that I'm gay. I've never been with a man and never would but I have nothing gay people. I felt like shit everytime he said that. He probably thought he was being sneaky and cleaver by saying that and I have no way of knowing what he did. I tried to get back at him by slacking off at work anytime i got. I would just do the bare basics and fuck off majority of the time. 

That girl that was concerned  about me during breakfast, got fired. And my boss kept trying to pit me again her. He kept saying she didn't want to pick me up that night and she told him to leave me out there. He kept calling her crazy and called her a drug addict. Im pretty sure he was trying to get me to hate her because she probably know what happened to me that night. I'm pretty sure at this time my boss knew that I found out that I was raped by him. I kept Googleing I was raped on my work computer and trying to find other people in similar situations. This is the first time me talking about this incident.I probably need to go to a therapist but I am broke and can't afford it. My boss  would  bring up the accident from time to time, he kept trying to insist I was really drunk that day and I made a big mistake that night. I would say I wasn't drunk but he wouldn't care and kept accusing. But I just finally decided to say yes ""I was drunk and I'm sorry"" but that was just go shut him up. I now realize that he probably was recording that so he would have evidence if I ever try to accuse him of rape. There was a bunch of other incidents like this were it made me know for certain I was raped. My boss also knows a lot of lawyers and made it a point to make sure I knew that he has a bunch of cop friends as well. I am broke and I have no idea how I could prove he raped me. So I didn't do anything and I didn't talk anyone about it. I felt alot of shame from it. I feel like a bitch and I'm still working for him. But I am 100% sure I was rapped that night.",31Jan2018,18
34,"I'm not money focused in that I don't really care about having a lot of money, as long as I have the basics. I don't often buy myself new things and only really spend money on going to stuff with my girlfriend and the occasional game.


Having said that, I feel like I'm too salary focused. I am only a year a bit out of university, and am on a really good salary compared to the average. I've been looking for a new role (for various reasons) and I've been accepted for the perfect role... Except for the salary. It ticks literally every other box. It's still a raise compared to my current, already good, salary, but I know for a fact I could have gotten a lot more elsewhere. I know I'm gonna love it but I can't help having that niggling feeling.

Over the past year, my life has improved immensely. I got a new (and demanding!) job that I love and which enabled my partner and me to get out of poverty, got married, moved across the country, started grad school (again), got a dog, was able to afford my spouse going back to school, just got approval to implement a project I proposed at work, and now am in the process of buying a house. 

All of those are wonderful things--I just didn't expect them all to happen so fast. I feel like in day-to-day tasks, I'm constantly falling behind, like ""Oh, I don't have clean clothes because neither of us had time to do the laundry,"" or ""I guess I'll skip lunch today because I don't have time to prepare it before work""--things that are totally my own fault because I'm not staying on top of time management. I've stopped working out, and have gained about ten pounds and I feel disgusting and disappointed in myself. At the moment, I also feel that our finances have spiraled out of control--something I generally have a very firm grasp on--but I know that feeling will be alleviated once the dust settles after the purchase of the house closes. There's about a hundred other things in my head right now, too, but they're all swirling around too fast for me to write down and I'm running out of time before I have to leave for work.

44,"Just something I'd like to share. Hope you enjoy.



Not so long ago, a good friend of mine talked about this boy he shared a dorm room with at that time. This boy, apparently, after having gone through the stress of last semester, wrapped himself up in Christmas lights and stared blankly at the common room tv. When my friend asked what on earth was he doing, he shrugged and said he was watching tv (which was turned off).  I told my friend I found this boy interesting.

Apparently, it was the first time anyone had thought that about him. My friend (let's call him ""M"") told me that the guy (let's call him ""R"") couldn't believe that a girl called him cool.

A few months after, I was walking to the school building when ""M"" called after me and loudly asked my opinion about ""R""'s hair. This was the first time I've ever seen ""R"" and I found him adorkable. He was tall, skinny, and had a pronounced slouch, but he had a bright sunshine smile and a laugh that was funny enough to make anyone else laugh too. I called his hair ""fab"" since it was long and looked really Disney Prince-ish. 

It was also the first time he saw me, I believe. And the first time he received a compliment from anyone not of his friend circle. He was more reclusive than a Brown Recluse. 

The time we were introduced properly was when my friend circle and ""R""s friend circle shared a spot to hang out. He came marching up to one of his friends, playfully yelling ""fuck you"" and other insults. 

It was crush at first sight.

The rest of our meetings after that were filled with awkward glances and mutual pining. At this point, you're probably thinking, ""Jesus, this is material from some YA novel with a white heterosexual couple on the cover"". Yes, it did sort of feel like that. It drove me crazy.

Come Valentine's Day, my roommate, aware of my feelings for ""R"", pushed me to confess to him, otherwise she'd do it on my behalf. I learned long ago to fear her and take her words as seriously as the Commandments. So in a pathetic scramble to get the confession over with, I swiped a brown paper bag from a friend, stuffed it with butterscotch, and prayed to the good Lord for strength.

I did the deed with much fumbling and stuttering, as well as almost getting sprayed by ""R""s drink in his absolute shock. It would have made even the most hardened shoujo-loving weeb/otaku cringe horrendously. (How do I know this? Because ""R"" and his friends are of that particular sort.)

It was a few days after that I knew from ""R""s closest friend (let's call him ""J""), who was a mutual friend of mine, that ""R"" ran all the way to the next college to tell ""J"" that I confessed. And then by some gossip wizardry, everyone in ""R""s friend circle knew about it in less than a few hours. Give boys the right thing to talk about, they'll spread the damn subject like wildfire, I tell you.

A few hours later, I was on my way to dinner with my professor and a couple of friends when ""R"" came sprinting towards me out of nowhere and then handing me a rose (with its stem bent from his run) and a plastic bag of chocolates he bought at a rush from 7/11. (I didn't know how he knew the chocolates were actually my favorite). Lo and behold, my professor bore witness to it all.

We started talking and meeting up more and I was aware of my feelings gradually developing into something much deeper than a crush. It was the same for him. Not long after, we became official. Our days were spent with a ton of laughter, affection, and banter. To this day, we've never had a single fight. We had misunderstandings and disagreements, of course, but ""R"" always kept a level head and handled things wisely and maturely. Sometimes I feel like he was a hundred year old sage trapped in the heart of a child and a body of a gangling teen. 

An interesting thing I knew only later into our relationship was that our paths may have crossed long before we knew of each others' existence. Years ago, I made a drawing for my friend's (let's call him ""S"") exhibit. ""S"" then told me he overheard and saw a guy complimenting my artwork aloud, commenting on how it looked like it was printed. He even took a few pics, ""S"" said. I wished I could have met my mystery admirer to properly thank him for his kind words.

One day while ""R"" was showing me his camera roll, what else did I stumble upon but my old drawing. ""R"" said that that drawing was special to him since it ""made his day"". ""I wish I could've met the artist,"" he said. 

He blinked like an owl when I told him I was the artist.

Was everything predestined? Was it fate? Were ""R"" and I supposed to have gone through all this? I don't know. But whatever the universe has planned, I'm just thankful that I have a wonderfully kind, loving, intelligent, and fun boyfriend with a heart of gold by my side. I'm proud to say I love him beyond comprehension.

51,"Like I am sure a lot of us do in this wonderful, horrid time of the internet age, I struggled immensely with finding who I am and why I couldn't be better like some other people.

My main gripe with myself was mostly seeing a FWB I had on social media lately. Back when we had a thing we were great friends on multiple levels. Well, that's what I led myself to believe. Once things kinda broke off is when I realized just how terrible of a time my life was being around them, and the only positive was the ""with benefits"" part of our friendship.

Fast forward to a few months ago until recently, I would always see their posts on social media about the wonders of their life. Smiling with a large group of friends. Out at events. Just being their quirky cute self. This really had been damaging me. It wasn't just a person showing off a great life, but someone I knew. Why couldn't I be that way? Why couldn't I have that lifestyle.

It wasn't up until recently did I come to a huge realization that kinda blew me away. During our friendship I learned a lot of things about them. They work several jobs, and use the remaining few hours to be with their friends. Of the plenty of friends they had, few were close. Their father is extremely abusive and their mother is an alcoholic. They are the sole income of the household.

I was jealous of the highlights, and was so stuck wishing for their online life I never bothered to remember how shitty things were. I had to sit back and realize that even with myself I only post the highs. 

I don't have a lot of friends, but the friends I do have are extremely close and available to me. Im blessed enough to not have to dedicate my life to work. I think they are more attractive than me, but I am fully confident in my appearance. Quite proud of how I look honestly. My home life isn't the best, but I have it so much better than others.

Having this self reflection just completely lifted away so much stress I had. I don't need to compare myself to anyone because I am me, and I love who I am.",31Jan2018,2
52,"I doubt that someone here can really help me but I hope, there is somebody listening (/reading?) because my best friend doesn’t understand how hard it hit me. 

My former best friend (know her since 2006?) told me a while ago that I’m pretty arrogant and mean online and it hurt me. She and her friends are way more wholesome while I prefer self-deprecating jokes and irony.  She is pretty honest and I appreciate that but she also told me, that she already talked with other friends about me and that they thought the same. Is that already gossip? She then had a good cry about me on the shoulder of a former friend that hates me for a while now but that’s another story. That former friend spread that I’m arrogant and mean online and irl and that’s too much. 

I have great trust issues and I’m lacking of self confidence and Twitter is my safe space and I’m trying my best and I just don’t feel well anymore in anything I do because it’s probably too arrogant and wrong. I’m trying to find my self. I guess, my whole behavior is some kind of compensation of my self hate but now I can’t trust my friends anymore.

53,"I can't say it there, so I'll say it here.

I was just reading a now locked thread, and the OP there mentioned that she gave in to the totally unreasonable and somewhat insane demands of her partner basically because he'd just refuse to let it go till she did.

This shit is just as abusive as yelling or threatening or hitting. It's not as obvious but it leads to exactly the same place. 

One person ends up tying themselves into knots to try to make the other person less insecure (doesn't work, btw) and the other person instead of being happy in their relationship gradually turns themselves into a prison guard instead of a partner. Both people end up constantly afraid of what the other one will do, all because one of them can't face up to their own insecurity. 

An aside on insecurity: Insecure people think the thing they are focused on is causing the bad feelings, but actually the bad feelings are causing them to pick up things to focus on. That's why pandering to their insecurity does nothing to appease it. 

Controlling people think that they will feel better if they control all the things, but that also works pretty much exactly opposite of how they think it will. If you make yourself responsible for all the things, then you are constantly having to jump to keep all the things under control. 

In short, insecure controlling people very often do things that make them feel even more insecure and out of control. Then instead of just letting shit go, they try to grab even tighter. It's not pretty.

**Edit:**

To expand a tiny bit more - this kind of thing is a spectrum. Anything from a shitty friendship all the way up to a stifling and destructive relationship. 

It seems harmless but annoying. Pouting, whining, being passive aggressive, sulking, asking over and over, insisting on ""debates"", maybe keeping someone awake with the drama, or making it impossible for them to enjoy their leisure time. 

But it wears the victim down and sucks up their mental resources. Brain power they should be using to think about the patterns in the relationship is instead being used on emotional self regulation in the face of constant stress. 

The person doing this stuff is also using up their own mental resources. And in their case, it's usually the emotional self regulation that takes the hit, as they zoom in on the thing they are trying to get the other person to do. They get increasingly insistent - the worse they feel, the more they want to 'fix' it by making the other person just go along with them already. Instead of putting their mental energy into managing their own emotions.",31Jan2018,353

How does an individual who has extensively been exposed to images and/or videos of extreme violence process empathy compared to individuals who have never been exposed to such visuals. Also, what is the emotional response of individuals viewing violence electronically v.s. viewing it in real life?

58,"So I'll give you some background and I'll tell you what I think now. 

First crush (2010-2011): 7th grade, I kept talking to her for a few months, when I finally told her I like her she said she's with someone else and that I should have told her earlier.

Second crush (2012-2013) : 9th grade. I met her online, we kept talking a few months, I told her I like her, she said we couldn't have a relationship and she sees me as ""her brother"". Distance too, of course.

Next crushes were not really crushes, just girls who seemed ""ok"" to me. That was during high school, when I tried to make myself not to like anyone so I won't get hurt again. 

Fast forward to first year of University : I met this girl, she became my girlfriend 2 months later. Everything good, she got my first kiss, it was nice. But it only lasted a while. We couldn't see each other due to distance, because we're both students.

She broke up with me in October because ""she doesn't want a boyfriend anymore, we didn't see each other in 3 months, and I didn't send her any pictures"". Okay,please don't comment on this relationship, it fucked me up big time. Depression, lost weight, motivation, I was just staying in bed the entire day.

December 2017 to this day : I started nofap, I started eating healthier, taking cold showers, exercising and reading a self improvement book.

There are these girls at University who I like, but I have no idea how to ""make a move"", how to ""show them I like them"". 

Why does it have to be so hard? Why do you have to play all these games and tricks? Why do you have to hide your emotions, your feelings? Why are women so fucking difficult? Why do they play mind games?

I read so many things, watched so many Youtube videos. Last time I saw something about the push-pull technique.

I mean, what? Am I engineering something or just fucking trying to be with someone? Or other things. Don't call to early or too late, don't text right away, just wait a few minutes or an hour so she can see you're busy and have a life. To tell her or not to tell her how you feel about her? On one hand, if you tell her, you might seem to needy, if you don't tell her you're a pussy and you'll get in the friendzone.

Man...it's just so fucked up. So complicated and rather hopeless. Sometimes porn (masturbation stuff) really seems like the way to go. That coupled with controling your feelings not to care about anything at all.

Don't tell me I'm complaining too much. I know that already. I'm just looking for some answers.

I really don't know anything about this dating thing what so ever, so if you could explain some things to me, that would be great.

66,"This happened a couple years ago but I'm still not sure how to feel. Do you forgive people or cut them off if they are ""toxic."" If you are a parent please read this and realize how important how you react to things is. This was a big moment I realized there was nothing good for me in my Mom. It's Years later now and sometimes I think about trying to have more of a relationship with my parents but memories like this always keep me from doing that. I'd like your guys opinion. 

Backstory: I had a pretty normal childhood except for the fact that at 14 I was sexually assaulted, maybe raped still not sure what I think about it but that's a different story. My parents and family didn't  know about this and I was mostly in denial and pretended it didn't happen. It didn't effect me too much but I was definitely depressed on and off for the rest of high school. At 16 I got a new boyfriend, we dated for a year. he ended up being a jerk and I dumped him. His response was stalking me for about 8 months. He would park his car and watch me walk to school so I had to start having my mom drive me. Had to change my phone number and delete all social media and email anyway to contact me. He would mostly send me messages saying I was a whore and a stupid cunt that deserved what had happened to me when I was 14. This was hard to hear from the only person I had told about what had happened and someone I thought loved me. The world seemed cruel and I felt like only horrible things would happen to me if I even went near boys. I also though that at that point I was too fucked up and had to much baggage for anyone to ever love me or for me to relate to people anymore. I became very suicidal. It was really comforting to think I could have control over what happened to me, and that I could make it all stop. My plan was to kill myself in my first year of university so I'd be alone, out of the house and maybe call 911 so an emergency person would find me not some poor stranger. I would day dream about it but I wasn't 100% sure if I was completely fucked or if I could still be happy if I pushed through. 

So here's where my mom comes in. I was in the car with her and was having some sort of freak out finally after keeping everything in, and I forced myself to blurt out. ""I'm so suicidal, it's all I think about, it's the only thing that makes me feel better I don't know what to do, I need help! I need a counsellor or someone I can't fucking do this anymore, I need help."" Of course I was starting to cry as well, and my mom responds "" that's a terrible thing to say to your mother."" I was shocked, just blown away, I was reaching out with my heart on my sleeve and was told to not talk about it. Breaking down wasn't normal for me this was an end of my rope thing that I thought would be taken seriously. We went back home and I just didn't say anything just cried silently. We never talked about it. I moved out to go to university like the plan but an amazing thing happened when I moved out, I realized that if I just wasn't around horrible people that life wasn't so bad. I had to do a lot of work to feel okay but every single year since leaving home has been better then the last. My mom once I moved out started saying she loved me at the end of phone calls and sending me nice cards for my birthday but it's too little too late, she dropped the ball and I don't feel the need to keep in touch but I do once in a while. It's hard to see this situation from any other side then my disappointment but if you have any insight I'd really appreciate it. ",31Jan2018,3
