2,"Today was a good day. I woke up, sure I was a little nervous. But hey, it makes sense to be nervous on a day you have a job interview, right? Hell, I was happy to be nervous. Because this kind of anxiety was at least a step in the right direction and meant I was doing something out of my comfort zone and improving myself.

I drove to the job interview (driving itself is a fucking stress cause I guess I'm useless and scared of driving, but whatever), did the interview just fine. Things went well all that. Drove home. Felt amazing for the next couple hours. Most productive day I've hand in months. I felt like I was finally becoming somebody worthwhile.

That high continued for a bit. Then I went out to dinner with my parents. Still felt great, awesome, whatever. Well, at some point during dinner I felt this intense wave of anxiety wash over me to the point of losing my appetite and just feeling helpless. I thought I was done with my anxiety attacks? They used to control my life, completely ruined my childhood and caused me to become an isolated hermit. But I thought those were gone? I have't had anything this bad in years. Like what the fuck? I've had a great day, and now my anxiety comes back stronger than ever and puts me in my place? Fuck.

No matter what I do, how good I feel, my anxiety always comes back and fucking bites me in the ass and shows me I don't have control over my life. Nothing I do will make it better, I can be great and I will still have this crippling fear that always makes itself known, even when I think it's gone.

Anyways, I'm fucking drunk and don't play on stopping the booze train anytime soon. Hell, I don't even wanna wake up tomorrow tbh. Nothing I do will end this fear. fuck",10Mar2018,2
3,"Be in a metro city of Los Angeles and kinda drunk.  Currently listening to relatives from Montana bitch and moan about California and how we are a ""liberal immigrant cesspool"".  Yet these fucks insist on coming to visit us.  Personally, I am in no way a self described liberal.  However, listening to these idiots run their suck holes makes me ponder California's relevant geopolitics.  Why do I care about every day Montanan or any other shit kicker across the continental?   If these clowns want to wallow in Fox News for the rest of our lives and complain about us being a parasitic appendage of the union, then why don't we just part ways and we can take our GDP and live in our supposed socialist experiments to our own detriment?  Why do we have to keep pretending that we are all culturally relevant to each other when we clearly aren't?  Living in major metropolitan cities in California all my life, the people I hate the most are the transplants from the other 49 who come here whine like a bunch of dumb fucks while soaking up our real estate.  Honestly, secession and unionization with the British common wealth sounds more intriguing than having to listen to my relatives any day of the fucking week.  Go fuck yourselves members of the other 49.  ",10Mar2018,0
5,"Long story short as possible: I’m a college student. I’m currently behind on my degree but trying not to stress about that. I currently play a club sport for my school, paintball. I’ve been playing paintball for years and I love the sport, it’s a passion of mine. My school is introducing shooting teams next year. I’ve always wanted to try 3 gun shooting as a sport but I cant afford it. The school would be paying the bulk of 3 gun costs if I were to join the 3 gun team.

I can’t decide if I should stick with paintball or try something new like 3 gun. I can’t do both because that would take far too much time away from academics and I would certainly fall even further behind on my degree.

I’ve actually considered quitting the paintball team in the past as the team has been an unhealthy and negative environment at times. I’m not sure if I should stick with what I’ve been doing, or try something I’ve always wanted to do. I’d love for input. Thanks r/self",10Mar2018,1

Everything would work out because it was in state and I would be close by and the biology program at UW is so good.

So, yeah, stupid as it is I'm getting scared of men. My father had anger issues when I was growing up, and lately they've been fighting, so this actually isn't anything new. It's just that every time it happens I start remembering it all really vividly and it freaks me out, I guess. I'm not good with physical contact anymore, I don't even let my friends get too close. I hate how stupidly irrational I'm being over this.

Just needed to rant,  I guess, so sorry about that. Had to call 911 this time, fuck this shit.

Unfortunately, my palette is pretty bland due to the fact that it’s hard for me to find music I like to listen to on a daily basis because I like to listen to music, daily. I’ll have to admit that I’m pretty lazy and don’t extensively search but correct me if I’m wrong, good music is hard to find, especially with my weird taste. I tend to gravitate towards hip hop/rap because I was raised on it, occasionally wandering to a different genre but never diving too deep. Some of the main artists I listen to are Kendrick Lamar, Earl Sweatshirt, Chance the Rapper, Isaiah Rashad, Schoolboy Q, J Cole, MFDoom, Kid Cudi,  Joey Badass, Nas, Ghostface Killah, Mac Miller, Mac Demarco, Tame Impala, Lupe Fiasco, Gangstarr, Jack Johnson, and Bob Marley. I’d like to expand my horizons so I’m asking if you people of reddit could comment your top 3 favorite artists with your top 5 favorite songs by them and I’ll be sure to check them out! I’ll give you guys an example.

23,"Hello everyone, I just read a 'not to self' I left couple of weeks ago. As most of these things it seems quite stupid now, but at the same time I am a bit worried because I actually wrote it so I was feeling completely out of it. I wonder what would you think about it. Is it just a tired student cry?

I am leaving grammar and formatting as in original 'spit-out' manner.


Did you ever feel good about yourself? I think I did. Like 2 weeks ago maybe. Or even several days ago when I got marks for couple of coursework pieces and our navigation algorithm proved to work on a real drone as well as a simulation. Hell yeah I felt great about myself...or didn't I? Did I deserve to feel this way? Is it destructive to feel this way? Or did I know that feeling was not earned since these marks don't matter this much. Am I that demoralised because I couldn't find a year placement? Any placement? Am I good enough for anything? Why does writing this is making me hot and desperate? Is this what a panic attack is? Nah it's not panic. I am just scared. That fear bastard...or is it the reality? Is it me finally understanding I am not going anywhere? Is it a time when I go and read all those motivational and self-improving, efficiency and effectiveness, tools of titans and success stories books? When I start good habbits like gym and taking better care of my skin, talking to more people, read more news to make meaningful conversations and ALL THIS IS JUST TO RAN AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT i AM NOT WHO i AM TRYING TO BE AND NEVER WILL BE? It is not a low point, that is a peak. These thoughts are destructive because look at all these people achieving and improving no matter what, but what about all those who don't? Is it the realisation that I have reached my cap? Not because of the external reasons or genetics, but because I just don't try hard enough? Don't want it enough? Am I 'the bounded' middle-class manager who is happy to have his beer and his netflix? Is it where I am actually capped? Because it seems to me that is all I want right now. 
It seems so easy to just fucking open the MatLab and do the bloody lab but it's so hard. Is it because I don't see the point? I couldn't find a placement, I feel like I am worthless because of it? What am I going to do? 

I guess I'll keep pretending I am totally cool. I used to get angry at myself and hurt myself. I hated it. But now I don't feel a shit.  I am not angry, I don't want to blow up and brake my own jaw as it used to be, I am not sad. I feel nothing. I don't care about anyone. I don't want anyone to care about me. I want to be in a vacuum. A vacuum full of self-pity and hatred. But I don't feel pity. I don't have hatred. I believe there are people who care about me and they want me to care about them but I don't. And I don't want them to think I do, I make it clear I don't. I think I am in my socially most successfull years and I never was that lone. I don't suffer though, so what's the point anyway. 

Is this all just a guilt-whining trip because I've been hugely unproductive lately? Is it doublethinking? Triplethinking? Do I hope somebody reads it and saves me? Do I hope somebody reads it and gets lost? Do I know what hope is? Can anybody know? Is it a way of going off the rails of the original train of thought?

Which is kinda strange for me because I am not looking to have sex with men and I'm not physically attracted to men. I think some men are good looking, but not attractive to me anyways. This started about 2 months ago when I started remembering about being sexually assaulted when I was 18. It was by someone I was supposed to look up to as a mentor. I hated being in those situations. Something in my mind said ""you're gay because you didn't stop it"", and now everyday my mind says I'm gay. I don't want to tell my wife and have her think the wrong thing.

25,"My girlfriend and I rescued a cat from a shelter ~3 years ago. I love this cat; she can be very kind and affectionate sometimes but keeping her is starting to take a great toll on me.

She has not been an easy cat to deal with. The shelter told us she was 6 years younger than she actually was (15, not 9) according to the vet, and with her age came a slew of issues. 

Firstly, the cat hates closed doors and will meow **all night**. This is not an exaggeration. She may take ten to fifteen minute breaks to lay down every now and again, but goes right back to screaming at the bedroom door. You may be thinking: why not just let her into the bedroom at night?

The cat shits on the floor. Every day, multiple times a day. I'd let her in the bedroom at night but she will shit in there. She used the litter box consistently for the first few months then just stopped. The vet said her arthritis could be a factor so she is on medication for her pain. 
I've tried everything. Multiple litter boxes, different kinds of litter, covered litter boxes, easy access litter boxes, different litter box locations, changing the litter as often as possible, but she insists on shitting on the floor. The worst part is that she smears it into the floor or carpet after she's done like she's burying it, but there's no litter to bury. Cleaning is getting increasingly frequent and difficult and I'm scared that my floors will be ruined beyond what they already are, and the stench is awful. I don't want my house to be like some animal hoarder house with shit on the floor all the time.... Constantly picking up shit off the floor every day is draining me.

I believe the cat's behavior is partly explained by her dementia and Alzheimer's but I'm at the end of my rope. I don't want to surrender her because I love her and I've cared for her all these years but I don't know if I can anymore. And I'm worried she'll be killed because she is so old and people likely wouldn't adopt her, never mind the behavioral issues. (In addition to chronic floor pooping, she is a biter, screams all night and rips up carpet despite 4 scratching posts available to her) 

We have another cat, a 6mo kitten. The kitten uses the litter box consistently and has never had an accident.

I don't know what to do. My home is becoming filthy and destroyed by her and I don't know if my rental, my psyche and my time can handle it much longer. I feel guilty for not being a good enough cat owner and I feel like a villain to my gf who adores the cat. ",10Mar2018,6

I have a lot symptoms of being depressed, yet, I think I might be happier than I've ever been and in position that I like being. I feel a lot that I'm in charge with my life and and I can choose what I do instead of the pressure of being obligated to do things. I feel very **free.**


I don't go out much. I play on my computer a lot, excessive amounts. My apartment is a mess most of the times. Most of my dishes sit in the sink for week. I study in uni, but I'm so lazy even though I have very little amount of studies left till I should graduate, and I've already postponed my studies with a year. I sleep till evenings, don't care about many things. I don't pursue any career, I'm not interested in anything particular in life. I don't find much enjoyment in things that I do, I just do them to pass the time. 


I'm in a very good physical condition, I go to the gym about 3-5 times a week, it varies. 


I enjoy interacting with people a lot, but I'm very inwards person, so I guess I'm inward oriented extrovert.

I've been wandering the streets looking for someone to protect, because you know, it sounds like a nice way to spend your life.
Most people aren't interested in having a protector, some people just like to go at it alone, some don't want to be held back by someone in a suit of armor. That's fine

A few months ago though, I came across someone who really seemed like she could use my help, and she seemed like the kind I'd be happy to dedicate my life to. It seemed ideal..

She stuck a single flower in a notch in my armor, and walked away

It was a beautiful flower, and a lovely sentiment

And for a while, I walked around and looked over at the flower, it reminded me of her

But also, it reminded me of the help she needed, and the potential we had.

Moreover, it didn't really fit with the aesthetic of my suit. It was at an awkward angle, almost upside down, and the stem poked through my suit and aggravated my skin

So I followed after her

And asked her to take the flower from me, for it would be much lovelier if she were to hold it for me by my side

But she refused

And so, we parted ways again. And for a few months, the flower remained

The sentiment was still as beautiful as it had always been, the flower never wilted

In fact it seemed at times to grow of it's own accord

On a whim, I returned to the place where we first met, and came across her again. And she placed a second flower through my suit, right next to the first

And parted ways again

This was about as confusing to me as you might expect
And the two flowers, now twice as aggravating as before

So I returned to her again, ready to ask the same question I offered her before, but I saw in her eyes that she did not want to hear it

And so I reached over and removed the two flowers myself, gave them to her, and thanked her for them

And then I walked away

And from behind me, I heard an angry shout

She was angry, most of all, that I had assumed her disinterest

And so I walked back to her, kneeled before her, and asked her once again to hold the flowers at my side

In response, she pushed the flowers back through my suit and cut off their heads, leaving only two stems

And then she was gone

I quietly removed the stems once more, left them on the ground, and walked away

A year gap, then another minimum wage gig for a few months, and then 6 years of nothing. How do I apply to jobs now? Is there anywhere I can go that will help me write resumes/fill out apps/something?

**Long version + Vent maybe?:**

It's all mental health related. I don't have high expectations, here. I was thinking doing more minimum wage junk. I've pretty much accepted I'll never amount to anything employment-wise. I've been living off disability, but I've managed to make everything work ok from basically being a frugal jerk. I completely own my own house and am currently debt-free. I've been active in mental health services since I got out of the Navy and I think I'm doing good enough to start trying to maybe get a job again, but I'm psyching myself out because... Who would hire me? How the fuck do I even apply to shit? I don't even know if I can handle a job??

I wanted something really easy, low expectations. I don't need a full-time job, not even a part-time job, something as little as $60/mo would be great. So I looked at online stay-at-home mom type junk and I can't do any of them because I have satellite internet. I live in a small rust belt rural town so can't really do many of the ""kid"" jobs either like yard work or pet sitting. I thought maybe I'd apply to mcdonalds or something and maybe they'd hire me by virtue of the fact that simply nobody else is applying, but I don't know. I'm afraid of failure.

I feel like I need some hand holding on this but I don't know where to go or who to ask. My therapist hasn't really been of much help with the practical solutions. She just talks about feelings and shit. I mean, it does help my mental health, but it doesn't help my lifestyle, which frankly sucks. I have no social life because I have no extra money, so I'm just looking for some extra bucks every so often so maybe I can afford gas to drive out to the more populated areas to meet up with people and talk or something.
