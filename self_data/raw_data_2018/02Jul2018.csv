0,"Today driving around in my small town I recognized lots of high school classmates passing me on the road. We graduated last year and it's our first summer home from college.

It's pretty weird thinking how we all graduated, then left for 9 months in completely different places and situations for college. It's like we were all pretty much the same when we graduated, and now this summer we are made of completely new and unique experiences. No two of us had an identical experience. We've all been through our separate first years of college and now we're all back home as if we never left. 

I just thought it was kind of cool and comforting to know that my old classmates probably find comfort in being back in our hometown too. Has anyone else ever felt like this/noticed this before? It makes me pretty nostalgic for high school. ",02Jul2018,1
1,"I guess I just need to vent.

This is stupid, I know, but I just took a huge slash at my self esteem. 

I'm not fat, but I'm also not skinny. I'm very thick, meaning my waist is a lot smaller than everything else and nearly flat but not quite. I exercise a lot. I weight lift, jog, and do something similar to the training to get into the circus. So there's not much more I can do to change my body other than just lose this last bit of fat, which I'm actively trying to do. But to change the ratio of where my fat is, I'd either have to starve myself or get under the knife. My body just isn't naturally made as a skinny body. Even as a little kid, my butt was the biggest part of me and it hasn't changed.

Well I'll just say I posted in a forum for nude body positivity and another, very skinny woman posted in the same forum. This woman had everything I've always wanted: a smaller chest (probably an A or B cup), a completely flat stomach, a thigh gap with flatter hips, back dimples, and she was white. Her proportions were a lot less... dramatic I guess, than mine but she seemed very naturally slender. And she got likes out the wazoo, while I got barely anything. A couple likes and even fewer, lackluster comments and we posted around the same time with very similar styles of pictures.

I guess it's just that I was just finally starting to get comfortable with my body and accepting that I can never look like that, and starting to love myself and seeing that just brought me back to reality I guess... I've always, for as long as I can remember, wanted to be skinny like that. But my actual body frame isn't that tiny. If I tried to get down to her weight, I would look like skin and bones.

I guess I just wanted to vent this somewhere. It's not like I can tell any of my friends or anything. Now I just feel like I hate myself all over again because what I was trying to convince myself that that's not really true... But the majority of men are always going to prefer a woman like that over me.

Sorry to whine or whatever, I'm just feeling pretty low right now",02Jul2018,1
2,"Hey, I am a 20 year old female from germany and two days ago after a long odyssey, my painful search came to an end.

When I was 18 and my life went just perfect, I would soon start attending an art college, friends were great, I felt great.
Then small symptoms started, in the matter of weeks I was bedridden.

My mother didn't believe me and the doctors either sent me home saying I just had a stomach bug or claimed I had an eating disorder, I went grom doc to doc, hospital to hospital.

Nobody found anything and none believed me, not even my mother, while I was slowly wasting away as my condition got increasingly worse.

Over and over people claimed it was just anxiety or an eating disorder or gluten intolerance... at home everyone dismissed my pain and symptoms as being my imagibation and thus ignored me whenever I mentioned me feeling bad or falling down due to dizzyness, screaming because of cramps... nothing moved them to care.

I was ready to face death a few weeks ago, my body aches, I can't do anything or eat and I had no hope for the future with nobody knowing what's wrong. I am nauseaus and thus miserable all day, I didn't want to keep living that way.


I kept posting on reddit and on other websites about it, hoping someone stumbles upon it who might have an idea.

And a few weeks ago, one reddit user pointed one condition out I never heard of before, it is very rare, SMA syndrome.

The symptoms matched perfectly, so I talked to my doctor about it anf he sent me to get an MRI/A.

While the radiologist had no clue what to look for, I took matters into my own hands and looked at them, asking for nore opinions and the pictures fit.

My father finally believed me and took me out of the shithole my mother let me rot in, he has been incredibly supportive ever since.

I joined a group of other people with such diseases and they begged me to visit a doctor here in germany who is known to be incredible about these diseases and is internationally known for diagnosing and treating them.


We travelled there and he spent 3 hours looking at my abdomen with ultrasound.

I was diagnosed with severe nutcracker syndrome, MALS/Dunbar Syndrome, pelvic congestion syndrome, may thurner syndrome and a possible borna virus infection.

They also cause the breathing problems I have since I was 12 which nobody found the cause for, aswell as abnormally painful menstrual pains  and a strangely shaped back.


I still have a long way ahead of me, surgery will be rough and take some time to heal, but I want nothing more than to finally escape this misery, I am glad that I made it this far, even just weighing 38kg.

I honestly still cannot believe it..  it feels surreal and far away, it's like I am somehow still stuck in the past. 


But guys... I cannot describe how I feel...  if I could I would just hug all of you, I got my hope and future back... even if I still have a hard time actually believing it. I keep expecting the doc to call and tell me that is was all a misunderstanding or something like that.


I hope you guys have a great day, too!

But I live in Stockbridge GA and no film schools out here so I been looking at schools in other states. Holy shit they are expensive. So for the past six months, I have been looking for jobs two days ago I had an interview with Chillis. They told me they might call me and for fuck sake, I hope they do. Anyone who lives in Stockbridge knows jobs are hard to come by. I can tell my godmom is getting fed up and if I don't find something I can't blame her for putting my ass on street. Also, its been a while since I talked to someone  I feel lonely I mean I talked to my close friend on ps4 the other day but I talking about new people or a girl IDK its hard.

5,"I’ve talked my friends ears off about this girl, but I still have so much to say about her. We texted for about a week, we really hit it off and decided to meet up last night and I’ve never felt this much joy and happiness out of a first date, it was like I was in a movie or something. I remember holding her hand and just starring at us holding hands and thinking of how overwhelmingly happy I was to be in this moment with her, and after the first kiss it was like no happiness I’ve ever felt, just pure, chest clenching happiness. I’ve never been so fascinated with the way a girl talked, it was like every time she talked or laughed, it was like hearing your favorite song preformed live. She’s so genuine and so sweet. I’m scared but I’m so excited to feel this way about someone, especially her.",02Jul2018,4

8,"22M here. Just need to unload some emotions for a minute.

My girlfriend if 3.5 years left me back in October. A lot has happened in my life since then, all for the better, but damn do I still get down on myself all the time.

I just graduated, and all this year I told myself how great summer would be. The breakup was just another added stress that oiled up on top of me with school, and the only thought that kept me going was that come June I would be at home with no schoolwork and could finally have some R&amp;R to recover.

But now that I'm home I can't help but long for the days I was at school. Surrounded by friends and homework to keepy mind of my loneliness. Being in the same town as her feels weird, and I sit here an anxious mess for when I see her when I'm grocery shopping or grabbing a cup of coffee one morning.

I know with every fiber in my being that she was wrong for me. Our relationship lasted three years longer than it should have. She was a shitty person, and yet I can help but miss her with every ounce of my emotions.

Why? Why do I miss someone that was so wrong for me on so many levels? Is it the emotional connection with another human being that I miss? Is it physical contact, which I've never experienced with another person since her? Is it the comfort that came with a relationship of that length? The fact that I knew every thing about her personality, and vice versa?

Whenever I think of her or see her in social media, it's like a knife in my heart. Even to this day, almost 9 months after it ended I feel like this. I saw her on a mutual friends Instagram story and it made my heartbeat skip a beat. Just seeing her brought me so much pain. 

Why.",02Jul2018,1
9,"I've graduated high school. holy shit it was bad for me. I know some people say it's the best years of your life and others say things get better eventually, but I'm praying the latter is true even though I lost hope a while ago. I didn't go to prom. I wouldn't have gone to grad but my parents wouldn't have let me skip it. i just wanted to get out and forget that place and those people.

I don't know if I'll start to feel like I belong in the future. I don't know if I'll stop being a lonely loser. I don't know if I'll get a solid job and live a comfortable life. I don't know if I'll ever lose my virginity. I don't know if I'll stop wanting to die. But I know i'm one step closer to finding out. Also I'm pretty glad I don't have to wear a uniform anymore.

And one more thing, happy Canada day!",02Jul2018,4
11,"Good evening reddit, here goes nothing :/

My life has been pretty shit socially/academically up to very recently. I had a really fake friend and did terribly in school, overall lacked motivation (everyone says say I’m smart but don’t do shit). Then I met a group of friends (including my crush). I suddenly had an ‘awakening’ of sorts, and realized my life was a fuck-up (I have a dream of being a programmer, something I’m good at). I got depressed about possibly getting held back, only time I’ve ever felt borderline suicidal (poorly thought-out teenage angst). My crush managed to pull me out of it, at the price of being brutally friend zoned. and when we got our report cards, I had somehow passed every class, with only one class below the 70s. A very thoughtful teacher noticed I was genuinely interested in changing the course of my academics, so he’s agreed to help me out during the summer and prepare for next year. First day of summer vacation; I was bored and checking around the internet when I found the EVE Online Launcher in my applications folder. I had downloaded it a few months ago but the tutorial bored me out of my mind, and I reached some weird glitch that didn’t get me past the ‘Redeem Items’ part. I, being bored, decided to launch it, made a new Gallante character and start playing.

Case in point; I’ve spent the past week playing 14-16 hours of EVE daily. I’ve tried AFK mining and studying but the distraction is potent, even if I’m just staring out into the atmospheric EVE ambient with music, for HOURS. I’m pretty worried about getting obsessed, I’m trying to do better in school and I don’t want to unwind my motivation/will surge in an MMORPG (my first, surprisingly). I’ve been telling my parents that I’ve been studying, and I’ve been feeling guilty as hell over not doing so. I’ve even gotten to the point of staying up hours after playing EVE to study, (I log off at 10). I’m worried that it spills into my next school year, thus fucking up the promises I made to everyone relevant in my life.

12,"I’m in high school, today me and my mom were watching Queer Eye together. See here’s the thing, they are okay with other people being gay, but not me. I accidentally said out loud “Hey mom how would you feel about me being married to a girl?” Big mistake.

I got blasted, it made my heart hurt, I just wish for once they would accept me. Everyday I wish I was normal. I just want to accept myself. 

When I move out I’m cutting my ties with them. 

But I’ll miss my mom strong arms wrapped around, giving me hugs. I’ll miss her kisses. I’m crying is hard, I just wish homophobes didn’t exist. I just wish I wasn’t alive. I wish I wasn’t gay.

My OCD has improved drastically, and my mind doesn't loop and twirl  nonsensically and invent fears anymore. It's so great to exist in the present without constant anxiety. 

I am way more social now than I was a year ago. I actually look forward to talking to people now. I feel much better about myself and my life and my future.

It's crazy to think that the reason for so many years of dark depression was that my brain didn't have enough of a chemical. I know that many people have bad experiences with antidepressants, but for some reason it has worked quite well for me. Or it could be a placebo and I've tricked myself into happiness, either way works for me.

18,"I come from a family where literally everyone is obese. Grandparents, parents, siblings, extended family etc. so here are a few reasons getting healthy sucks. They’re in order from matters less to matters more (top to bottom) 

- I get constant hate from family. Every chance they get they use it to put me down. Eh who cares tho that just means I’m doing something right 

- it’s kinda difficult.. I live with my parents and they constantly are feeding us trash plus there’s the genetics thing.. 

- main reason: it’s constant anxiety/curiosity over what I look like. 

Okay so elaborating on that last one. From the beginning I had 2 things going against me which were: a lot of fat &amp; weak. My metabolism has always been kinda slow so losing weight had been harder for me and since I was really weak aka no muscle it was mostly all fat. 

Recently I started weightlifting so I’ve been getting to a “normal” place muscle wise. I still have a long way to go on losing fat weight though. My fat percent is anywhere from 15-21% so I can’t fully see all the “muscle” under  and my family has a huge history of just problems health wise and I’ve always been scared I guess of having some deformities considering I already have flared ribs. So wondering what tf I look like under all the fat is kinda giving me anxiety and as I work out more I start getting more and more anxiety since I’m starting to see a little muscle under the fat idk just ranting at this point lmao 

But hey, everyone said I couldn’t lose weight and if I tried to I’d fail at it and I’m by far the healthiest of everyone in the family :) they hate me for it but eh no one gives a fuck :) so yeah.. pretty proud of myself for doing that ",02Jul2018,1

25,"People don't do the things they want to, don't say the things they want to say, are ashamed of who they are, are so afraid of upsetting others, but in the end what is the result of that? It does not make you happier, or more fulfilled. The further you are from the things that scare you, the more you will be afraid of that thing. The longer you hide from yourself and what you want, the scarier it becomes to be who you are, especially around others. Do this for long enough and you wont even be able to remember what actually fills you with self-love and what it is that makes you, you. 

Until you are so far separated from what truly fulfills you that you become complacent about it. It becomes less and less important to yourself, when in reality it is the most fulfilling and gratifying feeling to embrace yourself regardless of what surrounds you. ",02Jul2018,2

I live in Amsterdam where the people (and I thought my parents) are pretty open minded. First gay rights multi cultural society and etc. I thought that this summer would be the perfect time to tell my parents that I’m not religious anymore, I already knew the setting and where I would tell them and how I bring it to them. I wanted to get this of my chest because i kept it secret since I was 16. There strong believers of Islam and due to this I was a little bit frightened bcs I read on a couple subs parents freak the fuck out because of this. 

Fast forward to the weekend before (Saturday) my dad found out that I was subscribed to the ex muslims and other non Islam subs on reddit he read all my posts and comments there and went full anger mode. He grabbed some stuf and my pc and sold it on an Dutch version like eBay and kept the money as punishment (I paid it on my own) they screamed and yelled to me i was going to hell and that God doesn’t forget. That night after. I cried like a kid as never before (I fucking never cry) and didn’t know what to do. The summer was coming and I would have to face them all the time then until yesterday I went for a morning walk to not see them at breakfast but when I came home the doors where locked and all my clothes where thrown on the front door. My own mother screamed to me  that I wasn’t welcome anymore and never should come back. She threw Everything in my room that was breakable and then threw me my stached saved money and other important things like my passport. I cried the whole fucking time and said i was sorry and telling them to open the door, I stayed on the front door from 8 in the morning to fuckinging  11 in the evening and no one opend. I then went to th local grocery store and paid for a plastic bag and some food. I picked up my clothes and some important stuff on the ground. I prayed that the shack wasn’t closed and luckily could pick up some stored Diploma’s and certificates of mine. I’m now staying at a friends house where I can keep my shit together for the week but he made clear I then must go. 

I’m going in September to a university for comp science but have till then no home nor a job. I have saved enough to rent an Airbnb for 2 weeks by then idk I’m now just solving bug bounty programs but the payments are coming late.

43,"So I just turned 25 a few months ago and I moved to a new city on my own. My best friends live back in my old city and I don’t really have many friends here apart from a few people I work with. I’m still trying to make new friends here.

I’m tall I go to the gym and I’m in good shape and I’m decent looking. Don’t mean to sound arrogant just being honest about my situation. 

All my friends are in commited relationships and aren’t really interested in going out to bars. I’m also at that point in life where I want a girlfriend  with me because I’m starting to get a bit lonely. I also live on my own.

Anyway i do everything I can to fix my situation. I go on Tinder and Bumble but it’s an absolute joke. Most girls don’t reply. Or they message me first on Bumble and then never reply. Or they talk but never intend on actually meeting. It seems like a lot of women on Tinder/Bumble just want to play games. 

And if I ever finally date a girl they tell me after the date that I’m a nice guy but they don’t want to see me again. This sometimes happens after we have even made out on the date. Or this one girl I was seeing for a few dates and  it was going really well but then she eventually just stopped texting me.

By the way this was a woman who I honestly thought I was lowering my standards a bit for. Not trying to sound mean or anything just being honest. Does this happen because women have way too many options?

I feel like the only type of women I could actually get with aren’t attractive to me at all. Should I just start looking in different areas for a girlfriend? I’m not sure if it’s where I live that is causing the issue. 

I actually have met a couple women overseas when i went travelling and I message them a lot. But I’m not sure if pursuing them is worth it because they live in a different country. Do you guys think it’s worth it to try that?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated

Thanks",02Jul2018,2
44,"Growing up, I was bullied on how I look and I took it hard upon myself. I was a fat kid growing up and didn’t understand why and how I suddenly became big. It didn’t help that my parents didn’t help me with through the bullying ordeal or maybe even through with the whole process as they too would add insult to the injury during my formative and adolescent years. 

Because of that, I turned to the power of intelligence as a defense mechanism. Back in high school, I realized that people will make less fun of you and give you more respect if they know that you are smart. This proved effective to me for as it made up for the insecurities and gave me much more respect for myself. People don’t just randomly pick on me because having a huge intellectual capacity in our society means that you are bound to be successful in life. However, not everything turned out for the good. As I was nurturing my self-earned status, I developed a prideful mentality driven by my insecurities. I used to think that everyone who doesn’t do well in school are automatically doomed to fail or they are most likely to be a failed member of society. On top of that, I made sure that my intellect was recognize by other people because I thought that made me a much more interesting person.

Fast forward to uni, everything made a complete 360. I guess I would say that I was enlightened or maybe I got out of my own bubble. It was a liberating experience, especially not being able to carry the burden of having a bad prejudice on people who I thought wasn’t on the same intellectual level as me. However, things didn’t just slide on smoothly. You see, my parents rode on the intellectual success that I had back in high school as to redeem themselves of their social status. This resulted into them wanting me go to medicine so that I could “project the image of a successful and good member of the society”. At that time, I didn’t mind since I really didn’t know what degree to take. I just had them dictate to me how I should choose my future since I thought it was easier that way. 

Now that I know and understand myself better, I want to pursue the opposite of what my parents want me to do. I told them my plans and they didn’t take things well. They still want me to go to medicine although not saying it to me directly. Rather, they would guilt me into thinking that I won’t become happy and fulfilled in life because I won’t be rich or successful. 

And now I’m stuck in between worlds. I cannot move on and be where I want to be because I don’t want people knowing that I’m slowly becoming a failure (this maybe brought upon the intellectual pride that I still carry and having a hard time to let go) and I’m too scared to make a change. As of now, I don’t have any resolve. ",02Jul2018,8
45,"I'm writing this for a girlfriend of mine who does not use reddit and needs some serious advice. Her name is Emma. She's a fun, vivid person and is pretty open about her sex life and relationships.   
Yesterday we (8 people) went to a friend's house, had some predrinks and eventually went to the club. With us, was Emma's best friend, James. James is rather a shy and fragile person. He's good fun but he suffers from depression and anxiety. It's been roughly 1-2 years since he sees a therapist and since he'd been doing that, he was feeling better and slightly more confident. What I (the writer, not Emma) learned yesterday, is that he stopped seeing his therapist 1-2 months ago and also quit his hobbies.   


Anyway, we were all out in the club and everybody was having a good time, or at least pretending to enjoy the evening. In the course of the evening, Emma and another guy who was with us (who we met the first time yesterday) were dancing together and eventually started kissing and stuff. From that point on, we noticed James' change in behaviour. He stopped dancing and moving all the way and looked kinda frightened. He wasn't feeling good at all. From there on, things happened quickly and I'm not sure who told me what part. Thing is : James was having a panic attack. The reason? He saw his best friend Emma kissing some other guy who we all knew for like 3-4h. When we were walking home, Emma finally told me everything. James is in love with her since quite some time and he feels like shit everytime he sees her best friend showing affection to somebody but him...   


Emma is in a shitty situation since she does not love him back and she made it clear several times, even though they've been best friends for about 5-6 years. She can't tell him straight away since we all are pretty sure that he will be absolutely destroyed when he learns the truth that way. On the other side, she is afraid to go out with all of us any more because she can’t get close to someone without feeling guilty or without his best friend having a panic attack (or even worse perhaps).",02Jul2018,5
46,"I’ve been watching a lot of “let’s make a deal” and “price is right” recently, and what I’ve noticed is that there seems to be a very disproportionate amount of black contestants when compared to the national ratio of black to white citizens. The census shows that US citizens are 62% white and 13% black. On the game shows it seems to be around a 1:1 ratio. I was wondering if they use some type of affirmative action when selecting contestants or if black people are more likely to apply to be on these shows?

Got home from work the next day to find out my brother was paranoid that he was going to get arrested because he could smell weed. This essentially has fractured the family and I am being treated like I stabbed someone.

49,"Tokyo Ghoul is on its final chapter and everyone is laping it up like it's the greatest thing ever.

Now don't get me wrong, the first series had some masterful writing and illustration. It did itself a lot of poetic justice. It had a strong impact on my life and outlooks; the main character having a near constant self-sacrificial death wish spoke to me, check my post history and you'll see I even have tattoos inspired by the series.

This sequel series however, dear god did it saturate the character count, the illustration quality went downhill (fight scenes in the latter half were all drafting quality scratch works), and the latter half of the story ran around in a circle. The ending, after years of build, is extremely rushed, Bleach-tier asspulls (character revivals everywhere; once great scenes of sacrifice and ultimatums get trashed for fanservice)

But again, the fanbase will crucify you should you raise any of these points.

Should you be interested in picking up the series, please only read up to the end of the first series and completely ignore ;re. I cannot reiterate enough how great the first half is, it's a true tragedy story on par with works of Shakespeare and sticks to the framework it layed down from chapter one.",02Jul2018,2

It bothers me because I feel like most of my life until that point I was pretty driven and directed my life by things I was passionate about (sports, friends, traveling, different academic pursuits.) A year ago I moved to a small town and while I have friends and don't hate life, I'm pretty hedonistic and it feels shallow.

55,"I really just need to put this where many people I know won't see it. Whatever. I'm venting and I'm angry. 

I'm so incredibly fucking exhausted, annoyed, tired, and removed from my ex. We dated for a whole year and so much of that was spent with me worrying about him, where he is, who he's with, and caring about someone who never gave me any of that decency. When I told him I was doing anything it was like he never gave a shit about me. Long distance sucks right? Imagine that but you invest all this effort, love, time, and money towards someone who rarely gives you what you want. Imagine being so full of ridiculous and unjustified unconditional love. Might as well include unrequited there. 

And after we go on break, my love really fucking fades. I realize that I deserved so much better throughout the whole relationship and even after two or three visits between us and a whole road trip later, I just feel like he never tried to make me truly happy and only did it to fuel his ego and only cared or listened when it was convenient for him because he ""knows more, lives on his own, and has his own life."" After all the pushing me away when I tried to get close to him both physically and mentally and after all the crying I did over it? After feeling like a pathetic piece of shit when I had to ASK for you to tell me that you cared or loved me? Motherfucker, what? 

After we ACTUALLY break up, maybe a few days after he posted a video of himself jacking off to someone else on a porn sub and telling me it didn't mean anything ***DESPITE STILL BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ME***, I had enough. I don't want anything to do with this asshole romantically. I was tired of excuses and manipulation and false promises. Weeks later he suddenly fucking wants me back after the realization slaps him in the face. After a whole goddamn year. What makes you think I wanna get back with someone that's such a fucking liar and a loser? Jesus fucking christ. 

You still want me? You want me to wait a fucking year until I transferred to university and see if I still had those feelings? FUCK OFF HAHA! You're KIDDING me right? A whole year of false promises? I might fuck around and do the exact same thing to you just so you know how it feels, but this time I'm never going to ask for you back. That's evil and I won't do it, but the gross part of me wants to try. I still won't.  

Yeah, I still talked to you afterwards. Yeah, I still sent stuff because I was bored and you were the only person around. Do I feel bad? Not really. I just feel stupid. I shouldn't have done it and I regret showing you any part of me afterwards.

65,"I was the abuser in a shitty, drawn out relationship with someone for the past year. I wanted to get better but I couldn't. I wouldn't listen in time and drove her away from me by being incredibly distant and dismissive of her love for me. I might have cared for her, but I never showed her.

Our first week together was magical. I still think back to that time fondly and wish I could return to it. But I had lied to her, I was still dating someone in a different state, and didn't break it off like I should have. They found out through an Instagram post. After that I put up a wall with my new relationship due to the circumstances. I used that as an excuse to show no emotion and belittle her problems for the better part of a year.

We cut it off two weeks ago, and around the same time a housemate of mine brought home a boy who was treating her in much the same way I had treated my ex. He was conniving, cold, and only sought to preserve his own feelings over hers. His cold eyes were like a mirror.

I realized what I had done to my ex, and longed for another chance. She had already given me so many, and I wanted another, to show her I was better, and realized what I had done wrong. It was too late. I pushed her away.

A few weeks prior to breaking up, I had a moment of self-loathing where I suggested that she be with my close friend instead. I said he was more caring and similar to her. They'd be a good match. I regretted that as soon as I said it but it was too late. Yesterday I found out she had slept with him three separate times.

I was blindsided, but I really shouldn't have been.

You see, I did not communicate to her how strongly I still feel for her. We fooled around on snapchat a few times and assumed it was mutual but she just wanted to get off those nights. I hadn't realized she was done with me. Seeing her with my friend let that sink in, and.... it destroyed me.

I had been so shitty for so long I don't blame her. I wanted to turn around and be the person I was when we first met and I didn't make excuses. I wanted to meet up, make dinner with her again, hold her hand and go to IKEA, go skinny dipping in my pool again. But I can't do that again. I had my chances and blew it..

I don't know how long it will take me to move on. I still talk to her, and I'm trying to give her the space she needs right now. I'm holding on to the hope that when she transfers schools to Missouri next year we can rekindle this. I'm not making that my goal, and I'm sure I'll move on before then, since that's just how life is.

Right now though, all I want is to start over with her, be honest from the start, and not shut her out of my life because I got absorbed with college life.

I'm doing better now. It might seem like I'm trying to be better for her, but I want to improve for myself. I have a history of treating relationships like that, and I'm done with it. Whether we get back together in the future, I find another person, or maybe I don't, I still want to be the most loving, caring person I can be. I don't want my eyes to be dead like that man's.

So just a preface... My cat, Dexter is a 4 year old sweetheart. We found him in the dumpster at my parents family business when he was about 8 weeks old. No clue where he came from or how he got there. We took him home and he's been so good. Got along with our now deceased dog, and never caused any problems with scratching furniture or going to the bathroom outside his litter box. When I moved out of my parents' house, I took him with me since he was closer to me than with any other family member. 

Fast forward to one week ago today. Took him in for his yearly checkup and everything came back great! Got blood work done since it had been a while and everything came back exceptionally average; good body weight, (11lbs, 10oz) nothing out of the ordinary with his organs, etc.

He is usually pretty energetic and has no problems getting around my place. However, today, before I was about to leave to meet a buddy of mine, I noticed he was being very un-Dexter-like. He likes to lay on my bed and he responds to my command of ""c'mon bud"" when I'm about to leave, since I usually keep my bedroom door closed when I'm out. He wouldn't get up.

""C'mon Dex.""  Nothing.

""That's strange.""

I pick him up and set him down. He immediately squats like he's about to pee. ""Oh shit."" (I have carpet in my room) 

I pick him up again and carry him to the litter box. Set him down right next to it.. same thing, squats on the hardwood floor, and stays that way for a good minute. Turn him on his back and rub his stomach, usually he hates this, but he was being very nonchalant.

Next 20 minutes or so I'm trading off between trying to get him to walk and rubbing his belly. ""Something is definitely not right"" I thought.

Call my vet and explain what's going on. Thankfully they were able to squeeze me in. Afrer they take him in the back and do what they do, they come in the room and say they have to act quickly. His urinary tract is blocked and if not dealt with is fatal. They ask how long he's been like this, I told them I was out of the house nearly all day yesterday and most of this morning and only noticed symptoms as I was about to leave.

They are going to sedate him and try to get a catheter in him but he is going to have to stay there over night. I'm worried. The vet tech told me this is very serious and can be fatal. I'm just hoping I caught it soon enough. 

Stay strong, Dex.",02Jul2018,573
