Married life. Going on 2 years. Husbands job is super stressful. He comes home aggravated almost every night. I try to do little things to make him happy, but they last a whole 5 minutes. Most of the time he seems disappointed in me. 

At least 2 nights a week I like to drink and play video games (just to escape). Husband does not like this finds it to be a toxic habit. Tried doing things around the house (take puppy on a long walk, do laundry, wash dishes before hand so I can feel like ‚ÄúI deserve a small break‚Äù). 

Families is always distressed, husband is always disappointed, work does not have time for me. 

Just learned to let it go.  Kinda of forced myself to not care.

Tickets were booked for 2nd May. The thing is he gave me tickets for yesterday. I checked every detail of the ticket and everything appeared fine. I took a pic of it just in case it got lost. I was really paranoid about keeping the tickets safe. Today morning I got anxious about the tickets and saw them and found out that they gave me a tickets for yesterday (30 April). 

That guy will remember me. I made a positive impression on him. The thing is, he's just an employee. Human beings make mistakes. However that won't give my money back and arguing with him will only spoil his day. Plus he can't give me a refund. In fact the cinema usually doesn't give refunds. 

I need to manipulate the guy and make him feel guilty about this and make the manager feel guilty and empathise with a made up story that I present so that I can get some refund. I want the manager to feel ashamed of himself if he can't give me a refund.

15,"Hi Reddit,

I‚Äôm not sure what I can accomplish in posting this other than I would love some advice as to how to tackle negative thoughts/ paranoia. 

To give a very brief backstory, I have only had a couple of serious relationships in my life ‚Äì one of which I am in at the moment, the last one ended after finding out he had cheated on me repeatedly.

I don‚Äôt doubt that my past experience has influenced my current problem, as I had no trust issues at the time/ no suspicions that anything was wrong and I can‚Äôt understand why someone would behave like that rather than just breaking up. I was gaslighted pretty badly afterwards and now I have this constant fear that I am being cheated on/ going to be left for someone else.

My current partner is everything I‚Äôve ever wanted in a man. He is open and honest even when it‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt necessarily want to hear, but he does have a complicated life. This often leads me to questioning him on things that happen that don‚Äôt necessarily make sense to me, because my life is infinitely simpler by comparison. He takes this as me being suffocating, as he sometimes feels like I‚Äôm ‚Äògrilling‚Äô him. I.e. if he has said that he‚Äôs probably going to do X, but then because of something or other ends up doing Y instead, I will question it whereas he is just of the mindset that his plans changed, and it‚Äôs no big deal (it never even is something that is a big deal either, it‚Äôs just as if I have some sort of compulsion that I want to know vaguely where he is or what he‚Äôs doing).

In my mind, it‚Äôs like I have to make sense out of everything, and I tend to overthink things a lot. To give an example, he has suffered with depression in the past and sometimes would sleep for ~20 hours a day. If I called him during this time and he didn‚Äôt answer (because sleeping) and I didn‚Äôt hear back from him, my mind would immediately jump to the worst conclusions and I would feel so tense/ not be able to focus on anything else until I heard from him, even though deep down I would know it was probably just that he was sleeping, although it did take me a while to develop this ‚Äòsense‚Äô of what was likely happening. 

I also think that naturally I just am a cynic. I tend to read things in the worst possible way and this too annoys my partner as he wants me to be positive and upbeat ‚Äì he has said before that even when he compliments me it‚Äôs like I take it in the worst way or read something else into it. Thinking on it I do do this, and I want to change. 

My natural inclination is to question things that happen, which over the long period of time that we have been together I think has worn him down. I don‚Äôt want to have such an obsessive mindset over things, and I want to be in more of a positive place mentally. He has suggested therapy before but said, from his experience with it and his reading of me, that a therapist can only do so much and that the change has to come from me. 

To give an example, recently he went to meet some friends in the evening (which he does maybe once every couple of months or so ‚Äì perfectly reasonable) I will make comments whilst he‚Äôs getting ready like ‚Äòoh you look nice‚Äô meant as a compliment but in my mind I definitely have an undertone of ‚Äòwell who are you getting dressed up for‚Äô which he picks up on and gets upset. I know this is a ridiculous thing to think, obviously if you have a group of friends you meet only every few months or so you‚Äôd want to look nice but I just overthink things. I think I do it to try and get more details of who he‚Äôs meeting even though I don‚Äôt know them (a group of people he went to school with) ‚Äì if he mentions that he‚Äôs not sure exactly who will be there because not everyone responded in the messages but that he thinks X Y and Z are going, and one of them is a girl who he has maybe mentioned at some point previously, I will make some stupid comment like ‚Äòoh the Z who used to fancy you??‚Äô even if it‚Äôs just someone else with the same name. He finds it so draining and takes it that I have no trust in him. I do trust him, and don‚Äôt think he has/ would cheat on me, but I guess it‚Äôs almost like I like the reassurance in some way? I don‚Äôt know, thinking on it it is a bizarre line of thinking.  

We are at a point where I would want to be getting engaged soon, but I think instead it is now crunch time in that either I change my behaviour (which I want to do anyway ‚Äì I‚Äôm tired of being so pessimistic) and we take the next step, or we have to part ways as he can‚Äôt deal with when I get in moods etc anymore. If it were me reading posts on here of some of the things I question him on, I would think the person was mega suffocating, and I have realised in time that this is what I‚Äôm doing and I want to change.

Does anyone have any advice as to how to tackle inner negativity? Any personal experiences? 

Tl;dr: a past experience of being cheated on extensively has led to me being a very questioning/ obsessive and negative person which is grinding my current partner down. I want to change so that I no longer spend time questioning things endlessly in my head and become a more positive person. Please help with any advice or anecdotes.

Took a shower today,and my head started to feel heavy because of all the water the hair absorbed.

I tried doing what doggies do (I know I'm a fucking moron) instead of cleaning of my head with a towel and spinning gave me a massive headache that I can't even look at my phone without using read mode and lowest brightness settings turned on..


So any tips?",01May2018,1
17," But of a setup to this.

So, middle of the night/early morning I was chilling, reading some fluff fiction and there's a pounding on my door. My neighborhood is strange, and I do have a few friends that would be the sort to bang like that at three in the morning, so i didn't just assume it would be anything major. Still grabbed a firearm just in case, but tucked it safely away (yay for concealed carry permits).

Anyway, I peek out the peephole to see a woman crying. Now, I know it wasn't me because I didn't know her and she'd therefore never seen me naked (which had been known to cause either tears or laughter). So I figure somethings up.

I open the door and she's sobbing like crazy. Tells me she needs help. Apparently she got beat with a brick by her boyfriend and dumped in the road. I said my neighborhood was weird. Her face was pretty beat, so it wasn't a trick or a scam. Well, if it was, she was really selling it.

I get her sat down, go inside to grab my phone and hit 911. Maybe a minute between me stepping inside, grabbing it and hitting the numbers before I'm back on the front stoop.

She's gone. Nowhere to be seen.

So I'm there trying to explain to 911 why the heck I'm calling and give them that story, more or less in those words, minus my crappy jokes.

Anyway, point being that the operator says they need a description ""was she white, black, Hispanic, or Asian"", then asks about height, clothes, etc. Pretty normal stuff.

But me being me, after the cops show up and ask almost exactly the same things and I give them the same spiel, I'm still worried about the woman. Which means I'm up all night thinking.

So, it hits me what both the operator and the officer asked and how they asked it.

There's some degree of racial tension pretty much everywhere in the U.S. With the history of our country, there's bound to be. And the two ""races"" with the highest tension and the most complex history are the ones referred to by color.

And I'm thinking and running it through my head, it goes for everyone every racial grouping I can recall ever hearing used in a semi official means. Everyone except black and white folks gets referred to by the areas their ancestors came from, or some other ethnic identifier.  Asians, Hispanic/Latinos, native Americans (though they get Indians still, it usually isn't used by cops or city level officials). 

And yeah, black folk get African American as well, but with about the same frequency as black as far as I can recall.

So I think some more. And I start wondering if our language isn't telling us something that we may not realize consciously as a society.

Could it be that the shared history of black and white Americans (even though most of it was pretty dang nasty for the black folk) has made it so that those two groups are somehow more alike than different when compared to other groups?

It sort of makes sense. As much as other groups have influenced American history and culture, the dynamic between whites and blacks has driven more conflict, culture, and social structure than either group by themselves, or any other single group. And it may be fair to say that the two groups combined  pretty much defined what America is.

Which is sort of cool if you ignore the hundreds of years of slavery and oppression.  I mean, what if, after all of that, and all those years, our cultures and language have finally reached a tipping point where even without thinking about it, black and white are finally more alike, more connected than other ethnic/racial groupings. 


I guess the real point is that if we're holding blacks and whites separate from all other groups by using colors as the label, maybe there's a real chance to see some real steps toward true unity between them. Yeah, it sucks that the others are still separate, but maybe that shift in language is just the first step that will lead to a more complete inclusion?",01May2018,2

I feel that I have to say something. The situation around us is just absurd. WE DO NOT WANT TO GO TO WAR. We, the people.  
None of us, the ordinary people, asked for what's going on now. None of us wished to get caught in the middle of a game between power-hunger psychos. We do not wish to kill or get killed. We don't want to lose our homes. The leaders of our countries do not represent our best interest, and unfortunately, we have no influence on what they are doing.  
  
Whether it is Lebanese, Saudis, Russians, Israelis, Iranians, Syrians, Yemens, Jordanians, Turkish - I can safely speak for the vast majority of us saying that we just wish to live our lives quietly, raise our children, go to work, enjoy the weekend, watch Netflix &amp; chill. We do not want war.

NOTE: I‚Äôm not entirely sure if this is the correct place to put this, I just wanted to get this out there somewhere.

So Monday night, my girlfriend texted me, and basically I want to continue being really close friends, I care about you and your family a lot, I just don‚Äôt believe that we‚Äôre gonna workout as a couple. This devastated me, considering we had just gotten our relationship back on track that weekend and even had an (from my perspective) amazing date Sunday. I fell in love with her all over again, and it was great. Monday morning went really well!

I don't know what to tell my doctor or what to do about anxiety/medicine, I think I do have anxiety but I think meds are just as bad. I just need someone to yell at me, or tell me what to do, or something, I don't know what I need ... just some help. Like what do normal adults do when they find themselves like this? What do you personally do to break out of a funk like this? Has anyone else been through something similar? 

Honestly, please give me any thing you've got. I have no friends only my boyfriend and parents, and I cannot bother them because they have much larger problems of their own and I need to be supportive for them not a drain on them.

I just want any advice, reassurance, life lectures, you know whatever might help, I am just so lost, sad, exhausted, and confused. Please help.",01May2018,3
45,"My neighbor just came up and put this thing on our door, and it's celebrating May Day.  The reason I ask is because I think it might actually be passive-aggresive.

Apparently my dad posts on something called Front Porch (I think), that's a neighborhood site for lots of discussion.  And my uncle had mentioned he got into arguments with neighbors about politics.  He just hears what Fox news says and repeats it.

They're very left leaning.  I appreciate their commitment.  All about putting things into action.  They have self-powered lawn mowers, chickens, they collect water from their gutters, and just clearly practice what they preach.  But the thing they put on our door was kind of nice, but quickly thrown together, and had candy, but even like a seashell and a dime in it...

But after reading what it's about I get this feeling she was trying to make a political statement to my dad.  Or am I reading too far into it?",01May2018,2
46,"I don't want to go into to much detail and a discussion whether I should or shouldn't be jealous because that's not the point. I tried talking about it but everyone just says ""get over it"".  I want to get over it but I can't. What can I do to not care so much about that? ",01May2018,2

48,"I haven‚Äôt been that scared/nervous in such a long time. I was almost visibly shaking when I told her. I honestly had no clue how she would react, but she told me she‚Äôs loved me since she met me. I still get nervous/super happy when I think about it.",01May2018,1
49,"I call them every three months and see what promotions are currently on offer. I generally can get them to lower the bill about $15 a month. But they don't tell me that I'm signing a new 12 month contract each time I do, I had to figure that out on my own!",01May2018,1
50,"I‚Äôm in the middle of exam week at my university, and I‚Äôm literally feeling like I‚Äôm going to puke. I have already finished two of the 3 classroom exams, and turned in a paper as part of an exam (worth 60% of my final score) I have two papers still being graded for an education class. I prepared as usual for these exams and I knew the material, but I keep panicking thinking I‚Äôm going to fail everything, lose my scholarships, and let down everyone. 

 I just want to calm down and enjoy my two days off before the next one and I get to go home.",01May2018,3
51,"Suddenly immediately after Israel (America's ally) decides to bomb Iranian defense missiles, suddenly two major news stories throwing dirt to Iran pop up, all of which seem internationally phrased to boil enough blood to start a war.

The first, Iran lost the lawsuit for the 9/11 attacks. This will cause a lot of people to immediately shift the blame of 9/11 onto them, and have a deep negative view on them. The Truth: Saudi Arabia (American ally) was much more heavily influencial towards the attack, they just recieved diplomatic immunity. The lawsuit means nothing, but it's an effect headline to rile up people.

The Second : Iran suddenly after this bombing has potential nuclear weapon programs. This sounds a bit familiar doesn't it? What happened the last time this was used to go to war? (Even against NK) this is an amazing fear tactic to convert your average deep blue conservative to want to war. There is no way another country should have that power!

Please let's not let our governments start a useless war again, many people will die for what cause? Please people when you see news about middle Eastern countries, or about Russia or any one who is not a direct ally of America or whatever country you are from, please do research before demanding blood. We don't need more blood spilled on the eastern sands ",01May2018,1
