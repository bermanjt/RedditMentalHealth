0,".9% of Americans vs 9.3% of Americans. 

So if you think it's preposterous that someone could dare assume your gender wrong, but yet somehow assume they are uneducated, or less so then you, understand the significant difference.

If you are offended that 99.1 percent of the time someone is correct in assuming a gender, you need to re-evaluate. And yes, I am talking to you Fin the man. You should not be so uptight I misgendered you, you are the vast minority. And I apologized and used the correct gender.

2,"Been thinking about this lately. I’m in college and at this time in my life I feel like I’m constantly changing. Who I was at 16 is not the same as 18 or 20. But some patterns or way of thinking, even those I don’t like, are still with me. despite my wishes and efforts. Some that I thought I had overcome are starting to creep back. Some powerful events that changed me are now starting to lose their potency, and I know people who seemed on the verge of changing for the better, only to return to deeply held stubbornness and pride a few months later. 

So given your experience and in the lives of those you know, do you think people can truly change? ",16Oct2018,1

5,"I was recently going to graduate school for my MSW after taking a year off after earning my bachelor's degree. I completed my first semester of grad school and then in the beginning of my second semester I became very sick and was in the hospital, causing me to miss too many days which I then needed to withdraw completely. During my 1 year medical leave I began working full time again and I realized how much happier I felt than when I was in school.  I know in my heart that I will go back to school eventually because this has been my goal/dream for quite some time, I dread going back to school in a few months SO much. My parents have been dropping hints every once in a while and asking ""you're going back to school, right?"", saying that it would be a complete waste of time and money considering they paid for my undergrad. The thing is, I love my job now so much and I absolutely love working full time doing something I both really enjoy and that's related to my field of study. 

This passed year has been the happiest I've felt in a very long time. I've had so much more time to do things for myself, I am much less stressed and depressed, and I am saving much more money than I was when working part time and in school.  I have to contact my school at the end of the month in order to go back in January. I'm really stressed out about telling my parents I've been feeling this way because I'm very concerned that they'll be angry, frustrated, and essentially, disappointed. I know they are going to tell me that the longer I wait to go back, the harder it's going to be to get back into the swing of things. No part of me feels that I'll never go back, because I still want to earn my MSW and get a better paying job some day. But as of right now, I am so content, I love my job and I get so depressed just thinking about all of the homework, studying, stress, internship, and how miserable I was when in grad school.

Basically, I need advice on whether just going back to school and getting it over with, while also not upsetting my parents, is a better idea.
Or should I stick to my gut feelings? And take another year off before going back to grad school once again.  I'm not getting any younger (25) and I don't want to look back and feel like I wasted my time taking more time off before completing another year and a half of my Masters degree.",16Oct2018,1

I'm a sophomore now, and I'm considering taking a semester or two off to figure out my medication more and get my life back together, but I'm afraid of disappointing my friend and family.

I’m tired of
-Getting led on by Lesbians that magically become straight when a better looking guy is around
-Being pelted by rocks
-Scaring people away or getting them to laugh at me
-Getting bullied then fighting my bully but I am the one that gets more days off because apparently I started it
-Being alone and no one wants to be around me, meeting people with similar hobbies to me makes them not like there own hobbies when I’m not around
-Being creepy because I have no friends but I have no friends because I’m creepy and ugly
-Scaring a girl away by asking her out causing her not to show up the next day
-Getting a group of girls to beat me up because apparently I was going to “Rape” her friend
-“Atleast I don’t look like him”
-“He’s probably a virgin.”

10,"So yesterday I was supposed to meet with my uncle and brother for lunch. I missed the scheduled time by about 30 minutes, mostly because I had to park a mile away from the meetup. I may have also slept in longer than I thought I should to be ready for it. My uncle knows I had to park far away but does not know I have a problem with sleeping that contributed to this. 

I apologized for being late to both my brother and my uncle. My brother seemed okay with it and surprisingly understanding for him. My uncle responded with ""Don't worry about it, if I didn't have anywhere to be, I'd be late to lunch with family too.""

Am I crazy when I think this may be condescending? Is there some other implication to that sentence that I'm just not getting? I've always been told by my mom that my uncle loves me, that always seemed confusing she even needed to say it. 

So is it condescending or are there other ways to interpret it?",16Oct2018,1
12,"Why does it feel like uti hasn’t fully gone away?

So about a month ago, I got my first uti. I mistakenly thought my symptoms went away after the first four days of treatment (7 days total) and I had sex w my LDR boyfriend since I knew I wasn’t going to seem him for a while. Stupid I know, but that’s what happened. On the 5th day of that treatment, i went to Urgent care and I was prescribed another antibiotic and azo. The doctor total me to stop taking my first one, and so I started (and finished) the second antibiotic for a total of 10 days treatment. I went to the doctors a week after that to get tested to see if I still had a uti and they said I was in the clear.

Thing is, why do I still feel like I have one? Not necessarily it hurts to pee or my pee smells or is cloudy. But when I started the second antibiotic, my upper and lower back started to hurt. It has not stop hurting on and off since. In addition, I have slight pressure over my bladder. Is this all in my head?

I have been eating probiotic yogurts and drinking waaay more water than I ever have so I’m really confused. If not a uti what else can’t this be?

I’m going to see my boyfriend in a couple of weeks. Idk why but I’m kinda of scared to sleep with him again because I’m scared of the pain it might cause.

18,"I just started a new job today then I was originally so excited about because it involves helping people getting into a sober lifestyle which is something I’m passionate about. This is a new program offered by the agency that hired me so there is a huge learning curve, everyone’s trying to figure out the logistics still and Ive only been given a limited scope of experience from the only other coworker who shares my position. From what I’ve gathered so far there is a tremendous amount of driving involved with this job which was one of the reasons why I left my old job. The mileage reimbursement is lower than my last job, I can’t work overtime or take any time off for the next three months. This being said I’m also trying to study for the GRE’s that I’ll be taking in December... obviously starting a new job that is so involved with such a steep learning curve is not exactly conducive to a rigorous study habit. I work at two other agencies as a relief staff so conceivably I could just quit this job and work relief and pretty much pick up shifts whenever I want to and leave myself as much time to study as I want and can afford. Should I just be an ass and quit this job as soon as possible? I feel bad they’ve already provided me with a brand new cell phone and a brand new laptop... everyone at this new job is super nice... getting into grad school is of the upmost importance.

26,"I've been pretending I'm OK. I don't know why. Maybe because last year all tests came back negative. But now the pain is almost excruciating.
I don't want my doctors to think I'm lying or that it's just something arising from my psychiatric issues (anxiety and depression).

It began as the ""usual"" overuse pain and numbness in my right hand. Evolved into the full myriad of carpal tunnel syndrome with a possible differential as something along the C5-C7 nerve roots, but all nerve conduction and MRI studies were normal. I felt ashamed. What will they think? So I shut up about it ever since.

Fast forward 12 months. It feels like there are needles being continuously inserted all through my upper right limb. Sometimes it feels like it's on fire or being constantly electrocuted and I can't move it or touch it without almost crying. There are evenings or nights I take strong sedatives just to fall asleep and ""stop feeling pain"", although I would have a million other better things to do (I hate sleeping...). I honestly feel like a crippled person sometimes, given that my entire arm becomes useless, with pain radiating from shoulder to the tip of the fingers. 

I'm relying on codeine with acetaminophen right now. In extreme pain episodes, months ago, I've had to inject tramadol, but now the pain and associated movement and dexterity dysfunction makes it impossible to properly administer myself IV meds.

This is becoming more and more impairing. I know the meds are just masking something that is undeniably worsening. In my dreams I dream about amputation of my arm and I feel relieved, because there's no pain anymore once the limb is removed.

I'm so sick of it and it's so frustrating to imagine myself going through the tests again only to get no tangible results pointing to the source of pain. The needle nerve conduction and muscle study (Electroneuromyography) is an specially painful procedure I would have to do again, but honestly these days it doesn't compare to the pain I'm going through almost daily.

At the same time I ashamed of even writing this because so many people have no access to the healthcare and health services I have and I'm ""wasting"" this privilege. At the same time I would feel like wasting resources if the pain turns out to actually be psychiatric in origin. And I would hate to follow with the usual treatments for pain arising from psychiatric issues (gabapentin and similar medications make me slow and dumb; duloxetine has terrible side effects and discontinuation syndrome symptoms in the event of an unexpected withdrawal so fluoxetine and bupropion are the only antidepressants I take, thus sudden withdrawal is never an issue).

27,"At the very end of this summer, I badly broke two fingers and ended up having surgery on them. The process was long, expensive, painful, and annoying. I was in some sort of a cast for over three months. I have the cast off now, but I’m still in a splint. During this time I became very depressed, and stressed about everything 

I lost ALL motivation to do anything. Sometimes even getting up out of bed was to much. I was disgusted with myself, which only made me feel worse. Right after getting my cast off, I thought my motivation would magically come back but it didn’t. I was still sleeping for hours a day, eating way to much, and not wanting to even get ready.

Today I got up and finally forced myself to do something. It started as just picking up the trash in my room, then it turned into completely deep cleaning it. I took my bed apart and dusted and cleaned under it, I washed all my dirty clothes and sheets, I washed the baseboards, I cleaned everything. I also rearranged furniture to make things feel like they were new and changing.

Sometimes when I do say things, I regret deeply because the things I've said were super unnecessary. In the same social situations I grow hate to people who can express their mind clearly and have fun with stupidest arguments. And the other people at the table seem to enjoy it, laugh and look that person in the eye, ask more questions.

Nice, so now just need something that goes with it. Decide to make some rice because it's probably the easiest. I just take some pot put there some rice and water sit in the kitchen till it starts to boil so I turn the stove down a bit.

I finally sit on the toilet, feel like this is the end of me! I won't ever come out! if it won't tear me apart the poisonous smell will definitely seal the deal! I spent good 20 minutes there trying to survive and then cleaning shit from the floor and myself. 

This is the time I realize that my dog is running around and rolling over like crazy, I think nothing of it, he does that sometimes when he's playing with his toys. I proceed to take shower to finally clean myself. I'm done finally feeling clean,
as I walk out of the bathroom I realise that there is a fog! What!? Why is it so Fogg.... I forgot about the fucking RICE and left the stove on the max! As I'm getting closer to the kitchen I see more and more smoke when I get there the RICE IS ON FIRE smoking like crazy, I manage turn the stove off open windows and as I try my best to put the fire out my parents come home.

35,"Back in high 11th grade I had a friend at school who thinks GTA V is the bestest biggest most ultimate, most mind-blowing, most fantastic game all of time. He has a PC at home which can barely play GTA IV at low and he can't upgrade (Bad grades) and I have a laptop that can play V. He likes GTA IV but he's getting bored.

He occasionally begs to play V every time he sees my laptop, like if I was working or playing another game he would just sit beside me and he be like ""Come on man...play GTA V... play V...""

He said he wanted to come over my house so that he has a friend to play with and I lied, I said my parents wouldn't allow it even though it's because I'm sure he wouldn't do anything but raid my laptop at my home and play GTA V all day.

He was so desperate to play this game, at class during lecture he would just open his phone and watch GTA V videos, walkthroughs, and all that (Another reason for bad grades) or just draw GTAO characters in heist gear. I swear he'd take any chance to play GTA V, even if he had to play in the lowest setting, 1 fps, play in very terrible circumstances He would still play it.

Due to his horrendous grades, he wasn't able to pass 11th grade and had to restart the year. So he did, and he graduated high school and entered a pretty good university. As a reward, he got a gaming laptop, and after a year, he's finally got GTA V on Steam recently. He's just as obsessed with GTA V now as he was 2 years ago. He is now trying to play GTA Online and get absolutely rich after seeing how rich I  am in Online and trying to catch up after all these years (if only he knew...)

From seeing all of the Online heist videos in high school, where professional players play on hard, and getting all of the elite challenges, criminal mastermind challenge and all that, added with him wanting to get rich fast. He always coaxes me into playing Online with him now, and everytime we play, there's always a technical problem, and he always demands that we play on Hard, which ends up prolonging everything, since we always fail, and we always have to wait for a long time to get a random player.

Now that he gets what he wants after all these years, I fear for his performance in college...

When i get home i think about what i have said and if i said something wrong i dont feel sorry for my self. Its good. Nofap did this to me. Most times i go back on it it kills my mood. Kills my personality... i think this is a good start. But how do i have a strong back bone? Stop being a pussy?  How to i build Strong frame? How do i love my self more and be fucking smart and when people ask they dont say what a naive or ingenuous nice guy! Im a nice guy just so people like me. I have to stop this shit spamming too. Im not a troll. I aint lost i will find a way to fix my self. My whole family is like this so i dont want to do the same fucking mistake as they did. My brothrr is alcololic. The other work his friends and they dont give him money because he says you are a friend. He does this to all his friends. We live in a small town in fucking iraq. so everyone knows other. He cant get a job for him self now. When he talks with his friends i can see him being the most nice guy but i want to fix my self first. People of reddit what do i need to do? How do i be my self ? How do i be smart?? How to have a useful and good brain?  Stop worrying if people like me or not and live my life? Stop worrying to much about life? Stop wanting others to like me?

38,"I’ve been unemployed for a couple months, but luckily I got some severance money that has floated me until now. I was hoping to get a job right out of the gate and pocket the cash, but I’m in a weird position in my career where I have some senior level experience, but I’m finding it hard to land another senior level job since I only have a year of experience at that level.

Then suddenly last week I got a lot of responses and landed two interviews for today. One would be a huge step up for me title and responsibility wise... to the point where I have no idea why they think I can do this job. The second one is for a freelance job for a cool project but with a really weird schedule. It’s a lower title/role, but I’m at the point where I just need income now.

I really want the higher job... I really can’t fuck this up. I’m just a really anxious guy and interviews aren’t my strong suit (usually rely on strong internal recommendations to get me the job). I’m trying not to over prep... I did that for an interview with Netflix and I got way too into my head and flubbed it up. I’m trying to just go in and try to be relaxed and have a conversation rather than trying to remember and recite prepared statements.

I’m just so close to reaching this next level... I just want it to be tomorrow so the interviews are done. Gahhhhhhhhhh.

46,"So I have this friend, lets’s just call him Yuu for the sake of anonymity. 

Yuu is well trained with weapons, ex marines and so on, after his last tour around six years ago he finds himself in a tough situation, little money, nowhere to stay, he lands a job as a security enforcement at the world health organisation (WHO). 

So Yuu works his way up the ladder, and he ends up as a part of some special operations unit, turns out that the  WHO is more shady  than you  would think, he only ever did one operation before leaving, he said the pay was good, but he couldn’t live with what they had him do on his conscience. 

Yuu told me that the one operation he was a part of was to capture this Russian nuclear physicist out of Uzbekistan, the trouble however was that the CIA had their eyes on the scientist as well. He said that he was part of a group of three, led by this big guy in a mask, (I think he said his name was Wayne or something similar I can’t quite remember). There were also other mercenaries involved in the capture hired by WHO, they staged it so that Yuu and the two other guys had been caught trying to apprehend the scientist and handed them over to the CIA for interrogation. 

The CIA guys took them on board their plane, Yuu said the guy threatened to shoot them and throw them out the plane, Yuu said nothing however, despite being a hired gun he had a lotta loyalty. The guy in the mask had the whole thing planned however, another, bigger plane flew in, and guys basically bungee jumped down, shot the CIA guys, crashed the plane and extracted the scientist and Yuu, the masked guy made one of the three stay behind to die, saying “they expected one of them in the wreckage”. This terrified Yuu as he says it could have just as easily been himself left to die. 

The CIA kept this under wrap for obvious reasons but Yuu said he couldn’t carry on with that job and soon quit working for WHO. 

TLDR: WHO paid Yuu to grab Doctor Pavel. ",16Oct2018,1

A little back story on me, I’m a 15 year old girl with depression and anxiety issues and I’m doing my best to cure my daily struggle with anything but perception medicine because my entire family says that we don’t react well to any of the medicine provided by a pharmacy. My sister’s anxiety got tremendously worse, my mother fell into a deep depression and my father says he felt like a robot that lacked feeling.

So I’ve started looking into working out.

I think it would be perfect for me but my anxiety says people will judge me because I’m already a very tiny person and idk, maybe they think I’m to young to worry about working out??

Anyways. I’m going to try it once and if it makes me anxiety worse I’ll stop but if it doesn’t it might help me a lot. But I don’t know what to start out with. I don’t even know the first thing about working out 😂

Every moment I spend with him, I am happy. I’ve never questioned once if he cares about me. I’m still so terrified I’m going to do something to lose him, but I’m so happy he is mine.

Was leaving my neighborhood and saw a vehicle stop abruptly in the oncoming lane (one of those shared roads with no meridian so you pass pretty close to each other), I stopped as well because it seemed like an emergency thing.  I had stopped right next to their vehicle and all of a sudden I had a ""Wait a second..."" sensation, I did one of those ultraslow head turns towards the driver of the vehicle and as I'm doing this I'm going ""Hey, I think I recognize that vehicle"" (it's the same one he used to drive, he was mechanically inclined so it's in really good condition still), then I'm thinking ""Oh no, not him, anyone but him"", and sure enough I make eye contact with him, he must have been piecing together everything that was going through my mind because as soon as I made eye contact I was scanning his face.  Massive grin, watering eyes, he raises his right hand slowly from the wheel and gives me a slow wave.  I slowly turn my head forward and was like ""Great, now that he knows he's going to cause headaches for me.""  He wasn't one of these ""Beat you up bullies"", he was good at doing little social knocks to paint you a certain way (if that makes sense) so other people would think something was wrong with you and ostracize you because they'd gossip about it and fabricate things to explain it and pressure you out of social situations pretty quickly.

This is completely false.

The fact is that Lenin and Trotsky, the leaders of the great revolution, hated lying and always told the truth to the oppressed. If they deceived anyone, they only deceived the ruling classes.

It is the capitalist world that lies about Lenin!

This is easy to verify.

Go on Google search, or Google images search, and type ""lenin quotes"", and search for it.

90% of the quotes that appear are fake! You cannot find one shred of evidence they were ever said!

These false quotes were invented to portray Lenin in a terrible light and paint him as some sort of bloodthirsty monster!

90% of the quotes have been fabricated by the capitalist world because it must lie about Lenin if it is to keep the poor in chains!!!

And is this a coincidence, just a product of a ""free market"" of ""free ideas"" existing?

Or is it because we live in a world marked by the domination of one class and another, and this must lead to one set of ideas being prevalent?

Now study the works of the leaders of the revolution Lenin and Trotsky!

Is there one lie said anywhere?

There are no lies!

If you love the truth, and hate lies, there is nothing better and more enriching than reading the workers of the leaders of the revolution, and fighters for the universal liberation and emancipation of mankind, of the workers, poor, oppressed, and downtrodden -- Lenin and Trotsky.

59,"I’m a 20 year old student that wants to work as a waiter. So far, I’ve only had 3 months of experience. I love the concept of serving guests and talking with them. 

Today I had two great interviews in two different restaurants in Oslo. You can look them up: (Yo Sushi), a restaurant themed around japanese cuisine, stationed near the train station where people from different places pass by. The other is a fine-dining restaurant (Nodee Barcode) located a bit futher from the station, but near office buildings and expensive residential areas where more-fortunate people live.  Nodee is a huge restaurant.

It’s hard for me to decide which one to choose, since both offer a great deal of experience and training. However, I feel that perhaps the fine-dining restaurant will require more energy and if I work right after 8 hours of school, I might not survive the qualifications at all. 

On the other hand, Yo Sushi requires the same things but is smaller compared to the fine-dining restaurant. However, being beside the train station will mean that there will be more people to look after. I also know some people who work there.

I like many other humans am very flawed and I am struggling to make it on my own. I am putting as much effort as I can into progressing as an adult, and verrrrryyy much feel that I am getting almost no where. If I take a step back I can see that I have made legitimate progress but it is so slow it feels like I am still the same.

I often sit in my car outside my apartment dreading going inside because I feel like when I go inside I am just accepting that my life is at a stand still for now. Last night was one of those nights were I sat in my car for maybe an hour just talking to myself about why I have these issues. 

I think it's very important that I accept that even though I didn't start these issues, I have to be the one to either fix them or accept that they will always dominate me. I am not going to live a life where I am dominated by my issues, so I must fix them. Problem is I genuinely don't know how. My issues stem mainly from 2 things, having no father figure ever as I was growing up, and my mom finding my affection to be annoying to her. My presence in my family when I lived with them was always annoying to them but my mom getting annoyed when I tried to show her my appreciation really affects me still. 

I can see the affects very clearly. Not having a father figure has really made me feel like I am always a little brother, I have started trying to make myself push more, do things without asking. The mom disliking my affection really has a big impact though and I can see it everywhere in my life. I am always seeking approval and it always crushes me when inevitably I can not find it. I would talk more about the affects of that but really they are embarrassing. 

It annoys me when people say to just wait for the right person, wait for the right job to call you back, wait for real friends. 
waiting will only let these problems exist and continue to ruin any potential good people/things that come into my life. If I want to be able to keep things in my life I have to figure out these issues otherwise I will keep on getting nice people and opportunities and ruining them in a matter of months because I have not addressed my issues. 

To leave off on a positive note though, I have been losing weight be it slowly, I have another job interview today (I've had about 4 in the last week the others said if I get it they will call at the end of this week), I am learning things to do on my own to cope instead of constantly trying to find friends to overwhelm with my emotions, and although I sometimes feel like I am at rock bottom I can still always acknowledge that I am the one who can change that.
