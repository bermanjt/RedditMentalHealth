1,"First of all, I can finally buy shit. Ok, so to give a bit of context, I am living with my parents and also studying in university. I didn't *need* to get this job but I decided to do it anyway. And man, seeing this money now in my bank account just feels exhilerating. I finally feel like I don't need to really ponder if I can really afford to buy X, I can just do it.

After next month's salary I'm gonna finally buy a gaming PC, which is something I've dreamt of having for so long. After that I'm probably going to just mostly save my money because I don't know what else I even really want to buy with it right now.

Secondly, I feel so much less depressed now that I'm working. Before, despite studying in uni I still had a ton of free time, probably too much. And as someone who isn't very social I just spent most of my time at my PC, which felt depressing. Now when I have days off I really appreciate them.

Thirdly, I actually love the job itself. It puts me in an environment where I have actually been socializing way more than I did before. There's a lot of people around my age too, so it's not too hard to find someone with common grounds. Plus the job is not too hard, pretty interesting and there's a lot of breaks.

Lastly, the schedule is super flexible. I can pretty much swap, take and give away shifts as much as I want. Especially when I'm studying it's super important. Plus I can choose if I want to work more and make that money or have some days off and relax. 

Honestly starting to work in this job has been one of the best decisions I've made in my life so far.",11Apr2018,2
2,"Social anxiety really is a bitch. Usually I’m able to go home listen to music and think about the good things I could do and the opportunities I have. But right now I can’t even do that without cringing at how awkward and tough to open up to I am. Aside 2-3 people, It’s hard for me to start conversation and build relationships. Plus this is all heavily rooted in my sensitivity to mistakes and occasional self hatred. No matter how many r/socialanxiety and r/socialskills advice threads I read and YouTube videos I watch, the anxiety holds me back so much. ",11Apr2018,6

A history of my period in the past 4 months

PERIOD from January 13-17, 2018

PERIOD from February 9-11, 2018 (started on DAY 28)

PERIOD March 8-11, 2018 (started on DAY 28)

My mom has anemia, but I don't get irregular periods like her and I take iron supplement tablets. My period was supposed to come on April 4, after a 28 day cycle but I still haven't got my period. I usually never missed my period ias t always comes on time. I had the usual PMS symptoms up to April 4, high sex drive, bloating, little bit of acne, irritability. But nothing came on the 4th. The weather in was unusually hot lately, and on April 7, it fell to a really windy, cold and icy temperature, I got the flu on April 7, and a fever on April 8-10. I'm still sick today but from what I've read, it’s only if you're sick during your ovulation that it throws your cycle off track. However I got sick after I missed my period.

I'm not sexually active (in the intercourse sense). But on April 3, my boyfriend and I did some genital rubbing, where he slides his junk near my clit, but he always pulls out right before he comes, he never comes near my area, probably unless it’s precum. But this all happened very shortly AND on DAY 27 of my cycle. Otherwise I have had no other sexual contact since February 28th.

Yes, I’ve been a stressed over college work and SUPER irritable leading up to April 4. But, where’s my period?! I’ve been taking medications since I got the flu on April 7, but shouldn’t my period have started before my sickness/medication? Please help. I’ve been jumping into the worse thoughts lately, but conception is not even possible given that I’m technically still a virgin and only came into sexual contact right before my period is due.",11Apr2018,1

7,"I am 28 ywlears old, a recent college graduate, and I recently moved in with my girlfriend of two years. I quit my job, came to Florida (she had moved for school before I left) and started a new job.

I am very happy with her, but I feel like other aspects of my life are disappointing. I had lost a significant amount of weight between 19 and 20 but had gained back about 10 lbs a year so I am back where I started. I have sudden depression spouts that trigger like panic attacks and no health insurance coverage that could allow me medicine - I also have an ingrained aversion to such medicine after seeing my grandmother deteriorate after years of treatment for her schizophrenia. Aside from my girlfriend I have kept most people at a distance; the last beat friend I had (who I thought was my best friend) blocked me on social media with no explanation and stopped responding to messages. I purchased a car and found out it was a real lemon but I have years of payments remaining. 

I  have been writing for years and graduated with my BA in English Literature but I have no idea how to even start to become published. 

My current job is above minimum wage but not of an amount that I should really feel satisfied.

I try my best to make it through each day but only because I know if I just quit life would only become more difficult. I feel like I am spinning my wheels in neutral.  

One if the few things that makes me feel better is the time I can spend with my girlfriend nand listening to the Shock Waves podcast. Everything else just feels artificial. ",11Apr2018,4

10,"I'm a 23y old guy. I recently realized I can't feel stress, at all. Same with anxiety. I guess I've never thought about it before since I don't know what it feels like..

I believe this is a very bad thing because I don't care about myself or act like a normal person should.

Let me try to give you a short story of what have happend in my life the past few months:
I moved to a new town, where I knew no one. I wanted to ""press the reset button on life"". I wanted to start working, make money, save money etc.. My dad helped me get a job through contacts so I started working, but not full-time, the money I got was just enough to survive, pay rent, buy food etc.. I felt like I didn't need more than that. I spent my spare time at the computer, playing games with my friends from my hometown over the internet. That's basically all I did. Then one night when I was at my computer a bomb exploded outside my window. Someone planted a bomb infront of a door on my courtyard. The explosion was like nothing I've ever heard before, like fireworks on new years eve x1000, the shockwave blew all the windows on the courtyard and the whole house shook. Since then I just pushed everything away. I went back to my hometown and started sleeping at friends couches. I stopped caring about everything. I let all my bills go past the last pay date, I didn't pay rent for 3 months. I didn't go to check my mail for a long time, and when I finally went to get it I couldn't care about opening them (I don't know why? I just didn't). I lived at friends houses doing stuff daily that made me feel good, that made me feel some kind of happiness. Hang out in the good weather having a good time.. After 4 months I felt like I had to do something about my situation before it couldn't be fixed. I felt like I didn't care but knew this couldn't go on. Today I still can't feel like I care and this is really bothering me. I KNOW I should care, but I can't and I don't know why. I have now moved back home to my mom and got like 2000€ in depts in total. I'm currently waiting to get an appointment to the psychiatrist because I really feel like I have to talk to someone and get help somehow. I know I don't think like a normal person should and I can't understand what's wrong or why I am like I am.


I've always had a hard time to feel motivated, about anything really, especially to work and get money.
I feel like I don't have to work because I have nothing to work for. I feel no need for money. It feels more like ""it's nice to have money, because then I can do stuff"", but that's not making me motivated enough which I guess is really strange?
Some of my friends think I could have depression, some of them think I could have ADHD. I don't know much about these two conditions. All I know is that something is very wrong and that I don't think or act like a normal person should.

Is there someone that can relate or atleast try to figure out what's going on inside my head? I'm starting to loose hope about myself.
Feel free to ask questions, all help is truly appreciated.

Please keep harsh thoughts to yourself, I won't be able to just snap into being a normal person just like that. I'm well aware of what's right and wrong, and clearly I know what I feel is wrong, or else I wouldn't be here trying to be understood.

11,"Live with a romantic partner/soulmate? Absolutely. But hitch myself to that person legally, financially and (near)-irreversably? Seems like an awfully dicey proposition.

14,"I want to be an astronaut or do something like be an entrepreneur. I'm a physics and aerospace engineering major. Yet I am very behind on math because none of them transferred from my last school (I had free tuition and they didn't have my major, so I transferred). Now I've l really lost the motivation to go to school yet I don't want to leave and then regret not coming back later on in life. Yet I have an amazing job where I can work overseas, I have great references and I still can't get out of bed in the morning for class. Im burnt out even though I haven't done much. 

I have done some amazing things so far in my life and I can do just about anything. I've ran a marathon with a weighted rucksack. I've lived in a tent in the middle of Alaska for three months working and living off the land with no internet or phone. I went to Madagascar for two and a half months. I can always find a way to make money, I have the coolest jobs. I've even had a sugar momma for gods sake, I have all of these interesting stories (some i wouldn't share with everyone for obvious reasons). Im so young and I've done so much, yet some people find it hard to believe me at times. Not that I need there approval because I know whats true and whats not, but still.

Yet I suck at school, currently. I'm good when I want to be but my math credits not transferring killed my motivation. I want to take a break and do something big, like work on a company or for a start up.  I also want to do it with someone else not just by myself, I'm tired of doing things by myself and having no one to do it with and share my experiences with. Who knows. 

Also wanna get started on my pilots license and just fly with friends and go on weekend trips but everyone is so fucking scared to leave. I'm not sure what to do.

Normally when I'm not wearing them, they sit on my desk. A few days ago, I was clearing away trash and papers and I'm pretty sure I accidentally swept the biggest ring off the desk into a trash bag.

20,"So I’m confused as to how I should handle this situation. Anyway, I go to school full time (Monday to Thursday, 8 am to 4 pm) and I reserve the time after school everyday for my projects and home work and what not. But recently I got a new job, and when I started, I told her that I could only work Friday-Sunday, and that I wouldn’t work on the days I have school. It wasn’t a problem up until I went on spring break a couple weeks ago, and she needed me to work, so I didn’t see anything wrong with picking up extra shifts during the week off since I didn’t have any big plans, and it’d give me some extra money. So I ended working every day that week, but now I’m back in school and I’ve got big assignments and studying to do in preparation for my finals. The problem is, my boss is scheduling me to work during the days I have school, even after I told her I couldn’t. She ignored my request and did so anyway. I feel like she’s taking advantage of the fact that I was willing to work on my break from school, and of the fact that I’m a soft spoken kind of girl, I tend to step back when something like this happens, instead of standing up for myself. It’s just the way I am. I just need to know what I should do?

21,"This might be a dumb thing to ask and it’s probably something I should be able to decide on my own but I really can’t, so here goes. About 5 months ago, I ended a friendship with someone I had known for nearly a decade. He was a great friend, we would see each other often and it was always a great time up until the last year or so of the friendship when things changed. To be fair, we were both going through times of stress in our lives and maybe that’s the reason this happened. We graduated high school and he got a full time job while I started college, but he basically started treating me like more of a therapist than a friend. Whenever we got together, I would find myself listening to all the things that were wrong with his life, and it was just too much. Didn’t want any help or advice whatsoever, just someone to shoulder all the baggage and it really made me feel used. Eventually I got fed up and cut him off because I didn’t feel like it was even the same person that became one of my best friends almost 10 years ago. This was a guy with a strong negative outlook on life, and it killed the mood every single time. However, there’s a part of me that can’t help but feel like this was all a misunderstanding and that it was a mistake to cut him off because like I said earlier, it was a time when we were both stressed in life, and maybe he just needed someone close to him to listen. Maybe I took it the wrong way because of everything that was on my plate at the time. I just don’t know what to think or do because of how close we had been for so long before all of this. Was this all a misunderstanding and should I reach out to mend things? Or was I justified in ending the friendship? I should also note that he did reach out and try to apologize a few days after the falling out, but I ignored because I was still really pissed off about what happened, so it’s my move if there is to be any contact.

23,"Things I have discovered while trying to make this god-forsaken mashup

1. The youtube video calling itself ""Poison"" by Bell Biv DeVoe (the non-music video one, since the music video doesn't start the music right away) has a BPM of almost exactly 111.850.

2. The nightwish cover of ""Phantom of the Opera"" plays at 132 BPM

3. The nightwish cover of Phantom transposes the notes, which means I can't listen to the original andrew lloyd weber version while I'm working on the multitrack

Let's talk about poison for a second. It's a song where drum patterns are arranged to tied eighth notes, ok that's fine but then in between parts 1 and 2 of the hook (""miss her, kiss her, love her"") they use dotted eighth notes, ok, fine, whatever, but then in the middle of part 2 of the hook, one of them (I think it's Ricky Bell? I don't know much about BBD) is dropping tied sixteenth notes (""never trust a big butt and a smile"") and I'm rapidly realizing that I'm out of my depth trying to make this remix happen

Meanwhile, Phantom of the Opera has its own problems. I'll mainly be referring to the version on songsterr which has the correct key signatures relative to the original (both the spotify 2004 motion picture soundtrack version, and the nightwish version, have different alterations to the key signature). It starts off enharmonic to Gm (actually written as FMaj), every time the characters sing the descending scale (""phan-tom of the op-e-r-a is there""), the last note ""there"" is always an accidental (C# in Christine's verse, F# in Erik's verse), and then the key actually changes to accommodate the next singer's verse

this whole thing is a clusterfuck and I honestly wish I had never come up with the stupid idea for this mashup in the first place

edit: ok some revisions, looks like the 2004 motion picture soundtrack version uses the original key (starting at FMaj) but poto.wiki.com is wrong when it says the only key change is to Cm because Erik's verse is CLEARLY in F#m aka AMaj which poto.wiki.com mentions NOWHERE in their page for the title song

edit 2: I'm gonna just transpose all of the damn tonal notes on my fl studio project to the original written type signature and then just alter the key signature with the global key slider so that I hear the notes that match the karaoke cover of the nightwish cover of the alw version but I see labels corresponding to the alw version

edit 3: the whole fucking thing is clearly written for minor key, and I don't know where the fuck I came up with Gm because even as written in the nightwish cover it's actually Dm, this whole song, this whole post, this whole mashup can go fuck itself",11Apr2018,2
24,"I have always been attracted to people who’d reject me. They were either in relationships or just not into me at all. 
Once they were into me, I’d completely lose interest. 

And when I say I was « attracted », I mean obsessed. I didn’t like them for their looks, their spirit or their personality. No; I was obsessed with the idea of them. 

I have been completely obsessed with a girl I only met like 4 times but kept a close text relationship with for three years. It feels like I’m in love with her but I don’t even know her. It’s like I am in a relationship with this idealized, completely fantasized image of her. Like I am dating my imaginary friend or something.
There’s a giant gap because reality and my fantasies, and even though I’m aware of this, it doesn’t reduce the feelings (pain, heartbreak or love)

And even worse, when people liked me, I either used them for narcissistic needs OR I end up so disgusted with myself that I’d completely cut ties. 

A few years ago a girl told me she had a crush on me, but I took it like a personal insult. 
And when I was younger, a guy liked me and it creeped me out so bad that I completely stopped going out at the parks and stuff (I was 9/10yo)
Even worse, the perfect girl was in love with me, she was smart, funny, gorgeous, but it creeped me out too ! 

After +1 year of therapy, I learned that my parents have similar relationships mechanisms : they usually don’t pay attention to people and rather form their opinion according to their own standards of conduct and to what the person can provide them.
They’re also very excessive as well : for example, if my father thinks the neighbor is treating his dog well according to his standards, he’ll think the neighbor is a great dude. But if the dog barks a bit too much, the neighbor becomes a complete asshole.
They’re never moderate and they never have stable, caring and loving friendships with anyone. 

I am afraid I’m like this : judging people by my own standards and not looking past that. 

In therapy, we always use the metaphor of a filmmaking setting : like for my parents and myself, people around me are cardboard characters with no depth or feelings of their own. 

I try to connect more with people, I try to pay attention to their feelings, their needs, their behaviors, but I’m afraid that in the long term I’ll never be able to love someone for who they are. 

TL;DR : I can’t seem to connect with people and love them for their personality or spirit. I have grown up in a similar environment where my parents dismiss people when they don’t stand up to their own standards and rather idealize them (both positively and negatively). I am afraid I’ll never be able to love someone for a long period of time because I tend to use them and fantasize about a specific image rather than learn to live with their negative aspects. I’m afraid I’ll forever be stuck in my little world",11Apr2018,2

26,"**But I've been so messed up/emotional because of pain and pain killers for the past week that nothing helped me get properly distracted. 

So I decided to do something I haven't done in years. I feel weird about it since I'm not that great anymore expressing my feelings in such a way. But I do hope at least someone appreciates me sharing this.**

&amp;nbsp;

In the midst of the darkness that was surrounding me,   
I went out to seek the light as I went down on my knees.  
But there was nothing to find, nothing to hold on to,  
Nothing that could lessen the pain I went through.  

&amp;nbsp;

I kept weeping more and more each night falls,  
With my only witnesses that surrounded me, the walls.  
The loneliness kept growing like a virus,  
I kept falling into the abyss and got more anxious.  

&amp;nbsp;

Hoping, praying, crying, shouting, nearly dying,  
Doing it on my own was terrifying,  
But I asked the universe for one thing,  
Please let my sun come up and give me a happy ending.  

&amp;nbsp;

Nothing happened yet, and I started to doubt myself,   
I managed through so much, so why deserve help,  
They always say that if you come off as strong,  
No one will ask if there’s something wrong.  

&amp;nbsp;

But one day.. that one day...  
My earth and sky suddenly lit up from a darkened place,  
There he came towards me and I was terrified to embrace.  
 To embrace the fact that that day the sun came up,  
Exactly like I begged for it, so this had to be a set up.  

&amp;nbsp;

It is too good to be true, was circling through my mind,  
How could someone like that be one of the human kind,  
He was a treasure left unopened and forsaken,  
Did I deserve the sun to be mine for the taking?  

&amp;nbsp;

I knew I didn’t, I knew the sun was too pure and innocent,  
One look at his eyes and I felt insignificant,  
That was all I could look at, his eyes,  
His golden lashes which matches the sunrise,  

&amp;nbsp;

He was equal to heavens bliss,  
When I first felt the touch of his lips,  
He was truly the sun that came up one day,  
And from that day on never faded away,  

&amp;nbsp;

The kindness that overflowed him,  
The smile he showed when he taught me how to swim,  
The patience and understanding like no other,  
Moments unforgotten between each other.  

&amp;nbsp;

Yet, I’ve broken him with my pain and despair,  
Things he felt because of me which he couldn’t bear,  
Instead of letting his shine loose in the world,  
I kept it to myself and made it night fall.  

&amp;nbsp;

The dread of this world on his shoulders,  
How his rays stopped shining and got colder,  
The sun isn’t as bright as it used to be,  
But it isn’t hard for me to see,  

&amp;nbsp;

That for it to be shining bright again,

27,"So my now wife has been and continues to text her ex and vice versa ever since she and I have started dating. 

She tells me I have nothing to worry about, and I do trust her and it hasn’t been an issue since. 

The latest bullshit her ex tried to pull was contacting my wife and telling her she was HIV positive. 

(Yes my wife had a girlfriend) 

Wife starts tripping, and of course let me know and I said we can get tested, however I think this bitch is lying and trying to fuck with us. (Her ex got word we just got married) 

Fast forward a few days, I know they’ve been texting back and forth and while we have each other’s unlock codes to our phones, I don’t check her phone like that. 

If people want to fuck up they will no matter what. I don’t have time nor energy to be a detective. 

Anyways, yesterday I noticed my wife texting and saw it was her ex again and it seemed pretty heated but I ignored it and again, if I really wanted to know I could. 

Just now,  1:30 AM PST my wife’s phone is ringing and it’s her ex calling. A complete show of disrespect. 

Now it’s an issue. As I brought it up to my wife that why is this toxic bitch still in our lives and now fucking with me aside from the HIV shit, what is it? 

My wife tried to make it seem like it was nothing. 

Actually turned it on me and couldn’t believe it was an issue. I never make an issue about shit usually and I’m pretty chill going and I love my wife with all my heart. But should I feel bad for wanting her ex out of our lives now? Like isn’t lying that you have HIV and calling at 1:30 AM grounds for me feeling a bit fkn angry here? 

Am I overreacting? I hate that it’s even an issue. 

Feeling confused as hell right now sitting in my living room. Any input appreciated. 

Thanks reddit. ",11Apr2018,0
28,"Turning 27 in two months. I'm back to square one. I don't adore myself particularly. I don't hate myself like I did before though. I'm at peace most days living life drama-free. But it's a little uneventful.

My to do list is rotting for a year now. I guess when I'm 35 I'll do the same thing because I'm a lazy fuck. I was supposed to plan the next three years of my life a few hours ago but I was derailed by reading some mushy shite on the Internet causing me to pull up facebook and have a look at what everyone's doing. Former flames, friends, course, I did compare. They're older than me but age is just a number. At least they don't look like they're stuck in 2010. They seem to have made some progress. And I'm here wondering why time flew so fast while being careful with grammar and spelling because nazis. Why I didn't do jack shite about my situation when I had 3x the skill and talent? Cause I was waiting for the sky to fall. But I really thought I could fast track my way to another career but I'm so distracted by all the noise around me. Noise meaning reddit. And sleeping is welcome escape from reality. It's all the same though. I have zero dreams. I only feel good when my favourite basketball team has won games.

But when was the last time I really tried? Like tried to the point of exhaustion. I haven't used my brain in a million years. I know what's worth trying but ugh, I fear failure. I fear failure, full stop. I'm not scared at the prospect of someone blowing my brains out and totally disappearing from the face of the earth but I just don't want to get rejected by anything I love. Want to know how that feels? It's reliving every single moment of defeat ever since kindergarten when I fucking got a dart board instead of a gorgeous Barbie for the end of year gift exchange.

You know wanting to cook but the kitchen doesn't want you. Wanting a guy who will turn you down but boo, he doesn't even exist. Yikes. And I'm writing code and designing random stuff not because I enjoy it particularly -- because I can, I taught myself. If my fridge had the capacity to talk, he'd give me a mouthful about the blueberries I haven't touched in a month. I'm writing this crapload of a rant, yeah, as if I can figure something out, get my gears going. But boy I do want someone to relate to this steaming pile of hot shite. What the fuck is going on. I don't need a shrink. But I do have a ton of angst that's bubbling under my tongue. It's very manageable, I don't have intrusive thoughts anymore unlike 2 years ago when I was killing myself thinking of 20 different things at once.

I am not crying about the lack of direction and fulfilment on my side of town, I don't feel sad about anything anymore aside from the thought of my cats dying, but Jesus. I had my  shite pulled together a few months ago. Then I moved to this home and spent the day and night just by my lonesome. My breath stinks every 2-3 hours because I never talk. I bought 3 litres of mouthwash though. But the silence is comforting, I am so used to it now. I prefer it more than having to put up with human beings. Prefer. I don't prefer getting off by myself but damn if I can get the job done and deal with no consequence they yipee ki yay, motherfucker. My friends. I don't even know what to say to them. Hi? Sorry I'm a turtle who can't be arsed to drop you a line and explain that not talking feels better than talking?

But wow  I'm now a self-watering plant. Very low maintenance. This is some hydroponic automatic hydration system shite powered by the mind. Congratulations, you played yourself. Have a doughnut because KitKat isn't enough.

If the world is ending tomorrow what am I going to do today?

Call my mum and tell her I love her. And find someone to fuck after. Preferably two guys because it's hard to find three. I hope they don't argue about who orals who. What a way to end it all though if they wound up having sex with each other and leaving me out to dry.

33,"TL;DR one of the people on the Reddit [Suspicious Account list](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts)  is not suspicious at all!  

[in reply to this announcement] (https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/)

I'm going to tell this as a bit of a personal narrative: 

I've been an amateur researcher of the Russian Troll Farm (Internet Research Agency) and when Twitter sent its list of IRA accounts to the House Intel Committee and the Dems [published it](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/exhibit_b.pdf) I decided to go through it 

I noticed that one account was far older than the rest and started to post about it on twitter, when out of the blue an account contacted me claiming it was one of his other accounts and convinced me he was who he said he was and not a troll at all [Twitter link](https://twitter.com/iPad_App_Bugs/status/926198883113426944) 

After becoming convinced that Robby was who he said he was, an American living in the country of Georgia who enjoyed taking pictures and bug hunting, I reached out to a reporter at Motherboard who wrote this article: [Robert Delaware is now part of the Congressional record, despite having no apparent ties to Russia.](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8x5mma/twitter-told-congress-this-random-american-is-a-russian-propaganda-troll)

Twitter restored his account in light of the article but never told the House Intel Committee about it, meaning he is still listed as a troll in the congressional record (eat your heart out /b/) 

Reddit when looking to ban accounts compared the House Twitter list against Reddit's users and banned accounts that matched, including Robby's [https://www.reddit.com/user/RobbyDelaware](https://www.reddit.com/user/RobbyDelaware) 

A simple read of his account would include that recently he posted the Motherboard article in the AMA thread with Ben Popken, one of the NBC reporters who worked with researches to publish the Twitter archives of IRA trolls. 

I have no reason to currently believe any of the other accounts on the Twitter or Reddit list are errors but to error is to human and it could have *happened* doesn't take away that most of the narrative around the IRA is true",11Apr2018,0
34,"They married in their 60s about 10 years ago. He had lost his first wife a few years back due to breast cancer and my Grandmother had been divorced from my biological Grandfather for over 20 years and in and out of numerous toxic relationships before settling down with my Step-Grandfather. 

In a weird twist of fate roughly 3 years ago, my Step-Grandfather got breast cancer like his first wife. Super rare in men, but treatable. Well, over the years him &amp; my Grandmother got healthy together. They were happy and he was the best thing for her. She lost over a 100 pounds with him which was well needed and he in numerous respects probably saved my Grandmother's life.

As of yesterday he was in remission from the breast cancer for several months now and took a two-week vacation to visit my great aunt in Florida with my Grandmother. They had a first class ticket and a stop over in North Carolina. On the 2nd flight my Grandfather got up to go use the restroom. About an hour goes by and my Grandmother wakes up from a nap realizing he's not back yet, from the restroom.

They get the restroom door opened and he's deceased. They tried to revive him. No luck. My aunt who lives near my grandmother's destination is called as an emergency contact and the airline gives no information except that there's been an emergency and they need to get to the airport ASAP. 

Apparently the airline made no emergency stops or anything, no reason to I guess he was dead and getting my Grandmother to the destination with her family made the most sense, but jeez, they were two hours away from landing so they brought these privacy screens and put them around my Grandma's &amp; Grandpa's seats and let my Grandmother sit next to him for two hours while he was already gone. 

Makes my stomach turn.

Paramedics arrived onboard to get the body (feels weird calling him that) and well, the whole family is in shock right now. I live 8hours away from the rest of the family as does my mother. Last night my boyfriend and I collected the dog from my mom and early this morning my mom got on the road to drive 8hours to my Grandmother.

I just turned 30 and I still have dreams of giving the touring musician life a shot, and I feel like by pursuing a trade that I don't particularly like, I'm living a lie, but like I'm too scared to take the risk and work a shittier job and focus on music for a while.

I'm also dating a new girl in my tiny town who is amazing and it would suck to leave her and move to a bigger city, but I feel like it might come to that.

42,"So here's the deal.  Back in February I purchased a Nintendo Switch, a Switch Pro Controller, 4 Switch games, a MicroSD card, and a 3 year product protection plan for the Switch from Best Buy... all in all I spent a little over $1000 dollars in their store.

They gave me a receipt and on the receipt was a survey link with a chance to win a $1000 store gift card.  I have never done one of these surveys in my life and I had no intention on doing this one either.

Then, about two weeks goes by, and for whatever reason my YouTube autoplay picked an unboxing video for one of the Switch games I purchased... Cave Story.  I didn't even mean to watch this video and I was going to change it but I glanced at the thumbnails for all the other Cave Story unboxing videos.

I noticed that all these people got a cheap rubber keychain in a cheap polyester drawstring bag.  I hadn't opened my copy of Cave Story yet but since it was going to have free shit I raced to open it.

I had no keychain.

So for a laugh I decided to do the survey but with a completely disproportionate emotional response... I essentially treated this most minor of transgressions as if Best Buy had just decided to annex Poland.

I didn't outright lie in my survey... I just exaggerated my emotional response.  The kernel of truth my exaggerated emotional response hinged on was the lack of pack in inserts and how long I had to wait to get some help from a rep.

I get an email from the store manager... I ghost him.  He sends more emails.  I ignore them.  Finally, he sends a 4th email that has piqued my interest.

&gt; Hi /u/Mattson,

 

&gt; Sorry for the delay in response.  I did read through the response a couple of times, I always ask simply to ensure that I’ve got all the information correct.  I know I cannot go back and change the experience you had, but I can see if I am able to find you the items that were supposed to come with your purchase.

 

&gt; I’d also like to be able to give some money back to you for all the trouble and the inconvenience you’ve had.  I know there were some extra games you had purchased when you bought your console that you hadn’t intended on buying.  If you are open to it, I’d like to reimburse you for one of those games.  Like I said, I will also see what I can do to get my hands on the key chain inside the drawstring bag.

 

&gt; Again, my apologies for the delay in this response and my apologies for the experience in our store.  Please let me know if you are open to this.

 

&gt; Thank you for your time.

 

&gt; Best regards,

 

&gt; [Name Redacted]

&gt;General Manager

So my plan is to accept this offer by responding to the email while I'm in the parking lot of the Best Buy then immediately go to the counter and ask for a 'reimbursement' and reference these emails he's sent me.

Would it be wrong to accept this offer?  I did have a bad experience but I completely hammed up my emotional response.",11Apr2018,0

48,"Throwaway.

I'm a huge geek out of college. I work now for a large company.

A month ago I had to wake up and attend a webinar from home. Our largest client was on it, as well as half of our higher ups in our company.

I took a shower beforehand, and when I got out, I dried myself with my towel, threw it in the hamper, then I looked at my phone.

Holy shit, it starts NOW. I can't be late.

My laptop is in the living room, my bedroom is all the way across the house and upstairs. Shit.

I panicked, leaving my towel in the hamper, put on my glasses, and went running in my birthday suit in a panic to the living room.

Log in now, show I'm there, and get dressed right after.

I logged in, and clicked the video icon to start the presentation, and then right there was my nightmare as the screen opened.

There I was, in HD on screen.

I was NAKED.

I'm a virgin at 22. And here I am, all my secrets exposed for 35 people to see if they just glanced at their computer screens.

Eyes wide, mouth open for 5 seconds. My 5'6 bare body on screen. Lily-white from the neck down. A smattering of hair on my chest and rounded belly. Not ""fat"" but definitely a belly on a geek who never hits the gym. 

And my 4 inch limp penis for the world to see.

In a panic, I spammed the icon to turn off the cam, and all it did was maximize it.

In pure fear, I clamped a hand over my penis and balls, turned my big, round, bare white butt towards the camera (my friend Ashley always teases that I have a ""bubble butt"" that she says I'm ""hiding"" under my ""nerdy khakis"" all the time) and ran out of the room for cover.

I came back, fully dressed. Everything was fine. No laughter. No commotion. Nobody must have been paying attention before the training started.

After it ended, I received an email from Mrs. Jenson, the (very attractive, and very married) 47 year old Senior Vice President:

""Next time don't go traipsing around your house with absolutely nothing on before a big meeting. You're lucky nobody else saw. Don't worry, I won't tell your boss, naked boy. Nice BUTT! haha.""

49,"It could be because I heard it was a sad story before I watched it? I can only say that I wasn't affected emotionally as much as how others portray themselves who watched the movie. I didn't cry or feel like it was especially tragic story.

I used to think it was because I don't hold much sympathy for Japanese especially during the WW2 era but really I think it boils down to ""I've heard this before"". Growing up, I read/heard stories like Graves if the Firefly all the time. In Korea, not Japan obviously, but people who survived as orphans, lying in the subway stations barely kept alive by scraps given to them from strangers. Cuddling up next to a new-found friend for warmth, only to wake up to find that they had died. I remember during some Korean leadership camp here in US, a Korean senator came to speak and told us how he was a war orphan and witnessed his friend kill himself by throwing himself on the oncoming subway train because he couldn't keep going anymore.

Anyways, I guess my point is, I always feel bad when people talk about Graves of the Firefly cause I was like meh about it. I think it's because it's just a movie while I've met people who went through the exact things in person, talked to them, etc., that I don't feel as impacted as some other people.

Also isn't it crazy how tragic stories some watch on the big screen is only a recent memory to others?",11Apr2018,1
50,"People of reddit, I need you! I’ve only been a user on reddit for a few days now but I love the anonymity and freedom to post feelings and thoughts without anyone knowing who I am. 

I’m gonna summarise this as best I can but I guarantee this is gonna be another me spewing my thoughts out into the wild post. 

I’m a 20 year old British guy and I’m not out yet. I’ve known for over 10 years and I still can’t fully accept it. It’s completely crushing for me and, as I said in another post, my life is like a rollercoaster. Some days I feel like I’m ready to be who I am and others I completely hate what I am and just want it to all go away. Appearance wise and personality wise I’m very hetero to the point where people actually accuse me of being homophobic. That all began because I get awkward whenever the topic is brought up, so people assume I’m homophobic and would never in a million years guess it’s because I’m actually that way inclined. I’ve become so good at keeping my secret that even when I’m drunk I’m able to keep up the act. 

I got a family who (most of which) I dislike and they dislike me back. The biggest clashes I have in my family are with my mum and brother. I can’t stand either of them and they’re constantly pushing a negative image of me to anyone who knows me. I do have an uncle who’s out but he’s very camp, the complete opposite to me, and we also dislike each other. I’m at the point where genuinely I want to move away and tell no one (more on that in a bit). I also don’t have that many close friends and I wanna make new friends but I’m honestly not sure how to. 

Back to the moving away and telling nobody. I really want to move to America (California is the dream) but I have no idea where to start and how much a change like that would cost. Equally I’m keen to pursue a career in acting and have been looking at universities/colleges in California (but I’m again lost in terms of how to get to that stage). 

I just wanna move away, make new friends, find that someone and be happy for once. Does anyone out there have advice on this? Any advice on how a Brit can study at an American uni (how does it happen, can you get funding etc). 

Any advice, please, anyone!

My grandpa is 92, almost 93 this year. He is active and he takes time to drive out to my family's house everyday to pick up his Chinese newspaper (my mom is born in Vietnam, but her parents were both born in China). My grandmother died 6 years ago. I was in Illinois celebrating my birthday with my dad and my brother. Later in the day, after being really happy to see the Lego Discovery center in Chicago, my dad gets a phone call. We get back to the hotel and we rest a bit. He lays the news that my grandma had passed away. I was absolutely destroyed. I was mad at myself for not being near. 

I was sitting at my family's computer, playing some games on it. I was in a tight situation in the game, when my grandpa touched my arm to say hi to me like he does every time he comes over. I was focused into my game and all I can think about is that I needed to hurry this up. I always give him a hug every time I see him. I give him a hug when he comes in, I give him one when he leaves. I give him one and I try to get it over with as quick as possible. He says goodbye and I say bye back. My team and I lose the game, since what we had to do was really difficult. That was the moment when it hits me. I can't do this. This is wasting my time. I was very careless in wanting to hug him and say bye to him. I focus way too much on winning in the game which has no true impact on me. I should have been doing something better that I could have shifted my focus however much I wanted. He would sometimes ask if I wanted to go to get lunch every other week. He gives so much, and yet I do this. He may not have as much time on Earth as me, but he is using his time to spend it with me, and I don't do anything. It just makes me feel bad. I want to be there for him. I can't spend my time like this when someone is using theirs on me. My brother is up at college and only comes down on certain weekends in the month.
