0,"I understand what an alcoholic is. And I never really drank much. Went years without having a drink except for weddings and or an occasional night out. BUT now I'm drinking regularly. I am in my 40s and last year my mother was diagnosed with cancer. So between traveling back and forth to her and trying to spend time with my husband, the alcohol became a nice wind down and let loose once a week. My husband would smoke a joint and I would drink 6 pack of wine coolers while sitting out back during the summer. Then I decided that the wine coolers weren't that high in alcohol content and just sugar! So I switched to a bottle of red wine. Then I started drinking earlier on Saturdays, my drinking time became 4PM instead of 8 or nine, and because of that I needed 2 bottles of wine. Now I find myself wanting it all the time and 4 pm is now 3 pm. And today is the first time I'm drinking on a work night! Tomorrow is a big event at work and I've been on vacation all week. I've been letting loose every other day. And here I am polishing off a bottle and a half of wine, my reasoning is, it's still earlier, I can feel fine in the morning. I think overall it has to do with the sugars and not just the alcohol... but still. I want to add... I've never felt guilty about drinking. I have always been able to do whatever I needed to the next day. I don't cancel plans. I know in my mind what an alcoholic is...

But I still wonder... am I becoming one?",21May2018,1

2,"I worked a full time job so I went to school part time. I took two classes a semester.  It took me four years to get a two year degree. 

Because of my poor planning, 3/28 of the classes I took will transfer into a bachelors degree.  I wasted four years of my life getting that degree. 



My degree is in IT. I’ve had my associates for a year now and yet no IT Job. I’ve had one interview for an internship and I didn’t even get that even though I was spot on with all of their questions.   

I just quit my fulltime job of 3.5 years because the management team was seriously cancer and I finally cracked.  Now I have no job. I have a degree that has done nothing for me, and if I want to continue that degree and I keep up my trend of working full time while going to school it’ll take me like six years to get my bachelors since I’m starting from scratch, plus 100k. An associates in IT can’t get me hired so who’s to say a bachelors will? Then I’ll be out 100k and also no job. 

Where’s the positivity in this situation? Should I jump for joy that I wasted four years of my life? “You’re open to new opportunities” Should I tell my landlord “I don’t have the money to pay my rent but let me sprinkle some positive vibes in your hand because i have new opportunities” ",21May2018,5

Friday night, I realised this is taking a toll on my body. I freaked out and cried until I fell asleep. Yesterday we decided to clean up. I'm not withdrawing but my partner is. We both have jobs to keep so cold turkey isn't really doable - the withdrawals are too bad for them to be able to show up to work. So we're starting to taper down - doing just a little bit to keep the withdrawals under control. I don't have any experience with drug addiction.

6,"Specifically genetic engineering, becoming transhumance cyborgs, or the best one \- jumping into parallel universes. I'm gonna copy and paste something I wrote somewhere else for why I want genetic engineering:

\&gt; I could see it as having the same implications as plastic surgery \(to a way higher degree\)without the dangers of invasive surgery. ***I have one shot at life so I don't know why I should be forced to live one that I don't want.*** I think acceptance is bull shit. If there's a chance I can change my circumstances for the better than I'm not gonna let puritan bs stop me. Like I said, it's basically the only thing that I have hope on. I've heard that you can't exactly transform an adult with this but I'm hoping there will be something like that further in the future. Further down the comments someone pointed out that nature takes out portions of the population who have inferior genes. I don't think anyone could argue that. At that point, why is it wrong for someone to commit suicide because they will never leave a legacy? Should we force them to live 80 years \(or less since their genes will probably kill them sooner\) of depression just so we can pimp them for decades of their labor \(for empty cash that they wouldn't enjoy\)?

7,"Story quickly:

Girl (24F) hooked up with me(25M) as her rebound, but kept hooking up and trying to get to know me. Turned into dates. Treated me boyfriend-like, it was very cute and nice. Months later, cuts me off for a few weeks. Breaks up with me. 'Not ready for relationship'.

She reaches out, flirts, and talks with me in the interrim. We go on a hike, and get back together. Three more months of the same - I'm more cautious, but have a few date moments that go over super well that trick my stupid head.

We go out for a nice night on the town that involved her getting in a car with a powerful older man in her industry, him making a pass at her, and me being totally over this shit. After she fought him off, she begged me to sleep over and take care of her. She (finally) said she loved me, and I slept over. 

She proceeded to then cut me off from texting and refused to give hard no's on any meetups or communication what-so-ever. Needless to say, I broke up with her. This is rediculous.

Its been two months since then. She's in my community, and when she sees me, she's all smiles and flirty but if I flirt back it ""makes her sad"". I finally insisted HARD on space - which made her mad, and then she eventually conceded and said she ""just wished we could stay friends.""

I've had two months of nightmares, panic attacks and still thinking about her. I have listed out all the bad shit so I don't idealize it but I just can't figure out how to kill the feelings. Its frustrating. I just feel so hopeless and spiraling out of control constantly. I even avoid my community, and that hobby all together because she's around so often. I've quit social media. Its hard. I don't know what to do.",21May2018,0
9,"I’ve always been a lurker on here but I’ve never posted so I’m not sure if this is even the right place to post this. I just really need advice because I’m worried to talk to anyone about this. So a little background: A year ago I dated this guy for quite a while. We broke up because he flirted with other girls and I was super insecure, but that’s a different story. There was this one girl in particular I felt pretty threatened by the whole relationship, and the last straw was when she became his number one best friend on Snapchat. (Obviously not the reason we broke up, I wouldn’t have been super upset by it but it just broke the camels back). I know it sounds ridiculous but she was just always a problem in our relationship, people would tell me he was rediculously and obviously flirting with her at games, he would like every scandalous picture of her she posted when I had already talked to him about it. So yah, that whole thing just made me feel really shitty like I wasn’t good enough for him and it was just always a reminder that she was so much better than me. 

We broke up, and my guy best friend was with me the whole time. I told him time and time again how I felt about my ex and that girl and how it made me feel really crappy. Fast forward a year and for the last month or two my guy best friend has been obsessed with the same girl. It’s a weird situation because I’m still friends with her. But he talks about her ALL THE TIME and tells me how hot she is and how he loves her. I’ve been so so bothered by this lately because he knows how hard that whole situation was for me. Sometimes I feel like I’m blowing everything out of proportion and there’s no reason for me to be upset because it was a long time ago, but I just feel like I’m going through my last relationship all over again, and there’s just always that reminder that I’ll never be good enough for a guy in my life, and eventually I’ll be replaced.

11,"May twentieth marks the end of the first and last time I will ever try to create a friendship over someone online in what I would call such an informal manner of introduction. You found her by scrolling through the names on the Discord server. You got there from some subreddit that you found out of curiosity if there was any way to find someone to talk to on one of your favorite sites to procrastinate with. You came in way too strong. So many people come to talk casually and saying that you’re not looking for a relationship with them while at the same time trying to have deep meaningful conversations with them says otherwise. And you’re shit at small talk. I can’t believe you even replied “I don’t know” when she asked you what you’re plans were. Anything, saying that you were going to binge-watch anime and not shower would’ve even sounded better than “I don’t know”. Look at you, Mr., “oh, look at me, I’m so lonely, you’re the first girl that I’ve ever had a real conversation with in a long while, I’m so sad, but at the same time such an intellectual, oh I’m such a tortured soul, oh, pity me”.

Makes me just depressed, so depressed. And angry. And annoyed. And sad. And lonely.

The last time you had a good time all out of your own doing was that last day of school in which you played music during Mr. Mavis’s class in that Spanish final that you didn’t have and danced out of the period with your table group singing Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’”. Or, I forget, maybe it could’ve been “Allstar” by Smashmouth. But yeah, the table group was Skyler and Abe, and Tina and Allie had decided to walk with us boys that day. It was a sentimental day it was. That was, during sixth period, and after that was the five minute break before seventh period.

Whatever it was, that was the last time you were that happy.

I think I tried to missed the bus that day, so that I could walk home. No, I missed it because I needed to turn in a lab report the final day of school. I remember that because I actually ran through the halls to try and beat the clock. I didn’t beat it so I had to walk home, with tons and tons of newspapers weighing me down. They were crammed in backpack, though, almost all of the stuff inside was just newspapers. I had to leave room for other stuff so I had to carry by hand the rest.

It was a 5 mile trek through suburb streets, dirt roads, and gravel paths on a hot day that said summer was upon us. It was manageably uncomfortable, and the only thing different about deciding to walk home that day was that another guy from one of my classes, Gunner, was walking home too. We made some small talk. Then we started talking about music because his had earbuds in and he said he liked listening to the rock band Def Leppard. When he asked me if I knew of them the only thing I draw from my mind about Def Leppard was that there was this one image I remember of all the members holding their fingers up to their mouths and making the “I’m licking a vagina” sign. Awesome. We laughed. We talked a little bit more and then we went our separate ways. We exchanged goodbyes and I said “we’ll talk next year”. I’ve never have talked to him since then. 

You’re 16 y/o boy, man. Stop worrying about everything. You still gotta a long ways to go. Take in things as they come and appreciate them. Sure, but time flies, and it hurts right now. I don’t know.

14,"So recently I'm been feeling unmotivated during my second semester in college after failing a course in CS \(Computer Science\) in my first semester. My first semester was very stressful for me. No matter how much I studied, I always fail assignments or quizzes which made me more depressed. I think it's my study methods weren't so great that I failed. After the exams, I was relieved that I had a week off and was done with the stressful work. It felt a load off my back, despite that I failed one of my exams and failed one of my courses. When second semester come around, I started to feel depressed again.

I'm not sure if I wanted or should continue with CS or college in general. I'm mostly considering myself an artist since I love to draw and drawn since I was a kid. The reason that I picked CS in the first place is because I wanted to do video game development and make games and maybe some software \(Like an app\). I wanted to go for Graphic Design or Video game Development in College, but I was told that for both Graphic Design and Video game Development companies don't care about your degree and that they want to see your portfolio. I figured that I would do Graphic Design on the side and pursue a CS degree.

Now I'm just too unmotivated and depressed to continue college thanks to my stupid mistakes that I did last semester.  I don't know if I should either withdraw or continue with my major? I've also heard that companies for CS look mostly at your portfolio than your degree as well, but I heard it's harder to find a job without a CS degree.

16,"1) Redditors NEVER use the upvote/down votes correctly. Even though you are supposed to down vote truly bad comments, and subreddits TELL YOU that if you don't agree with something, you should no down vote, but say why you don't. To, you know, have a conversation. People will downvote the heck out of something just because they don't agree, even if it's not something bad.

2) Most Redditors are stuck up. Not all, but like 80%. You know how anime/game elitists think that they are the most knowledgeable when it comes to anime/games, and anyone who doesn't share the same opinion is stupid? There are those people on every subreddit.

3) The worst ones are the nerds and showoff's. They are so full of themselves and think that anyone who does less than they do aren't trying hard enough or are dumb. No, Tyler, I don't care that  that you were able to get a Masters Degree while you worked 5 part time jobs, raised 2 kids, had one arm, and got 2 hours of sleep a day.

3) Witch hunts...are so stupid. I remember posting in the Friday 13th subreddit, had to delete the post because I was bombarded with hate because I didn't like something about the game. I'm talking people attacking me, saying I didn't know anything about the game or the movies. And down voting even if I tried to apologize or explain myself.

A molluscum infection that I had to cut out myself
Severe sight threatening allergic reaction in the eyes
Severe bronchitus that almost had me stop breathing at two points

https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/7pzpzt/im_gonna_do_it_next_week/      
(Wow, hello, old me. Yeah I feel your pain. I wish I could say what is about to come for you, but you'll see that I can't. I wish I could stop you from doing certain things. But this is not about those things. Oh no.)      
As you may notice, I didn't do it one week after I posted. First it was her birthday. Then I couldn't do it. Then I thought for a week that my pain was finally over and I wouldn't have to end our friendship. But then the pain came back and it hasn't left me since february. So I decided, with the help of my friends, that I didn't deserve it anymore. Today, at six in the morning (the best hour to send emotionally loaded messages!) I wrote her a note and after a lot of shaking and deliberating I sent it.        
I told her to forgive me for what I was about to do, that I don't see a future where I think about her without feeling bad for a lot of things, that this was for the best and that I love her. Then I blocked her on Instagram and Twitter. I don't have her number and she doesn't have mine so I didn't have to block her number.         
I don't know what will happen next. I feel... strange. A bit happy, a bit relieved. Sad. Worried. Worried that my actions will have consequences. But then I think about it and I'm truly glad that after so long I FINALLY did something about this. I deserved it.

One, cliche but, I’ll probably never see many of them again. 

And two, It makes me feel sad/regretful with my own future.

I really fucked up my college career. I borrowed way too much. I couldn’t pick a major for almost 3 years and now I have 0 motivation to go back to school after taking almost a year off now. I still don’t know what I want to do and the thought of sitting in a classroom any longer makes me absolutely miserable.

I spoke to my advisor not too long ago and they told me it would take another 3 to 5 years at the pace that I am going to get a degree.

Fuck that.

My entire life up until this point I’ve been sitting in a fuckin classroom and there is absolutely no way I can stand another 5 fucking years of it. 

Franky, I don’t even know what I would do with a degree. I already have a full-time job so its not like once I got one, I would start looking for a job. I don’t even know where I would apply or what I would do with it. I would just have it. 

The only reason I would even finish school is to make my parents happy/proud and thats pretty much it. Buuuut, they don’t know that I’ve been taking a lot of time off. They also don’t know I’ve failed 3 of my last 5 classes because I really just can’t find the motivation, especially after a long days work, to sit down and read a book I don’t care about, write an essay I don’t want to write, or do some stupid homework that means nothing to me. 

I haven’t retained a single thing I have learned at college either.

25,"To those who believe birds don’t understand anything about humans. Stop reading!

I was in the court yard at my apartment complex and was just bird watching (each apartment consisted of 4 living quarters for people, two doors extruding from the middle each led to its own living quarters upstairs and 2 doors that were flat to the outer brick walls at ground level, all with sliding doors at the top and bottom and balconies at the top) 

After awhile I walked out of the square and made a right to the outskirts of the external lawn and saw a bird hopping and trying to fly but failing. I made a slow jog toward the bird and it kept hopping and could only muster to fly up to about 2 feet high; then I realized it was because one of its wings was broken. 

I kept walking toward it and it went around to the front lawns; where people’s front doors are located. Then I stopped and let it get as far away from me as it wanted. 

Then half a minute or a minute later some other birds started hovering around it and pecking at it. I watched for a few seconds; then I ran up and shewed them away and the injured bird hopped and tried to fly away from me. It ended up eventually hopping into a bush in the apartment right beside mine. I thought it would be safe there, so I walked around it to my front door and lit up a cigarette and kept an eye on the bush. 

Then a couple minutes later other birds started flying at it and pecking at it in the bush. I was thinking about shewing them away, but then the bird hopped about two feet out of bush; in my direction. Then I went a shewed the aggressing birds away and then I backed away and the injured bird just stayed there. I was about 12 feet away from it. 

About 20 seconds later another bird swooped down with a worm in its mouth and landed by it. The bird looked at me and twitched its head a couple times and then gave the injured bird the worm; then it looked back at me and started tweeting and twitching its head.

I stood there for a minute pondering what just happened; and the gracious bird that gave the injured bird the worm just started walking like a bird does and pecking at the lawn; while the injured bird just hopped  around a couple of times. 

I opened my door, took one last look at the birds; then shut the door. I went and layed down in my room for around five minutes and thought about what just happened. Then, I decided I had to go back outside to see if they were still there.

And they were both gone.

Witnessing this definitely affected my life and changed the way I look at birds in general. They seem to have more understanding and maybe even emotion than we give them credit for.

My siblings were the complete opposite in some aspects but he seemed to be tougher on me &amp; I suppose at a subconscious level I resented him for that.

35,"I think I summed up my problem really well in the title. I am 22 years old now. I just don't have anyone to tell this to. I would be nice if I had someone to tell ""Hey, my friends ghosted me, it's my birthday, I am sitting alone. Want to eat some pizza or go out or something? I can't eat almost anything, but I am sure we can have some fun.""..."" Why they ghosted me? I don't know. Well, maybe I do. A friend of mine sent me a conspiracy theory and I spent 30 minutes researching it and I sent him a long message debunking it. I think he got mad since he hasn't replied since. Earlier he invited me to spend some time together. We also had agreed that he will call me when he gets back to hometown. After debunking his conspiracy theory, he hasn't contacted me in a month and we haven't met as we planned before."".

37,"I’m a 20 y/o Male, where to start... Sophomore year of high school I started dating this girl let’s call her Rachel, for about 3 years during this time, she had this habit of when something didn’t go her way for the day she would shut down, seriously,  complete silent treatment towards everyone until she figured out the situation I suppose, to this day I’ve never seen something like it, best way to describe it... if you walked into the room with no info prior, you could just feel the negative energy, which every time we would hangout with a group of people it turned everyone off, especially my friends,  which I’ll admit I got busy with the relationship and turned into a bad friend because I was terrible with delegating my time... Fast forward to 5 months out of high school, her parents are gone for the weekend, she asked me to spend the night in which I did, we slept together Friday, Saturday and then Sunday “she was going to sleep at a friends” won’t need me to spend the night, I hug her we both tell each other we love each other, I kiss her and go on my way... To be completely honest in that moment I felt like I was on cloud 9, I loved that girl so fucking much, later that night I got a weird intuition feeling my stomach felt like knots... Curiosity was killing me and I asked a buddy to come with me because I just wanted to see if she happened to be lying, at 9 pm that’s when everything would change (her window faces the street) saw the dude with gym shorts and his shirt off...I was about to leave but then I said fuck it I want her to know I was here... go and knock on the door she continues to lie saying she’s not home and then finally just says please don’t hurt yourself... Never heard from her again that night... Ended up forgiving her which I feel really stupid for doing, even to this day.... Since then I’ve been in this funk, I feel like I’ve completely wasted my time, the friends in our same group have chosen her over me, none of them even asked if I was okay or anything, I know I sound like an attention whore, I’ve stopped communication with my ex but I don’t have anyone anymore anytime I try to reach out to anyone I’ve been getting ghosted it’s been like this since the beginning of the year, I’m losing hope, my life right now is school and work I don’t even know how to treat my depression anymore I just feel numb....Just when you think you have everything planned out, life tells you otherwise... thank you for reading ",21May2018,1

My boyfriend is in recovery. He says the root of his cheating was him stopping work on himself and going back to a self centered mind set. He has been very supportive since crawling back. Letting me know it wasn't my fault, and that the issue lies with him. He listens when I'm sad and take my anger. We are in therapy, both individual and couples.

It just kills me that it happened. He told her such intimate details about me. It's not even the sex, it's that he shared with her what I only shared with a few people in my life. He used my pain to put me down and elevate her. When it was going on he told me how he loved her more, told me how happy she made him, how much she wanted him...

He lied for months. And we haven't even been together long. He lied most of the time we were together. The pain come crashing down in waves. I did not deserve that. No one deserved that.

We are basically living together now. I'm not even sure how that happened. Things manage to feel both right and wrong at the same time.

45,"I just had a dream that every part of my personality came to me as different people. The dream started off with me still in my bed, eyes closed, and i remember having my thoughts taken over by what sounded like a gospel choir singing worship music. I remember one of the lyrics being ""he will come, seated on his throne. Then a person showed up somewhere in my bedroom, stared me down, then stabbed me. After that death I woke up again, to see another person that stared me down, then proceeded to stab me. This kept happening with every death. The people were completely alien to me to, I didnt recognize one of them, yet they seemed like they've known me forever. The second to last one i remember screaming very loud for my foster parent, who came and opened the door, stared me down and pointed at me saying ""No"". At the end of the dream, I saw what I think was myself, yet he looked nothing like me. He seemed more calm, and he actually greeted me rather than staring me down, and I asked him if he'd let me go. And he did, i asked where all the others came from, then he simply nodded his head as if saying ""you"", then I woke up",21May2018,1
46,"I'm posting this now, it'll become apparent why at the end.

I'm a British student. More than a year ago I got contacted by a Australian girl at my uni, let's call her Rachel, she had written a sketch that had gotten into a local sketch show, she knew I had done comedy stuff before and wanted me to perform it with her. She was funny and smart, if a bit shy, and had a suprisingly dark sense of humour for someone so quiet. We did a few more sketches over the next month. Unfortunately, she had Crohns' disease, and her detiorating health forced her to go back home.

I would later learn I was the fifth or sixth person she had contacted. I always think it's ironic, as this chance friendship has proved to be the most important thing that has happened to me.

Fast forwoard to last summer, 10 months ago. I was interning in London for a company who creates ads on Google searches. 8 hours a day of wrangling with PHP code. It was suprisingly fun. At a certain point, \(I can't remember when\) Rachel made spontaneous contact with me. We spoke for a few days, \(I'm not a very social person, but I'm happy to chat\)  before she explained why she made contact with me: she was being physically and verbally abused by her mother.

Over the course of the next few months, I witnessed, and attempted to provide support, as Rachel's home situation steadily grew worse. Rachel was expected to return to university at the end of the summer, and her Mother's abuse intensified as the date got closer. Her Mother was clearly mentally ill, and blamed Rachel for stealing her money and her time, of leeching off of her, of conspiring against her. She let out this rage by controlling Rachel, banning her from cooking or eating her food, \(so Rachel had to use up her dwindling student loan savings on one fast food meal a day\) and  entering manic states when these rules were broken, states that involved wandering around the house muttering, screaming at Rachel to kill herself, and physical abuse, including beating. Once, she stabbed Rachel in the hand with a kitchen knife, cutting down to muscle, and whispered, ""Something to remember me by""

I wanted to call the police, I tried to pressure her to. I called an abuse hotline instead, and they said there was nothing I could do but listen. So I did listen. Sneaking away at work breaks \(11pm in Australia\) to talk to her as her mother entered another abusive spiral. Towards the end of the summer, it became increasingly clear to me Rachel was never going to make it on the plane back to the UK. How could she? Her mother was obsessed with the fact she was using her money, she was starving to death, barely sleeping, and developing trauma\-related compulsions, including obsessive handwashing and public panic attacks.

Well, she did make it, and more. When she arrived in the UK, she revealed to me she'd changed her name, erased herself from the records of a large number of constitutions, and all in secret, without her Mother having a clue.

I'm telling this story because I think it's important with reference to what happens next. Rachel \(now Jenny\) was a brave, intelligent, and determined woman. She escaped a situation that would have destroyed anyone else, and managed to protect herself in the process.

The next few weeks of being back together at university went well, but things began to detiorate. It became apparent Jenny was suffering from PTSD, experiencing nightmares, panic attacks, and the occasional dissociative episode. She broke contact with her Mother about 4 weeks after arriving back in the UK, emailing that she had changed her name and didn't want to speak again. At the same time, she had to navigate the unsympathetic university welfare program, where things were said to her like, ""I'd be devastated if my daughter did that to me.""

Over the course of the Christmas holiday, she stayed with me and my parents, even coming to Christmas with our extended family. She would have PTSD attacks occasionally, and I learnt what to do when this happens, \(""Jenny, you are having a PTSD attack, but it is only temporary, and I am here, with you, to support you through it, so you are having a PTSD attack right now, but I am here with you, and you are here, with me, in the living room, Jenny, you are having a PTSD attack...""\). Her obsessive handwashing developed into OCD, gradually morphing into a need to repeat actions if she had a flashback while doing them, she also became depressed, experiencing periods of suicidal thoughts.

At the end of our first term, Jenny revealed she had booked a sketch show for us. I had expressed an enthusiasm for to do a sketch show together, but wasn't aware she'd gone ahead and got us a venue. We spent a lot of time preparing for this show, but the rehearsal processs became very strained and irritable, as I beleived I hadn't really agreed to the show and was trying to manage other hobbies at the same time. In retrospect I should've just said no, rather than committ to something I wasn't enthuastic about, and this came back to bite me when in the first few weeks of our second term, I glibly said, ""I don't think this matters as much to me as it does to you.""

This hurt Jenny a lot, and she got close to cancelling the show. I apologised profusely and we gritted our teeth through the performance. We got a 2\-star review, entirely unexpected. It was our first real falling out.

Jenny's mental health continued to detoriorate. One time when we were working together in my room she fell into a PTSD attack, I tried to help her but she was in too deep, so I attempted to get back to work. Then, out of no where, she started to punch herself in the head. I panicked and ran over to her, grabbing her hand and holding it away from her head, her hands flailed, trying to bat me away, ""Please stop."" I whimered, ""Jenny, please stop.""

This event became commonplace. It was just an expected part of her PTSD routine, she'd have an attack, start hitting herself, and I'd restrain her until she relaxed. Eventually, she'd surface enough to maybe cry out for help, and I'd come in and repeat my PTSD script until she recovered. It was emotionally exhausting. I bacame irritable, lashing out at friends and collapsing academically. I encouraged her to reach out for other support networks, but she didn't want anyone to know, and distrusted the college welfare system. So it fell on me. I convinced myself things would get better, it's only temporary, it's PTSD, it's just temporary.

She stayed with my family again over easter, but now the dynamic was completely different. My parents had broken up and my Mother had moved out, the house was empty most of the time and all our relationships were strained. Jenny's mental illness became all\-consuming, her PTSD attacks became daily, and she developed a new form of attack, a depressive episode, in which she'd become angry and self loahing, and lash out and me while seemingly repeating everything her mother had once said to her. I begged her to start anti depressents, but she wouldn't listen, so I told her that if she didn't I would not be able to help her anymore.

Midway through second term, she had messaged me telling me she was going to kill herself ""tonight"". I panicked and called the nurse, who told the college staff, who came into Jenny's room during the act of self\-harm, made her take off her top to check for scars, and then made her call 111 and make an apointment with the doctor for antidepressent medication. She had left the doctor's appointment feeling very confident, and went straight to Boots to pick up her perscription. But she never could manage to start, knwoing that once she started, she would not be allowed to stop, and concerned about the negative effects antidepressants have on a small proportion of people. This meant, when she was staying at mine in Easter term, she had the anti depressents in her suitcase, all she had to do was swallow one pill.

My emotional blackmail, however, didn't work. And it fell on my Dad to give Jenny a talk and motivate her to start the perscription. My Dad has been an amazing help throughout this entire process, and his level\-headedness saved the day. Jenny agreed to take the medication.

Unfortunately, she was in the small proportion for whom the medication affected negatively. Over the rest of the holiday, Jenny's condition got even worse, the PTSD, panic, OCD and depressive attacks became continuous, to the point at which she was scraping only four or five sober hours each day. I tried to support her through these, but I became angry and irritable when my help didn't work, especially during the depressive episodes, when she would rant about how she hated me, and herself, and tell me that I didn't care about her and wanted her dead. One time, she hit herself so frequently I had to tie her hands behind her back, and then a pillow around her head. When I had a moment to myself, I would just sob, curling on the floor and weeping out of sheer panic.

Now we come to a few months ago, the start of exam term. Me and Jenny's relationship had become so toxic it was irrepairable. I was no longer able to respond to her problems properly, giving only hollow ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" responses when she explained what terrible things she had experienced or felt that day. When I wasn't emotionally available enough, she would become abusive, telling to just come out and say it if I didn't care about her. She suggested it was best for us to break contact for the exam period, and I \(enthusiastically\) agreed. We had a final, almost normal, conversation in a cafe nero, similar to the coffee shop in which I had said goodbye to her when she left for Austrailia, we chatted shit about music and laughed, I remembered the sweet, mildly morbid girl I had first collaborated with.

A few days after this conversation, I began hitting myself on the head. It happened largely by instinct, like a reflex or a twitch, and it got progressively worse, until I went to the nurse. Three of my close friends had taken over supporting Jenny for me, and as I was talking about one of them I burst into tears. I wasn't worried for him, I was realising the size of what she had been through, ""The vastness of it."" I wept, ""The sheer scale of it.""

Jenny remade contact many times over the next few weeks, each time the interaction went the same, she tell me a list of bad things that happened to her, I'd say I was very sorry for her, and then she'd ask me to just tell her if I didn't care about her, and threaten suicide. Eventually, I blocked her. First on facebook, then on the other \(Rachel\) facebook account, then on mobile, and finally, a few days ago, on email.

Meanwhile, the three friends that were looking after Alex formed a group chat with me where we talked about what best to do. One of my freinds reported she had read the chat when he left his laptop open to go make tea. I didn't care that much.

Today, she messaged this to my group chat with all my freinds, ""Hi CriticallyAlmost,  Since you refuse to talk to me \- I just wanted to let you know that I read the chat you were a part of and your comments including 'wiping your hands with me'. I wish you'd been able to say this in person but it has made things extremely clear for me. I know anything you've said to me in the past about how I have value as a person has been lies. You weren't my friend I only put you in a position where you felt morally obliged to help me as you are not defective like me. You saw what I truly am. I deserve what I got in Australia and should've ended things earlier.  I know I have no value as a human being and am fundamentally not fit to be alive.""

I've not replied, and don't intend to. The college knows about this message, the staff are aware of her situation and my friends are supporting her.

I think she will be dead or hospitalised within a few months.

I think often about the thought experiemnt, if someone was drowing in a lake, and you were the only person who could save them, but you were wearing very expensive shoes, should you take off your shoes first?

54,"I get into these bouts of depression and intense anxiety. It happens once a month or so and lasts for a week. During that time, I slowly descent into misery and self-hatred. I feel it coming on, I see it happening, I try to stop it, but it doesn't help.

I'm leaving for business for a few days tomorrow and that makes things a million times worse because I won't have my usual things to keep me from things getting worse. Last time my business trip and these depression periods coincided, I couldn't sleep a single night, I couldn't do any work, and all I could think about was how to get out.

I never drink alcohol because I'm afraid I'll become an alcoholic (my father had issues with alcohol and I tend to have an addictive personality) but on my trips, I tend to drink as much as I can, making things worse.

Right now, I feel all alone...despite the fact that my kids that love me are at home, despite my wife who supports me through these things is at home, and despite the fact that one of my closest friends is here for me, too. 

There is a photo of Chester Bennington (the Linkin Park singer) the night before he committed suicide. He's smiling, he's with his family, he's surrounded by people he loves, and from what I've read, he had plans with his bandmates. Yet, he killed himself...

I think about this depression and anxiety, and I think about the fact that despite surrounded by these people, despite having friends and people to reach out to, I feel alone and anxious. I look at my shibari rope and wonder if my upstairs railing could hold my weight should I hang myself.

I think about how if I could just change a couple of things, I could feel better and I know that it's not true. I already fixed those ""couple of things"" and I don't feel better. I fixed other things and I don't feel better. And recently, I realized that whatever I ""fix"", it won't matter. I'll still get into this funk that makes me want to jump off a bridge.

I should mention that despite having suicidal thoughts, I'm not at risk. I know I won't do it, and I am seeing a therapist. I have problems in my life but none of those should make me feel the way I do -- if that makes sense. I had a difficult childhood and that sucks and it's responsible for a lot of what I go through as an adult but I'm working through it.
