0,"I don't know what I did to deserve this. I thought we were in love, I thought we were best friends, I know you were mine, I guess you didn't care that much though. What kind of person blocks somebody who cares deeply about them? All I wanted was to know how you were doing, if you were okay, if you were feeling better, I wanted to know what I could do to help, I wanted to be there for you the way you were always there for me. You helped me see that love exists and I wanted to return that, because I saw deep pain in you that was dragging you down with it. If I'd known that Valentine's Day was the last time I'd ever see you, I don't know, I think I would have acted differently. I probably would have appreciated you more, even the times when you annoyed me, when you tried to kiss me in Starbucks and I kind of ignored you because of my social anxiety and embarrassment about displays of affection, and you got upset and got in your head that you were old and ugly because you're 12 years older than I am, and I tried to get you to come back just because I didn't want you to be hurting. If I'd known that was the last day of our time together I would've given you everything, all that you wanted. But I didn't know, it just sort of ended. You just stopped responding to me and I kept trying to reach out because I love you and I care about you so fucking much and you responded by blocking me. And then I was so angry, not at myself, not at you, but at everything, just angry, that I opened my knife and slashed my right arm four times and made four really deep cuts, deeper than I'd ever gone before I'd even met you back when cutting was a regular weekly thing. That was over four months ago and the scars are still red and every day I see them and I worry about people at work seeing them. I stopped posting here for a long time because I didn't want you to know if I was still alive, I wanted to keep you in suspense and make you worry and wonder if I'd killed myself or something, I wanted your mind to run wild with the worst possibilities because that's exactly what you did to me in February and since then. I wanted to hurt you the way you hurt me. You knew this was my first relationship, my first time with a girl, my first experience having a social life, my first time being abandoned, and I know you had your reasons, but jesus christ, you handled the situation in the worst imaginable way. You don't say ""I am going to block you now"" when the person who's in love with you, who you forced into being in a relationship with you when you showed up in my life, tries to communicate with you and ask why you left. Who the fuck does something like that? A minute later and I'm bleeding out of my arm and I don't know what the fuck to do. I had to ask our mutual therapist for help and she told me how to treat the wounds because I never learned how to do it myself. I went to CVS and bought some gauze pads and hydrogen peroxide and neosporin the next day after my appointment and started applying it every day until it started to heal. But the wound you gave me when you ended our relationship and our friendship like that hasn't healed, and I don't know when it will. I feel like you used me, like I was the only one who was damaged by this. You've been abandoned before and had no support system and yada yada yada, but why does that make it okay to do that to someone else? Because of what you did, I don't even want friends, I don't want to date other girls, I don't trust people anymore. So thanks for that. I love you so much but honestly I hope you feel like shit for how you treated me.

4,"This is gonna be a long ass post, but I hope maybe at least one guy (or girl) who’s always too scared to be honest with their feelings takes something good out of it. I’ve always been one of those guys who is terrible at approaching women romantically. I’m not too socially awkward, and am completely fine talking to anyone when there’s no feelings involved, but the minute I realise I have feelings I have had a tendency to just bury them deep down, avoid the person and wonder ‘what if’. I could just never work up the courage to be honest, the thought alone terrified me.

So in this situation I was fucked. I was becoming progressively closer with this girl I worked with, a girl who was already in a relationship. We just naturally gravitated towards each other, had the exact same sense of humour, etc. Eventually we graduated from just being ‘work friends’ and started hanging out outside of work, and it was around this time I realised I felt more for her than just friendship. 

My avoidance tactic was off the cards, cause I’d spent so long being friends with her and hanging out with her most days I couldn’t just ignore her, or how I felt. Over the course of the next year or so we became truly inseparable, we started going to college together everyday, we would talk on Snapchat basically every minute we weren’t together, and to this day I’d still probably consider her my best friend. Each day I had to swallow my feelings while constantly being around someone I was just endlessly falling more and more for, knowing I could never act on it. It was fucking emotional torture. I’d cherish every moment we spent together, and as soon as we were apart all I could think about was how things could never be the way I wanted. 

I got my hopes up thinking she might have liked me back, and while I still think there has been something more than friendship going on between us at times, it got to the point I would read things into every little interaction between us that just weren’t there. I couldn’t think of anything else, and I genuinely almost flunked out of college cause my head was just all over the damn place. I’d never felt that intensely for anyone, I didn’t even know it was possible, and I had no idea how to handle it at all. I was finally in a position I’d never been in my whole life; I had to face my fears and tell her or else I was gonna go insane. And it wasn’t just the embarrassment of rejection scaring me this time; I genuinely faced losing my very best friend, and I just sat and agonised for months over whether I should tell her.

It’s obvious from the title that I did. And even now I dunno if it was the morally ‘right’ thing to do. She was in a relationship which I should have respected from the get go, I was putting her in a shitty situation and I was putting our friendship in danger, knowing nothing good was gonna come form it. But people aren’t perfect, and sometimes you just have to do what you have to do. I could have just swallowed it all and kept the status quo, but I’d been doing that my whole life and this was the first time in my life the feeling of ‘what if’ felt far worse than the fear of being honest about how I feel.

So I told her. And she told me that her boyfriend was her priority, and while she was upset about it, she thought it was best we back off from each other. I couldn’t do anything but agree. I was fucking heartbroken. I was hollow. For a good few weeks I was barely functioning as a person. People consoled me, telling me I done all I could, but it didn’t help.

3 months passed. I started to feel a bit better, but was still nowhere near over her. I woke up one day to a message from her out of the blue. It was long, but she essentially told me she was splitting up with her boyfriend and that she had felt incredibly shitty about how things ended between us all this time. She told me that she needed me in her life, and that she had been absolutely miserable. 

Long story short she got back with her boyfriend. This doesn’t have some stupid movie ending where she realises her boyfriend is an asshole and I was the one for her all along, cause that’s just not true in the real world. Sometimes her boyfriend’s a decent guy, and the person you spend so long putting on a pedestal is just as flawed and unsure of what to do as you are. I still don’t know whether she messaged me that day just cause she needed comfort, or she genuinely thought her relationship was over and thought I was her next best option or whatever. In either case, things were understandably awkward between us. I think we both knew how us reconnecting at that point came across. She’d reached out to me just cause she was feeling vulnerable and I think we both knew it wasn’t quite right for us to be talking while I felt so strongly towards her.

But one thing I did learn while not talking to her for months is that I needed her in my life too, even if it was just as a friend. Since I couldn’t be her friend like that and continue to feel so strongly about her, I finally became willing to do something I’d never done; put my feelings aside, and be friends with someone I have feelings for. I couldn’t live my life just ignoring my problem. I had to face it yet again, this time in a different way. It wasn’t easy. I still have a soft spot for her, and honestly think maybe I always will, but it’s not near the intensity of when I kept it all bottled up. I’m at peace with it, it’s been an opportunity for me to work on myself and focus on other things, and now I can be a far better friend for having gone through all this. It’s been about half a year since we started talking again and we’re basically back to being just as good of friends as we ever were before. We’ve never talked about what I told her since that night, but I think I’m fine with that.

Cause I realised through all this exactly how you need to approach having feelings for someone. You need to throw yourself at it. If you really do feel that strongly about someone, you need to do everything you can to make it happen, even if you’re risking everything for it, even if it’s the scariest thing you’ve ever done, you can’t live life just never trying. But after you do, if you try and it doesn’t work out, you need to do something just as hard; you need to let it the fuck go. Maybe the feelings won’t ever fully disappear, maybe they will, but one thing that I know for certain is that just telling someone how you feel, respecting their boundaries as much as possible and listening to your heart at the same time, makes getting over them so much easier. Rejection is probably sometimes the only way you begin to move on, even if it hurts so fucking bad. Once the dust settles, knowing you tried your best even if it doesn’t work out is so much better than that shitty limbo you live in when you don’t try. If you’re meant to be together, you probably will be one day. If you’re meant to just be friends, that will happen too with time. But you have to be honest, respectful as possible, and willing to let things go if it doesn’t work out. But no matter what, never just sit and wonder ‘what if’. As someone who’s spent his full life until recently doing just that, things really are better on the other side, even if it’s the hardest thing you’ve ever had to do.",19Aug2018,17
5,"I recently got a pair of extremely good headphones, and I've been listening to a bunch of stuff I remembered from a long time ago for the nostalgia.

I decided to listen to Skrillex's classic album Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites expecting to laugh at the garbage I used to listen to. Instead, I was absolutely shocked at how his old stuff was completely different from anything I've ever heard in my life.

Kill Everybody and the titular track Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites are, hands-down, THE most unique-sounding electronic tracks I've ever heard in my life. It's bizarre that nobody has been able to replicate the Skrillex sound.

10,"I’m middle schooler who’s always had top grades. I’ve recently been encouraged to apply for high school preparatory school known as Andover. Obviously now everything is super higher stakes because if I don’t do well enough to get into the school I lose the biggest opportunity of my life. I’m trying so hard but I’m really struggling. 
 For starters I’ve got an advanced math teacher who’s really unhelpful. She speeds through lessons and seems to loathe explaining things and often  gets upset with us for wanting more than 10 minutes to absorb information. She’s giving quizzes on Tuesday and randomly on Mondays which really messes with the flow of learning. We learn new random stuff through out the week and then have a test the second we’ve gotten rusty on most of it. She’s very big on not reviewing stuff. To me it’s clear she really teaching to a test. It’s a stretch to even call her teacher. For the past few quizzes I’ve been having to reteach myself the lesson because she’s just that useless. Math is my worst subject so it’s struggle to try and hold an A in this class. 
I’m also the current leader of my school’s academic team and trying to do a mad dash to try and get our school to nationals. It’s escalated to the point where I’ve skipped all my school meals(I still eat dinner) to spend all my time studying. I’m a decent player at best and still not to the level I need to be.

I’m also floundering emotionally because of the pure stress. From the pure exhaustion of juggling my grades, to trying to train for a statewide band competition, I’m drowning. I don’t even have time for the things that I like anymore. A part me just wants to shut down and stop, but if succeed I could be in the school of my dreams.

31,"So I live in a studio, above a clothing store. I’ve looked all over my lease and there’s no info about trash, I don’t see my neighbor take out trash, ever. Last time I just carried some bags to my car and threw them away somewhere but, what should I do, what’s easiest? Where would your first idea be for a free dumpster? 

There’s not really commercial stores around here, the only I could think of is maybe Royal Farms, but I feel like their dumpsters are locked.

32,"me and my ex broke up 2 years ago, and i just found a video of all of us, her, me and a bunch of friends at a party before we started dating, and it just made me realize that i miss her a lot. 

it made me realize that that was probably the best it was ever going to get. luckily i realized it then too, but that just made it even worse when we did break up. i hope i can be as happy with someone else some day, but im worried that i wont.

37,"Hello! I'm new here, and I have a huge problem going on right now, I need a bit of advice and perhaps some ideas on how to deal with this. That being said, heres the situation: 

In may I let a friend at the time move in with me, she has a son ( not the issue at all), we discussed things like bills with me originally telling her that she needed to take the two cheaper bills in her name and I'd take the more expensive one in my name. At first she agreed, but as time went on, she became violent and angry every-time I talked to her about bills. She lied about putting one bill in her name for months and would pay me back for split bills a month behind. We eventually began to not get along as she would never clean the apartment and would leave things like dirty underwear, diapers, and moldy food laying around. She would also hoard my dishes and other house items in her dirty room, which she never cleaned by the way. Imagine coming home after a 8 or 10 hour shift and seeing that your house is a wreck! (When it was clean before you left for work). She would go to music festivals instead of paying her bills and let men do coke around her son. She said she would be out by the end of July, but later changed her mind saying she needed more time. I told her because of her son, I would give her august but she would still need to pay rent\\bills. She pack all her things while I was at work or out with friends, and left. She left my apartment busted and dirty, she left her AC on which runs up bills and she blocked me so I cannot contact her at all. I don't know where she is to go to small claims court because they wouldn't be able to find her. Does anyone know how I could find her? Or even have her taken to court? Im at a loss, as the bills she owe me total over 600 dollars. Im falling behind on bills and I have to find a 3rd job. It may not seem like a lot but I worked my ass off for that money and got screwed because I was paying bills and helping someone. I do have all the messages we sent each other as proof she was supposed to pay half, but I cant find her. It sucks because my heart was in the right place, providing a home for a mother in her child, but I can't afford to pay incoming bills because she ran them up and ran away. Help me seek justice please! 

Also again, Im new so im sorry if this was posted to the wrong area. Im still getting around here haha. ",19Aug2018,1

40,"I’m sorry if this turns out a little bit long, it’s kind of one of those situations where I feel like backstory is needed to fully understand 😂  (Info/History about me)  I’m 17F, in the beginning of my senior year of high school. I’m more of the introverted, quiet kid who doesn’t talk much and is painfully, painfully shy and inexperienced.  I’m more of an art freak; I plan on majoring in art and going on to get my teaching license for art education for high school students. As a kid, I was severely made fun of; called fat and ugly, was told that I should just die, etc. This led me to have issues with depression, severe anxiety, eating issues, and general body dysmorphia that I still have issues with today.  (End history)  In my family, we never really talked about sex or dating; it was extremely taboo. Everything that I learned was from my friends/peers, online, or what I saw at home. This was my first indication that healthy relationships are practically nonexistent and sex is something that should be automatically given to the other person; no matter what.  The very first relationship I had was not the best. He wouldn’t listen to me, would try to touch me all the time, would try to make me touch him, and blamed me for mostly everything. He called me crazy and that everything was my fault. A few months after him, a semi-close friend of mine blamed me for him trying to kill himself. Both of these situations have left me to believe that there’s no such thing as a healthy relationship; that all that will happen is me being blamed for things that aren’t my fault and that whenever I speak I’ll just be turned down to a deaf ear.   As I’ve said before, I’ve seen a lot through my friends and peers. 99% of it is not good. Most of them end up being used for sex, be cheated on, be hit, be sexually assaulted, or some other harmful experience. Because of this, I feel like I’ll be hurt; whether that be beaten or used up and left.  From all of the negatives that I have heard about sex, I’m extremely uptight about it and have a 6 month mandatory waiting period for sex for anyone who tried to get in a relationship with me. It helps me weed out the bad but I feel like all it does is turn people away because I am so uptight and fearful of being hurt again.  I really don’t want to be this way anymore. I want to see that there are positives in relationships and that I won’t be used up or thrown to the ground. I’m sick of having such bad anxiety every time I think about relationships and sex. I appreciate any helpful advice that’ll get me past this.",19Aug2018,2

43,"I (19 f) live with my parents. My family is highly disfunctional, we barely communicate and on the rare occasion that we do, we only scream at each other. My parents physically abused me growing up, they stopped when I hit my dad back once. My mom only sleeps in front of the telly after work and housework and my dad drinks beer after work and sleeps in our garden. All they do is sleep while my neighbours eat together in the garden and laugh and have conversations together.

Yeh, great idea. I fell over a few minutes into the walk back, grazed all down my leg &amp; aggravated an old hip injury.

45,"Ok so I think I have a problem. I’m 18, and got tired of being a lard-ass (was 215 and 5’10, dropped it down to 185). I used to get a ton of energy from working out, and I even picked up skateboarding, but after spending a few hours of skating, or even just 10 minutes of cardio, I’d become incredibly fatigued. Now I’m fatigued even when I don’t work out for a few weeks. My fatigue often even carries on to the next day where I end up (most of the time involuntarily) sleeping 14 hours. I tried drinking coffee to make up for my constant fatigue (760 mg every morning), and it worked at first and was able to get back on schedule. Now coffee stopped working, and me being tired all the time has made me loose interest in the things I love, and makes it impossible to keep a consistent schedule. I tried looking up my symptoms online prior to posting this, but it’s nearly impossible to find information without jumping to anemia or diabetes (not to mention the subjectivity of personal health). I drink roughly a gallon of water every day, I’m on medication for anxiety disorder and I tried going off of it to see if it would fix things, but they only got worse. I cut back on caffeine and even increased the amount I drink. Nothing works. Does anyone know what’s wrong with me, or should I look into the possibility I have anemia or diabetes?",19Aug2018,4
46,"It’s weird, and I always thought it would work the other way. But for me personally, something I noticed is that things seem to stress me out a lot more than they used to. For example, when I was 15/16, I was never really worried or anxious about schoolwork or performing well. I was content, confident and did things pretty well. Another example is relationships. I felt very empathetic and understanding, and should I ever lose the girl I love, though it would make me sad, I didn’t stress or worry about it ever happening. I was always an overthinker (which led to a lot of depression) but felt relaxed, had myself together, and despite my depression at the time it was still easy for me to tell myself that everything was going to be ok.

Now I’m 18, and as I look back, I remember thinking “if I keep this mindset, I’ll be golden for the rest of my life” and I was excited to see what the future would hold. Nowadays however, I’m terrified of losing the girl I love. I’m petrified of receiving a heavy workload. I’m stressed out by little things and while my depression has gotten better, my anxiety has skyrocketed. It’s devastating, because I thought things would only be looking up, but instead my mindset feels like it went downhill. I really just wanted to write this down somewhere or get it off my chest but, I really wish I knew why this was and would appreciate any advice.

TL;DR: Sophomore year in high school I experienced minor anxiety but major depression. Fast forward to junior/senior year, I experience significantly less depression but immensely heightened anxiety. What on earth happened here?",19Aug2018,1

The info is in the post but I'll copypaste it here as well.

Female massage therapist slapped my head to the point of unconsciousness yesterday, but I mostly feel better. 

I went in for a thirty minute massage and asked her to start with my skull because it helps me relax very quickly. I don't know what the heck was going through her mind, but as soon as the massage starts (I'm on my back) she starts slapping my face and skull, that's all I remember aside from waking up to her shaking me and saying I fell asleep (which I assumed was correct at the time, why would I argue) and my massage is over. I didn't even remember walking into the place when I first woke up, I didn't recall the face/skull slapping until later either.

I didn't grow up in an abusive home. I had an uncle that would beat me when he babysat us, because he would go for my younger brother and then I would pick a fight with him to get him to take me on instead. Which of course is stupid, especially because you get older and everyone tries acting like all of your physical and social problems are your own, you get nothing for that kind of protection for others. Anyway. I didn't enjoy the beatings, they only happened a few times though because eventually I told my mom and we didn't get babysat by him anymore. So. This is what's weird. It's like I paid for a massage and randomly ended up getting my ass kicked instead, and I feel fantastic. Mostly like there was some kind of validation there, that somebody took my money and beat me up.

What's the therapy reasoning behind this? There has to be some kind of logic.",19Aug2018,1

51,"I am so regretful. My parents let me live abroad and alone for university. In that first year alone I started taking drugs and had a guy living with me. It started off innocently trying to self medicate but it quickly turned. Not only did my parents find out but the police became involved and briefly I had charges placed against me. I broke their trust in every way. I let them down like no one else did. I did this to myself. 

I am happy to say that today I have been clean for a while - but the thoughts of my past continue to haunt me. I have yet to regain most of my family’s trust back but I am acceptant of that. 

When I tell anyone about what has happened, they put me down even more and I understand that. I wish I could get over that at some point. Living like this is super hard. Today, I live with my parents and have finally left rehab. I am due to start university next month and am hoping this will aid my start for a better future. A future without all these wrongdoings - a future where I can make my family proud and repay them for what they have given me.

Throughout all of this I have been majorly exposed and walk around with close no dignity. How can I finally move past this? I know if I want to - the people around me have to as well but I can not control that. I would be grateful for any advice on this situation.",19Aug2018,3
