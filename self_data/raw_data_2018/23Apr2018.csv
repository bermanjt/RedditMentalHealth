0,"I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls (only 2 of them are in this , a blonde girl and a brunette girl) were there for a few hours in the night at the end before closing time the blonde girl in that group walked up stairs with some other girl  to the toilet she kept looking back at me down the stairs and laughing bit couldn’t make it out fully. a while later I walked around the corner towards by where they were sitting one of them (that same blonde girl) was looking at me and I looked up at her and she didn’t look away and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say whisper to her friend the brunette girl 'that lads just been staring at me'. another while later I was cleaning a table (they were the last customers left in there it was late before closing) and the brunette girl asked over at me ‘excuse me’ twice then I looked and then she asked ‘how do you get a job in here?’ I answered and walked towards her because she asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) I said yes and she was saying he’s not her friend they don’t know her that well and said she’s weird (but the other girls were disagreeing saying she’s being harsh) the  brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit....’ and then  looked at me then grew a smile and said 'she likes you' and they all burst out laughing I just walked away. I then went back to finish cleaning the table and then the same brunette girl asked ‘excuse me’ I looked then she looked tipsy as she asked pointing at me 'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she said  'have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her and their was a pause then  the blonde girl then said 'aww leave him alone...he’s dead cute' while looking over at me smiling (idk if she said it like puppy dog cute is that bad?) and then said “he probably has” (probably has a gf) the brunette asked me it again saying ‘have you, have you got a gf’ nicely and I blanked her and then the blonde girl said “aww leave him alone now hes fumin” . On their way out by the door when I was cleaning other tables the brown girl looked a bit drunk and the blonde girl who seemed normal said ‘byyeee’ smiling politely idk they looked like pleasant well spoken girls not loud drunk girls",23Apr2018,0

2,"So I dunno if users remember me. I posted here a little while back.

Just a quick update and celebration. It's kinda early to celebrate but thanks to users support I was able to apply to many jobs and try my hardest. This has resulted in a very exciting phone call. I have an interview for a full time job tomorrow! 

The only issue is I don't have interview clothes. Shit\- but I am sure I can work it out.

Anyways, I am so excited and fingers crossed. It's a great opportunity and if I get it, I will be able to move out with my boyfriend and get my life on track. 

My bank is still extremely in the red and I am still hungry but I feel like I can ignore that because of this event. I know it's like ""an interview? Just one?"" but after attempted so many places, this is my first interview in months!

Anyways, I just felt like I needed to celebrate!

&gt;Hey all.  
&gt;  
&gt;I don’t really have any real friends to chat to or discuss this sort of stuff with so I figured I’d resort to good ol’ reddit here.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m an 18 year old female from Melbourne, Australia. I’ve currently got a boyfriend I live with most of the time. I stay with him because my parents are severe alcoholics. I’ve run away before and Children Protective Services got involved, they made promises but were quick to ditch them and they even became worse. Dad started growing pot and he and mum got worse in their behaviour towards me.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have no job as I was fired last November as I was going through some tough relationship things. My ex raped, abused and cheated on me and it was probably the lowest time of my life. My depression and anxiety \(diagnosed way before the incident, runs in the family\) got much worse. My birthday is on the 21 of January. I had planned to kill myself after going to Cloud 9 \(night club with a bad reputation of ecstasy\). That was the plan. Plans changed after I met my current boyfriend, he changed my life. He makes me incredibly happy and my depression was getting better but my anxiety is getting worse with almost an anxiety attack every few days. Most of them at nighttime. I also get nightmares now usually involving my ex. Sometimes involving my new boyfriend doing things my ex used to do.  
&gt;  
&gt;Obviously, I am still alive today and I’m stronger now but anxiety has got me at my worse. I’ve also now been diagnosed with ADHD. Which my current boyfriend doesn’t fully understand.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now the problem right now is, he works a full time job and is quite stressed most of the time. He tends to take this out on me in a non physical way. Which stresses me out and makes me anxious however I’m okay with this as I fully understand. He’s paying for me, himself and bills while I sit at home, cleaning and doing nothing.  
&gt;  
&gt;I need a job but I don’t know how to get one. I’ve tried applying to jobs. I’m going to Centrelink tomorrow but I’m not sure how much help they’ll be. My account is in minus $100 and I don’t have any interview/work clothes. The only meals I eat is at dinner because that’s all my boyfriend pays for. I’m losing weight and energy, fast.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m dying to get my life on track. My boyfriend wants to move into an apartment closer to the CBD. That would be entirely possible if I had a job.  
&gt;  
&gt;I need to be more responsible but I’m scared. I don’t know how to kick my life into order.  
&gt;  
&gt;If there is someone who can help me, message me and give me daily advice I’d be highly appreciative. Even someone to vent to.  
&gt;  
&gt;I know I put my whole life story into this post but I’m so stressed and I don’t know what to do anymore. Help me.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks for reading through that shit storm. On a positive note, I hope you all are having a good day.",23Apr2018,11
3,"Women are ignoring me, I want them to stop doing it, but whenever I try to be assertive I just come off as mean. I don't want to be mean, or rude, I just want them to know I am single and looking for a relationship, but I don't want to sound weird about it. I just don't know how else to find love. I feel like I cant even talk sometimes, because I don't know what to say. ",23Apr2018,2
4,"I was born in small town in New Zealand. My parents and situation were fairly regular, dad was an engineer at a paper factory and mum was an English teacher. When I was 4 we moved to a smaller town by the beach far from my hometown and family. This is where i spent most of my childhood and i loved the place. It was surrounded on all sides by wild lands, and nature is one of the few things that i can count on to make me happy.

In this beach town i started school and was a fairly talented kid. I didn't have many friends but was a voracious reader. I was always imagining stories in my head and also wrote them down often. I used to make up crazy fantasies about aliens and mythical creatures that me and my friends would play pretend.

Things began to get interesting however, when i was 11 and my parents took me on my first overseas holiday. My father had moved to this beach town for a more lucrative job, and my family had become substantially wealthier since moving. In small town NZ, not many families can afford to travel abroad, its simply too far away and difficult. We spent 6 weeks traveling Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand. When we got back It was the start to a new school year, and i was 11 so started at the NZ equivalent of middleschool. My few friends from primary school went to a christian school in the city, and i found myself in a new school where i didn't know anyone. 11 year old me got carried away by this sensation, or at least that's my best way of explaining what happened. Regardless, I started telling my new classmates all sorts of crazy stories pretending as though they were true. I was a smart kid, however, so made my lies believable, usually based on truth. The most notable one and also first one i told, was that instead of saying i had BEEN to southeast asia, I claimed i had been living there for several years. I showed off my few phrases of Vietnamese i had learned as proof and through enough persistence, i had everyone thinking i was the child of some globe trotting expats.

I started to lie about everything, simply because i found it fun. I made up all sorts of stories, and soon some people started smelling something was off. Also, just because none of my old friends went to this school, many kids who went to my primary school were here too, and they new i hadn't just arrived from a foreign land. Luckily, i felt guilty for lying and fessed up about it to the new friends i had made, and they remain my friends to this day. However, other kids called me out on my bullshitting and i was known as the little bullshitter.

Fast forward several years. Im 18 and finishing college (we call high school college in NZ). After the mess of middleschool i toned down the lying as i started college and actually found a tight group of friends. I was always a bright kid and was dedicated to my grades which were really good. But i hadn't forgotten how much fun lying was. Around my friends at school i often exaggerated things, but was careful to never lie to them. Meanwhile, I had been telling the craziest things to people outside of school. People I met on one off occasions, Parties, on buses, in bars etc. would receive a totally fictional identity. I was working part time as a dish washer and my co workers thought i was Russian immigrant who grew up in NZ (explaining the accent). I went to crazy lengths to prove my lies. I spent a year learning Russian after the whole ""Russian Immigrant"" thing came out of my shit spouting mouth on my first day working there. As school finished, my friends left to their various paths in life, but i had no idea what i liked doing, so remained working at the restaurant, now as a bartender.

Without my friends, my lies got more out of control. Suddenly, I 'had' a scholarship to a university in Russia, and i began planning a trip to Russia to back this up. Luckily i stopped myself short of actually doing this, but realized i should get out of my hometown. Around this time a polish waitress started working there who spoke fluent Russian, and it was quickly realized that I didn't speak Russian fluently like i had been saying. Lies exposed, I had a humiliating last couple weeks there and then packed my life into my car and drove south to work on a ski field. Like i said, Nature had always been my happy place, and i thought that living amongst the pristine NZ Alps would make me happy. I remember consciously thinking to myself; ""Don't fuck things up this time"" minutes before i arrived. But somehow, as the new ski season employees were introducing ourselves Someone asked me where i was from and i said a totally different part of NZ to where i actually was from.

Like that i slipped into another mess of lies. For some reason once i start making stuff up about myself i fall into a new character and cant say a single true thing. I became OP, the boy from the Urewera hills, where i was raised amongst a maori village riding horses and farming kumera. This lie was so ridiculous looking back i think they may have just been humoring me. Regardless, some months went by, and the season ended.

I had always wanted to travel, so decided at this time to get out of NZ. I traveled Europe for a month, before coming to Canada. While travelling my lying was ridiculous. I often had made up names, was always from NZ (apparently my bullshit is at least patriotic) but if the person i was talking to didn't know much about NZ i would fill them in with all sorts. I would teach people i met at hostels gibberish, pretending it was Maori (which i said i was fluent in). I claimed to be a pilot back home, a ski patroller, a writer, married, among many others. Anyway, by the time i got to Canada i had gotten myself a working visa, and began working on a ski field as i had by now been hooked on skiing from my last season. This time, i wrote myself a reminder on my phone screen. DONT LIE TO YOUR NEW FRIENDS. but sure enough... I am now months into the Canadian ski season and all my friends here think im OP from Ruatoria (not my hometown), child of Russian parents (that ones back again), an ex-LSD dealer. I have no idea why i do this tbh. I actually feel really guilty when i lie, but i do it anyway. and its not just my past i lie about. I lie about EVERYTHING if i know i can get away with it. ""What did you do today?"", i would probably make something up. Random things like how much was the bread, i would say a dollar more or less than it actually was. I would always find myself describing conversations i never had, altering my retelling of an event in any way i can.

Nonetheless, here i am. And guess what, I'm happy AF. I ignore the people i lied to in the past as i won't see them again. I am living in a beautiful place getting to ski every day. Am I a Jerk? is something wrong with me? thanks for reading anyway. This is the first time i have fully admitted to all this so enjoy, random internet stranger.",23Apr2018,1

6,"I cooked dinner with my kids today and I had a blast. I cooked some fetuccine. My little daughter helped me add spices and stir the mushrooms while my son stole a mushroom to munch on, then he stole a green onion, and then he asked for some baguette.

It was amazing. One of those moments that make parenting worth all the crazy shit.

So here I am, at the end of the day, and I'm smoking up while watching Dragon Ball Super. I'm watching that episode where Goku is supposed to watch Pan but he loses her. She's kidnapped. She escapes by herself and she's in outer space. 

That's when the waterworks started and they've yet to stop. She's remembering her encouraging grandpa, she's reaching out for the stars. When she gets back to Earth, Goku, Chichi, and Piccolo find her sleeping on the couch. 

When Pan's parents come back, they jokingly chastise her for making her grandpa run around like crazy looking for her. Then she says ""grandpa"" and reaches for him. I think this is the first time she says it. And Goku is just so happy.

Then Gohan tells everyone he turned out that super awesome job because he wants to see Pan. He'd rather do that than have crazy hours.

Then the episode ends. And I'm sniffling.

Hey everyone, I had a shitty fucking childhood. My dad was never around and just recently I reconnected with him after two decades. And he's still the same. His new family and new kids don't ever see him.

Any time I was excited about something, my dad would make me feel like shit about it. He made me feel like shit about school, about myself, and about my interests and even friends. And he beat the shit out of me.

It fucking sucked. He tried to kill me once when I pissed him off. He fled the country when I reported him to child protective services. He refused to pay child support or see me despite being rich.

While I wondered if I'd eat and tried to contain my anger, he was building a small mansion. While I had to give up on going to any good colleges because I couldn't afford it, he was going on vacations to Europe.

I promised myself that my kids would never see a life like that. I spent my twenties (and late teens) making plans on how I could afford having kids, how I could take care of them. I made career decisions that would ensure I'd always have time for my kids and that I could provide for them.

And now I'm here. My kids are happy. My kids love me and they seem love their lives. They get to explore their interests, and I'm always home to cook with them and to take care of them and to put them to sleep.

They eat the best food on the planet, and for some reason, they love eating kale and carrots and drinking Kombucha but can't stand pizza (I fucking love pizza but they won't take to it!).

When I saw Pan, I saw my kids in her smile. And while I struggle with depression, with thoughts of suicide, with anger that I'm always afraid to lose control of, they're smiling and they're exploring life as I never was able to. And when Goku feels happy to be finally called ""grandpa"", I think of the challenges he went through to save the world multiple times and STILL make time for his kids and his grandkids. And I think of my pain and the challenges I go through to be able to be a good day (HOPEFULLY they'll think so too one day).

**tl;dr** I had a shit childhood. I made sure my kids would have a good one. Pan and Goku's relationship reminds me of that and now I'm sobbing.",23Apr2018,10

8,"so like a little bit ago (late december/early january) i had liked someone and finally mustered up the courage to actually tell them those feelings. not long after that though, i feel i messed up and tried to turn it into a relationship too fast, and got turned down.

after that, i had decided to distance myself from that person as to try and help myself not get hung up over it. seemingly, that affected the other person negatively, as after awhile of that, they randomly texted me saying that i was a great person, and stuff of that nature. we started talking again, and really soon after that they started to seem flirty with me so i started reciprocating.

thus, from that i had developed feelings for this person again. but it's been almost a month now and nothing seems to be developing really. we still talk but its sort of infrequent and it goes between being seemingly flirtatious at points and at others the complete opposite.

in person they also seem like they are trying to flirt with me, but i can't tell if that's just wishful thinking on my part. i feel like im hung up on this again and i don't know what to do. on one hand, im afraid that if i down right give up on it, i'll lose my chance and regret it. but on the other hand, i feel like i don't really have a chance and am just sort of hanging on for nothing. there seems to be signs that they like me but also i have doubts that anything will actually come of it.",23Apr2018,1

20,"Hi, my name is Leo and I’m addicted to gaming. This addiction is on and off and I always manage to quit and only to relapse anywhere from a month later to a year later. I have struggled with this compulsion for  15 years.

How bad is it? 
-It has gotten so bad to the point where I couldn’t sit. My ass was so sore that I had to lean on different sides of it and use pillow for support. 
-I have gotten a hemorrhoid from excessively sitting. 
-Carpal tunnel in my right hand. 
- poor sleep because of my preoccupied thoughts of the game

The list can go on and on. And thats just the physical aspects. A ton more psychologically. 

The worst part is that I don’t even like the games I play. It’s a compulsion of feeling that I have to play and I CAN’T STOP! 

When I was young and my parents knew my obsession of gaming, they would take my computer away. I felt so depressed and at times suicidal. 

I’m a grown ass man already and married. My addiction has resurfaced again. Two days ago I have quit gaming....... again. I am fighting the urges to play. It is hard but I want this to be the last time. I can’t be playing games because I don’t know how to control myself.

24,"I don't exactly enjoy being at home, which is why I chose to went to GMU because it's far away (while still being in state). My parents are pretty overbearing and it's taken a toll on me from an early age. I still get treated like a child when I'm a very independent person; nothing I say or do changes that so I am like a shut door around them (I'll be turning 21 in June). I'm so tired of the stress that comes with that; I've been getting headaches so often now that the semester is coming to an end for me, just thinking about having to go back home soon.

I have an amazing boyfriend and we've both been planning our future together for awhile now. We are in a long distance relationship and get to see each other pretty often while I'm in school. He's pretty much the only part of each day I look forward to. I'm so depressed when I'm at home; I'm either at my shitty job where they don't care about me or I'm at home where I can't do anything right or be perfect. I have friends at home but they all want to go out and that requires a lot of money I have tried my hardest to save, so I don't go out too often. I've been cutting back on spending my money in order to save as much as I can. I have about $7K in savings that's just for moving out to NOVA. I have two more school years to go before I graduate and I don't think I can handle 2 more summers at home where I don't feel welcome. I want to be with my boyfriend, even if it means having to work full time while taking 12 credits for my last school year. I want to build my life with him and I want to do it on my own. The only thing is there's no way my parents will pay for my room and board if they know I want to move out with him (because we're not married). So I'll have to work full time that last year, because I can't afford the rent here otherwise.

30,"I'm almost 30.

That's not old.

I'm a woman. I've never worn much makeup or spent much money on skincare products.

Everyone around me always worries about aging. From a young age we're bombarded by the messages. It's kicking into high gear as my friends enter their 30s and 40s.

I already know people getting left for younger women. Men who scorn women for being superficial in one breath glorify youth with the next. We're interchangeable. Insert joke about people getting older but college girls remaining the same age.

I started wearing moisturizer and sunscreen last month. Today I just spent hours on /r/skincare addiction. Today I bought a $60 eye cream. 

To reassure me, someone told me:

&gt;  Think of it as an investment - we have a thing that, once lost, we can't quite get back.

But we will all lose it eventually. And I don't want to obsess over laugh lines. I don't want a skin fold to define how people look at me. I didn't care about wrinkles and I'm so tired of getting anxious about the texture of my face. I want to spend $60 on something that doesn't feel like I'm scrambling to keep up with unrealistic societal expectations. 

I'm returning the eye cream. I'm not going to wear more makeup. I'll wear sunscreen and moisturize but I refuse to let my anxiety feed off of 7-step routines and I think I need to stop spending time around people who insist on its necessity.

But I can't stop being peripherally aware of how society mostly only values women when they look young. I want to not be aware that I'm currently conventionally attractive, but to stay that way longer, I have to be fighting the inexorable march of time. 

I don't want to live the rest of my life unhappy with myself. I want to make peace with it.

I then went back to finish cleaning the table and then the same brunette girl asked ‘excuse me’ I looked then she looked tipsy as she asked pointing at me 'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she said  'have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her and their was a pause then  the blonde girl then said 'aww leave him alone...he’s dead cute' while looking over at me smiling (idk if she said it like puppy dog cute is that bad?) and then said “he probably has” (probably has a gf) the brunette asked me it again saying ‘have you, have you got a gf’ nicely and I blanked her and then the blonde girl said “aww leave him alone now hes fumin” .

41,"Hello everyone, 

so this post is all about the well known topic of regretting not asking a girl out. I wanted to ask if there is anything you can do to make yourself feel less shitty about it. I know that the best solution is to never miss a chance and rather remember it as a „Oh, well“ than a „What if“, but what when you just couldnt man up and do it?

Now, a bit detail to the question:

I put my phone up on the Facebook Marketplace and within a day this girl had contacted me asking if I‘d be willing to trade with her, to which I agreed. We met two days later to trade the phones, but we had a nice conversation (Messenger) prior to that day. 

Edit: I saw on Facebook that her relationship status is set to „single“, so now I feel even worse for not asking her out.

So, I drive up to the spot where we decided to meet. She was waiting there for me already. 
She had some problems regarding the factory reset, so that took some time to get done. In the meantime, we small talk and all the usual stuff you do and talk about when you meet someone new. Note: neither of us was awkward during the conversation, it all felt perfectly normal. We then manage to handle the problem with her phone, and finally trade the phones. Now, at that point I thought to myself: „This could be a good chance to ask her for out for a coffee.“ But then again, I talk myself out of it. 
As shitty as I feel right now for not doing it, as easy I gave up when I had the chance. 
Some detail I didn’t mention: Im a 22 y/o male, she’s a 21 y/o female.

Now, be as honest as you like in the comments. Honesty is always appreciated.

Tl;dr met a girl over facebook; met her in real life; wanted to ask her out; didn‘t ask her out; regret not doing it.",23Apr2018,1
42,"I love him to absolute death. He’s the love of my
life. My bestest friend in the whole wide world. 

BUT he’s fucking pissing me off.

He doesn’t pick up his clothes...HE JUST DUMPS HIS CLOTHES ON THE GROUND WHEN THE LAUNDRY BASKET IS LITERALLY RIGHT THERE. Like, literally, the clothes on the ground are touching the damn laundry basket. He lets glasses and mugs pile up on his bed side table to the point they go moldy and bad, he brings his dirty dishes to the sink even though the dish washer is RIGHT THERE. He’s 26! 

I understand some people just aren’t neat freaks and that’s fine, I’m not either, but I still clean up after myself. What makes me so angry is the fact that he expects someone else to take care of it. Something I’ve told myself since I was younger is that if I don’t do it, someone else will have to. And I just don’t want to leave shit around for other people to take care of?

Right now we’re living with his fantastically normal parents so his mom cleans up after everyone, she had four kids, 3 who are boys, so I guess she’s used to it. BUT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE I don’t want to fucking clean up after someone who’s supposed to be my partner. 

It would be different if he DID clean up after himself on a regular basis then I’d be fine with picking up his slack, but he simply doesn’t.

I’ve cleaned and organized his closet TWICE because I do our laundry and I can’t fucking put his clothes away if his closet is a disaster so I told him if his closet isn’t clean I’m not doing his laundry. I’ve failed to keep that up so now I just fold his clothes and let it pile up on top of his dresser. 

I’m totally venting but I’m just so annoyed. I don’t want to be that nagging gf but like fuck man if I don’t drill it into his head now than when we move out it’s just going to be the same shit. 

He’s so amazing everywhere else but mannnnnnn it’s just so frustrating.

43,"My friends and family see me as this strong person who has no issues sticking up for themselves. But this is partly true. Outside the workplace I can, but for some reason in it I revert into my shell and people think they can work over me. 

My first job I was essentially bullied because I didn't feel good enough, I took on far too much of a workload and everyone just dumped on me. My second job I worked with really nice people so didn't really have to stick up for myself. My current and most recent job I've gone back again. I've only been there 2 months and the work is quite intense. One day I was given a  slightly larger workload for a newbie, I felt comfortable taking it on but colleague and mentor shouted not to give me said workload because I wasn't ready for it..in front of everyone. I was humiliated and wanted to say something but for some reason couldn't bring myself to. My confidence just really takes a shake when it comes to the workplace and I hate that everyone thinks I'm the quiet pushover when outside of work I'm the opposite.

I'm so ashamed that I can't give myself the same self respect inside work that I do outside. It's as if I'm 2 different people and I don't know which one is the real me. I feel like a fraud and if my friends/family saw me in the workplace they wouldnt believe it was me.

44,"I am a 22 year old girl. Recently I just got out on my own. My mother was *extremely* abusive and fucked up and I'm glad to get away from her house.

I live with my coworker. I've lived with her and her husband for 2 months now. I pay my share of rent and bills.They don't have a car and regularly use mine.
 It didn't start out this way, they would ask only when they needed it but now they use it more than I do.


They act cold towards me if I use the car for a day. The silent treatment upsets me tbh. Stuff like that . 

I mean, they do put gas in it- we all do.

I'm just tired of living my schedule around whose using my car.

Everyday I think of getting in my car and driving until I run out of gas. Then refill and repeat until I am out of money. I really really want to. The thought is so relaxing. 

Right now, I don't have enough money to do that but I get paid wednsday then I will.


Yet! I work 2 jobs. I know I would lose both of those. 

I have a $175 bill that I have to pay each month for *sure* due to a 12 month probationary program I am in. So obviously I would have to get a job and can't just be a wandering hippie like I wanna be.

Should I run away and start a new life? I know it requires a ton of planning if I think about it too much. So in that case if I do it, I won't think.

But then I tell myself, a few people besides my roomates depend on me. My 18 year old cousin is pregnant now and she doesn't have a car, so I've been driving her to all her appointments and errands and stuff. 

(I don't mind as much because she's family and lives like a block away)

 I would be literally running away from my problems, and what would that solve because I would simply have to find new jobs in another location, I would still be a people pleaser and pushover and just let a different person take advantage of me. 
Does every adult get this urge and overcome it, or should I go with it?

58,"Hello r/self

Let's step right into my main concern
So i born with cataract on my right eye.For those who don't know it's something you better get removed from your eye before it's late.

My family didn't know about it because none realized it at first.
When i was about half a year old my mother started noticing that i often get very close to objects, that i sometimes walk into the wall accidentally.

She started to worry about it and we visited a doctor who told me that i'll be blind at the age of 20 so there's no need to care about me.

We were also told that they can take of the cataract from my eye, but not at that young of an age.One doctor said that he can do it so my mom belived him.I was 2 years old when the doctor did the surgery.

He failed and i lost my vision on my right eye which means that i'm one eyed from that day.

Later, presoure started building up in both of my eyes.The normal eye presoure is from the mid tens to the early twenties, but i had around 40 in my right eye.

Because the presoure was too high, it slowly started its way to my left eye and it begin to build up in my left eye.

Thanks to this presoure not only in my right eye, but now in my left eye too, i developed one of the worst kind of glaucom

For those who don't know what glaucom is it's basically tunnel vision.

Later they found out that i'm also sensitive to light.To be exact, brightness.When something bright flashes into my eye just for a secound i can't seen nothing but white amd my eye hurts

I have built in optical lens in both my eyes which means that the ones that i born with is gone.This would be a problem but if i ever hit my head too hard i'll be blind and there's no way to revert it after because the damage will be already done

By this day i had 12 surgeries at the age of 15.Most of them are just to keep my right eye from exploading/wrecking.It can't take anymore.

I don't see distances also.I don't know how far is something.I can't aim right.

It comes back at me in everyday life and I sometimes want to cry because of it to be honest.

I don't see when someone wants to handshake or give me something.I always bump into someone on a daily basis and i feel terrible about it because it's a suprise to me that they were there, like it's for them that i bumped into them.Every display that you can imagine is blurry to me and so on.

Sometimes i just get really down becuase of it to the point where i don't want to do anything

Thanks for reading:)
Have a nice day",23Apr2018,7

For a long time she didn't date great guys. They weren't bad, but they weren't the kind of good that she deserves either. But last week, an honest, good, hardworking man proposed to her and she said yes.

We're both 30, now but we've been best friends since primary school. Twenty five years is a long time, and I have no doubt we'll be little old ladies comparing wrinkles, laughing how terribly we paint each other's nails, and still lusting over inappropriately young but deliciously hot dudes.

I'll chastise her for yet again being too nice. Neither of us will hear each other and so the conversation will turn instead to tacos, or dresses, or pizza. She is more family to me than anyone on my life and that will never change.
