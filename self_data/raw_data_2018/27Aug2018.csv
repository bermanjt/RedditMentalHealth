0,"So long story short, when I was 18 I suddenly got very ill, everything hurt, constantly nauseaus, stomach pain, whenever I ate it felt like I would explode and a lot of other symptoms. Lost 22kg since it started, now weighing 38kg. 

No doctor could figure out why, hospital stays, tests, medications, therapy, nothing worked.

My family believed I was mentally ill too, until in june, 2 years after it started, I was diagnosed with 4 rare compression syndromes; MALS, Nutcracker syndrome, may thurner syndrome and pelvic congestion. 

Of course surgery is the only way to fix these, luckily I have the probably worldwide best surgeon for this procedure, but that doesn't make it any less complex... it will be an open abdomen surgery that will take between 7-11 hours, lots of reconstructing arteries, working on arteries... removing an entire artery from my leg...

I am so, so afraid.. of so many things... I am terribly afrsid of throwing up, that is constantly on my mind.. waking up and having to puke and feel terrible...

Then come other worries.. the risk of the surgery itself.. things after the surgery, I wont be on ICU for 2 days for nothing after all... 

And also, MALS is supposed to be the compression that causes my GI tract to dysfunction, but I read that the surgery is succesful only 70-80 percent of the time... what if I go through all this for nothing? It is hard for me to believe I could ever be able to eat something without pain and nausea again..  surreal.

I want to get better, more than anything, I will die a slow death if I don't... but I am still so, so scared... I try to stay cool and I don't show it, but anytime I hear a medical term or just randomly think of it I get a chill down my spine... 


I feel so lost and so scared...

1,"I’ve been using it for about a week, and have been pleasantly surprised at how positive the community is. I really enjoyed it... then a couple nights ago I got a private message from a user saying they were going to kill themselves that day and thanked me for the happiness they got from my post. I told them their life was worth living, that I struggle with depression and have had those thoughts before, that they’re not alone, that it may get so hard but that they have a future worth living for. They responded and said they were going to make the decision in the next few hours if they were going to die or not. I begged them not to- Please don’t, stay with us, you’re not alone... they said they’d tried therapy, meds, nothing worked for them. I pointed out most survivors regret their attempts. I sent “please call” with the suicide hotline number, which they said they’d used before. I got a message the next morning saying they had called, but had ultimately decided to go through with it and wished me the best... all I could do was beg them not to. 

I’m not really sure what my goal is of posting this except to tell someone, since no one knows I use r/gonewild... I’m just shook and worried about this very real person, and whether or not it was true, I’m having a hard time processing. ",27Aug2018,14

5,"I'm 25 right now and I haven't really gone to college because I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life and didn't want to go only to find out I didn't like that major. 

But I found something I want to do now and that's the the maritime industry (I guess it's called that?) 

I want to attend the Great Lakes Maritime Academy but I'm wondering how to apply. I filled the application for Fall 2019 but tuition seems high.. How do I go about student loans? From what I've read after I graduate I can easily pay it off though I'm not sure. ",27Aug2018,17
6,"Does anyone have any advice? I know for a fact that I can get along with anyone I meet. I know I’m mostly a quiet person but that’s only when in the company of people I don’t know so well.

7,"So I am pretty introverted but lately I have been forcing myself to be social. I also have severe anxiety and stress I also worry a lot. So I was invited to a party last year- my first one. I was so happy and my mom let me go. I had a good time except when I got home I broke down crying and told my mom I had two shots since it’s impossible to lie to her, after 17 years I have told her everything and have never lied. We went to my counseling session and my counselor was like “there’s a lot more things to worry about than 2 shots, plus you seem responsible” it all goes back to my anxiety and the guilt that my mom makes me feel for just existing basically. I was invited to my second party yesterday and I let her know that there would probably be drinking my I would be responsible and make it to my job on time (which I did the last time too, I was also sobered up before then and got there 20 minutes early). She didn’t let me go, felt depressed and lonely and worthless the rest of the night and couldn’t sleep.

So now I feel like even though I am 100% honest with her at all times she will never let me go anywhere again just because I told her what I did that one time. Others kids sneak out and stuff and I have never lied to her and I have to be cooped up in the house? Anytime I try to do things with my friends she just makes it more hassle than it’s worth with all the questions and stuff and her always shooting down my ideas on where I can take my friends. I’m sick of it. What should I do? I’m a teenager I want to go out and experience things, all she does is want me to stay in the house and be lonely. 

She let my two older brothers go out to parties and get fakes IDs and stuff. They even did the senior vs juniors wars and tee pee houses and stuff which I DOUBT she would ever let me do even though it’s coming up. She even told me how she would sneak stuff around HER mom like cigarettes and stuff. I’ve never snuck anything around her because I’m too afraid to since I worry and feel guilty about being alive in general, so sneaking things around her and being dishonest would absolutely wreck me.

I just feel I’ve been good all these years and had straight A’s last year, but for what? and now that I want to actually go out and have fun I can’t. I’ve never been to a real concert with friends. I see everyone on Snapchat having fun and here I am in my room with my strict mom wallowing in depression. I just feel like I am wasting my life away and will have no stories to tell my future kids. I just want to have fun before real life hits me. And maybe it’s because she’s 61 and has forgotten what it’s like to be a kid, idk. Just feeling really terrible lately.",27Aug2018,1
8,"As in how do I stop being afraid of fake shit like demons in the corners of my bedroom? I’m not trying to doubt on anyone’s beliefs but I know that odds are there is not anything paranormal waiting around corners or when I look in a mirror or anywhere at night or just alone. 

Also, my current living situation doesn’t help. So I recently moved out of state for college and am in my grandmother’s basement. This basement alone is like a whole apartment. Living room, bathroom, access to patio, two bedrooms, and a study. As well as the storage and water/heating areas. It’s great during the day but my problem is... it’s big. Too big. There is so much space for darkness at night. I closed off rooms like the study and second bedroom to help but I still FEEL like there’s something there. 

I’ve dealt with these problems before but it took years to die down in my parents house and even then I still had those nights where I couldn’t sleep.

Seriously, if you guys had some advice for me to get some sleep and ignore the feeling of being watched at night, I’d appreciate it.

IMPORTANT NOTE: For those of you who believe in the paranormal. You do you, BUT I do not need advice on hauntings etc. That’ll just keep me awake more.",27Aug2018,1

10,"I am really her just to vent...

I had never been unemployed since starting my  first job the day after my 16th birthday. This January, almost 20 years later I was laid off for the first time. I didn’t have an emergency fund so my son and I had to move in with his father (luckily we remained friends) and my monthly expenses ate up my unemployment. I decided to take a few months to focus on my mental health. I worked with my doctor and different medications and for the first time in a seriously long time, I finally felt like “me” again. 

Feeling completely re-energized, I began the job search. I realized very quickly that not having a job AND no degree was making it difficult to even get a call. A week before my unemployment benefits ran out, I received a called, an interview, and offer and then they rescinded it due to poor credit. So week after the job offer had been rescinded, I had no money and needed to fill my prescriptions that had given me my life back. I don’t have healthcare now so the total was $160. My sons father had already done so much so I texted my mom and asked her if she could help. I added, “if you can’t, you can’t, it’s okay, I just needed to ask”. She ignored me for a day and then sent me a nasty email saying this is the only money she’ll send me and that she won’t and can’t do it again. And some bullshit about getting any job. She knew my offer had just been rescinded so even if I had gotten a job that day, I wouldn’t have had the money for my meds. She also knew I was in the process of applying for the training grant which would extend my benefits. Lastly, she knew that getting any old retail job would only pay for my sons camp when I could just keep him home. So her response made me feel like even more of a loser/failure after the sting of losing the job offer. 

I don’t ask my mother for much. She’s a recovering addict and alcoholic and so **I ended up being the parent** most of my life. When she got her DUI, I didn’t bat an eye when she asked me to take her to the train station every morning before my own 90 minute commute. Shortly after she got her license back, I moved out at 20yrs old because at the time, the apartment complex she wanted to move to only had a 1 bedroom. I got sick of hearing her headboard bang against the wall to the living room where I slept on couch as she fucked her latest squeeze. When her cat was sick and her money was going to vodka, I would put money on her account so she could take kitty in. 

The thing is, at least when my mom was drunk, she would reach out to me and tell me she loved me. Since being sober (and please don’t get me wrong, I am SO happy for her) we don’t have much of a relationship at all. When I bring her only grandchild (I’m an only child) to see her, she just smokes and plays on her computer the whole time while my son begs her to play. The longer she is sober (4 years), the less emotions she seems to have. The young girls in AA seem to be her life though. 

As I mentioned, this is the only time I’ve needed the love, support and even a little financial help from her and even then, she can’t come through. I can’t change her so I just need to change my expectations of her. She is who she is and so I’m positive we will both be better off not having any contact. ",27Aug2018,1

15,"You know how in a video game when a run isn't going well you'll just go into ""fuck it"" mode and try shit you'd never do otherwise? That's kinda where I am in my life right now. 

I took the SAT yesterday after pretending to study for it all summer (I did end up studying a lot but pretty much by force), have a week or two before I start my senior year of high school and, honestly, I just don't see a reason. I don't care. About any of it. There are two main catalysts that have made this abundantly clear. **I'm not sure who I'm expecting to read this. It's pretty much a diary entry.**

The first ""ripple"" in my life's little puddle is when in a brief moment of bravado a couple of weeks ago I signed up for AP Bio and dropped AP Music Theory. I didn't think they'd actually let me do this, but they did. 

You see, I've always thought that, despite my aversion to math and science and my lack of academic drive, I could become a doctor. My dad is a doctor. I don't like him, but if he can do it I probably can too, right? And taking AP Bio would make my application more competitive to pre-med type programs. Yeah, cool, whatever, **what in the fuck was I thinking?** 

To be perfectly honest and overshareeven more that I already am, I was like two weeks in /r/nofap when I made that decision and had decided to give up making music entirely. Plot twist, nofap is a joke and dubstep (or neuro dnb) never dies. All major life changes made during that period are undone now except for the Bio thing. And I'm totally paralyzed. 

My mom and sister don't want to me to drop it and that only makes it worse. I feel like whether I take this class or not represents a fundamental choice about how my life is going to be. Not because the class on my transcript with materially affect much, but because, I'm just a fuckin loser man. 

I sit around all day playing the same mobile game I've been playing for two years (Death Road to Canada, check it), watching Superjail on dailymotion, and making really derivative EDM ( and drum in bass nonetheless, it's not even a thing in America) all the while deluding myself into thinking I can make some type of career out of it. 

Ha I should mention that all of last year I worked super hard on music and pretty much became a dismissive self-centered douche who's grades decreased linearly as the year progressed. The /r/nofap period was pretty much the part of me that still wanted a future staging a military coup on the crazy king who had begun to go senile. 

For the past few months I looked back on that year thinking that I needed it in order to get that lit my my system. But that's the thing. It's not. I just don't work as hard now. And I've also permanently dented that youthful optimism which some people ride off of into their 30s. I just suck now. 

So this brings me back to Bio. Could o still turn shit around and do the doctor thing. No. I can't. If you haven't already gathered from my writing this, I'm pretty much a stupid, mentally weak, unstable, spoiled, useless piece of trash who can't even write a coherent post on Reddit. 

What pushed it over the edge tonight (the second thing), was the realization that my musical pipe dream makes sense on no levels and is basically dead. All I do is rip off Emperor and Joe Ford, but with no work ethic whatsoever. So why continue? Shit hit me like a train. But instead of feeling freeing, I am now truly one with nothing. I can't see myself living 80~ more years of this pointless living, so why not make it like 1-2 years?

I've been playing this game called Death Road to Canada for awhile. It's about these guys who drive from Florida to Canada fighting a bunch of zombies on the way. Why don't I just do that? I live closer so I could use a bike. I worked last summer so I have over a thousand dollars. I feel like I could really make it. Maybe even to Alaska over the course of years. 

I'm starting to realize that life is not a web of straight and direct paths and options. You can do whatever you fucking want to. So why not? 

My best years are behind me and there is nothing but ruin ahead. But that's just adulthood, I guess. Why do adulthood? None of them are happy. You see it, you hear it, you feel it. Sure, you can preoccupy yourself with climbing the corporate ladder or chasing a relationship that will sour in 5 years leaving you with idiot kids who spew shit on Reddit at midnight. But none it seems like what I want. So why want anything? 

Most people only want things so they can be financially secure enough to simply exist or raise a family. But what's the end game there? I don't see one. Not judging, I don't have on either, but doing that just what I'm thinking of doing but with long extra steps?  

Actually, the Canada thing is silly. If sleeping on a store roof were so easy more people would do it. I'd be mixed in with the other homeless and probably get addicted to drugs or whatever. Ah, but no, if I avoided major cities and used a sleeping bag I could sleep in the woods. Especially as I go further north. But still it's easy to say this shit while in my pajama pants with 3 pillows on my bed, bit could I really do it? I want to find out. 

Truth be told, in the morning I'll probably wake up, read this, cringe a bit and delete it, but I'm really feeling this whole Canada thing right now, in this moment. Not excitement, but anxiety about even beginning to prepare for this journey. 

Anyway, if you actually read all that you deserve some type of award. Thanks? I don't know how to end a post like this. ",27Aug2018,1

Fast forward 3 years later, havent really been interested in relationships since and im doing pretty well in my studies &amp; already have too much on my plate but to this day every time i see a picture of her or her name on social media my heart aches...i dont really understand the feeling since logically speaking its been 3 damn years so why does it still ache when im reminded of her?

18,"I was the awkward member of the class that knew the answers to a lot of questions, but had nothing else going for me. Nobody even knew me. The people who tried gave up when they got to know me. They decided it wasn't worth the effort. They decided I wasn't worth the effort. I see them every now and again, living their lives like the horrible ways they abandoned me because I was different never happened. When women my age see me they mostly giggle and try to hide the fact that they're whispering about me, the loner that never really fit in. What makes it worse is the fact I have crushes on so many of them. Knowing that I have that affect on them, and they have no idea what effect they have on me, is torture. But I can't say anything, because that's weird and frowned on because I'm not a solid 10 male model who has the charisma of a god. Besides, these girls always have boyfriends anyway, and their boyfriends always look at me like they wish they could knock me out just for interacting with their girlfriends. I'm sorry but I'm a cashier. I HAVE TO interact with them. But I'll make it as quick as possible so you can go back to your wonderful lives and I can go back to being a fucking cashier.

22,"Broke up with my long term boyfriend this year. Things were going great. Was working on my body, focusing at work, socializing a little bit more than usual...

Started a long distance relationship with Garrett, nearly immediately after breaking up.  Wasn't taking it too seriously but, started talking every day, texting all the time, things were great he seemed perfect...

Simultaneously rekindled a relationship with Mitch, who is local and has been persuing me for years. Mitch and I would text but I never saw him out of respect for Garrett.  Even though Garrett never asked to be exclusive, I have strong feelings for him and don't want to be that kind of girl.

Few months into talking to Garrett, I feel him pulling away. He doesn't seem as interested in talking as frequently. He would always tell me he loves me, he said it first, and now that's starting to die out..I tell him I need more attention, similar to where it was when we first started talking. We had been planning on me going to visit him two weeks after I brought up my concerns.  I tell him I can't keep doing this and we need to stop.  He says ok and we for all for a week.

During this week, I see Mitch. Mitch rocked my world with amazing sex. It was the first time since breaking up with my ex that I've been intimate. Were so hot and heavy in the act all night that I never realized Mitch was cumming in me every time he came. 

I don't talk to Mitch much after our session, were still friends and very cordial to each other.  I just didn't feel the same flame I did before we became intimate. 

Garrett and I start talking again, I tell him we have to address some things before I am able to visit, inorder for me to feel the most comfortable. I didn't want to see him just for sex, I didn't want to waste my time with someone that just wanted my body, which is what it was beginning to seem like. 

I postponed my trip for next month.  Day before yesterday I'm feeling funny, cramps, insane mood swings, etc. I check my flow calendar and realized I haven't had my period. I go to buy a test and boom, extra pregnant and Mitch is the daddy.

I told Mitch, we both agree a child isn't in our best interests right now. So I've already set up a time at the clinic to terminate my pregnancy. It's $550 and I cant afford it. I called NAF and they're giving me $135 ... Mitch is willing to help but I just don't want his help. I don't want anything to do with him, is that wrong of me?  

Garrett doesn't know, and I'm taking it to my grave with him. But today and the past couple of days I feel the relationship with Garrett and I regressing. I feel jealous about other women, he doesn't talk to me as much. He only sent me a couple texts. We talked about 10 minutes today and he didn't even say goodnight, just kinda ghosted me tonight. 

I don't know where I'm going with this ramble but, I'm all over the place. I haven't cried in weeks.  Even after knowing I'm preg and knowing I'm going to terminate it, I can't cry.  I'm sitting here alone in the dark doing stir crazy. How do I fucking deal with this without self harm or falling into bad habits. After this should I just ditch everyone and start over again from scratch?",27Aug2018,1

But I instantly really liked this guy and we got each others contact info and have been messaging basically daily. Very casual stuff. But I’m coming back from out of town soon and he wants to hang out. He seems like he really wants to get to know me instead of just hooks up which is cool. The problem is I feel like he’s really out of my league and I’m afraid once he sees me he’ll think I’m fat and ugly. I’m not faking anyone out with my pictures or anything I just think I’m a lot fatter and uglier in real life. Anyone experience something similar?

     I’m currently going through problems Where someone would tell me to do something later but then eventually forget, maybe because it wasn’t important to me so I didn’t do it but I’m not sure. I would also have trouble listening because something else interests me more then the conversation making me forget, I also have trouble concentrating in a conversation because I lack intuition. I’ll eventually understand but I’ll take me some time, think of it this way I’m like a slow chess player trying to play a quick game of chess. This world feel too fast for me. I have a trouble making up my mind on things because I don’t want to make a big mistake or fail especially when it’s important. I end up rethinking thing things that don’t need to be rethought, I do this because I want to make sure it’s not a mistake, then I move on ( so I have problems with trusting my first thought).

31,"I met you for the first time Saturday. I was stunned by your beauty. I wanted to talk to you, but I wasn't sure what to say at first. I decided to play it cool and introduce myself to you.

I came up to you and told you my name and you proceeded to tell me yours in return. We shook hands and I felt your firm handshake. You are a woman that appreciates a good handshake and knows how to give one.

You and I started talking and I got to know you a little bit more as we were both doing landscaping work for the school makeover that our church had asked for volunteers for. I found out that you were in the military and have been in the military for 12 years. I asked you if you had joined the military directly out of high school to which you replied yes. I then took a guess as to how old you were (30?) and you confirmed it.

You told me more about yourself. You told me a little bit about your family, what you did in the military, and you weren't upset at the fact that even though my little sister is in the military, I still have a hard time understanding what she is talking about in regards to what she does every day. (In one ear and out the other as I out it).

We lost contact for a little bit as I kept on getting called away from my landscaping duties to do some heavy lifting (my back still hurts) but eventually I found my way back to you as I was sent to the same room you were in during our school makeover.

We chitchatted a little bit more and even though we talked, we talked about every day things. Still, I enjoyed talking to someone such as yourself.

The time came for when I had to bid you a fond farewll. I shook your hand and told you that it was nice to work with and a pleasure to talk with you. I turned and walked out the doorway and I am about 150 feet down the hall when I hear my name called out. I turned to see you running towards me and you ask me about my streaming that I do. You ask for my channel name so that way you can follow me.

I decide now is as good of a time as any to ask for your phone number, so I play it smooth and purposefully stutter and get confused while asking for it explaining that it will be better if I send you my channel url via text message. You gladly give it over, but I think you already knew my plan. I send you my url and said bye to you. When you said bye, I think you were sad to see me go judging by the way you sounded when you said it.

I see you again yesterday during church and you look even more beautiful. You wave at me, and I wave back. I feel like I have butterflies in my stomach seeing you. A good majority of the service passes by and I decided that it was a good idea to send a message apologizing for being weird because I was nervous around women.

The rest of the service passes by and I am sitting out in the lobby thinking of how stupid I was for sending that message. I see you walking towards me and you came over and apologize for not stopping to hi, but that you were already running late. I told he that it was ok, that I was late as well.

I tell you that i sent you a text message. You pull your phone out and look at the message. You take a minute to read it and you tell me that there is no reason to apologize, but for the record, she didnt think I was being weird.

I decide now is as good of a time as any to ask you a certain question, but before I have the chance to, you drop a bombshell on me. You let me know that you are going to be deployed for 3 months. I feel my face drop and I think you saw it too. But, I had an idea. I ask you that when you get back if you would like to go grab a bite to eat, if that is alright with you, and you laugh and say yes, but only as long as I am ok with it being around Christmas time.

We say our goodbyes and I see the sadness in your eyes. I think you see the sadness in mine as well, but I think that you are reassured because of the fact that you and I will see each other again in just a few short months.

Is this a chance encounter? I think God placed me here for you to meet me in that exact moment, though, I can't be too sure. Regardless, I am happy to have met you, and I am excited to see where this goes.",27Aug2018,0

See the face looking back at you?

That person is the only important reason why you remain lonely, why you hate yourself. That person is the only person on the face of this Earth that will ever be able to give you the love you need, the love you deserve to have! Get to know that person. Because you don't know them like you think you do. 

Discover the original source of your pain. Dig deep. Go to therapy. Open up. Cry. Let it out. Find that pain. And let it go. It is both the most important and the least important of things. The most important thing to discover and the least important thing to hold onto. Let go for it is the anchor that weighs you down. 

Let go of the need for external sources of closure. You will not get it. You are the only one who can give yourself the closure you need. 

Forgive yourself. No one else can.  You are human, to be human is to be flawed, to be raw, to be needing, to hurt and to be hurt. 

It is okay not to be okay. 

Each of us is a raw, pain filled being on this little planet wearing suits of armour to try to fool everyone else that they are invincible. No one else will take off their armour to show you, they risk too much in doing so. But know that it is the truth and that you are not alone. ",27Aug2018,1

38,"i'm an introvert, and i'm described as quiet by everyone who knows me. all of my classmates and friends' first impression of me is always that one word i hate, ""quiet"". 

i'm not quiet. i'm loud inside. i feel emotions stronger than most do, and i know myself best.

i can't communicate well, that's for sure. i have trouble expressing myself to people. i stammer, i slur, i can't speak properly. which is why i don't speak much. which is why people call me ""quiet"".

but i'm more than just quiet. i love to read books - fiction, non-fiction, fairy tales (never too old for that) and even philosophy books and bibliographies; and writing is my solace. writing is the only way i can get my point across without being interrupted or being judged at, just like what i'm doing now.

is it that socially unacceptable to be an introvert? is the only way to get my voice heard to speak out in class by raising questions and being outgoing as a leader? i'm strong in my own way, and i know how much power an introvert can hold.

to my mum who thinks i have to speak up more: i don't have to. i'm not obliged to. it's not a social requirement that i have to speak all the time. being a little quiet can't hurt, can it?  do you think i'm not brave enough to speak in front of an audience?

First one is: someone touching any legs up to my rear end (sounds dumb) my defence mechanism kicks in and i move away (from the person touching me) 
Second one is: finger locking, either mutual or someone locking fingers with me from the back of my hand (i can hold hands tho). Defence mechanism kicks in immediately, my heart rate rises a lot and im in a state of adrenaline when i pull my hand away with all of my strenght. I slapped or pushed away a few people involuntarily. After that my breathing is hard. Its pretty strange but just thinking about it rises my heart rate. I havent been abused or anything like that.

42,"So basically I was an idiot in high school. Probably passed all my classes with one point. I didn’t care. I assumed I would just be fine going to a technical school because they don’t care about grades. Scored a 23 on the act I think it was. Recently my job cut my hours so I’m struggling. I’ve also decided I wanted to go to school now. And I can’t afford a technical school as of now and it’s a hard commitment. I talked to my parents about trying to get into online college since campus doesn’t appeal to me and it would be able to go at my pace for such a dumbass. My mother laughed and basically told me I wouldn’t succeed. My father wants me to go to campus and do rotc for scholarships and such but I don’t want to go to campus. My other thought was maybe join the air force and suck up the fact that I’m a little bitch and have no physical or mental strength. 

Should I keep trying to make things work?

Wow it sounds easy. Idk I'm always bitching about how I'm not DM'ing DnD games like I did last year anymore and other shit. Trying to find out why I'm not and one reason is that I started a new game but I sort of fucked it or don;t like how its going and I don;t have the motivation even though the first game was fun, and the problem in the is surely fixable, but I sort of want to just change the whole game system and I just lack the humility and have too much pride to admit i chose the wrong system. Or me working now rather than being in high school has sucked away my motivation like it has done with a friend of mine even though I think my job is pretty good. Or I'm thinking my sinuses might be too congested and stop me form breathing properly during the day/night because my nose is always fucking blocked and the doctor said try antihistamines and a steroid nasal spray but I am too busy or lack motivation to get around to that yet and besides I feel the problem isn't mucus its just the shitty framework of my nose or some shit idk but I'm also a bit of a hypochondriac so who the fuck knows but breathing is annoying or maybe just because I am paying too much attention to it. Then there's the fact that both my crushes are in relationships, a girl and sort of a guy lol. And I was bitching about how I'd like to say I am a DM but I can't to the girl even though I don't know her too well and thats is what made me think I was being too negative also because she was talking about how she killed a bunch of Cacti and overestimated their toughness and I said maybe you underestimated your ability to look after them, which was a shitty negative joke. And looking back on our most recent conversation when we hung out together we had a lot of laughs and were both nervous about playing chess , she said that she was nervous cos she felt she was getting judged for moves and I probs didn't respond to that well enough but I was nervous too and we wanted to talk instead of play so we ended up half assing the game. It was so weird though because we went out with friends mot of whom know I have a crush on her and they eventually left us to play chess but that was so weird and I probs gave off  too negative vibes because of how nervous I was and how I was guilty that about even being alone with her when she has a bf and I have  crush so we stayed a bit longer rushing the chess and then we left and she said where are we going next and I was like um a bookstore and then I fumbled with directions and it was like a 10 minute walk at night and she was like if its far I'll head home and ok yea I didn't know where the fuck else I should have suggested  a neat arcade game bar but drinking alone in  that situation eeh idk. Also she is super on top of social cues and I think she is great at reading people from playing playing board games with her and hanging out and her best friend knows I have a crush on her and so she probs knows as well but what is she doing with that information? She did say she liked a character from my favourite book because he was honest, was that a hint for me to say to her, who has a bf, oh I like you? I don't even fucking know. I think I've lost all hope of this post being not identifiable so hopefully no one finds this shit omg the woman I've been talking about is studying psych and fuck looking this would be a nice case study I bet ha. I've only had like less than a glass of wine. Annnd my best friend who is super busy, I am seeing him later this week so I thought I'd get this out of my system now and he's heard most of it and the girl isn't coming along with us later this week :(, she is going to the same thing that we are going to but just one that is closer to her place, and not an hours travel away because it ends at 10:00-10:30 huh that actually sorta makes sense maybe its not just because I gave a horrible impression the last time we hung out uugh. But yea I soo need to get drunk with my busy best friend and rant this all out to him, that'll be fun.



So in summary, I'm not running RPG's, I may be ( ""maybe"" hah look at this post)  being too negative, my nose is always fucking blocked and it is annoying and my crushes are in relationships, what do?

46,"It’s happened to all of us...we’ve inherited some sort of personality quirk from our parents that we hate. Mine that I have been thinking about most recently is from my dad. He is a very loud, opinionated, and quite frankly, exhausting person. I am nowhere near that, but I am starting to wonder how I might be able to tone down my personality a bit.

It’s actually very weird. I should probably take that personality test everyone takes. Maybe that would help. Anyway...in my workplace, I’m introverted and don’t like socializing really. I keep to myself...maybe even to the point where people think I’m rude. But sometime when I am around friends, I find that I am always cracking jokes (some of which just aren’t funny...but some are!!) and being a bit on the louder side, and maybe a bit opinionated and possibly obnoxious...I’m not sure about that last bit, just trying to judge myself a bit on the harsher side maybe? One guy in one of my college classes described me as feast or famine...he said that I was usually so quiet, but then when I did talk, it was a LOT. 

My sister is much more reserved than me. I want to learn to chill the eff out and be more passive. I know some things are pretty hard wired into our personalities, but I believe if we are mindful and dedicated, we can change the outcome. It’s a weird problem to try to navigate though....

I don’t know if I’ll be getting paid which I didn’t ask too because I see it as I’m doing a favor for my good friends family. Anyways my huge contemplation is this, they asked me what groceries I would like for the house? Since I really only buy the basic and minimal when I personally go grocery shopping and I more so go out to eat almost every day. I seriously don’t know what to tell them?! I really want to take this opportunity to eat a lil healthier then I usually do. But I also don’t want to overwhelm them with a Long grocery list. So please Reddit community. What groceries would be basic healthy and delicious and appropriate for me to ask for. Thank you for your time.

48,"I have a problem and looking for a solution.

My past: I am from India, southern part. I was a smart kid and then turned out to be normal kid.
When I was 18, I discovered masturbation and started doing it almost everyday for about an year. Then I joined a very good institute for research in Math and Computer science ( and physics), now, after an year I realised “I don’t want to do a phd in Math or Physics”. 

I have no idea what to do and where to go after this B.Sc. I want a subject that’s good for both research and job. People in my college, discourage this idea.  My parents want me to go abroad for M.Sc. I don’t know what to do, and I have about 9 months to decide. My CGPA is great. Even if I want to change fields, no prof will write a  recommendation letters for me.   

College life is too stressful, people here only study and banter. Because of anxiety, lot of my hair turned grey and people don’t talk to me like they talk to other people. I feel discouraged by everything and unconfident about myself.

Putting all this together:

I feel anxious all the time, sometimes about the fact that I have so much to study, about homeworks, about what to do next, what other people think. I can’t even think clearly most of the time. I cant even focus on classes and think about my thoughts only. I want to go a monastery and fucking meditate.  I seriously have no idea, what to do. I feel like I don’t belong in this stressful world. I am afraid of all most everything.

I dont really care what you eat, doesnt effect me at all, but its when you start saying things that arent true that it bugs me.

&amp;#x200B;

Humans evolved to eat meat not because it tastes good, but because brains use a lot of protein to grow and for good neurological health, the brain makes it taste good because it needs it, the same with sugars.

Most vegetables dont contain all the essential amino-acids (what proteins are made up of) which essentially all meat does, and not nearly in the same amounts. which is why most vegans (and some vegetarians) need supplements in order to be ""healthy"".

&amp;#x200B;

""Its more natural"", most almond/soy etc ""milks"" are supplemented with calcium and vit D (which is naturally abundant in cows milk), also a side note humans drinking cows milk isnt unnatural, Humans over the thousands of years who domesticated cows evolved to not become lactose intolerant (which was natural due to the body not needing the specific enzymes needed to break down milk past the baby years) and because of that naturally we evolved to drink cows milk. Most native american populations (and other populations who didnt domesticate cows) are vastly lactose intolerant, due to cows not being native to the US,

I wasn’t messaging her 24/7, only about twice a week I would say something to her. She stopped replying a month ago, last message asking her how was the video game she was playing. She never actively reached out to me, everybody always says that if you really want to talk, then you would message the person instead of waiting. I did, but she never did the same for me.

Okay so all throughout my life I've been abused by my mother. It all started when I spoke up against my brothers bullying in school. Since that day my mother has had some kind of grudge against me and does everything in her power to make my life impossible. From time to time she randomly acts really nice tho that's the first clue to all of this. Slowly she has put everyone I once cared about against me, including my teachers. 

I, unlike my siblings and father have refused to take her BS. She wants people to beg her so, when I offer something and she says no well no then. She gets mad unless you tell her bless you when she sneezes. She gets mad if you don't invite her somewhere etc. Stupid stuff like that. So since she got tired of me not giving a fuck about her she kicked me out last Thursday. I was told I had 6 months to leave then she came back a hour later with 3 months only. 

I stopped talking to all of them since ya... Yep. So today I get in the shower. (Keep in mind mother has been trying to get me to talk to her since Thursday) she randomly starts yelling at someone. Can't make out what she's saying but I can hear her yelling and no one is in the house except for me and her. So I just shrug it off..

When I get out of the bathroom and get dressed she was outside and I was gonna go get my goes that I had washed from outside. So instead I say ""can you pass me my shoes?"" And she looks at me with this furious face.. bruh wtf I do now?

I'm pretty much set on tech (I'm going to use 'tech' to refer to both computer tech and electronics to make things simpler) , but here's the problem: I don't know which section of the industry is right for me, and what I would find my ideal job', since this field is massive. I think electronics and PCB circuit design look fascinating, and a bit closer to me, but I am still nowhere near as educated about it as I'd like myself to be. 

Here's the thing: I'm pretty undecided about what I want to do! I just want to be set on THE thing so that I can prepare early and not needing to panic like crazy in 4 years when I need to choose an university (I have already decided that I am going to go to another country, probably a Scandinavian one, for University because you need to pay a LOT of money in Hungary for it. And I also just want to go out there and experience other countries in the world, though both of these are equally big factors in why I want to study abroad). I am planning to do some sort of a Computer Science course, but again, not completely sure, only about 50%.

60,"I'm a 23 year old virgin who has never been in a relationship. About a month ago I met a girl on a dating app and we have gone out once a week. She wasn't really putting in effort to text me or plan the dates and she even gave me a last minute notice for one of the dates. On the dates she is better though but we had a talk recently where I asked where we were going and she said she doesn't know what she wants and probably wont be able to give me a relationship ever. She did say she is seeing other guys but not seriously and she knows I'm not seeing anyone. We are going out again in a week to talk about that more and have another date as well. 

I'm sure I'm just not the guy she wants to be with, just a placeholder for the right one. While she is great, compared to the other girls I've dated, I feel like crap. We are casually dating and I'm not even sure what that means considering we have barely seen each other and she barely texts back. I get people have their own lives and all of that but I'm not sure what to think. Its like I have to remind myself that I'm seeing her. The other girls I've dated treated me like crap but they actually made me their back up guy and wanted me to stick around just so they would have a constant source of attention while they were seeing other guys.

I've been working on myself and am doing well mostly. My main issues seem to be my self esteem, anxiousness, being too accommodating and available so I got walked all over before. I feel like its shown a little to this girl I've been seeing as well. Anyways, I hate myself for being such a bitch that people walk all over. If I was more manly I wouldn't be single or a virgin still. I would have already been past that. I would have gotten somewhere in college. Now I'm just working on a certification before I start working full time. I'll never be able to get those experiences with the girls that walked all over me or any other girl when I was young. Idk how to meet anyone, I have people on here telling me to lower my standards, I have others saying I shouldn't approach women in public, to drink and go to clubs and sleep around instead of wanting a relationship, I have people telling me it will happen, I'll meet someone at work and to not date at work.

I feel so stupid, unmanly, worthless just hearing all these things while everyone is in relationships, dating, or sleeping around. Dating apps haven't gotten me anywhere, I just went on a date with a different girl and I was not interested in her and I could tell she wasn't really interested either. Idk what to do anymore, all I think about is dating, wanting a girlfriend, someone I'm attracted to and its not like I'm going for models or along those lines at all. Everyone tells me I have so much to offer, my looks, my style, my degree, I have many friends both guys and girls, I have a fun personality, I'm mature, I work out, etc. according to my friends and even random strangers online or on the street that come up and compliment me. I just keep thinking about how I'm alone, how I want to have all of that fun with someone and spend my days with them. But I'm alone and I can't get over it and I can't focus on studying or doing anything else. 

I know this is just self pity and I'm to blame for being walked all over and I'm alone because I wasn't good enough. I go therapy but it hasn't helped at all with dating and women.

64,"I'm a 24 year old recent-grad who wants to immigrate *(or expat, whatever)* to Germany. My girlfriend lives there and this summer I was to go there with a visitor's visa for the last time before I apply for a work/student's visa *(whichever is more fitting, since I want to do both)*. Trouble is, my visa was rejected due to me being unemployed at the moment, stating ""they couldn't find enough evidence for me to come back."" I mean, they're not wrong, as you can see; but I wasn't planning on becoming an illegal immigrant, which they thought I was going to.

​

So I wait. And I wait, and I wait. It's been 6 weeks; 6 long weeks of depression, misery and isolation on my part with nothing to do but sit on my ass in the room, take occasional walks, play video games, eat, sleep, wake up; repeat. Sounds like a dream, right? Certainly, for those of you who are up to their eyeballs with tedious work would feel like I'm being ungrateful for the time that's 'given.' But I'm not, and I can't quite put into words how this feels like a personal hell; the sensation of feeling useless, being of no use other than taking up space...

​

I can't look for work, because I keep thinking they could call tomorrow, or in an hour, any time now -- not that any place I applied have accepted me. I can't go anywhere, because if and when they do call me, I have to contact them in my current city. I can't do any freelancing work either, because there aren't any to be found at the moment, which is convenient. /s So I've been doing nothing but wait for the past 6 weeks and I have another 6 to go -- at least! *(Officially, the process takes up to 90 days before it's concluded, though there are some exceptions, I'm told, that exceeds that time frame.)*

​

The worst part is, I was supposed to take this ""trip"" together with my sister, who's never been to Germany. She was super excited to go with me and do stuff together, up until my visa was not accepted -- while hers did. Because she is currently 16, she cannot go there by herself, not without me at least. So this whole shitpad of bureaucracy not only ruined my entire post-grad life, but her own summer break -- before she braces herself into a stressful year of college exams and stuff. Neat.

​

I keep myself busy by studying physics *(the second degree I wish to study in the foreseeable future)*, taking notes and reading field-related texts to dim the sensation of uselessness, but that lasts up until my depression and anxiety kicks in, which is faster than you can say ""The Chandrasekhar Limit.""

​

So yeah, if you truly, sincerely despise someone; one of the best punishments you can wish for them is giving them a lot of free time, to the point of making them feel useless. It may not seem like much at first, but trust me on this; I speak from firsthand experience.

​

I'm sorry for this post and sorry if I'm weighing you lot down. I just wanted a place to get this whole thing out of my system. I can't quite share this with my girlfriend and my family *(though they are aware how I am)* as they have enough on their plates.",27Aug2018,1

66,"She passed away earlier this afternoon. Everyone in my family has responded appropriately by crying and when my father told me the news my first instinct was to ask if he was ok, if my grandpa was ok. 

She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's a few years back and had been deteriorating with each passing year. For the last year, shes been bedridden and hospice came in. I was afraid to see her everytime I visited because I knew the inevitable was going to happen soon, but I did. And I talked to her. I saw her at the beginning of the month and told her I loved her. 

I don't know if my response is the way it is, because of the face that I've been mentally preparing myself for this day to come or what. I feel bad that I'm not crying, and I'm not a very crying person in general. I'm going to remember how she was before. The woman who taught me how to bake, the woman who took care of me when my parents weren't around. She took me to the beach every summer and laughed when my brother and I brought her sand dollars. She was a wonderful woman and I'm grateful for the woman she was. I'm happy shes not suffering anymore.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is that of this response is normal or not. 

Advice is welcomed. ",27Aug2018,2

I think it’s weird how most things that affect people are always other people, the things that get me down the most are always people, relationships, or something like that. Money is stressful, but people make me depressed.
I’m super lost and super down, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to fix my head, taking meds just makes me feel so suppressed but the alternative is manic and suicidal ... I just pray and hope that one day I’ll be brave enough to kill myself, until then I’ll take my pills and exist. ",27Aug2018,3

74,"It's very simple.  I am not a problematic neighbor.  I'm quiet and take care of my space.  One time I was coming home and he was in his driveway meanmugging me as soon as I got around the corner.  I didn't take it personally because everyone has bad days and can accidentally project, so just smiled and raised my hand to wave.  He immediately broke eye contact at this and marched into his house.

A couple days later I went out back and saw he was outside.  He immediately dropped his book on the table (I heard it slam), so I looked because of how loud it was, and he had powerwalked inside and slammed and locked the door.  Again I didn't take it personally but he's done it multiple times as soon as I go out back, no matter what he's doing (mowing out back with dog company you name it), as soon as he notices I'm outside he's charging to get in through his back door.  Whenever I try to greet him he ignores me, so I've mostly been ignoring him.  But whenever I'm out front and he's out front he's always staring at me, most of the time as soon as I make eye contact he will march inside his house.  Sometimes he will just stand there and keep staring but I will see him clearly tense up, like he's expecting me to charge him or something.  If I smile wave or say anything he ignores it all.  I've tried ringing his door when I know he's home so we can talk about whatever it is that's going on and defuse the whole thing, but he doesn't answer, and I'm not ringing anymore because at this point I'm getting the impression he's intentionally trying to escalate tension with me so if I keep ringing he may take that as a sign of ""harassment"" for this thing he's been building.

Also recently he's had a younger woman living with him, I can't tell if it's granddaughter or a niece or a friend or someone he's seeing, my best guess would be granddaughter or niece given the age gap.  Anyway one of the times he was out front staring at me she was there but she looked confused about what he was doing and went inside.  Every time I've seen her since she's been mimicking his actions - if I'm out back and she's out back in she goes the way he would, if both are out back both go in.  Same treatment out front, she will just stare and be nonresponsive, if both are out front both stare and he won't run but will instead lean into her like he's pretending he's afraid of me.

Then I was out front and I think it was his brother was just coming over.  Brother got out of his vehicle and looked at me, I smiled and waved, he waved back.  I thought finally! But it was like a temporary ""glitch"" in brother not being informed of my neighbor's game or something, because all other times I've seen him since have been the same run/stare/nonresponse treatment.  There was also a time where the woman came home while I was out front doing yardwork, and in my peripheral I could see her sitting in her vehicle staring at me while on the phone.  I had to leave to the garage to get something, when I came back she had gotten out of her vehicle and was walking into his house, but when she heard me returning to my yard she spun to face me and froze, she was still on her phone but not talking.  Eventually she backed away and went inside.

I had posted this before and someone asked if they were maybe racist.  We're all white.  I didn't care a lot at first but it's really starting to make me angry.  The thing is I'm aware it's just stares running away faking afraid etc. to *absolutely nothing*.  So if I blow up I have nothing for legal defense and they do.  Which is the only reason I can maybe think why they're doing this nonsense, get the guy next door to blow his lid on us and maybe we get a payout mentality?

I don't know.  I don't get it.  Somebody else had suggested I just sit on his propery when he isn't home waiting for him to come home to force a dialogue, since then I could at least record myself trying to talk to him even if he ran away? But I know if neighbors saw me waiting on his property that's an overstep and it gives him social backing.  Plus even if noone saw let's say the woman came home first, she can spin that in a lot of ways.  Not to mention he himself could just come home and use it as an excuse to get out with a bat or something, then tell cops any story to give him footing in the situation because after all I'm the one that was waiting on his property for him to come home.

I have no idea what to do but this is definitely starting to set me off.",27Aug2018,2

79,"Moved in with my parents after I graduated and honestly it's been great. No need to pay for rent or food, so any money I make goes straight to my savings. Mom does my laundry even though I insist she doesn't have to. And my parents are generally chill people that don't smother me or get over-involved in my life. Honestly I'd say I'm pretty good friends with my parents if that makes sense.

But the big issue is that I feel super self-conscious that I live with my parents when it comes to my women. I'm not saying I'm a super suave ladies man or anything. But I'm a bit nervous of the day when I wanna take a girl home, and have to deal with my parents being there.

82,"Whenever I go outside, either in public or in private (like my garden) I feel extremely overwhelmed. Even if it’s somewhere rather plain, I get sever sensory overload. As you can imagine it makes me anxious and uncomfortable, especially in built up areas it’s like there’s too much to look at. I don’t mind if I’m in a car though. 

Being around people in public places, strangers especially, makes me really insecure, I feel like they’re watching me kinda, like they know me and like I’m being followed and observed. Also I have a habit of observing others, especially what they’re wearing for some reason. It makes me super self aware / can’t conscious and insecure. 

Obviously I know it’s irrational but I can’t shake the feelings.  

Does anyone know how to stop these feelings? Or what they could be caused by? Anxiety is the obvious answer but anything more?",27Aug2018,3

85,"     I’m Anthony I’m 20 years old and I have issues and I think you guys can help. I’m a person without a proper diet, lack of hydration, and institutionalized in my Moms home with no job, I’ve been doing this for 2 years. So I lack communication skills and probably more that I don’t know of(lack of understanding oneself). There are 5 people and my dog living in this home; my dog Luna that is 9 months, my youngest step brother that is 6, my little sister that is 17, my brother that is 18, and myself being the eldest. My little brother stays with us 4 times a week, goes to his dads 3 times a week, my little sister goes to school, and my brother goes to work, and my mom has 2 jobs. I have a mutual relationship with my family.
 
     I’m currently going through problems Where someone would tell me to do something later but then eventually forget, maybe because it wasn’t important to me so I didn’t do it but I’m not sure. I would also have trouble listening because something else interests me more then the conversation making me forget, I also have trouble concentrating in a conversation because I lack intuition. I’ll eventually understand but I’ll take me some time, think of it this way I’m like a slow chess player trying to play a quick game of chess. This world feel too fast for me. I have a trouble making up my mind on things because I don’t want to make a big mistake or fail especially when it’s important. I end up rethinking things that don’t need to be rethought, I do this because I want to make sure it’s not a mistake, then I move on (so I have problems with trusting my first thought). 
   
     I’m giving effort to improve my life to become the best version of myself. I have been really motivated to do the things that I want, but my Will Power is not as strong as I want it to be. So the best start is to begin a routine to build my Will Power, my Conscious Mind and strengthen my Subconscious Mind exponentially. [Here’s My Routine](https://imgur.com/a/dnyjQv2) On Weekends my Plan is to Meditate for 15min then gradually work my way up to 4hrs. I also want to start the [Mediterranean Diet](https://imgur.com/a/rq670aA) to improve my overall heath. 

     Em I missing anything? What should I do to improve my life? Any advice? I Feel I’m heading the right direction physically, but mentally I feel challenged and I don’t feel that the goal I set up for myself will fix my mental equity. I feel like meditation won’t solve everything in paragraph 2. I’ve been having trouble trying to meditate. I feel like meditation isn’t helping me I still feel the same after meditation. Could it be because I’m not doing it right or could it be because I haven’t been doing it long enough to notice a difference? I really hope you guys could help me with my problems. If you want to know more about me send me a direct message. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.
