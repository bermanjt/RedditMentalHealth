0,"My buddy had a financial windfall recently from some inheritance and has decided to use it to start his dream business so he can build up some savings for his kid to go to college. The idea is ""like a gym but for straight people and 100% solar powered"". He's already picked out a vacant property in the poor part of town because he really wants to help simulate the economy there and get the local gangs settling things on the B-ball court. The only question left is what should he call it??

Here's our ideas so far:

* Razor's Edge

* Sunshine Hill

* Long Hard Steel

* Superman Dojo

* Planet Vegeta

* Bufftown

* Starburst Fitness

* Motherfucker Gym

1,"I worked with a company which required us to travel. They were not too bad with hotel reservations and most of the time it was good and sometimes not. I've heard stories of many bad hotels, but this was my first time with one.

Basically, the hotel was ""remodeled"" and clean. Upon arrival, the rooms were still run down, the doors didn't shut all the way so bugs and mosquitoes got in. I got another room and same story.  I left a review on google and that caught the eye of manager and he called my boss early in the morning asking if he can have me remove it because they were giving us a good deal. I said okay and removed it. Later that day, the other coworkers had problems with gang-banging tenants there and called the boss, so the rest of us all backed moving. Come next week, before we went back, I asked if were going to the same hotel and he said yes.  (We once had a bad hotel they reserved and after we checked in, we left and got different ones so it wasn't an issue. But this time, boss didn't do that. )

So I said I'm not going there because the rooms were dirty (pillows smelled  like the last person who slept on it), found a cum stain on the ottomon, mosquitos coming through the unsealed door jambs, a shitty excuse of a continental breakfast, and just attracts the wrong crowd.

He tried to bluff me that if I don't like it then quit.  They need all the manpower because they had lots of people who left for other opportunities. I called his bluff and quit and they were upset hat I did.

Now that I quit, I put the review back on google maps and they keep getting removed

3,"Im a 32/m with a wife and two kids. I've had a really hard past week and it's really getting me down. I've been depressed for awhile over this. I just needed to vent for a minute. 

It just feels like we're trapped. My whole adult life, it has always seemed like my income has been slightly above or at poverty. I currently make 45k a year, but I feel like i have less money now than I did when I made $10 an hour?!

Our one car is in the shop with 300k miles and the transmission has gone out. Our other car is 230k miles and i'm sure won't last much longer. We have zero savings or emergency fund. 

My wife can't find a job locally (I live in the country) and now that we're at one car, it has to be during hours when I am home (I commute to an expensive city 55 miles away, one trip). 

It just feels like we're sinking, with no way out. Our credit is shot from it, our savings is empty, and we can't seem to find a way to earn more. We budget so tightly that we don't even have Netflix. We've tracked our spending and we don't eat out excessively. Our rent and bills are below average.

I can't afford health or dental insurance for anyone in my family other than myself, so we're walking a thin line there. 

Where is the American dream?! I can't crawl out from this enough to even purchase a reliable vehicle. I can't move closer to my job or find closer work, as there is nothing. I've never taken my kids on vacation. ",12Jul2018,1
5,"So I wake up at six every morning, get ready and sit in traffic for an hour, work for the next 9 hours, sit in another hour of traffic, when I’m home I have dinner and then watch tv for two hours with my wife and fall asleep. Sometimes we have sex but we’ve been together so long there’s love but no passion. My wife is great but it’s just so boring, I’m honestly bored of sex already and I can’t imagine having sex with the same person for the rest of my life, it depresses me.

I drink on the weekends, do some meaningless fun like bbq or go bar hopping... but none of it excites me or makes me happy anymore. I can’t even get drunk cause I gained so much weight and drink so much that I don’t get drunk when I drink. I don’t enjoy any of the hobbies I used to enjoy when I was younger like playing music or video games or learning about science...

9,"She is 20 yr old. Has been seeing a low life for 2 years. They constantly fight, it’s very toxic. Lots of mistrust and disrespect. They break up for a couple of days only to get back together. I’m so tired of seeing her hurt. The kind of tired that keeps me up at night. I’m always on edge, she cries and gets really angry and everytime she tells me it’s the last time they break up. And every time they break up I feel a weight lifted off my shoulders. Only to feel heavy again when she takes him back. He’s verbally abusive and threatens her all the time. I’m scared. My gut feeling is that it will ruin her life. I give her advice, I talk to her about how she deserves so much better, she’s hard working, she is goal orientated, she’s beautiful!!! She’s smart on every other aspect except him!! I honestly hate him and I’m starting to feel really angry at her for being so stupid. I can’t stop her from seeing him. I feel like she doesn’t give a shit how this affects me. I don’t want to alienate her because I think that will push her closer to him and that’s what he wants, he’s so controlling. I honestly feel like such a failure, all my life I’ve gone above and beyond to take care of her and she has no regard for her life. She’s either stupid, naive, or just plain dumb. He never takes her on dates, if he buys her a $7 meal he constantly throws it in her face. I’m just so tired, I’m tired of praying for her to open her eyes, I’m tired of wishing she could move on, I’m tired of crying about it, I’m tired of seeing her cry, I’m tired of seeing her be so miserable. She has lowered her standards by being with him and I just don’t know where I went wrong!! I feel like my job is to protect her but she only comes to me when she’s sure she’s leaving him for good then in the coming days she gets distant and I know it’s because he’s reeled her in again and then she acts like she doesn’t need me again. Can someone please give me honest advice? ",12Jul2018,49

13,"It's your birthday right now. You'd be twenty six. Most of the time I try to think of it as something that just happened, but it's more than that. It just hurts too much to delve into how I really feel when I think of what you did. I know times were tough and you were hurting, but you destroyed us.

 Mom found you. She replays that night in her head a hundred times a day. She told me about the storm that night and how it woke her up. She came downstairs for water and thought she saw you standing in the shed. She went upstairs and put the contacts in to see what you were doing out there and that's when she saw you hanging. She tried to get you down but the extension cord was too tight and you were too heavy. She cut you down and you hit the floor. I really hate you for doing that to her. Dad just drinks more, but now he doesn't even try to do better. 

Mike and I both have daughters now. We tell them about Uncle Cody, they know who you were. I wish you were here. I know you were being bullied. I almost killed him, it's hard to get a good job but he won't be bullying anyone else.

Life was already fucked up but the last 7 years have been the hardest. We still do the skateboard contest for you and your friend every year. I stopped going to the skate park because I hate looking at your memorial. Why didn't you message me or Mike? Or Mom or Dad? Why?

I tried to call, I was coming into town the next day to see you. I was going to surprise you and take you skating. You took all the best things away when you took yourself away. It haunts me. I'll always feel like if you'd have had the strength to make it through that night you'd have gotten through it. Maybe it's selfish of me to wish you'd have gone through the pain instead of ending it, but I don't think it's as selfish as what you did.

I love you and always will, that's why I'm so angry with you and always will be. You ruined everyone's lives. Nothing will ever be the same and it's just not okay. I miss you. Happy birthday brother.",12Jul2018,5
14,"The past year (July of 17-now) has been absolutely insane. I survived a car crash that should have killed me, got my ass back in school (nail tech), worked my damn ass off and finished, I just passed both of my state board exams, and I have a great job lined up. 

I haven’t had more than a few hours to myself in so long! 

My parents and younger sister are spending a week on the Florida keys, and they asked me to stay at their place while they’re gone to take care of their two dogs and two elderly cats. There’s going to be nobody else there but me, for a solid week. 

It’s going to be great to not have to worry about anything outside of that house, and I plan on using the time to catch up on some of the art/writing projects I haven’t had time for. It’ll also be nice to not have to clean up after anybody else for a change! 

The only thing (apart from me getting bored) that I’m concerned about is coming home to a disaster of a house. I love my husband but he’s a slob. We just spent three solid days cleaning out the house from top to bottom, and I’ve actually made progress in breaking my bad habits. Husband, well, hasn’t.

15,"So just a little background. I(M19) tend to keep my circle of friends light. I was always very socially awkward and I had trouble with my confidence and making friends. This changed my junior year. After a small heartbreak and a lot of growing up, I just woke up one day as like...a social butterfly. Around that time, I made friends with a group of people and I consider them my first ever friend group. I went through ups and downs with these guys, but at the end of the day, I really value all of them. 

Last year, our group hit a little bump, as we completely dropped someone in the group for several reasons. After this, I started really analyzing the people I was friends with. I got very close with one of them, I consider him my first ever best friend. But he and I bonded over personal growth. We both grew up when the others didn’t, more responsibilities, more looking towards the future, and less drama. Meanwhile, another friend in our group is a mess. At almost 21, he was seeing a 16 year old. That didn’t matter as much to us, except that he constantly was getting into her drama: Arguing with 16 year olds, even telling one of them that he hopes she gets deported. 

I always knew he was moody, but lately he’s acted childish, racist, and sexist on many occasions. He calls it being conservative, but he’s proven on several occasions that it’s more than that. He’s used the n word with a hard r several times, as well as calling girls who aren’t into him or sometimes doesn’t even know whores. He is also very pessimistic. I’m a very positive and free spirited guy, and I’m at a point with college and being in charge at work, where I just don’t need negative people in my life. But at the same time, he hasn’t physically done anything to me that warrants ending our friendship. Since the rest of my group felt the same way, we kinda distanced ourselves. We hang out without him, and it’s a nicer, more positive group. But he is trying to force himself back in, and acts like nothing is wrong. At this point without making this any longer, the decision is basically mine to make for the rest of the group. If I let him back, he’s back. If I don’t, he’s not. But I just don’t know what to do. Do I accept an old friend who I still value’s many unchangeable flaws for the sake of being understanding, or do I cut that negativity out for good and lose a part of the past and essentially end up on bad terms with him?",12Jul2018,1
16,"So. I have two laptops. One is a Windows laptop I had for forever, and another is a MacBook Air that I got last semester for college because the Windows was so dang heavy. But today I found a MacBook Pro from 2012!!! and ended up buying it for $250. Now I have three laptops. 

I rationalized it by saying that I've been looking to get an upgrade for a while... But I never needed an upgrade. I bought a new SSD and another stick of RAM and my Windows machine runs perfectly fine. I figured I'd swap them into the new Mac, but that means now I have two freakin MacBooks and a crappy Windows PC again. Also it was a marginal upgrade at best because the processor is \*slightly better\*. 

I feel like I have a little Aziz Ansari in my head telling me to \*treat yo self\* every time I buy stupid things like this.

I will glance behind me and glimpse those long drives to your house, crossing highways and bridges and sailing through that wooded ridge that you lived on. I will see those flights to the West and our traipses through the mountains, our visits to stores and cities and our dreams of beginning a life there. I will relive those long nights of video games, of midnight journeys to the store for candy and drinks, giggling the whole way; of dancing, drugs, and loveplay; of waking up in the dim light as our cat sprawled between us while I pulled you closer and inhaled your sweet scent.

I just want to feel like I overcame a big hurtle, but I never really did that in my life. All I really want is something to overcome, so anyones suggestion is as good mine. Thanks.",12Jul2018,6

Tomorrow's another payday, more money going away... and not enough for July's rent. I'm already $800 in the hole, and come the first my rent goes up $50 to boot (up from $700). I'm going further and further into a hole that I can't get myself out of and I'm fucking scared and I don't know what to do. All I want to do is fucking die.",12Jul2018,2
48,"Wow, even the title for this one is hard for me to write, but maybe getting it off my chest will be cathartic.

I'll start with the **TL;DR: I've had lifelong medical issues that never allowed me to be pregnant, but I never wanted children; I just found out I'm miraculously 2 months in, and am questioning everything.**

I'm nearly 26, and have been told since 18 that I'm unable to have children. That point has been reiterated at nearly every GYN, PCP, and specialist appointment due to my medical condition. I've always thought of it as a blessing, because I love to travel, because I was never the kid who grew up wanting to be a mom, because I am a child of divorce and have little hope in everlasting love - but now, I'm thinking these were all coping mechanisms to allow me to not feel pain over such a ""loss,"" or rather, the inability to even try.

Obviously, as the years have gone by and the proverbial clock has ticked on, my hormones are pushing me towards wanting to have a baby, start a family, etc. etc. and the thought has saddened me. More recently, I've spent many a wistful night thinking of my future, and what I now (hormonally) want from it. I've never expressed this to anyone, because I don't want pity, I don't want to hear the ""you can still try!"" card, I don't want the adoption/foster spiel, I don't know if I even REALLY want kids. Okay, haven't expressed it to anyone BUT one.

Enter boyfriend of 6mo - person who makes me feel like maybe life isn't all bad. Really, a genuine, stand-up guy. Have known him closely for a near decade now, and so naturally, we're very close with each other. He's seen this breakdown more than a few times. He's always comforted me in the most wonderfully soft and kind fashion, and I couldn't be more grateful to have him in my life. That said, we've both discussed (previously and recently) our disinterest with kids, marriage, and the like. It's not in our wheelhouse, and that's fine.

Well.... fast forward to this past week. My medical issues make me irregular by means of menstrual stuff, so being 3.5 weeks late is no cause of concern. Still, I've been feeling.. weird. Lots of weird. More hormonal, significant cramps, and (red flag!) my tits were growing. Okay, can't be, but I got a test regardless. And whattya know... I'M PREGNANT.

I call him immediately, he calms me down, takes off work to sit by my side (I'm having an utter panic attack, for multiple reasons, but the main one being this is not a situation I thought I'd EVER have to navigate). We both feel blindsided, and I feel awful for having unknowingly ""misled"" him. He's initially panicky too, but manages to remain calm and collected for my sake. An abortion has been decided upon, as:

1. I am not mentally/financially capable to care for a child, 

2. We would inevitably grow to resent each other as a result, as we are both far too young and unfulfilled, and

3. Children were never in our respective life plans, nor the one we share with each other.

Still, I can't help this longing feeling - this concept of it being a fluke - that maybe, if I abort, this is my last chance to ever have a child. How would I live with myself if I knew I terminated the only kid I could ever have? It's utterly plaguing me. I don't feel like I have another option, but I'm concerned at the mental toll this is bound to take on me.

Please, if anyone has been here, I could use some words of advice. Thank you so much in advance. ",12Jul2018,494

51,"I owe you an apology. Even though I've never done anything to you personally, or anything that would possible make any impact on your life, I still feel like I owe you an apology. 

I unfairly judged you, as a person, and as a comedian. I thought you were just an unfunny, self centered, jackass. 

But after getting stoned, and having some food that I really wanted to eat asap, I stumbled on one of your shows that are on netflix. 

You truly have a special talent. I know you arent who you are on stage, but your stage personality is unbelievably relatable. You are, after having binged so much of your stuff over the last few days, quickly becoming one of, if not, my favorite comedians.


I hope you're happy.",12Jul2018,34
52,"I've never had one like it. It didnt traumatize me or anything because it was so unique feeling. 

I often have what I call anxiety dreams involving me being mistreated, mocked, and not being able to do anything about it. 

Well, in this dream I was having an intense argument with my father and he pulled a gun on me and I put my forehead up to the barrel and dared him to do it. And he did. The feeling was wild. Slight pain in my brain and then I felt my jaw break from the bullet pasing through... then complete numbness. Then I woke up.

You know that feeling when you fall and the shock kind of numbs you for a brief second. It was kind of like that when the bullet hit my brain. 

It was a very unique dream and am glad I experienced it. It did not upset me at all.

I had a kind of similar one where I was strapped to a gurney in a mental hospital and was being wheeled to a room where I was going to be lobotomized. It was NOT a good dream. There was this feeling of utter helplessness being wheeled down a long hallway. Was like going to my own execution. Was very disturbing to me. Then when the first hammer tap happened I felt it and woke up. ",12Jul2018,2
53,"And it couldn’t have happened at a worse time. My friends having been making me feel like shit. My social anxiety and OCD have been peaking. My family isn’t doing so well. And to top it all, my dreams are slipping away. 
Here’s why. Last year (in my senior year) I got into Dartmouth College (which if you didn’t know is an Ivy League school and is one of the best colleges in the US). And this of course was a great achievement for me because I’m from Iraq and it’s very rare for an Iraqi to gain admission to such a prestigious institution. So I accepted the offer, paid the deposit, and got my visa. Just two weeks before travelling, I decided that it was best for me not to go. This is because I’ve always wanted to study medicine and to gain admission into a medical school in the US after completing your undergrad is almost impossible for internationals.
And so I stay and decide to take a gap year.
This year, I applied to the UK and get an offer from a great medical school. I decided that this was a sign that I should take my chance this time and that I should go. So I accept the offer, pay the the tuition fees and apply for a visa. Now HERE is when I really fucked up. I did a huge mistake when filling in the visa application. I only realized I had made the mistake a few hourse ago and I think it might be too late. I’ve already emailed them but as I said I feel like the mistake is unforgivable. And to make it worse, I forgot to send all my documents to the consulate. So it’s a huge mistake and a bunch of other smaller yet still relevant mistakes. Now I feel like I’ll be refused a visa and will lose my last chance to study in a good professional university abroad. 
It wouldn’t be a huge deal if the colleges here were fine, but I know that the education here is subpar and not the type of education students should be receiving in the 21st century. The facilities, campuses, curriculum, etc. are really really bad and I’m afraid I’m stuck here forever.
I fucked up to the point of no return and I don’t even know what to do.",12Jul2018,2

56,"For the past few years since I was a child I've gone through some struggle that left me with some limiting beliefs. It wasn't until 4 months ago that I realized why I always felt so bad, even when nothing was seemingly wrong. I realized I had limiting beliefs such as that I'm not good enough, nobody likes me, or nobody wants to be friends with me, and if I express my true self that I would be judged and put down. I realized this and have been trying to change these beliefs through meditation, reading, self improvement, and taking action. Something that I'm really struggling with right now is that I feel like I can't be myself around my own sister. I'm not very close to my sister and she's a couple years older than me. I don't feel like I can say anything remotely personal to my sister. I feel like she will judge me for who I am. When she's around I immediately feel like I'm responsive to her every action and don't do what I really feel like. My mind is covered with fog and I act stupid. I feel the need to hide what I'm doing, I watch my words, I feel like she's going to judge me. It's actually easier for me to be myself with strangers than my own sister. I wanted some advice on what I should do. I find it very hard to tell her how I feel. Thanks everyone",12Jul2018,1

Flash forward 20 minutes ago: My friend and I are driving down the highway. Windows are down, and he says it's hot and wants to roll the windows up. Well, the pressure change somehow popped my ears and I could hear crystal clear for the first time in what felt like forever. 

The song my friend chose to play, at the exact moment I could hear, says ""FUCK YOU BITCH!""
