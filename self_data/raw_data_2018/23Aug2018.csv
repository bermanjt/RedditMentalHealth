Sometimes I really feel depressed, at the end of my rope, as if there were no issue. I studied and worked for so long (that’s relative of course) and I still don’t have a stable life.

3,"We’re in a long distance relationship at the moment, at least until we get back to uni, so all we’ve got is phone calls to keep things going. We’ll talk for hours usually in the evenings, then both get ready for bed, say goodnight, and hang up.

But today she hasn’t been feeling well, can’t talk much, so I’ve just been talking to her. Rambling on mainly as she sat silently (for the most part) listening along. She wanted to hear how my day was and since it hurts her throat to speak I thought i don’t mind talking at her for tonight. 

But after a while I’ve run out of stuff to say.

Right now, it’s 1:18am, I’ve been silent for the past 20 minutes or so. She’s been silent too. Pretty sure she’s fallen asleep at this point, probably fell asleep a while before that, not that I mind.

I don’t know why I haven’t hung up yet, will soon, but for now it’s just nice. She can’t fall asleep next to me in person, but she’s still kinda here as long as the phone calls going, ya know?

Anyway, that’s how my days ending. On the phone to her as she sleeps. Don’t know why I’m sharing this. If you want to take anything away from this it’s enjoy the little things, the small stuff that makes you smile.

4,"There are certain things or do or ways in which I act that I think “yeah, that’s me” about, but over the years, I’ve endeavoured to incorporate so many personality quirks borrowed from other people, both real and fictional, into my personality, that I’m a little unsure how much of “me” is actually me. I’ve consciously struggled for a while now with not liking myself much and wishing I could be someone else. That’s what spurred me on to imitating others. I feel my character is inconsistent. I’ll slip in and out of roles, and there are definitely moments when I’ll slip out of being in one and into something that’s more “me.” But it still seems even in those moments, that that “me” consists partly of me and partly of other people.

I’m feeling incredibly overwhelmed today. 

Short backstory of my very not dramatic life (sorry Reddit!)
I’m in my early 30’s and am suddenly a single mom to a teenage girl. I love my daughter to death, but that’s not really the point of this post. So what is the point you ask! Great question; I’m not even sure yet, so apologies in advance for any rambling. 

I’ve been married twice and said child is from my first marriage when I was 18. (God help me if I could go back.) Divorced that abusive asshole, married again many years later, most recent ex husband cheated, so now divorced again. Feeling a little bit shitty/guilty for this at my age, and now I’m in another serious relationship again and questioning my actual sanity. 

I’m living on my own now with my daughter for the first time in about 10 years. I suddenly realized I have no idea what I’m doing. I have been unemployed for months and finally found a new job that I think will support us. School has started, I’m working again, I have a new (amazing, normal) boyfriend, and life is generally looking up. The problem is that I’m FUCKING EXHAUSTED. 

I’m maintaining a household alone, doing all the mom shit, dinner, homework, boys, her social life, MY (hopefully) social life, and this shit is HARD. 
It’s gonna get better, right?? PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME IT GETS BETTER.

My bestfriend of 6 years staring changing around 3 years ago to become a cynical, jealous, pessimistic, narcissistic, selfish brat.

He’s become a toxic person who always downplays others achievements, tries to make everyone feel like crap, and is incredible selfish. My friend used to like him went up to him to tell him changed then he cussed her out and said no I didn’t retard. Slowly we’ve been distancing him and his always-annoying brother out of the group. Last month he texted me why is everyone pissed off at me. After many long talks between him and others, he began calling everyone disrespectful stupid brats who are overreacting and don’t appreciate him despite being “so sorry and promise to change”.

I told her everything and how it would just be a day of awkwardness and drama but she’s not budging saying he invited me to his stuff and her and his mom are friends. She said unless I invite him, the dinner would happen. Idk what to do. Inviting him would make him think everyone loves him and then as soon as he learns otherwise, the fights would be food.

14,"So I don’t know what the hell happened with me last night. I’ve been trying to have a better sleeping pattern, so I got to bed nice and early, but it hit about 3am and I was still wide awake. I have no idea why I couldn’t sleep at all, I’ve been sleeping quite well recently. I was getting angry about this, which is understandable, but I started to realise the anger was way over blown, I felt way angrier than I should have been, like I was completely furious and had no idea where the anger was coming from. Around that time my head felt buzzing with constant thoughts, not particularly bad but just random things, but after the anger I started having all these negative thoughts about nearly every aspect of my life. It’s like my brain was flashing through each aspect of my life, picking through each and violently rattling off in my head each horrible thing it could think of to do with my life. I genuinely felt like I was going fucking insane for maybe 5 or so minutes when it hit it’s peak. I had thoughts about my family not loving me, my friends not truly caring about me, me being some worthless piece of shit, how I’d never find love, nobody really cares, etc., and I have no idea in hell where it came from. About half an hour after things started to subside the thoughts just seemed irrational, and I couldn’t understand where the hell they had come from in the first place.

I’ve had pretty mild depression on and off for a few years, I go through periods of time where I feel fine, and then out of nowhere it will kick me in the ass (it’s never been diagnosed, but one particularly bad semester in college I almost got kicked out cause I could barely get out my bed for class). For the past year is so though I’ve been doing really well, being really productive and had a lot more of a positive outlook on life, and really just started to enjoy the little things and made more effort with my friends and family. I’ve never had problems with anxiety really, despite being a bit depressed. I tend to vary between worrying over problems a lot, and not giving a shit about them to the point that it’s not healthy. However, I’ve never struggled with like a real anxiety disorder. But what happened last night felt like some kind of anxiety attack. It was just a relentless barrage of thoughts, I felt a little bit sweaty and light headed, and when my mind started to calm down a little I felt so relieved that I kinda felt emotional about it all. I hesitate to jump to conclusions though because I know people who have panic attacks, and while what I had felt pretty bad mentally, from what I understand full blown attacks are far worse. I didn’t have the physical symptoms that come with a full on panic attack for instance, when people feel like they’re gonna faint or that they’re having a heart attack or something.

So is it possible though I had some kind of anxiety attack? And if so, why? My life is honestly going pretty well right now, and I’ve been feeling really good, so why the hell did one little sleepless night send me spiralling into some kind of anxiety filled nightmare? If this was some kind of panic attack, should I see someone about it and is there a chance of it happening again?",23Aug2018,0

My mom probably won’t be able to live alone anymore. She’s in the hospital right now getting treatment but basically she wasn’t taking her medicine and started drinking again. 

I am depressed and have anxiety. Soon I will be forced to move out of my current living arrangement as my brother and his family will be selling the home and moving to another province at the end of this year.  Up until today I had always considered moving in with my mom as I cannot support myself financially. I have a part time job but even that is taxing me big time.  Basically I couldn’t afford my own apartment or even get a room with strangers as the bills would be too much and they would need to be dog friendly.

I’m not sure if moving in with her is even feasible anymore. I’ll hopefully know more in the coming days but does anybody think it would be reasonable to think I could live with her and care for her? She can be psychologically abusive and she is an alcoholic. My main goals would be to make sure she eats, takes her medicine, and doesn’t drink (hopefully continue with AA meetings). I’m not sure I can handle it but at the same time I’m not sure what other choice I have? I could potentially be facing homelessness here in a few months otherwise.

https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/93rug7/my_apartment_got_robbed/

Recently the shmuck posted an item of mine on Craigslist. It's from a rare manufacturer and has a few custom bits making it very distinctive. I did the sane thing and called the cops, who proceeded to tell me they didn't have jurisdiction where it was being sold, and if I could prove the serial numbers matched (obviously the thief didn't post serial numbers) or get the guy's license plates they might be able to do more.

With that pile of nothing I called the police department that did have jurisdiction where the laptop was being sold, who told me they couldn't do anything because the crime was committed outside their jurisdiction.

Well fuck it, I set up a meeting. I work on submarines, submariners take stealing shit real fucking serious, I have a lot of angry armed friends who are earnestly eager to meet Mr. Sticky Fingers. The plan is for this to all go real peaceful mind you, and I very much hope it does.

I just don't understand how I got stone walled by the police, this is their actual job. My friends and I are definitely not who society wants handling shit like this. But so be it, the cops said to me outright that this was my only real option, so here we go.

The real irony is I despise guns, but now I'm relying on working in a field where they're everywhere so I'll feel safe. Wonder what that says about me.

My friend group consists of around 4-5 really good friends. We all get along really nicely, and many of whom are very smart. Obviously, when we’re together, we’ll have discussions about random topics and whatnot. But recently, I feel like I’m not picking up on what they’re saying half of the time. It feels like almost every time one of my friends tells a story, they will mention a thing, object, or idea that to everyone else makes sense, but for me does not come across as common knowledge. 

I understand the best solution is probably to ask questions and have them elaborate on what they meant, but I feel like I would do that all the time and frankly I just do not want to be a burden if that happens to be the case.

23,"This isn’t something I ever thought  I’d publicly be saying, especially on a forum such as (and as big as) this. (No offense everyone). It’s something I’ve held in for over two years now, at least privately, and it’s slowly eating me alive. I need to let it all out, let my story be heard. 

**WARNING: SUPER LONG POST WITH POSSIBLE TRIGGERS!! EXPLICIT DETAILS** 

**TLDR:** Raped during my senior year of HS in 2016, at a birthday party for my best friend. Drugged, never have figured out the perpetrator and was ridiculed/humiliated afterward. Dealing with demons to this day.  

First off, im a 21 year old male.  Two years out of HS and have been in an out of college ever since while working on the side in order to support myself and save money. From a fairly conservative suburb religiously (not knocking anyone’s personal or political beliefs) and was raised with a Catholic Church background (again not planning to knock anyone.) 

Physically I’m a rather short man, coming in at 5’6 150 or so pounds. Despite my short statue I’m pretty stocky and sport an overall athletic look. Always been told I look like a short version of Ryan Reynolds. 

I’m a rather laid back person, more of a people watcher I should say. Never have had that many friends, weather it be in HS or college, having always preferred to surround myself with those I connect with and truly have something meaningful with. I’ve been described as someone who’s shy but friendly, loyal and down to earth who’s always willing to lend a helping hand. All this leads to... (bear with me here, please) 

It happened in April of 2016, 2 months before I was due to graduate from high school. 18 years of age, Senior in high school and grinding my last days out. As the year winded down and with summer approaching, naturally more “graduation” parties started to spring out. Now I’ve never been a party (or crowd person). I don’t like the huge noise or drunk clumsiness or really drinking in general, but I decided to go to this one anyway.

It was located a neighborhood over, in walking distance and was thrown in honor of my best friends birthday. He and I had been friends ever since I’d moved to the neighborhood in 6th grade and it was just one of those things. 

So I get to this party, a mix of high school kids, young college kids and some adults thrown in. Pretty laid back and nothing truly scandalous going in. The house, and party, was located on the outskirts of the adjacent neighborhood, away from the main roads and usual side streets. As a result people flowed freely from the house to surrounding lawn and back yard field. 

I get there, meet up with my friend and we get down to hanging and just chilling. He knows I’m not much of a drinker so as the night progresses, I do my usual duty and make sure he doesn’t spill his guts everywhere. 

Eventually as the night wears on, I decide to have myself a few drinks before heading home. 

Things after that are a bit hazy I’ll be honest. I don’t know when I began to blackout or lose my focus but from I do remember I did not have that many drinks (other confirmed my thoughts after my questioning).

Eventually.. I wake up, upstairs in one of the bedrooms. I remember feeling real hazy, different than being drunk really. Nauseous, problems seeing , talking and moving. Eventually I remember focusing and realizing that I was tied down to the bed I was laid out upon. Tied on my back, arms to my side and tied off to the bedposts while my legs were tied to the edge of the bed. It’s an image that will forever be imprinted in my brain. 

After that It’s foggy again. The only thing I can truly remember is a me mumbling, fighting with all my might against something, someone. I can remember a woman with long red head, a rather petite frame and perky features being on top of me. I remember the feeling of her hand on my jugular, something sharp against my skin and the feeling of pain/bodily pleasure coming from my groin. 

I remember fighting and begging for her to stop, despite being in an out of consciousness. Before everything went dark, I remember being gagged. 

I woke up the next morning, alone and naked under the covers, that I remember. I was untied, covered with a blanket and oh so incredibly sore. I remember my wrists and ankles hurting, my chest bleeding from where something cut me and my groin feeling sticky, sore and hurting everywhere. 

I was raped that night, by a woman (or women). By who I do not know and doubt I ever will unless someone lets the truth slip. I made the fatal mistakes of showering (best friend house and all) and going to the restroom before leaving (everyone left was asleep and I climbed out the window)  and going to get a DNA test done. 

As expected, nothing came back and the police refused to go any further without any substantial evidence. 

To make things worse, one of my classmates, a woman, revealed to me that information of my body and sexual characteristics were making the round at school, almost entirely in ridicule. 

How or when it started I don’t know, all I know is that my private information leaked in order to humiliate and intimidate me, and boy did it ever. 

Now I’ll be upfront here. I never was and never have been a popular person. I’m not the type of man to be the center of attention. In high school (and now) I had the reputation of being a quiet, down to earth people watcher who others could turn to for help and friendship. I wasn’t ever popular, but I did have a good reputation. 

What happened after my ordeal and towards graduation, destroyed my reputation forever. I was humiliated physically, sexually and in every way you could think of. Attacked for my height, sexual characteristics and everything you could think of. What was said (and sent) was meant to intimidate me, harass me and humiliate me into silence. 

When I went to a counselor over what was happening I was chided for out of marriage sex and possibly bringing a bad reputation to the school (yea one of those places). 

When I went to a therapist about it, one slyly guilted me for what happened while another acted like I could have done something different. And if by chance I found that magical therapist, it always was a “Well we can get you in in 3 weeks” when I was more at the “I need someone now” phase. 

Towards the end of my senior year I was practically (outside my best friend who doesn’t know to this day) alone. No friends, no support from the systems in place and ridiculed by the student body in such a way it wasn’t obvious to the staff or someone else who may have been suspicious.

And here I am, 21 years of age. Two years out of high school and still mostly holding this secret in. 

I tried to rebound honestly. Well more like connect with someone and then have sex, because that’s who I am (not a tinder guy). All that happened was me being rejected once (rumors playing a factor), my PTSD kicking in the second time and me having a breakdown the third time. While I have had intimacy since then, it was short lived as the woman I was intimate with moved away and left me feeling like it wasn’t something mutual, 

You’d never suspect it if you saw me on the street, though I suspect that’s the case with most people. Despite being a short young male, I’ve always been told I look confident, that my eyes are strong and warm and that I have a strong personality and physicality about me. 

Inside however I am struggling. Broken more like it. Hurting. I’m not depressed or suicidal because of it. I don’t sit and wallow all day. I’m not miraculously hooked on drugs or alcohol or any other harmful addiction, besides maybe Netflix. I am however hurting, and still continue to hurt to this day. 

Silently struggling you could say. I have a hard eyed, hard mentality about me now when it comes to what happened.. Steel hearted, despite being naturally kind and warm hearted. 

The PTSD remains. The loneliness and pain remains. The memories remain. The want to just cry and be held and to finally let my guard down for once, it  remains. 

I will go to bed tonight (Close to 1am  currently), most likely after a PTSD memory flashes through me, haunted by what happened and the events that followed. 

I live my life, day by day, one step at a time. I’m currently on a path towards a career that’ll allow me to escape the reality I currently live in. No matter what happens though, I’m taking it one day at a time. 

I apologize for the ramble. If you read this far, thank you, I truly mean it. I really... really just needed to get this off my chest. And could really use a hug.

Today I discovered that about $700 worth of purchases have been made on my credit card this past week. I rarely use the card, and it is no longer in my wallet.  
My wallet is pretty much always in my pocket, if it's not on my counter at home. The only people who would have had access to it would be my ex-wife and my girlfriend.

Most of the purchases have been made in my ex-wife's neighborhood - about 10 miles from where I live. My girlfriend doesn't live, work, or socialize anywhere near there. They also took place during her work hours.  
\*However\* one small purchase was made on Sunday morning at my local grocery store -- that was the same time my gf ran out and got us bacon for breakfast. My gf doesn't make as much as I do, but she has a good job, owns her own house, and has always taken care of herself. My ex on the other hand is unemployed, and has depended on me or her boyfriend to support her to a large extent over the last 4 years. But I've never known her to steal. My gf of two years isnt someone I'd believe that of, either.  
Most evidence points to my ex, though it would be odd for her to be shopping at that particular store. And what are the odds that she'd be shopping at the same time as my gf?  
I'm not sure about how to approach this. Things are great with my gf, and I have a good relationship with my ex (with whom I amicably separated 3 years ago), too. We had several special needs cats together, and she cares for the ones I got when I'm out of town. One is dying, so things are stressful, and she comes over more than she normally would. Making a false accusation to either would damage the relationship, but not doing anything, and letting the cc company do an investigation feels weird, too.  
What do you think?

There comes a point when you realize things were really bad, but that point comes at different times for different people. For me it happened this year at age 34.

 I've decided not to talk to my mom anymore. So far I guess that's just fine because she hasn't called or anything since mothers day.

 I feel a sense of relief and some new pain, but the relief is helping me deal with the new pain. The relief comes from knowing that I'm no longer going to have her as part of my life. The new pain comes from realizing she never loved me at all. I was just 'there'. I was just like a dog that no one walked or pet. I had food, so that's something.

 I know that since this isn't being posted to a support group, I'll have some people thinking that 'this is your mom you should love her!' or 'you only get one mom!'... Well all I can say is that you know there are some terrible selfish people in the world and some of them have kids they didn't want, so they are selfish and terrible to them too.

 I've been discharged from therapy because my therapist says I'm doing very well with all of this, and she says I don't need her anymore. Yesterday when it occurred to me for the first time that it was basically my moms fault I was raped, I sure felt like I needed my therapist at that moment. I was 16. My mom drove me to go to another town to be with my 27 year old boyfriend. She dropped me off and left, knowing I'd be drinking. I had too much to drink safe alone with him (or so I thought) I passed out, someone else came over that I didn't know and he had sex with my passed-out body. My mothers reaction? Annoyance. That's all.

But I don't need her. I'm a grown woman now. I know that rape was not my fault. How could it be? I thought I was drinking alone with someone I trusted. So many people have told me that it's not rape though. Fuck those people. I never gave consent and I would not have. I had a boyfriend and when I saw what that guy looked like after I woke up later, he was ugly and old. Whatever. I'm over it.

I'll be ok.",23Aug2018,2
30,"Things are just starting to go downhill for me guys. Recently, I had been feeling better about myself and getting work done early and being happy and social, I was starting to feel like a normal human again. I don’t anymore. There’s a few things that happened to make me feel this way. School started up again and it is already a flow of homework, and I’m hardly having the motivation do it. The only person who I have ever felt attracted to sat at my table last year, but it always seemed like they didn’t like me, which was proven when I heard them say the words “I hate him” when asked about me, and they transferred into one of my classes and my heart breaks every time I see them. I feel like a burden to all of my friends and most of them don’t even like or care about me.  I pushed away one of my oldest friends by making a stupid mistake, by showing him some graphic images to see if I could freak him out, he has refused contact with me and has made passive aggressive comments about me. I just feel like a heap of shit. I just want to have friends. I just want people to like me. I don’t want to push everyone I know away for cheap laughs, even though I enjoy the graphic humor that most of my friends don’t seem to understand. School is just becoming too time consuming and frustrating. I have had a 4.0 all through every year of school before this one and it has taken a toll on me. I almost committed suicide 3 times over the summer. The only reason I didn’t was because I knew I had friends and people who cared about me and who I could make laugh and I could laugh at them. The thoughts are coming back and I don’t know what motivation I could dredge up at this point to stop myself. All my classes are dreary and meaningless. The one class that isn’t is ruined by my heartbreak. I feel sick about forcing myself to got to school any more. What do I do, how do I see the bright side?

I called Hmm earlier and asked if he meant all those things he said to me (that he loved me and all that) and he said yes, but it’s complicated because he has a girlfriend.

Recently, though, I began a program to become a yogi (I've been spiritual for a while, and I'm deeply passionate about fitness), and I learned I'll be in the program with the girlfriend of my brothers old supplier. Now, this wouldnt be a problem, but she was very very closely associated with him and, at the time everything was going to complete shit, I blamed both her and her boyfriend as well for contributing to my brothers downfall. 

Basically, this raging, undying fire has returned and I'm just generally concerned about my future in this program.

Plus tons of water throughout the day. I never felt crappy, hangry, hungry, or any negative side effects from eating less. 

For the past couple months I’ve been consistently working out 45-60 minutes each morning, eating healthy, and feeling great physically and mentally. 

On the trip I did not work out. And ate at the same times each day. I went from 5’4 and 140 to 5’4 and 134 in those 6 days. I noticed my stomach really flattened and believe my face slimmed as well. People were remarking on how pretty I was. 

I got back home 2 days ago and was super excited to continue eating less and pick up again with working out. 

Instead, I went back to my old eating habits and then.....the most disappointing thing happened......I binged and purged. I’ve struggled with bulimia off and on for the past 13 years. The past few months I haven’t even thought about it and then this happened. :(

54,"So just to preface this post. I've admired reddit for a long time from afar, but never created an account or posted on anything. I'm not a fan of social media and I often feel pretty anti-social even when I want to speak to people. And Facebook just isn't a place for me, I feel like everything is so fake there, so I'm hoping that the anonymity (or something like that) of reddit will console me to some degree. Anyways, that being said I've had an interesting thought and I'd like to hear some opinions on it.

I like silver better than gold. I think it looks more classy and blends with other colors and accessories better. For some reason, I feel like I've always felt this way and it seems like most people I've met prefer silver too (or white gold, platinum or whatever, you get the idea). But I clearly remember having a gold necklace and ring that I loved when I was small, so I'm not confident that I've really always liked silver better. And that leads to the question.... Was I conditioned to be this way? Were we all? From a very young age we're taught the value scale. We know that monetary wise, gold is supreme. In sports it's gold, silver then bronze. So maybe when we're little we do like gold best because we know that it's the best. But perhaps with the struggles of life and particularly American society, we truck ourselves into liking silver better. The prospect of being the best at something is a trait that I feel like most of have as children. But we get older, we miss out on dreams, we adjust our goals to something more attainable, but hopefully still something profitable. So maybe life beats us down and forces us to accept the fact that we aren't the best, and in all likely hood, will never be. So maybe we switch our love to silver, to second place, since it feels far more achievable than first. And perhaps if this is the case, we trick ourselves into thinking that we've always liked silver so we don't have to accept the disappointment of never being gold.",23Aug2018,0

so i was going to meet a friend in a place at night to hang out, i go in a Van and the Van drops me in a place where i have to walk in order to reach my destination. On the way there was a guy on his phone i ask him for the directions just to make sure and he says yes come walk with me, as we walk he saw the phone in my hand and said can i check your phone i said no why.. he said i want to check something my phone isn't working. We walk a bit and started making shady small talk and i got scared af and my brain froze because i knew i was getting mugged any second, my phone was in my hand so he immediately grabs my hand and says ""i have a knife, give me your phone or your life"" then i let loose of my phone and he told me to head in the opposite direction so i ran away freaking out.
I didn't comprehend what happened at the moment. I saw a some law enforcement on my way but instead of telling them i just got mugged i ask them for directions to my friends location idk why i didn't tell them but my brain was exploding and my heart was racing, i ran to the destination my friend is at and told him the story then i drank some water and we went to the police station. 
I still see the scenario infront of my eyes and when I sleep every second it's like it's on reply, i need help please I'm so confused and scared I can't forget what happened or get over it and it keeps haunting me",23Aug2018,13
56,"This'll be a long post, I'll try tl:dri ing it.

So a few years ago I met this guy and we became alright friends. at the time I was into gaming, and that's about it. We chatted about the fact he was building a pc. He got a guitar soon after, and that I guess replaced the pc, which gave us less reason to talk. Last year I guess I had an epiphany. I've been doing nothing with my life, and I wanted to start something. So I picked up the guitar, messed around with photography and such. Anyway we started talking to me again and we went out and smoked some hash (at this point I'm just gonna point out that this is a relationship thread, not anti drug. I don't want to hear it.) we had a great time, and this kind of rekindled our friendship. We started chatting some more, and every now and again we'd smoke with another friend of mine. Just to clarify, I would now classify him as one of my best friends. Out of everyone I know he interests me most. It feels like the conversations we have actually matter. So I have started living. I wanted to branch out, meet new people. and last week we're in a park looking for weed when we bump into a group of his friends. we buy off of them and sit down to smoke with them. I'll be honest, I said next to nothing (I haven't been diagnosed with social anxiety or anything, but it would make sense). Even so I had a good time with them, and these are the kind of people I'd like to reach out to. Talking about on our groupchat (me friend 1 and 2) I mention the fun I had, and He states that he very much wants to keep the groups he smokes with seperate. This makes a lot of sense to me, my friend has no street knowledge, but I'm (I think) one of the main people this guy confides in. I am completely socially inept so I think he'd see me as an embarassment, or non compatible. Thing is I think we would be compatible, I was just bat scared of talking today. So I want to make an effort to spread my wings and meet new people. Question is: What about this group? I have their contacts, but I'm not used to engaging people in conversation. and even if I do score, I'm doing a wrong to my friend. I feel trapped I guess. I really don't want to just ignore my friend, he means the world to me, but I've never met anyone (apart from my current friends) I relate to as much. Any advice is appreciated, and I hope if nothing else you guys can get a chuckle out of how socially retarded I am.

Tl;Dr I live a boring life and want to try talk to a new friend group I can relate to, but my friend (who is in said group) doesn't want our group to mix with that group. I'm worried I'll annoy/Embarass him and I think he's worried about the same thing",23Aug2018,8
57,"I know I need to see someone. I think I may depressed. I also think there is something else wrong with me. Sometimes I feel like I am walking around with an undiagnosed mental disorder or something. I’m not happy. I get so mad or irritated so easily. So much energy to smile. Talking to people feels like a chore, but at the same time I long for that connection. Even going to the bathroom takes so much of my energy. I simply have no motivation to do daily tasks, but I do have dreams I want to accomplish. I feel guilty and almost like a phony that I am this way because of the career I’m in (social work). 


I want to see a counselor who can diagnose me and prescribe me the medication I need to make me feel better. I never realized how expensive they were until I turned 26 and had to get my own heath insurance. Honestly, I feel like I’m paying for nothing. I had to pay over $120 dollars just to go to the doctor for them to tell me that my Pap smear care back abnormal and that I need to have a colposcopy done soon. Which will be an extra $200 out of pocket. And it’s that much because I need to meet my deductible first, but I don’t even go to the doctor enough in the first place that would help me reach the deductible anyway. And the deductible starts over every year, so pretty much every doctor visit I go to from now on for the rest of my life (excluding one women’s annual, two dentist visits, and an eye exam) I will be paying $200 out of pocket. 

I say all this because I don’t have $200 to see a counselor 2-4 times a month. I know I need to and I really want to, but how am I supposed to afford that? I’m in grad school and am getting a refund back from my loan, and have thought about using that to help pay for it, but I also would like to use that to pay back my student loans and not have more debt and I feel like that should be a priority too. 

I don’t know what else to do. I want to be better. I want to be happy that I get to wake up in the morning and be excited for the day to come. I want to feel emotions that aren’t just sadness, bitterness, anger, annoyance, doubt, lonely. I want to stop taking my negative emotions out on my boyfriend. Life is hard, I know.

58,"Ok so for my first Reddit post I’m talking about a Erotic Massage :) ok first let me give out several background information  facts: I have a girlfriend that I love to death and would do anything for. Also I’ve had a fantasy for a while to get one of those erotic massages that you’ve seen in porn. Last fact is I’m a socially awkward introvert. Ok now enough of all that useless rambling the story goes like this. I looked at one of those sites where you can book a escort to give a massage. Long story short I texted the girl that I liked we agreed on a price of $140+ tip last night. So this morning I woke up feeling stoaked and nervous as hell to get this massage. From where I live it was a 40 minute drive to get to her location which was a upscale apartment. I text her I’m there and she says make sure you have donation in hand. She comes down in a skimpy outfit with booty shorts. (Looked like she had cement blocks in her shorts lol besides the point) I walk out of my car to get into building. She said hey and then asked me to give her a hug which was kind of weird to me because there was people in lobby looking at us. So we went on the elevator to the third floor. We walked down the hallway and she asked me to wait in sitting area. Oh I forgot to include an important fact I already gave her the money.  I thought it would’ve been like a 5 min wait but it was longer than that. After 5 minutes she texts me asking if I could take a shower in her place. I was like okkkkkk. But I agreed. Giving a person like me that thinks about a hour ahead and worries a lot was a bad idea. I thought about all that could go wrong like what if I’m going to get robbed, what if my girlfriend finds out somehow, or I know it’s not likely but I get a std Sti or something else. So after about thirty minutes of not hearing anything back from her I got cold feet and decided to leave. I texted her that she could keep the money and I had to leave. She texted back she was taking awhile because she was getting oil and robe ready. Of course I feel like shit for losing out on 160 plus gas but  I feel satisfied that this will teach me a lesson to never do something like this again.

62,"Please excuse my dumb video game analogy but I can't help but feel like that's the closest interpretation to how I feel. I guess starting with having played Sims 3 using emotions as stats has been appealing to me, and I've been really feeling that lately.

I wanted to post it here because my anxiety doesn't really apply just to social anxiety and I want to talk about the things wearing me down, responsibilities and such beyond just social. My main issues being living alone, while my wife lives in another state that I'm sorting out my stuff to move to while trying to work on remodeling a half bathroom in a house I bought at the end of the year that I've been putting off because my dad told me he'd help with it to then cancel it and pretty much just drop me. Man, and it's his birthday this week and it'd cost me ~$200 in gas and food to go see him not to mention a present and a card, and I don't feel bad about not wanting to go. This bathroom is my justification for not going.

I know what I need to do with the bathroom, but it's all stuff I've never done alone before. I have friends but for different reasons I don't want to ask for their help, mainly because I rarely talk to them because they all got moved to another office. (Trying to keep my work life obscured just because I don't want to be too identifiable.) I know what to do but some things would require either another tool or more work to clean up the job, like where I decided to saw off a piece of the doorway trim to glue it back when I'm done laying the laminate. Every time I make progress after three or four hours of work something new stops me. I don't want to spend more money on it though it's almost done. I'm moving to an apartment too so I don't want to buy too many tools. I just want to sleep. I've already blown my savings on a lot of this, as well as hobbies that at the time I thought I could reasonably afford. It's been six months since I started this project and have a month left before moving, twelve hours away. I know it's my fault, I just want to gripe and grieve over it. I at least take solace in the fact that I'm only 22 and outpaced both my parents to owning a house.

Until now it's annoying because I started saying ""Hi"" to the dude to get an idea of him he responded and that was that and the next day I made eye contact with him to say ""Whats up?"" and he completely gave me a dirty look and turned his eye around like he's trying to avoid me. 

Now I feel like he is thinking the same way I am thinking of him which is about the whole ""staring"" thing that is making me get extremely annoyed now. 

I never thought going to the gym I can make a friend so I never had any intentions on passing by people and saying ""Hi"" because everyone imo is in their own zone especially with earphones/headphones that make it seem like people want to be avoided.",23Aug2018,4

65,"A couple of months ago I changed my legal name. It went from a really common Latin name to a really white name. 

I'm 43% white 40% native American (Mexico) and the other 20% is split among Asian, African and other smaller percentages of other populations. I've been told I could pass off as white and Asian. Mexican too but less.  

I had always been excluded from Mexican culture because according to them I looked too white. Whenever I used my credit cards I'd always be asked for an ID. 

Due to all the reasons listed above I decided to change my name and it's been kinda overwhelming. I'm never asked to show an ID when I use my cards now. The most shocking effect to me is that people treat me so differently in a good way. They're just so nice.. idk it really really sucks how being white changes how others act and interact with them ",23Aug2018,2
66,"If I post about how much I love a new snack, I'll get trolled or called names. But if I post about how pathetic I am, and how I want to kill myself, I get so many kind responses. Even when I ask to be insulted, no one will oblige. Wtf is wrong with people? Is this some form of torture?",23Aug2018,1
68,"I don't know where to post this, I don't know who's going to read this, and I don't know if I'm right or wrong. I just know I feel what I feel, and I had to get it off my chest one way or another. This is going to sound like a one long sob story from start to finish so don't expect much else.

The source of all my unhappiness, and why I end up picking horribly self destructive relationships, I believe, is my shitty childhood. I was essentially born out of an affair, and sent away to a boarding school. My mother was destructively, emotionally, and physically abusive. And I genuinely thought, and believed that I had a bad relationship with her because I was a bad daughter until sometime in my early twenties when I stayed with her long enough to have a mental breakdown where I realised it was not my fault. It.. felt, like some dam in me broke down. It was easier when I blamed myself. But when I realised it was her, and not me.. it completely, and irrevocably fucked me up. My mother and I were dragged to a therapist by a relative who saw how toxic whatever we had was.. the therapist took my side, and diagnosed me with PTSD. My mother flew into a rage when she realised everyone including the rest of my family took my side. She hit me, said the worst possible things in the world to me.. I can't even repeat them here without choking up.
My father meanwhile is emotionally unavailable. When he wants to, he showers money and attention on me, but otherwise, for years at a time, he's.. just not there. He's a lot more easy to reason with than my mother though, so I always looked up to him. Daddy's little girl, I always thought.. even if we only spoke once in two years.

Now, here's where I talk about my sexual trauma. Throughout university, I was a prude then; had never kissed, refused to hug men; I was madly in love with a guy.. best friend for lack of a better word? we were incredibly in sync intellectually, and he always, always had the right words to say no matter what, when, who. It was unrequited.. but also because he made me feel... exactly what I thought I was. Small, undeserving of attention, unworthy, unattractive. He was.. I put him on a pedestal. He was a shitty person.. in hindsight. He ended up having a fling with my best friend, after I spent three years talking about him incessantly, and wringing my hands about him to her. They met through me. 

When I found out about it.. until then I had barely kissed let alone had a relationship. Now, I'm by no means unattractive. I'm not. I just make it way harder for men to talk to me, than I should. That's a nice way of saying I'm a bitch, basically. But after finding out about their fling.. a prude who was reluctant to even hug her male friends.... well, I went on a rampage. I got very drunk, very often, said yes to most every man who wanted me.. although I tried to not lose my virginity this way, I had a few close calls. In hindsight, pretty sure they qualify as assault. I was way too drunk to consent, and in one instance, they'd held me down and were almost going at it but I sobered enough to get out of it, even if it involved near physical violence. In that phase.. maybe there two of the guys I kissed were because I wanted to, not because I was drunk and trying to rid myself of my demons.

Then, a crush I had waaay back in high school texted me because he saw me on tinder. Invited me over. I told him I was a virgin, told him I didn't want to have sex - multiple times. But then I got drunk, as usual, before any sexcapade I had (In my head, I had to do it. In return for self worth? As punishment? Because I believed that's what I was worth? I had to do it, but to make it easier for me, and also so I didn't have to remember it, I always had to get wasted).. and he stuck it in me. I woke up from the pain. I left then.. I didn't.. I never realised. I didn't even think much of it, just felt oddly disconnected, and thought ""well, I had to get it over with one way or another"".

Then.. I met a guy who reminded me of that love from college. And I liked him, and it felt like the same thing as before, but with a new face. Until he met me, and I realised he also just wanted to fuck. I remember coming back home from that date, and weeping in the shower after. I wept, and wept. I felt.. like that's all I was worth. My body.

After that, I called that high school crush again, thought, might as well do it for real. But it was so painful, and I didn't want it, and I just wanted it to stop. So we didn't, we couldn't.. even if he was forceful, and rude. He left after.. not satisfied, clearly. We'd made plans to meet the next weekend, but I found myself postponing, and making up excuses not to meet him. My conscious brain couldn't understand why. Get sex over with, here's a candidate who can help with that, why aren't I meeting him? But I just couldn't bring myself to see him again, I couldn't.

Then I met boy, after boy, after boy. All of them assholes, all of them complete dickheads. I once dated a guy for a while who kept going even while I was sobbing audibly. Sex to me was never pleasure. It was a currency, it was what you gave in exchange for some self worth.. some value of you.

And then, well. For a change something good happened to me. I met someone amazing. He cared. He loved me. And if I had to be drunk to have sex, he refused to touch me. He said he would wait until I was ready, no matter what. And if I so much as grimaced during sex, he would stop, he would hold me. I cried so much, and so often the first few times we tried, because he refused to do it drunk with me.. but he was patient, and he would just hold me until my sobs mellowed to sniffling, and I fell asleep in his arms. But eventually we did end up having sex. I remember telling him, distinctly, ""oh my god, is this why people have sex? This is amazing"".
It's been a year since we broke up after an amazing year and a half together for other reasons, but  I tell him, and I continue to maintain that he is one of the best things to have happened to me.

But I'm a continent away from him now.. and I'm in a dark place, especially with regard to my family, and the men I've been seeing again. I got wasted a few times, (My friends, god bless them, they're the best thing I have, tell me I am self destructive and put myself in those situations) and got assaulted, and nearly raped a few months ago. And I don't know.. I want help. I want to be okay.

I almost.. feel guilty.. about using the word rape because I feel like I'm diluting it. If what happened to me was actually that, then why would I invite him over again? Besides, he has no idea, he occasionally texts me like normal, and I don't reply.. but he has NO IDEA, he probably thought it was a normal thing to do. What do I do? What can I do? What do I feel?",23Aug2018,0

72,"My best friend, let’s call him R, stopped all contact with me very suddenly about a year and a half ago. There was no warning, and we haven’t really talked since. R and I shared a class last year, but all of my attempts to talk to him resulted in R just getting annoyed and ending the conversation. 
We were friends for about 6 or 7 years. I trusted him deeply, and I shared basically everything with him, and he (at least I think) shared everything with me.  I loved R like a brother, and I’m pretty sure that I had a crush on him for a while, but not so much anymore. Anyways, we were really close friends and I thought that we’d be friends for a long time. 
But he suddenly stopped returning my calls, and left most of my texts on read. So I thought, “R must be busy, and I don’t want to bother him, so I’ll stop texting and calling so much.” But then, at most a day or two later, I noticed that he ignored me at lunch as well. Whenever I tried to speak to him he would only give short replies that indicated that he wanted our conversation to end. 
I was worried that something was wrong, so I asked another close friend of his (Let’s call him L) if something was going on. L then told me something along the lines of, “Oh...you don’t know,” which left me confused. So he continued, “R told me that he thinks that you’re annoying. R said something like ‘She’s just too much! I wish that she’d get the hint and leave me alone!’” When I first heard this, I didn’t believe L. If R had a problem with me, he would tell me, right?
Long story short I figured it out and realized that what L told me was true. I was crushed. I cried myself to sleep for weeks, maybe months, about it. 
Fast forward to now, and ever since I’ve lost almost all of my friends. L and I ended up becoming close, and he’s a really great friend. But to be honest, I don’t feel comfortable talking to him about my issues or problems. He comes to me with his, and I’m happy to help, but I just don’t think that I’m able to trust him with personal things. 
I’ve lost everyone and I have nobody to talk to. 
Another thing is that I don’t really feel anything towards the friends that I do have. Before R left, I felt connections and happiness and platonic love towards all of my friends, even my acquaintances. But now, I feel nothing. 
Worst of all, whenever I think about R, the feelings for him are still there. The only feelings that I still have for anyone are towards someone who hates me. 
I feel like I’ve been abandoned, and I can’t do anything about it. 
I still cry about R on occasion. 
What should I do? 
Should I try to confront R?
Thanks for reading this whole mess. ",23Aug2018,4
73,"I really hate life and the world and I don't see the point anymore, other than being too afraid to die. I mean everything is so fucking unfair, why bother living? My life has gone nowhere. I'm a hopeless virgin with a small dick. I'm going to spend much of my life working. I have no social skills. I'm so lonely. Girls want nothing to do with me. Everything would change if I had certain genetics and was born wealthy. All I see in the world is disparity. I'm never going to be happy. I'm always going to chasing something I can never have. How much alcohol does it take to kill the average person? No one understands me. People might appear sympathetic but most people will day it doesn't matter, even if they haven't experienced what I experience. People always say, ""you have to love yourself first before you have get a girlfriend."" I'll never be happy then because that's what I want. No one is owed anything in life but guess fucking what, when you are so far behind most people it can hurt a lot. I just want to lash out at the world. How can I do the most damage? I could try to find a way to emit a shit tonne of greenhouse gas, but idk if one person could make a sizeable impact on climate change no matter how hard they try. I could get into politics. Then I could really fuck shit up. I'm so bitter. I'm bitter because of what I don't have and I'm bitter because society does not give a fuck.

74,"I’ve been miserable and so unhappy for a long, long time. So long that I can’t remember what it feels like to be truly happy. Until today.

75,"I simply can't socialize, listen to directions, and my social skills just feel like they are tanking. Whenever I try to talk to people, I can't ever hold a subject well or even start the convo, and I tend to loathe small talk, and when that happens for a certain amount of time, I just want to leave. Speaking of just wanting to leave, I never ever like to stay at a giant social, much less even go. The only reason I go to them is that I'm dragged along and I don't want to seem rude or I'm forced to. Whenever someone speaks to me it's normally just a quick hi, or if they do have an indepth convo, some other kid just swoops in and takes my original person I'm talking to away, and they're fine with it or sometimes happy, like they didn't want to talk to me in the first place. And whenever at the lunch table, if I do try to interject in a convo, nobody listens, so I figure why the hell should I try, which goes to just not liking to talk to some people. I don't have any super close friends, and I don't know how to make or keep them. Most of my missing social time I spend drawing or daydreaming.

Whenever I'm told anything unless I'm paying a lot of attention or if its something I like, I don't listen, and whenever I can't just listen to anything (and people happen to shove this in my face a lot) I simply feel retarded.

This has gone down to my self-esteem, to the point where I cannot admit that I'm ""good"" at something. I just need genuine help.",23Aug2018,2

77,"I'm a 38 year old guy and I'm finding it increasingly difficult to live in the present. I have a great wife, no kids, and am unemployed but actively seeking work. Even before losing my job due to layoffs, my tendency to obsess over nostalgia was strong.  But with so much time on my hands, it's hitting me full force. All I do is think my life from childhood to through college. I pour over childhood photos, think constantly about visiting my grandparents and cousins at Christmas and in the summer as a kid. I think a lot about a cousin who was my age, who (in many ways) was my best friend (at least during the summers and holidays when we visited!), but who committed suicide back in 2007. I think about things that are fascinating to me, but are boring to everyone else (my grandparents had a house built in 1986! Here's a photo of it! LOOK AT THE PHOTO OF THIS STANDARD BRICK HOUSE! Here's a thing about my granddad's boat that will mean NOTHING to you! Here's this thing my cousin and I used to talk about! Here's a photo of their GODDAMN KITCHEN! etc. and so forth.)   


I don't know how to stop this. The most mind numbingly mundane things from those time periods just pour through my brain all the time. The present means almost nothing to me. Nothing in the present has substance. A trip to a tropical beach on the other side of the planet now means less to me than a photograph of my deceased grandmother's newly built kitchen from 1986. I don't know where this is going to end up. My wife has all but forbidden me to continue talking about this stuff, and I don't blame her. 

  
How can I live in the present? How can I see value in what I experience now, rather than see it as some cheapened imitation of my past? The older I get, the more terrified I get, the more unhappy I get, and more nostalgic I get.   


TL; DR Life seemed better in my youth, now everything seems hollow and pointless. Garden variety middle-aged whininess. ",23Aug2018,1
