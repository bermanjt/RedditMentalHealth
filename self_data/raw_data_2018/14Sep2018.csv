0,This isn’t how I eat every day but this is what my PMDD does to me. I eat ridiculously bad and I’m a moody roller coaster on top of being a bleeding lethargic mess every month. I want to have my tubes tied and my periods to go away already. I’ve had enough of dealing with this shit. I’m never having children nor do I want to. These monthly periods are a burden to me. ,14Sep2018,4
1,"I'm a painter with a loss of time and money to paint. I work in a bar to pay bills, with hours which lack routine. I dream about how I'll paint skin, light.. I dream about the layers. But I'm waking up without enough money to buy canvases and so I sit and plan my paintings, research technique and look at artists' work in the flesh (there's not a lot better than seeing it up front). I'm at a point where I at least want to be surrounded by art, even if I can't make it myself everyday. 

I haven't completed my studies. I thought I would gain more (mostly funds) from being self-taught. A classic story for you. 

I'm 23 and I need to paint. I have work to finish, so that's not part of the question. I've looked at assistant jobs etc, however a completed study is still preferred and the competition is fierce. I've reached out to printers, independent studios and galleries. However staff numbers required in these departments are generally short, with there being minimal jobs on offer. 

I have a lot of energy and passion here but it's bubbling up on my own and tonight I will only serve more whisky and cokes.

2,"so basically the title says it all but the last couple weeks I feel like i have been constantly fantasizing about having a biological little boy of my own to raise and take care of and just how I can make it happen. That’s really all i feel like I truly want out of this life i’ve been given. 

Being gay makes it harder i guess to have a biological child because i’m 22 do not have nearly enough money that I would need for the whole in vitro process so that’s not really an option. At this point honestly if like I became close with some girl and some how formed a relationship where she agreed to carry a baby if i got her pregnant for me that would be amazing. of course i would let them see and interact with their mom but idk i’ve just been focusing on it a lot lately and really only wanna achieve that. I do not have a boy friend right now and would totally be down with raising a kid with one though. 

So yea i just feel like i needed to get that off my chest and i don’t even know if this is the right forum to post this but i thought this might work here hopefully. I guess i’m just trying to find out if you or someone you know has gone through something like this and if you have any tips or advice that would be awesome. ",14Sep2018,1

4,"I'm sorry if you find any typos / grammatical errors, English isn't my native language. Feel free to correct me.

Ever since I was a child I've always been interested things like science and arts. I spent almost all of my childhood learning all I could about literally anything that caught my attention, thanks to this I know a lot about rather useless stuff.
I'm a high school student with terrible grades because I lack study habits, I also have zero social skills and spend all my time on reddit. Despite all that, most of the people around me seem to think I'm smart just because I ""know a lot about all kind of things"". 
Almost every single time a teacher asks about anything complicated all of my classmates look at me expecting to hear me say the answer, which I obviously don't always know. This is usually pretty humiliating since all of them think of me as some kind of living encyclopedia and not knowing about something is an unforgivable crime. 
This is where we get to the title. How do I stop them from thinking I'm smart or something? I'm not and this kind of situations are awkward.",14Sep2018,3

A child sees a tortoise taking a nap, and tries to get its attention. The tortoise gets startled and retreats into its shell. The child taps on the tortoise to try to get it to come out. The tortoise pulls itself as far into its shell as possible, in self-defense. The child keeps tapping on the shell, more aggressively now. The tortoise may or may not have been preparing to dial 911 from ~~under the blanket~~ inside its shell.

Eventually, the child gets bored and wanders off. The tortoise comes out of its shell when the ""danger"" is gone, and curiously walks over to the child, to see what they wanted. Don't ask me why this kid talks to reptiles, but what they said next was,

13,"Once again I turn to the internet for my problems. Lovely. I think I just need to vent. 

So some background here, I’m a first year in college, and about a year ago I went on a big summer service trip to another country with some guides and like 12 teens. And I met this really, really amazing girl there with me. 

We became pretty good friends, really fast. I knew then I liked her, but I was in another relationship at the time, and she lived pretty far away. We snapchatted a bunch every so often, and even met up with some others from the trip for a reunion once. And wouldn’t you know it, by some impossible, ridiculous, universe-fuckery stroke of luck, my college happens to be pretty close to where she lives (she’s a senior in High School).

She knows this, and we’ve texted a bit, briefly mentioned meeting up, but I just cannot for the life of me read this girl. Texting so much doesn’t help that. It’s hard to flirt over text. I have no idea how to pursue anything, or even if I should. She’s really special to me, and I wouldn’t want to fuck that up because I’m into her. 

I doubt myself constantly. Maybe I’m imagining how well we get along, maybe I’m annoying her by talking to her. For all the progress I’ve made in terms of self-confidence over the past few years, I always, *always* worry that people don’t reciprocate my feelings towards them, friendly or romantic, that I annoy them and they don’t know how to get rid of me. I hate it. 

If you read this far, thanks. I get you don’t have enough info to really help me, but it’s nice to talk it out, scream to the void and all. If you wanna hear more of this nonsense, feel free to talk to me. Got nothing else to do right now.

17,"In 2015 after staying late at work I was caught up in conversation with a beautiful coworker over a couple cigarettes. It was November in Alberta Canada, we worked at an automotive shop and we were about to close. My shift ended at 6, but because it was busy I stayed late to assist. It was a quick lane outfit. 

The temperatures were cold, frost was on the windshield of my Jeep. I let it run to clear it off with the heat going in order to not make use of a scraper since I was off the clock finally.

Infatuated with the conversation I was having (this woman has eventually became my girlfriend and is to this day) I did not look too much to my right side where my vehicle was, nor did she as I was less than 5 ft away.

After 15 minutes of chatting I hear my Jeep’s door open. I turn to my right and see a small blonde woman hop inside. Not recognizing this individual and being fairly acquainted with GTA video games I comprehensively deducted what was at hand. 

I chose to fight rather than pick up the telephone. I dove onto the hood. The blonde shifted into reverse, pinned it, and went heading towards an alleyway. Beside each side was a gas bar and a restaurant. While still in my shop jacket I decided the theft could end if the thief could not see. I unzipped my jacket and spread it across the windshield. Cannot drive if you cannot see.

She drove the vehicle into a metal garbage container beside the restaurant, I slipped off to the passenger side, I managed to grab onto the wiper blade arm and pull myself back upon the hood of the Jeep. Scanning her face like a Terminator, telling her to stop, she extended a gaze that pierced through me and only forwards.

She sped up near the end of the alley. Rocked the Jeep side to side, I said game over, let go, and got a couple cuts and bruises but ultimately survived.

Fast forward to August 2018, I am contacted by the local police department and the incarcerated thief wishes to apologize through the use of a program in the correctional centre they are in. I’ve agreed to this arrangement. Insurance covered all damages to the theft, I lost nothing and a rental was given in place of my stolen Jeep.  Tomorrow I meet with this individual and I am free to ask whatever my heart desires.

As I continuously jot down questions packed with barbs that i fully intend to deliver calm and confidently I wonder what others may ask given the opportunity.

If anyone is interested I will update this post tomorrow with what questions I asked and what answers I received from someone who didn’t even care if I survived that encounter.",14Sep2018,3
18,"I wanted a friend when I became old enough to recognize that I didn't have any. I wonder if that's just the will looking to exert itself, to expand into previously unreached domains, to grow, a desire that one would expect to exist in children in a variety of domains. Moreover for the social, we all seem to want that. We go through stages of wanting mother, then friends, then lovers, then family. That's the normal human chain of relationship primacy. I am one that thinks that's more hardwired than anything else. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now, looking back, I see how I never had any of that, and now, at this point, I don't think I ever will have any of it. In fact, after years of stagnation, failure, humiliation, alienation, active and perceived ostracization, I had to ask why, and I had to ask about the structure of the system. Where was the mismatch, what was the purpose for the others, why could they do what I could not. The more I deconstructed how other worked, what they sought, why they sought it, how they got it, and why it was given to them, the more I saw, and still see it as corrupt and disgusting. Notice, though, that I've already claimed our desires are hardwired. I can recognize myself as apart, as a non-participant, but it arises from resentment, not from a defensive superiority. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other boys, they didn't like me. They didn't want me around. I was unwanted, and I was a child. There was no way for me to adjust myself. I accepted that I was at the bottom and on the outside, though it's nicer to fool yourself into believing more on the outside than the bottom, within the school environment. When we moved to a new neighborhood, I thought, I can make friends now. They didn't like me. They wouldn't come to get me. I would always have to go get them. Their parents would sometimes look very guilty telling me that they could not come out for whatever reason. I would go to a different school. Maybe it'll be better? It wasn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was my fault, really. I didn't fit in because of who I was. This is a fact, and you should know that it is true, because in what other way to children behave? That is, how a child is going to treat someone is unmarked, uncorrupted, it's innocent, a reflection of how they feel about you. They didn't like me. 

&amp;#x200B;

High school was a little better. I learned to shut down more. I learned to withdrawal and act as little within the physical world as possible so that I would not be perceived and so that I could not be hated. To be more exact, this happened more around 8th grade, but by then everyone in middle school had already judged me. In high school, more withdrawn, but managed to have some 'friends'. They didn't really like me either. We were all just 4th social tier kids that hung out together out of mutual lack of identity or social status. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm drifting off into the weeds, boring myself now. Romantic feelings, those came too. Let me remember them. She liked my better looking friend, I hardly talked to her. She was smart, involved. I couldn't really say 100% why I liked her. Then there was the blonde one a little later. Very pretty. Was that it? No, there was more...I don't know what to say, all the normal things that you look at in another person. Next was the broken one. I know that she was as broken as me, and I think I loved her for it. She caught on, eventually, that I was sick too, and her reaction was repulsion. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then there was the last one. I remember how easy it was to talk with her alone. It was awkward other times, but often alone, I didn't have to try. She was impossibly herself at all times, so I didn't have to guess or try to figure things out. Excepting, of course, every time I would let her know I was interested, she would lie, but at least she would lie in a way that she felt I should understand that she was lying to me, and so therefore act towards her how she wanted based on the fact that she was lying to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

She was beautiful and intelligent, witty, eccentric. I know I would have been happy to live and die with her. I could not do better. She knew she could do better, but she liked calling attention friendship, so I had to leave. I didn't stay long, only long enough to know the only thing available to me was to lie to myself too.

&amp;#x200B;

Finding someone like that is a measure of your life and your worth. Her rejection is the quintessential statement on my life. You are not good enough to achieve what you want, what you want without even asking to want it.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me ask you something. I f you go to the gas station, and you see the 40 year old working behind the counter, and say they're not an immigrant, but born and raised in your country, do you want to be around them? Really? They're probably ugly. The janitor, talk to him or her. They're stupid and there's no changing it. You can deny this. Maybe I really just am close minded, but I'll just think you've seen too many movies. There are limitations, and worse, there is no fairness in these limitations. The liars tell you that you lose physical beauty, but you gain in inner beauty. You may be bad at pinao, but you're good at math. 

&amp;#x200B;

My emptiness, it extends far beyond the relationships. I have nothing I want to do in my life, no hobbies, no career goals. I am too old to ever excel at anything. This is another lie they tell you, but I swear to you, if you're not developing towards something at \~15, you will never excel at the general field derived from that something. 

&amp;#x200B;

19,"I'd basically make the older hbo model--wire and sopranos--the model for everything. I'm talking casting people who aren't necessarily actors but have lived the part. I'd cast not good looking women (no need for special effects or makeup) for the roles of love interests, what have you (they exist in real life they can exist on film goddammit). Everything would be an exercise in being as grounded as possible, almost for the sake of novelty. Some of my favorite films take this grounded approach be it the aforementioned HBO, the original alien, district 9 (to an extant), the dark knight, snow on the bluff, etc. There is something so much more appealing about authenticity. I have a hard time watching historical fiction because it's hard for me to rationalize the point. I'm watching a piece of history, supposadely,  except everyone is beautiful and has perfect white teeth, and engage in perfect dialogue. How about some scenes of a shitty conversation full of ticks, coughs, etc.

21,"I’m not really sure where to start off but I guess I’ll start from the beginning. I had this friend (B) who I became best friends with in high school and it was apparent that she was the type of friend that got into some serious shit. Over the course of four years, from senior year of high school to junior year of college, she had made a pretty big dent in my life. From manipulating me to giving her car rides to and from work, taking advantage of me before I had a backbone. She also crashed her car doing dust off and started to do heroin shortly after. I had never experienced quite a thing like that before and I had never had a best friend treat me like this nor did I know how to deal with it. Obviously wanting to help her I started skipping classes and drove her to and from work for about a month before she lost her job. From then on I couldn’t handle my own shit going on at home so I got into my own problems and somewhat became distant from her. Although still talking, she moved to another town and ended up drinking 24/7 with other people she associated with. About a year ago she got pregnant with the guy she got drunk with and we’ve had our moments and basically do not talk as of now. There’s a lot more to it but I can’t help but feel angry and this is why. About two months ago we sort of tried to reconcile things but I didn’t process everything she told me until a few days later and basically her now baby daddy isn’t fond of me because he doesn’t understand how she’s forgiven me for things and such. Granted I have made my own mistakes with her and have apologized and I admit I sometimes just disappeared because too much shit was happening in her life because I couldn’t deal with it. I took too much on earlier and it’s angering to me that I have forgiven her for shit beyond comprehension yet I’m still seen as the bad one. Idk. I’m just angry and I have matured now to the point where I do not want to associate with her but it’s hard because we both have a common best friend - who takes her side and sees her every week.

28,"As you may have heard, the news is reporting that Manafort is preparing to take a guilty plea in his upcoming trial. 

I have a theory (and I could be wrong, because I may be misunderstanding how US legal proceedings work).

I think that this guilty plea has been coordinated with Trump's legal team through Manafort's lawyers. I suspect that the purpose is to stop damaging evidence and testimony from appearing in court before the midterms.

Trump will then pardon Manafort, and this chapter of the investigation will close with none of the really damning information being released to the public.

Now, I could be wrong here (I'm not a US citizen, and I don't have an intimate understanding of how your courts work), but to my layperson's understanding, if the person pleads guilty at the outset, then there is no need to hold the rest of the lengthy and expensive trial in order to present evidence to the jury.

29,"Last year I had a couple of issues with my close friend and roommate of 2 years and ended up moving out. Most of our conflicts revolved around the fact that I felt she was constantly lying to me (about minor things) and then manipulating me into feeling sorry for her when I would try to bring them up. It got really frustrating and upsetting but whenever I would try to explain this to her she was able to portray herself as a victim and make me feel shitty for bringing it up.

I have a little bit of a drinking problem as well and when I was blackout drunk I would accuse her of lying or manipulating me, which was not cute, and then the next day she would cry and act like I was the worst person in the world for what I did when I was drunk. I felt so guilty, and so much shame and regret about my behavior, and it was such a vicious cycle. 

I'm glad I moved out and got away from her. But I'm still freaked out by how our friendship ended and now I'm reading some stuff online about narcissism, manipulation, and covert aggression, and it all lines up perfectly with her behavior. I'm realizing that so much stuff she said to me (""our friendship is so special!"" ""you're the only person I really feel comfortable around"") was complete bullshit that she probably tells everyone. I just feel really freaked out and manipulated and empty inside because of all of this.

It sounds overdramatic because it's not like it was an abusive relationship or anything - I just feel really weirded out and used.

I feel responsible for everything. I am responsible. I couldn't raise enough money for us. My issues ruined everything. I love her and now my only concern is getting her out of this rut.

So I'm sitting here at back entrance of our apartment complex enjoying nice view and guy comes over and showed his goods. Looked pretty fine, pure and clean.

36,"My life has been pretty shitty since the moment i was born. I don’t remember everything but the things that i do remember are nightmares every single day of my life, parents who hated each other, my failing grades and the pain i seem the cause to everyone around me.

I’ve had nightmares since i was little. Some so bad i would wake up crying, scary, horrific nightmares. I don’t know what’s the cause of them. But they never seem to go away. I don’t think i’ve ever had a “normal” dream. 

My parents were abusive to themselves. They couldn’t stand next to each other and not want to rip each other’s hearts out. My father was paranoid since a very young age, so even when they were dating my mom would be followed around by him and accused of things she’d never do. She was troubled, both of them were. Toxic, toxic beings. But she held onto him because he was smart and he had a bright future ahead of him. They were never good for each other. My father continued to be abusive towards her and she just went on with it. As the time passed somehow she found a voice of herself and would now stand up for herself. Somewhere, the pain and the suffering she went through messed with her and she was toxic, different. She believed she was right in every situation and she overpowered herself over others, played a victim most times. She longed for love she never had. So when she set out to learn computers as a hobby she found a guy and she had an affair one that lasted for years and still is and one that really changed our lives forever. 

My dad lost the voice he had against my mother. She was doing to him what he would do to her. They would fight so violent, she kicked my dad out of our house and he was forced to live in his office. I lived many years without him and I would watch as my mom would shut the door on his face when he would come home sometimes. I was the median through which she would communicate with him, she would tell me to call my father to not come home. It was painful. I wish i never agreed to do it. Most of the past is blurry to me. I choose to not remember it. 

2 years ago my father found out my mom was having an affair. It was a sunday night when hell broke loose in my house. My mother lied to my father blatantly. She lied with so much strength any other stranger would’ve believed her. And i watched because i had no voice to speak. I watched them fight and i was forced to take my mothers side. My brother knew too. I found out 3 months before that happened when i felt a change in my mothers behavior, i told my brother and my brother told me to be quiet unless that affair of hers was harming us.

My dad started drinking alcohol. Too much of it. So much he wouldn’t be able to stand a second without it. He became addicted. So my parents fought more and more and more. All through this i took my mothers side who lied so well. During this i spoke some vile things to my father. One reason i can’t live with myself anymore, the regret eats me up whole. 

It was I who suggested rehab for my father. So he was admitted there in hopes that he would come back to us a better person and his normal self. But things took for a worse and he became unhealthy. The rehab took poor care of him and he refused to eat absolutely anything or even drink water. He was born with multiple diseases, so the weaker he got the more they surfaced. When my mom and i saw that he was suffering, we took him back home. 

He passed away a week later.

And the last thing he said was my mothers name. 

He loved her with all his heart, he just didn’t know how to express it. He had always been a tough person. 

He passed away believing a lie that my mother wasn’t cheating. He passed away with hopes and dreams that he still wanted to fulfill. He was way ahead of his time and he was the most brilliant man i ever knew and i ever will. 

My mother blamed me for his death. Because it was me who said we should put him in a rehab.

My grades. 

I never cared much about school. I don’t know what it was but it never concerned me much as it should have. So as we would expect i never had a single good grade in my entirety of being in school. I somehow managed to know just enough to pass my classes. 

As a result i didn’t know what i wanted to do with my life. 

So when 11th grade came around i was worse than i had ever been. 

I didn’t go to school and i didn’t study. I would distract myself in my phone and my computer. Looking for comfort somewhere. Looking for a safe haven from all the pain in my real life. 

That continued for 2 years and here i am. still in 11th grade except this time i really want to make it happen and make a future for myself and my family that’s falling apart. 

As a result of my failing grades and my disappointing self. My mother and i didn’t have a good relationship. As toxic as she had become we couldn’t hold a conversation about myself without fighting. She didn’t listen to anything i had to say and believed what she said was the correct thing. She spoke about me to her friends and colleagues and family. Strangers knew more about me than i knew about myself. 

Things were good this week and i felt as though i was beginning to make my life better. However there was a motivational lecture in my tuition class that i didn’t want to go to since it was basically a holiday and i wanted to be with myself that day. My mother continued to force me and said if i wouldn’t go there i might as well stop going to school and stop studying because i wasn’t going to be able to do any of that either. The next day she told me she called in my tuition saying i wouldn’t be going to class anymore. 

Just when i thought things were getting better, my life had to fall apart again. 

She comes home everyday from work saying how much stress and pain i cause to her and how she wished i was dead, how she hates me and how she’s given up on me. 

I’ve been through 3 counseling sessions. Only two of which i actually went to. 3rd i was taken advantage of and molested right in front of my mother. 

But those two successful therapists didn’t help me and i ended both of them feeling the same hollow and empty i had been. My mom doesn’t believe i need help she just says i’m spoiled.

I used to write and sketch in my pass time but now i don’t. I’ve lost interest in things i loved to do. I’ve lost interest in doing anything. Sometimes i don’t mind if i was dead and sometimes i think about when i told my mom i was going to kill myself and she said she would be blamed for my death just as she was for my dads. I feel like i might go crazy when i talk to her about my feelings, she just doesn’t believe i have them. 

I self harmed when i was 14 years old over a argument with my mother. The only one who sat and cried with me was my father. The only one who ever sympathized with my was my father. He was my best friend.

I don’t know if my life has any meaning at all. I just know i’m not scared to die and i will accept it right now if it was given to me. I’m too scared to fall off a cliff and i’m too scared to bleed to death. As a child of two doctors i can only lean towards overdose. I don’t want to die and i want to live a good life. But i always fall back into this hole in the ground that gets deeper every second. 

I have a boyfriend who’s keeping me alive, making me want to live to make a future with him but I don’t think i’m strong enough. 

If god had made a person with all the bad qualities in life it would be me. 

I don’t know if anyone read through all of this and i don’t know what writing this will bring to me. I just felt like i had to get something off of my shoulder before things could get even worse. 

I’m almost 18, a girl and i don’t want to live a miserable life anymore.

I remember the first time I fell in love, I was 3 years old. She was my best friend and every night I was going to sleep thinking about her and dreaming of our future together. I wished that one day, we would get married and be the best parents ever. The whole thing was quite cute, but those feelings were always kept secret.

♡

I have loved since then, twelve times in twenty years. I remember all of them, their names, why I liked them, the good moments we had together. They still have one little piece of my heart, and they are all great people I still admire.

♡

Every time, the feelings were different. Sometimes very passionate, sometimes airy and spiritual. It often started by some kind of attraction, a desire to be spend as much time as possible with that person, and some kind of curiosity about who that person really was. Followed was a first period of infatuation and almost obsession, but a after a little time, that feeling disappeared as I got to know the person more and more. Oftentimes, it was followed by something really different. As I got to know the person, their secrets, their hopes, their wounds and their flaws and imperfections, I started liking them even more. That feeling of closeness, vulnerability and love without condition is exhilarating.

♡

Twelve times later, I have never experienced love as something shared. In fact, I’ve never felt loved by anyone in a romantic manner. I am 23 and all I have ever experienced is ending up being hurt, it’s realising after a couple months that I will never be with the person I love. It’s having that special someone tell you all about their crush. It’s pretending to be happy for them, while inside I’m dying of jealousy.

♡

This is my story, and I’m not complaining. I have my fair share of responsibility in that; I have no seduction skills, I’m too shy to be upfront about my feelings, and with all the times I was hurt, it’s even scarier to face the rejection, my self-esteem is pretty low, I feel quite a bit of gender dysphoria, and I’m afraid of anything that has to do with sexuality. That does not help, that’s for sure, but sometimes I wish I could feel requited love for once. I’d like to have a chance to heal, to learn, to make mistakes and learn from them... a chance to love.

♡

That brings me to this subreddit, I'm curious to know what you think... I feel like I can't afford to feel that pain again, or even build the confidence to change how I behave. I feel stuck, lonely, and I feel my story is so pathetic I should refrain for talking about it with friends. Every time I find someone attractive, I try not to get to know that person because I just don't want to deal with that again. Any tips on healing? Cultivating hope? Do miracles exist when it comes to love?

♡

Thanks for reading :)

It was broken in half, separated completely. 3 months of plaster, did not help, it had to be surgery to place the fixator to the bones. And i remember how it went with anaesthesia. It wasnt for me like for others, you fell asleep, you wake up and that's it. The surgery took 6 hours, and that was the longest 6 hours I ever had. It was like that you are asleep, but it isn't like you are suddenly waking up. It was like everything around is dark, your eyes are closed, and in that dark you see a small dot of light where you can see that you are aware that you are under anaesthesia, like in subconcious. Sometimes that dot disappears, but it is there for 6 hours. And through that dot you see that light that is from operation room. That dot was like when you look up to sky and see a star, except I could zoom it :) Imagine that you lay down 6 hours in a dark, you get in your head that dot of light, that maybe represents your subconcius and shows you that you are still alive. Anaesthesia was strong, I didn't feel anything. After all, they did drill my leg.

43,"I haven't been on Reddit for a few months but nothing has changed. My other posts will tell you a lot of whats happened.

But here's a brief synopsis of whats happened this year. 

1. I was dumped unceremoniously back in Feb after a 6 year relationship with a 4 year old son. It's been 7 months since he left and I still find myself weeping every night, worrying about the future, heartbroken, and just so very sad. A few months ago I tried to date, talk to new people - anything- but nothing lasted.

2. A month after I was dumped I found out my Dad had prostate cancer. I spent most days down at the hospital with him and my son, watched him recover from surgery and thankfully he's doing OK, though hes changed a lot and it breaks my heart.  He's not the same person.

&amp;#x200B;

3. In April, I thought things may have been looking up when I got an amazing salary job (wrote a post about it) writing for a tech start up. However, excitement quickly turned to fear when I  suffered daily at work with anxiety attacks, and dealing with the drama/atmosphere that come with many open plan offices. I was sacked after two months, after being told they had ""tried their best but it just wasn't working"".

&amp;#x200B;

4. I then took on some temporary work in a Psychiatry college working in archiving. I loved it- I worked alone in the roller racking room dealing with document and journals from the 60's. The job was only temp so 8 days later it was over.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Yesterday I found out my Dads brother (Uncle) died suddenly while getting routine treatment abroad. It's been a big shock for everyone but since I'm not close to much family (was very sheltered growing up) I feel very alone and don't know how to help.

&amp;#x200B;

6. I stupidly looked at the ex's instagram this afternoon after not looking for months. My heart broke again when I saw all the beautiful pictures. Since he left he's been jet setting around the world for his job, attending weddings, moving into a wonderful new flat and living the dream. I had a physical reaction. I wanted to throw up. I wanted to go to the corner shop and buy a bottle of red wine or some gin. I want to take the quetiapine I've been stocking up on. I want him to do well and good for him but he left me a mess. I know he can't have ever loved me. I feel out of control. I can't handle any more shit. I don't have the strength.

&amp;#x200B;

7. I'm so so tired. I watch crime documentaries to escape. Yesterday I cut all my hair off. Literally, I have 1 inch of hair on my head. lol. Luckily I have a wig so I can actually leave the house. When I have to. I realised afterwards its something my mum used to do when we were younger and she felt down. It made me feel better but I also feel ugly.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I was coming back here with good news. All my posts have been so dark and, well, negative. I'm documenting this for a reason. I want to make it out of this dark place. But I need a hand up. I want to be a better parent, a better human. I want to be happy. But I cant stop the feeling of permanent grief, of hopelessness, of guilt, and fear. What even is life? Is God pushing me to my limit? I don't want to die, but it feels like my mind is fighting me constantly.

52,"I love hearing stories behind tattoos. The interesting and genuine ones.

A lot of the time though when I ask I get some variant of, “I’m into body art”

I never gave this explanation too much thought, but the more I hear it, the more I question it, something feels off with this explanation.

I don’t doubt the people who say this are sincere, but I have a feeling that they might have come up with this justification to cover the real and less wholesome reasons they are into tattoos.

So one of my main reasons for doubting this is - what person who is into art finds a reseller or artist who is very close to them and pays them to produce all of their works of art for them, and worse, will find the cheapest artist or reseller closest to them?

People who are serious about commissioning or buying art are rarely so lucky to live in the same town as their favourite artist.

Don’t get me wrong, there are people out there who are very serious about certain tattoo artists works and will travel and pay a lot for a piece, kudos to them, this is sincerity and passion, and I get that a person won’t always have the means to go to their favourite artist for a piece for travel and financial reasons. 

But at the same time, it’s not like you’re buying something that you can put on and take off of a wall, it’s on your body forever. And you can’t even resell it! So you’d think someone who claims to be in it for the art would take it very much more seriously.

I find this annoying, and this might be why I tend to find people with lots of tattoos annoying who claim they’re into body art. The whole thing is often dripping in what seems like fake passion and interest.

So is it really about the art, or is it just about being a person who is covered in ink?",14Sep2018,0
54,"In my defense I did not know she was a apparently a thief and a lunatic when we met last night.  She got up really early because she said she had to go to work.  I did not have to get up yet and I was still dead tired so I stayed.  I was woken up a few hours later when I heard yelling and from the yells I am pretty sure of the following:


1. This is not her home.


2. This is actually the home of her friend, who I do not know.


3. Her friend's family has somehow found out she was here and is yelling at the friend because...


4. She stole from the friend's family in the past.


They are yelling really loudly and are very, very angry.  I am pretty sure none of them know I am up here.  I am currently trying to figure out what to do.  Given the tone of their lively conversation I am afraid someone may kill me if I walk downstairs.  I am on the second floor of the home and the ceiling of the first floor is pretty tall so I don't think I can jump out the window.  There is some snow outside but not enough.  There are a bunch of heavy blankets in the closest and some towels in a dresser, I am currently considering how likely I am to break a leg if I try to throw it all out the window to cushion my fall, there is nothing for me to try to tie one of the blankets off to, otherwise I could try to climb down on it?  If I keep hiding maybe they will also all leave for work? I think that might be the better plan. I'm worried about being murdered or arrested if I walk downstairs.

**TLDR: Robbed and left in a strangers home last night and the strangers don't know I am here.  Thank God I wore a condom.**

Edit: More shouting.  Friend is crying and trying to convince her family that Crazy One has turned her life around.

Edit: I found a number of hunting magazines on the toilet in the bathroom. I don't think that is a good sign.


Edit: Friend just went into a room down the hallway and slammed the door. Currently crying. Plans based on the hope that everyone leaves and I can sneak out seem increasingly unlikely. Still yelling and downstairs from the rest of the family.  But maybe if everyone else leaves later and she is still in there crying I can sneak out?

Edit: Still yelling from downstairs, crying down the hallway.  One of them mentioned work so I know at least one of them has a job.  Now if only they would leave and go to it...

Edit: Unable to contain my bowels any further. Had to make a deposit in the bathroom.  Can't flush.  I'm so sorry, Total Strangers, your home is nicely decorated and it is good you are trying to keep your child away from the crazy lunatic who robbed me but PLEASE JUST LEAVE AND GO TO WORK!


I posted this on /r/TIFU earlier and updated it as it happened. The mods deleted the thread because they said that it wasn't my fault therefore it was against the rules. I've also gotten many, many, many private messages asking for an update. Way too many for me to respond to individually. Someone suggested that I post here in the hopes that those people would check my history and see this and get some closure.  That sounds like a good idea.

So what happened? I was absolutely not going to call the police. I didn't want to risk being accused of being an accessory of burglary or being killed by the people downstairs. Going out the window and breaking my leg it didn't seem like a great idea either.  I started to climb out the window and I just lost my nerve and was too afraid of breaking one of my legs so I climbed back in.  I wrapped a towel partially around my head hoping to hide my hair color and then while everyone was still yelling I just ran down the stairs and bolted for the front door as quickly as I possibly could.  I was wagering that they probably did not have a gun on them at that exact second so the odds of actually shooting me were not great and I might be able to run before they kicked my ass. They saw me. A man who I am pretty sure was the father of the friend of the crazy lunatic who robbed me yelled in confusion when he saw me and a woman who I assumed was her mother screamed. I was out the door and I thought in the clear. Except the guy chased me down the street screaming like a complete f****** lunatic. I honestly don't know what he was saying but I imagine it was probably him wanting to know know why I was in his house.  I don't think that O have ever run so fast in my entire life. I was parked about a block away and managed to get into my car quick enough to speed away before he got to me. I threw the towel at the window, I didn't want to steal one of their towels.


So I guess I'm probably going to be someone's weird crazy story for the rest of their life. I don't think there's any sort of lesson for me to learn here and I don't have any advice for you on how to avoid doing something like this.",14Sep2018,122
55,"I have some pretty severe ADHD. But that part I already knew. I was on medication for it when I was younger (I can’t remember exactly but several years. Like from ages 9-12) until my parents, for whatever reason, decided to take me off of it. 


I spent the next decade and a half self managing the symptoms as best I could. I knew I was easily distracted. And occasionally prone to bursts of hyperactivity. But nothing that left me crippled or unable to function. 

Within the last year and a half, I started a new (very demanding, but very rewarding) job. And had a son. 

With both of those added stressors, I began to notice my ability to stay focused, on task, not distracted, and calm slipping away by the day. 

Though I’ve always hated the thought of having to get back on medication, I finally made the decision that for the betterment of my family and myself at work, I’d ask my doctor what they thought. 

They told me that, as it had been so long, I’d have to get re-evaluated by a clinical psychologist before they’d prescribe me anything. Totally understandable. Adderall and it’s kin are nothing to fuck around with. 

So I went and got testing done a little while back. Couple months. 

They administered three different tests on me. I have very little medical background, but maybe some of you do and know which ones I’m talking about. 

They ran the “Symptom Checklist-90-R” on me. The “Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory - IV” on me.  And the “ADDES-4” on me. 

This was back in July. All she told me afterwards was that based on my scoring, she was going to recommend I get back on the medication and make sure I stayed monitored for a little while to verify it was working out for me. 

I started the medication last Friday (it took them forever to get the paperwork sent to my GP and then for me to get an appointment slot that didn’t require missing work). Since July I’ve had some pretty rough personal issues at home. So I’ve been seeing a counselor. He asked to see a copy of the report if I was willing to provide it to him, which I am. So I called the psych’s office and got it today. 

They didn’t inform me of over half the stuff that these tests flagged. And now I’m severely sad.  I’ve always thought I was a relatively well adjusted person. But here’s a small summarized portion of the report. 

The SCL-90-R scored me as a 66 for Obsessive Compulsive. Which the scale registered as “elevated and clinical”


The MCMI-IV said the following Base Rate Scores were considered “of concern”

Avoidant. Narcissistic. Antisocial. Negativistic. Masochistic. Generalized Anxiety. Schizoid. Bipolar Spectrum. 


And then the ADDES-4 gave me the following scores. 

Inattention was rated as a 1 “within severe range”

Hyperactivity was rated as a 0 “within severe range.”


It’s kind of throwing me for a loop that apparently I have some severe psychological issues that I never even realized. I’ve spent nearly 30 years thinking that, besides ADHD, I was a normal person. Now I feel lost and sort of betrayed by my own mind. I don’t know how to think or feel about this. ",14Sep2018,0
56,"Long story short, we had two dogs that were best buds.  The older one, our first, died completely unexpectedly in June and I have felt so bad for our current pup. 

He is dog friendly with the dogs he met as a puppy but needs a slower introduction for new friends.  I thought that I’d never be able to make the commitment to another dog in case he didn’t settle well after the first short time period he usually has with other new pups. This is the second time he’s met my sister in law’s dog after a walk together and a little playtime. He hasn’t shown an ounce of aggression towards her nor have they stopped playing aside from occasional naps. 

I guess this is just a long way to say that I now have hope that we can find the right fit for a new family member when the time is right. Plus I haven’t seen our dog play like this since our first was still around. I can’t wipe the smile off my face watching them. ",14Sep2018,1

People really are waiting for the one post, it seems, that makes a black person look bad so they can unload all the pent up racism you can tell they've been holding in forever. And because they're ideas are echoed by those around them, then they're justified and comfortable in their actions. I assure you that just because a large group of people share your racist sentiment, that does not mean your sentiment is not racist. That simply means you all have some racist sentiment to add to the conversation.

And I see this a lot. Everytime there's a post like ""white people don't season their food."" They're rebutted with ""yeah? Well I hope you die in gang violence."" Or ""Black man jailed for murdering man"" it's ""yeah, and why do black people smell so bad, am I right?""

And I don't expect this to change anything, but I'm really Just calling for people to bring attention to it when you see it. Don't let these racist sentiments go unnoticed, giving the person who wrote them the satisfaction of somehow thinking they're in the right. Those who want tolerance and acceptance have to be as bold as those who want division and hate. Especially nowadays it would seem.

We can't let those who would preach hate be comfortable. They have to be educated or shamed. Because who knows how their comfortability will grow? They put out bits of an idea here and bits of it there and after a while they're sentiments are echoed and praised so much by like-minded individuals on here that they believe everyone is equally comfortable with it irl.

Note: we don't even consider candidates who don't have their certificate even if they're going to get it tomorrow; they can call back tomorrow when they've obtained it.  I asked several questions to determine how the candidate could say they both have experience while holding the certificate while not having the certificate, and slowly the candidate got more and more angry.  I finally understood the situation determined that there was good news to be had.  The conversation was supposed to play out:

Candidate:  I don't understand why we can't move forward.

Me:  We can't move forward today because you do not have your certificate today, however if you have the experience you stated you can simply re-apply or even called back when you get it and I can fish your application out and we can start again.  Even if this job is gone you could see what else we have, we're always hiring.  So call me back in a month.

67,"I struggle to write or express my current life situation because I feel it comes off as weakness in the form of self-pity. But here goes.

Financial:

I have a decent 40k M-F office job where I started as an intern in March and now work full-time. I’m living paycheck to paycheck due to bad money management, stupid decisions, and some legal trouble. In the past, whenever I’ve had some extra cash I’d usually blow it on weed, strip clubs, hookers. I’ve got 3 open marijuana charges. I have a lawyer for one of them, need a lawyer for the second (don’t know where that money is coming from), and the third one may not need a lawyer involved (3 different counties).

I need 5 more classes to finish a degree, but again, I don’t know where that money is coming from. It is an expensive private school and, unfortunately, they will not take credits from cheaper community or state colleges for the degree. I wasn’t approved for a private loan to cover what fed loan won’t (credit has gone to shit the past 4 years). 

Family:
I got married at 22. A big reason for getting married so soon was so she can become a US citizen and continue on to a university and get a degree. The marriage lasted 5 years before starting to breaking down. During our marriage, we moved about a 4hr plane ride away from all of our friends and family so she can take a well paying job. I quit my job and decided to finish college in the new state. Not too long after, we separated and eventually divorced but I decided to stay and finish school.

My mother and I have a bad relationship. As a child, I was sexually abused by my stepfather. I told my mother about it as a young child but she may have sunk into denial. I went therapy for this last year for 9 months and it has been very helpful. Although the anger is mostly gone, I have no desire to fix my relationship with her. 

I rarely speak with my dad, it’s awkward when we do. He was a bit verbally and physically abusive but I have no ill feelings towards him. We’ve just never had a ‘loving’ relationship.

I have 4 brothers aged 22-32 and two younger sisters ages 3 and 5. I only regularly talk with one of my brothers (31). He’s bailed me out financially a few times but I don’t have a plan yet on how I will be repaying the debt. 

Social:

I find it difficult connecting with anyone these days. Conversations longer than 5 minutes are tough for me. My roommate has tried to get me to be more social and fun and I’ve tried as well. I’d just rather be alone, knowing that this desire for isolation adds on to my depression. But so does being bad at socializing. 

Meditation has been incredibly helpful in turning off my mind for a little bit, but as soon I begin to realistically think how the next 5 years look like, my mind goes down a dark path.",14Sep2018,1

I know how much of a meme it is for this subreddit to have people venting about how they’ve been fucked over by life, but goddamn do I need to vent, so shall I begin ?

bit of context, I’m an 18M who just finished school and I’m struggling to try and find something to do with my life. On top of that I’ve had reoccurring depression since I was about 15 and have had periods in my short life where I was physically unable to look people in the eyes and would stutter at every word in a sentence, even contemplating suicide at times, albeit I’ve never told anyone this and likely never will. I suffer from severe lack anger issues and find it next to impossible to express myself

Ever since I was 15 I’ve been struggling with my self image and perception, due to being overweight, having gyno but most of all a load of unsightly raised (hypertrophic if you were wondering) scars all over my upper body due to a really bad case of acne. There were times where I would go to bed crying myself to sleep or I would begin chucking shit and punching stuff out of pure anger, always wondering “why me”, “no one else is like me” or “why am I so unlucky”. While I do know a lot of people have it worse, I get too emotional at times and can’t see past the fact that I feel disgusted when I rub my chest or back, even looking at it causes me to get depressed, not to mention the recurring irritation that serves as a reminder it’s there even when I cant see it.

I used to dread taking my top off, and when i had to change for sport I would either wait until everyone left to take my top off or hide in the corner and do it out of sight.

This shitty self image I have of myself made it really hard for me to make friends or feel comfortable around people. I’ve never had a girlfriend, and feel pessimistic at the thought of her seeing my body, just because I don’t feel as if it’s good enough. Whenever I do start getting close to someone I overanalyse, lash out and tend to have outbursts of rage at the littlest of things, as they can tick me off really easily depending on the situation.

I’ve gradually been getting better and trying to learn how to cope, even losing a good amount of weight to be considered at least skinny with a shirt on and slightly improving the appearance of my scars and acne 

But today I don’t know, it feels empty everything from my envy of my friends going out or getting ready for uni and enjoying them self’s without me,going gym and looking in the mirror and just thinking “ what’s the point in trying to improve when this is the result” to my scars acting up has kinda piled up to just make me feel shit and has put me in a state I haven’t felt for a while, and never wanted to feel again, 

Powerless and trapped 

I don’t know what I’m trying to get at with this post, probably reads like incoherent babble. I guess all I want is someone to come and tell me it’s okay, that it gets better and walk me through how to fix my life and get to the place I want to be, but I know that’s not possible, I have to deal with my problems somehow and have to accept that maybe things like my depression and my scars are things I have to land to deal with till I die.

If you actually finished this, thank you for giving me the 5 minutes of attention most people in my life have never bothered to give, to just listen (or this case read) my problems. if your dealing with stuff of your own message me and we’ll talk about it, and I’ll give you that 5 mins back in full .

73,"(23F) There is something wrong with me, I have a very unhealthy habit that I can’t seem to break myself out of. All my life I have had a very hard time making friends. I moved around a lot, multiple times a year so I was always the odd one out in school. Even now as an adult I have a very hard time with people and have no friends. I am a single mom and just went back to college for the first time. I suffer from depression and anxiety that haunt me. Anyways that’s just a little background on me. 
When I was 15 I had my first real relationship. I dated him for almost 2 years then ended things because I moved again and never got to see him. Like within the next day I had a new boyfriend, I dated him for almost 2 years then ended things because he and his family were horrible and abusive. Immediately after that I got another, for almost 2 years. I had my first child with him (accidentally) and he was evil incarnate. When I was finally able to get out from under him I had another, for almost 2 years, had my second child. Ended things with him and within a couple weeks had another. This one only lasted 8 months but twice as long as it should have, or actually it should have never happened. After him is the one I’m currently involved with. I have a problem. I can’t be alone, I didn’t notice what I was doing while I jumped, but I never gave myself a chance to myself. I stay with these men longer than I should, I see it months beforehand but it’s like I wait til I’m completely over them before I actually end things, it helps with the actual breakup part, allows me not to feel anything. But then it’s like I don’t even think, but I can’t be alone, and I get with a new person, for a distraction? Idk. I just know that this is not okay and I want to stop it. I’m 4 months into my current relationship, I’m not happy, I don’t think he’s happy. I want to end things but I’m scared, I’m not so much scared of his reaction but I’m scared of going back to this routine, that the loneliness and depression will become too much and I’ll try to fill it in unhealthy ways..all of this has just come to light in me, I’ve just now been able to recognize what I’ve done. 
How do I break up with him gently and I don’t want him to think it’s all his fault (which a lot of him is very bad and negative but that’s not the point) 
How do I make sure not to fall into another relationship? I don’t want to be involved with anyone anymore, i need to become comfortable with myself. My depression has been very bad lately and I’m scared it will influence me..I don’t like being alone to my own thoughts all the time.
What is this? I don’t know anyone who does things like this..I just want to be okay..
Any and all advice is appreciated..

76,"There are two different ""chemtrail"" arguments that are made. The crazy version says the government is constantly spraying us using commercial aircraft for purposes of mind control or combating global warming. I'm not arguing in favor of that today. What I'm arguing is that ""chemtrails"" are a proven historical fact and that they were used for experimentation. The public was not told until decades later, but these chemtrails were a bit smaller in scale compared to the modern US-wide chemtrail theories floating around. 

Chemical, biological, and entomological experimentation ""chemtrails"" has been proven over and over in our recent history. This happened in Britain, Canada, and the United States. They used airplanes, ships off the coast, cars, blowers on top of buildings, etc. In some cases, they used real chemical or biological agents, and in other cases they used what they thought at the time were ""harmless"" agents as stand-ins. **Both** were used, which wasn't admitted to by the Defense Department until around 2002.

&gt;A visible trail left in the sky by an aircraft and believed by some to consist of chemical or biological agents released as part of a covert operation, rather than the condensed water of a vapour trail

http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/chemtrail

You have to stretch the definition a bit to include spraying mosquitoes and fleas upon unsuspecting populations, but I included those here as well because they were a part of the biological weapons testing arena. 

- A government report provides for the first time a comprehensive official history of Britain's biological weapons trials between 1940 and 1979. The 60-page report reveals new information about more than 100 covert experiments. Between 1955 and 1963 planes flew from north-east England to the tip of Cornwall along the south and west coasts, dropping huge amounts of zinc cadmium sulphide on the population. The report also reveals details of the DICE trials in south Dorset between 1971 and 1975. These involved US and UK military scientists spraying into the air massive quantities of serratia marcescens bacteria, with an anthrax simulant and phenol. Between 1961 and 1968 more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii. https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/apr/21/uk.medicalscience (https://archive.is/4nxNI)

- ""U.S. Admits Bio-Weapons Tests- The tests included releasing deadly nerve agents in Alaska and spraying bacteria over Hawaii, according to the documents obtained Tuesday. The United States also tested nerve agents in Canada and Britain in conjunction with those two countries, and biological and chemical weapons in at least two other states, Maryland and Florida. The Pentagon released records earlier this year showing that chemical and biological agents had been sprayed on ships at sea. The military reimbursed ranchers and agreed to stop open-air nerve agent testing at its main chemical weapons center in the Utah desert after about 6,400 sheep died when nerve gas drifted away from the test range... Earlier this year, the Defense Department acknowledged for the first time that some of the 1960s tests used real chemical and biological weapons, not just benign stand-ins... Some of those involved in the tests say they now suffer health problems linked to their exposure to dangerous chemicals and germs. The Defense Department has identified nearly 3,000 soldiers involved in tests disclosed earlier, but the VA has sent letters to fewer than half of them. VA and Pentagon officials acknowledged at a July hearing that finding the soldiers has been difficult."" https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-admits-bio-weapons-tests/ (https://archive.is/8tAQX)

The idea, according to a two-volume report the Army gave to the senate health subcommittee yesterday, was to learn how to wage biological warfare and defend against it... Washington was one of five cities where the Army released simulated lethal germs in public places. Other cities where the public served as unknowing guinea pigs were New York, San Francisco, Key West and panama City, Fla. All told, the Army listed 27 times that it tested simulated toxins on public property, including releasing spores in two tunnels on a stretch of Pennsylvania Turnpike. In addition to those experiments in public places, the Army secretary used military personnel and their families for open air experiments by spraying simulated germs into the air at a number of bases, including Fort Detrick, Md.; Fort Belvoir, Va.; and the Marine training school at Quantico, Va."" https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1977/03/09/army-conducted-239-secret-open-air-germ-warfare-tests/b17e5ee7-3006-4152-acf3-0ad163e17a22/ (https://archive.fo/SSdWl)

- ""Beginning on September 26, 1950, the crew of a U.S. Navy minesweeper ship spent six days spraying Serratia marcescens into the air about two miles off the northern California coast. The project was called “Operation Sea Spray,” and its aim was to determine the susceptibility of a big city like San Francisco to a bioweapon attack by terrorists. In the following days, the military took samples at 43 sites to track the bacteria's spread, and found that it had quickly infested not only the city but surrounding suburbs as well. During the test, residents of these areas would have inhaled millions of bacterial spores...But there was a catch. At the time, the US military thought that Serratia couldn’t harm humans. The bug was mostly known for the red spots it produced on infested foods and had not been widely linked to clinical conditions. That changed when one week after the test, 11 local residents checked into a Stanford University Hospital complaining of urinary tract infections...One patient, a man named Edward Nevin who was recovering from prostate surgery, died, and some have suggested that the release forever changed the area's microbial ecology."" https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/1950-us-released-bioweapon-san-francisco-180955819/(https://archive.is/m8RM2)

- Operation Dew I consisted of five separate trials from March 26, 1952 until April 21, 1952 that were designed to test the feasibility of maintaining a large aerosol cloud released offshore until it drifted over land, achieving a large area coverage. The tests released zinc cadmium sulfide along a 100-to-150-nautical-mile line approximately 5 to 10 nautical miles off the coast of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Two of the trials dispersed clouds of zinc cadmium sulfide over large areas of all three U.S. states. The tests affected over 60,000 square miles of populated coastal region in the U.S. southeast. Dew II involved the release of fluorescent particles (zinc cadmium sulfide) and plant spores (Lycopodium) from an aircraft. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Dew (https://archive.is/rFSsF)

The US also tested releasing mosquitoes and fleas from planes. 

- The U.S. Army recently released logs of thousands of experiments conducted at Dugway Proving Ground dating back to the Cold War, providing a glimpse at what the highly secure testing facility has been up to. Some military tests involved human exposure to biological and chemical agents. ""They loaded up mosquitos with what they said was an inert disease, an inert bacteria, an inert virus and actually released that on civilian populations in the United States,"" he said. https://fox13now.com/2016/05/12/a-rare-look-at-dugways-experiments-then-and-now/ ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20160514105253/https://fox13now.com/2016/05/12/a-rare-look-at-dugways-experiments-then-and-now/))


- Operation Big Buzz was a U.S. military entomological warfare field test conducted in the U.S. state of Georgia in 1955. The tests involved dispersing over 300,000 mosquitoes from aircraft and through ground dispersal methods. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Big_Buzz

- Between April and November 1956, the U.S. Army Chemical Corps conducted Operation Drop Kick to test the practicality of employing mosquitoes to carry an entomological warfare agent in different ways. The Corps released uninfected female mosquitoes into a cooperative residential area of Savannah, Georgia, and then estimated how many mosquitoes entered houses and bit people. Within a day the mosquitoes had bitten many people. In 1958, the Corps released 600,000 mosquitoes in Avon Park, Florida. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Drop_Kick

- Operation Big Itch was a September 1954 series of tests at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. The tests were designed to determine coverage patterns and survivability of the tropical rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) for use in biological warfare as disease vector. Big Itch proved successful, the tests showed that not only could the fleas survive the drop from an airplane but they also soon attached themselves to hosts. The weapon proved able to cover a battalion-sized target area and disrupt operations for up to one day. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Big_Itch

- Operation May Day involved a series of EW tests from April to November 1956. The tests were designed to reveal information about the dispersal of yellow fever mosquitoes in an urban area. The mosquitoes were released from ground level in Savannah, Georgia and then recovered using traps baited with dry ice. The operation was detailed in partially declassified U.S. Army report in 1981 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_May_Day

Spray for you, but not for me:

- When West Nile was considered a problem in the US, planes were used to spray pesticide for mosquito control. ""The home of former President George W. Bush is an area that was scheduled to be sprayed, but it is one of several places pilots were told to avoid."" https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dallas-begins-aerial-assault-on-west-nile-virus/

I will leave you with 1 unproven case: 

- The Oakville blobs- In 1997, it rained gelatinous goo over Oakville Washington causing sickness for that population. A sample was sent to Washington Department of Ecology and the results were positive for pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter cloacae. Those samples disappeared without explanation https://web.archive.org/web/20150101201741/http://www.kxro.com/20-years-later-the-oakville-blob

Between 1961 and 1968 more than a million people along the south coast of England, from Torquay to the New Forest, were exposed to bacteria including e.coli and bacillus globigii. https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/apr/21/uk.medicalscience (https://archive.is/4nxNI)

- ""U.S. Admits Bio-Weapons Tests- The tests included releasing deadly nerve agents in Alaska and spraying bacteria over Hawaii, according to the documents obtained Tuesday. The United States also tested nerve agents in Canada and Britain in conjunction with those two countries, and biological and chemical weapons in at least two other states, Maryland and Florida. The Pentagon released records earlier this year showing that chemical and biological agents had been sprayed on ships at sea. The military reimbursed ranchers and agreed to stop open-air nerve agent testing at its main chemical weapons center in the Utah desert after about 6,400 sheep died when nerve gas drifted away from the test range... Earlier this year, the Defense Department acknowledged for the first time that some of the 1960s tests used real chemical and biological weapons, not just benign stand-ins... Some of those involved in the tests say they now suffer health problems linked to their exposure to dangerous chemicals and germs. The Defense Department has identified nearly 3,000 soldiers involved in tests disclosed earlier, but the VA has sent letters to fewer than half of them. VA and Pentagon officials acknowledged at a July hearing that finding the soldiers has been difficult."" https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-admits-bio-weapons-tests/ (https://archive.is/8tAQX)

- From a news report in 1977: ""The Army disclosed yesterday that it secretly conducted 239 germ warfare tests in open air between 1949 and 1969, some tests releasing live but supposedly harmless microscopic ""bugs"" at Washington's Greyhound bus terminal and National Airport as part of the experiment. The idea, according to a two-volume report the Army gave to the senate health subcommittee yesterday, was to learn how to wage biological warfare and defend against it... Washington was one of five cities where the Army released simulated lethal germs in public places. Other cities where the public served as unknowing guinea pigs were New York, San Francisco, Key West and panama City, Fla. All told, the Army listed 27 times that it tested simulated toxins on public property, including releasing spores in two tunnels on a stretch of Pennsylvania Turnpike. In addition to those experiments in public places, the Army secretary used military personnel and their families for open air experiments by spraying simulated germs into the air at a number of bases, including Fort Detrick, Md.; Fort Belvoir, Va.; and the Marine training school at Quantico, Va."" https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1977/03/09/army-conducted-239-secret-open-air-germ-warfare-tests/b17e5ee7-3006-4152-acf3-0ad163e17a22/ (https://archive.fo/SSdWl)

- ""Beginning on September 26, 1950, the crew of a U.S. Navy minesweeper ship spent six days spraying Serratia marcescens into the air about two miles off the northern California coast. The project was called “Operation Sea Spray,” and its aim was to determine the susceptibility of a big city like San Francisco to a bioweapon attack by terrorists. In the following days, the military took samples at 43 sites to track the bacteria's spread, and found that it had quickly infested not only the city but surrounding suburbs as well. During the test, residents of these areas would have inhaled millions of bacterial spores...But there was a catch. At the time, the US military thought that Serratia couldn’t harm humans. The bug was mostly known for the red spots it produced on infested foods and had not been widely linked to clinical conditions. That changed when one week after the test, 11 local residents checked into a Stanford University Hospital complaining of urinary tract infections...One patient, a man named Edward Nevin who was recovering from prostate surgery, died, and some have suggested that the release forever changed the area's microbial ecology."" https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/1950-us-released-bioweapon-san-francisco-180955819/(https://archive.is/m8RM2)

- Operation Dew I consisted of five separate trials from March 26, 1952 until April 21, 1952 that were designed to test the feasibility of maintaining a large aerosol cloud released offshore until it drifted over land, achieving a large area coverage. The tests released zinc cadmium sulfide along a 100-to-150-nautical-mile line approximately 5 to 10 nautical miles off the coast of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Two of the trials dispersed clouds of zinc cadmium sulfide over large areas of all three U.S. states. The tests affected over 60,000 square miles of populated coastal region in the U.S. southeast. Dew II involved the release of fluorescent particles (zinc cadmium sulfide) and plant spores (Lycopodium) from an aircraft. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Dew (https://archive.is/rFSsF)

The US also tested releasing mosquitoes and fleas from planes. 

- The U.S. Army recently released logs of thousands of experiments conducted at Dugway Proving Ground dating back to the Cold War, providing a glimpse at what the highly secure testing facility has been up to. Some military tests involved human exposure to biological and chemical agents. ""They loaded up mosquitos with what they said was an inert disease, an inert bacteria, an inert virus and actually released that on civilian populations in the United States,"" he said. https://fox13now.com/2016/05/12/a-rare-look-at-dugways-experiments-then-and-now/ ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20160514105253/https://fox13now.com/2016/05/12/a-rare-look-at-dugways-experiments-then-and-now/))


- Operation Big Buzz was a U.S. military entomological warfare field test conducted in the U.S. state of Georgia in 1955. The tests involved dispersing over 300,000 mosquitoes from aircraft and through ground dispersal methods. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Big_Buzz

- Between April and November 1956, the U.S. Army Chemical Corps conducted Operation Drop Kick to test the practicality of employing mosquitoes to carry an entomological warfare agent in different ways. The Corps released uninfected female mosquitoes into a cooperative residential area of Savannah, Georgia, and then estimated how many mosquitoes entered houses and bit people. Within a day the mosquitoes had bitten many people. In 1958, the Corps released 600,000 mosquitoes in Avon Park, Florida. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Drop_Kick

- Operation Big Itch was a September 1954 series of tests at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. The tests were designed to determine coverage patterns and survivability of the tropical rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) for use in biological warfare as disease vector. Big Itch proved successful, the tests showed that not only could the fleas survive the drop from an airplane but they also soon attached themselves to hosts. The weapon proved able to cover a battalion-sized target area and disrupt operations for up to one day. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Big_Itch

- Operation May Day involved a series of EW tests from April to November 1956. The tests were designed to reveal information about the dispersal of yellow fever mosquitoes in an urban area. The mosquitoes were released from ground level in Savannah, Georgia and then recovered using traps baited with dry ice. The operation was detailed in partially declassified U.S. Army report in 1981 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_May_Day

Spray for you, but not for me:

- When West Nile was considered a problem in the US, planes were used to spray pesticide for mosquito control. ""The home of former President George W. Bush is an area that was scheduled to be sprayed, but it is one of several places pilots were told to avoid."" https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dallas-begins-aerial-assault-on-west-nile-virus/

I will leave you with 1 unproven case: 

- The Oakville blobs- In 1997, it rained gelatinous goo over Oakville Washington causing sickness for that population. A sample was sent to Washington Department of Ecology and the results were positive for pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter cloacae.

Martin and Daisy were close friends in high school.

&amp;#x200B;

Although he's a geek, Daisy did always think Martin had a cute bubble butt &amp; was attracted to the nerd. Though they went to separate colleges &amp; grew apart, years later during the summer when both are 22, Daisy spots her friend Martin at the beach.

&amp;#x200B;

They start up a conversation. Perfectly normal except---Daisy is in a shoulders to toe wetsuit, while Martin is butt-naked!

&amp;#x200B;

She was so surprised to see him from behind. ""Is it...could it be?"" But then he nervously looked both ways, and it was unmistakably Martin.

&amp;#x200B;

Martin in the NUDE.

&amp;#x200B;

And wow, a surprisingly cute, ROUND lily-white butt on that geek!

&amp;#x200B;

Starting a conversation with him was for her own curiosity, but also she just couldn't help this devilish bit of fun.

&amp;#x200B;

Daisy knew Martin was shy in high school &amp; that he is clearly embarrassed at this. She also happened to hear recent gossip from her girlfriends that Martin was actually still a virgin. It's obviously his first time at a clothing-optional beach.

&amp;#x200B;

She did always think he had a surprisingly cute, round butt, and there it is, exposed in the flesh for the world to see!

&amp;#x200B;

His friends told him to try it out NUDE by himself to get out of his shell because who would know him at a beach 50 miles away?

&amp;#x200B;

Martin tries to play it cool, hands at his sides, but he's blushing red, his bare feet burning on the hot sand as he shifts subtly from foot to foot. Daisy thinks it's cute, but is still a bit sore at Martin for turning her down for the prom back in high school to ask out the cheerleader he had a crush on (she said no). She heard he's still a virgin.

&amp;#x200B;

As Daisy:

&amp;#x200B;

How old are you? Are you a geek, or outgoing?

&amp;#x200B;

What is your reaction at spotting Martin from behind in this situation &amp; what are you thinking? How do you get his attention from behind?

&amp;#x200B;

Does he look vulnerable? Why?

&amp;#x200B;

Does his status as a 22 year old virgin make you giggle that he's on this beach nude? Why?

&amp;#x200B;

What is something funny you can say in conversation as you take a subtle but noticeable look down?

&amp;#x200B;

As Martin turns his bare buns to leave, you say ""Hey Martin, one last thing..."" &amp; say or do WHAT to make him REALLY blush red &amp; run down the beach for his towel?

&amp;#x200B;

81,"At 3 o'clock, I saw on Facebook that a woman had been attacked and was in the hospital after an attack by the bees. Parents weren't notified by the school, even though it's right beside it. They're urging residents in the area to stay indoors and to not make noise to attract them. I've never heard of them being in the area and I have anxiety, so I'm pretty freaked out. 

I'm my little sister's guardian, and the police chief informed everyone the football game is still on for tonight. My little sister is in marching band, so of course I'm worried. The school doesn't have a great track record with emergency situations. (Hell, the water gets shut off for days at a time almost every month and the kids don't get sent home. They're just told to bring bottled water and try not to use the restrooms.)

I guess I'm just making this post for confirmation that she'll be okay. Our mom passed away last year, and I'm terrified of anything happening to her. I really can't tell if it's just my anxiety or if I should really be worried, because I know next to nothing about African killer bees. Does anyone have any insight into situations like this? I'd appreciate it immensely. I'll be a nervous wreck for the rest of the night. ",14Sep2018,1

It wasn’t assault...We were on drugs, ok?

 We were swinging on a porch bench of some dude’s house when it hit me. My sense of balance and size vanished. Reality took on a sort of echo; each second bled into the next. Time stopped making sense. My tongue felt metallic and heavy. I was spinning. Then I was looking at the stairs very intently. Then I was vomiting onto a tree. Then I was riding a bike, following you to your house. The memories are stitched together with no time between them. 

Then I was laying on your bed.

Tapestries and incense gave your room a free-love hippie feel that I was adored at that age. Fifteen, by the way, was my age. I was 15. You had Iggy Pop and Bowie music videos playing but we weren’t watching them because we were tripping balls and staring at the ceiling. Things got fuzzy. 

Your hands were in my waistband and was in no condition to object. Then you were kissing me, on top of me. But my eyes were closed and I was floating in a vast expanse of undulating fractals. I opened my eyes once to see everything strobing. I tuned away - it was too hard to breathe with your face on mine. It was too hot. I didn’t want to do anything like that with you.

But your hands were there again, snaking around my hips and into my jeans. Against my underwear. Technically I never said no. I didn’t even know or care what was real. It felt good. The top of my head fell off and allowed me to dip into the cool openness of a spinning galaxy that smelled of patchouli and felt like a pile of pillows. 

DXM is a dissociative drug, like ketamine and GHB. Did I roofie myself? Does it count if I took the drug willingly? Years later I worked with mice and anesthetized them with ketamine. Under the influence, they didn’t give a single shit. They let me do anything to them, even cut their chests open to pump fixative into their still beating hearts. I sorta knew how they felt, from that afternoon in your room. Not unconscious, but somewhere else.

I played it off cool. I played it off way too cool, decided that it was ok. I had simply asked for it by not saying no, by doing drugs with you, by ending up in your bed. Those things were all my choice, I told myself. 

For years this skewed my view of survivors of sexual assault. It wasn’t that bad, I thought to myself. If I had wanted it, it would’ve been fine. I felt like I had undergone a right of passage. Why does everyone get so upset? It wasn’t that bad.

And then as an adult I was confused. Should I be upset? Should I feel violated? Am I a survivor?  And if I didn’t feel violated then, can I feel violated now, 13 years later?

A memory can fade almost completely and yet still leave its emotional skeleton. In subsequent beds with subsequent boys, I was letting them touch me even though I didn’t want them to. Not saying no because I just wanted the delirious closeness. Getting too drunk or too high as an excuse to pass out in their arms. Waking up to being groped, pretending to still be asleep so I wouldn’t have to deal with it outside of that moment. It wasn’t that bad, I thought. It doesn’t bother me. It’s ok.

Did you start this, friend from high school? 

Did you teach me that this was ok?",14Sep2018,0
