1,"I love sitting down to do homework. I always get shit done. Today I sat down to do homework. After about 15 minutes I got bored so I decided to take a quick break. Thought I would make my lunch for tomorrow so I didn’t have to worry about it in the morning. I started making a pb&amp;j, but when I went to get a knife they were all in the dishwasher. Not wanting to go back to doing homework I decided to empty the dish washer. I then proceeded to make my pb&amp;j. In doing so, I somehow got peanut butter on my shirt. I went to change my shirt when I realized I needed to do some laundry. I normally dread doing laundry; however I REALLY didn’t want to do my homework. So I went to gather my clothes l. I then noticed how dirty my room was so I cleaned my room then started a load of laundry. Finally I went back to making my lunch. I then realized I was out of Ritz Peanut Butter crackers and without them my lunch would be pretty much ruined. I drove to the grocery store. I decided to do my grocery shopping for the week. When I was bringing the grocery’s inside I noticed how dirty the inside of my car was. So I cleaned out my car. Then I figured if I went through all that trouble to clean the inside I might as well go to a car wash so the whole car is clean. When I got back from the car wash I moved my clothes from the washer to the dryer. Then I realized it was time to feed my dogs. In feeding my dogs, I noticed all the piles of shit in my back yard. So I cleaned it up. I wasn’t able to think of anything else I needed to do while scooping up shit so I sat down to finish my homework. But then I looked at the time. I decided tonight would be the night that I get a full 9 hours of sleep. So I went to bed. Before falling asleep I realized how much I got done and found it funny so I decided to write this and now we are here. Hello.",18Mar2018,2
5,"I’m a complete mess. I just left a semi alright full time job with nothing to go onto. This was the intention, in fact on my last day with a big grin I kept repeating “sweet freedom!”

To clarify, my husband has watched me work varied office jobs for nearly 10 years. He knows I only do this to pay the bills and am so very over it/a little dead inside. With a new promotion he told me to leave my job and then start working part time when I’m ready. In my spare time I am keen to study art! More so - graphic design. So that’s what I told my last job I was doing and they were really supportive and even said later in the year they may be able to have me back part time...

So why am I walking into another large firm tomorrow to start working 45hour weeks?! Because I am gutless. Long story short I signed up at a temp agency and told them I wanted part time. They said they’d try. On Friday (my last day) I got the call “we have this 3 month assignment on Monday, it’s 45hours doing what you did at your last job, you’ll start at 8.” She even asked if it was ok I I stupidly said yes it was and signed my life away. My husband has now reneged his offer and told me I should get into it and learn to enjoy it (they want to trial me to keep me permanent after the temp period)

I know I won’t enjoy it any more than the last 10 years of office work. I am soooooo mentally tired!! I was looking forward to a break before jumping into any kind of work, let alone now I don’t know when I can start the part time course as I’ll miss the April intake...

How do I back out without burning the bridge at this temping agency? I doubt I’ll survive tomorrow let alone 3 months :(

Thanks for listening to my crap :)

6,"I feel alienated when talking about how I feel or when I need to vent/etc. It’s as if they cannot just listen for a while and agree? These situations may be my own fault; I don’t express my emotions/what I’m really feeling that often. I speak my mind when I’m alone though, in the comforts of my own mind. Overall, I wish I would be able to express my feelings easier, or just have someone who could hear me out.

7,"I’ll try to keep this short.

So up until a few weeks ago, I still lived with my mom. After living with her for 20 years of my life, the day finally came where she kicked me out. Now I’m not gonna go into details, but just know her &amp; I have never really gotten along well. We would butt heads and argue about anything &amp; everything. She finally got tired of it and decided it was time for me to leave.

I don’t have anything going for me really. I’m not currently in college (Took 3 semesters before deciding it wasn’t for me). I don’t currently work ( I start a new job at a donut shop on Monday). I don’t even have a place to live. In fact, i’m currently typing this 2 states away from the job. Now to the point where I feel stuck.

I don’t know if I want to go back. I’ve been working small jobs like the donut shop for the past 2 years &amp; frankly im tired of it. The pay isn’t much, and it doesn’t come with benefits. I really just feel like I don’t have much going for me back home. I have a friend who’s family is planning to rent a house out to us. The rent for myself is do able, thats not a problem. I just dont know if im ready to jump back into the same old stuff as far as my job goes. I don’t have alot of money saved up to cover rent to buy me time to find a new job either. And I havent had much looking recently anyway.

Now looking at where I am now. I currently am staying with my grandma on my dads side. She has been very nice to me through this whole ordeal, and really my entire life. She has told me that she could get me a job working at the medical building she manages, with good pay &amp; benefits. It would most likely be something with computers which Im good with.  And this would be a change for me. I have never had even a decent paying, never mind benefits. And I would be having my grandma as a boss, who I’ve always gotten along with really well. This all seems kinda promising, but I still dont know.

I really only have 2 days to decide if I want to go back, after that it would be hard for a while to do so. My only real option would be to start working here. I just dont know. Part of me wants to go back, for my friends and a home without someone telling me what to do, but the other part wants me to just start fresh, considering I have very little going for me back home. The house wont be done until either the middle of next week or next weekend. I dont really have the time or money to wait for that long however. I cant rent a motel room &amp; I dont have family to stay with. The only thing is my friend said I could sleep on his couch until then. I just dont know. I don’t want to leave my friend hanging with the house, as we’ve been talking about getting a place together for about a year, but I also don’t want to feel stuck again. I feel so lost on this. Any advice would be appreciated.

8,"I do. Somehow, someway, almost every interaction I’ve had with a stranger over the past several years equals more funny. And I love all those random people. 
I currently work retail, and have worked other various people orientated positions. Are people now more funny and cleaver than ever? It’s 2018 ... and it seems to me we all end our random conversations with a joke or some wit. Or at least the majority does in my personal encounters. 
Is it the internet? 
Are they all on Reddit and have trained themselves to combat any dialogue with some punch line?
Is it maybe we as a people have never been in a more terrible world, so we have combated this with more of a comedic crutch than ever? 
Is it me? 
Have we adapted? 

Either or.... I love it.

I want to be flat out drunk and be drunk cutting cause I crave some kind of peace. Some kind of calm. Anything. But I'm not supposed to do that. But what I crave more than anything right now is your smell. Arghh. The smell of cigarettes and you. You. You. You. Come back please.

Update : 
I'm beginning to think I was bad in bed. I did say no to the sex. I was shy and I didn't really take initiative. I know he's been with other women who had better sexual expertise. So maybe I was lousy in bed? Also, my butchered thighs must have been a turn off. I looked damaged and scared. That's not what men like in bed, is it? They like ferocious and fun? I was timid and weak, I guess? Was it that? Damn. If I had gotten over the fact that I probably looked hideous, he wouldn't have seen it either? It could have been better then yeah? Maybe he wouldn't have though it was bad then. Maybe that was it. I was a liability. ",18Mar2018,3

Let me be clear, I'm ok if someone likes something that I'm not into. I'm not into JRPG video games or anime, but if that's your thing, have at it. I don't like Country music, but please, enjoy it if you want.

I do, however, like crime movies. It's not my favorite genre or anything, but when myself friend tells me he loves The Boondock Saints, and actively dislikes Pulp Fiction and The Departed, I don't know what the hell is going on! How?

How does someone like a shitty knockoff version of something and not like the original? It just feels like Pulp Fiction and The Departed are objectively better movies, from a quality perspective.

And you know what? I kind of liked Boondock Saints when I first saw it 15 years ago. But time went on, I saw Pulp Fiction again, along with a bunch of other, better movies, and I could no longer appreciate BDS.

17,"I was in my mid 20s living in Palm Springs CA and me and some friends are bar hopping on biker weekend.

The bar we end up at is packed full to capacity and all night as i talk to random people i keep hearing coolio is there.

I'ts closing time and i just manage to exit the bar into a massive crowd of people. As i'm stumbling my way through the crowd looking for my friends i see the hair a few people in front of me. I hurry closer to get a view and there i am, face to face with Coolio.

I drunkishly say something along the lines of ""hey coolio whats up man!"" and throw my hand up for a ""bro hand grab and hug"".

Hes 100% receptive to this and after the hug we make brief small talk that ends something like ""ive never met anyone famous before, it's an honor"" and he asks me if i want an autograph. I don't have paper or a pen so i decline only because i didn't want to put him to the trouble of doing it, i'm sure people ask all the time.
I can see on his face hes a little insulted and i try to explain but more people are crowding in and i just kind of fade away.

Fast forward 10-15 minutes and Coolio and entourage are getting into his white escalade(coolio is driving) which is parked right in front of the bar on the main drag of Palm Springs.

He then starts whipping cookies right in the street with after bar traffic all around. He ends up rear ending some college girl and he takes off. the girl just gets out of her car(shes obviously drunk) and sits in the road and cries until the cops show up. She gets a DUI.",18Mar2018,13

23,"I've had a long running problem where all my free time just goes to shit. Everything is perfectly fine at work, I get things done, I enjoy myself.

But then the weekend comes along and I find myself completely frozen.   
I want to do one of the many things that I find fun, like playing video games, reading a book, or (most importantly to me) working on one of the may cool programming ideas which are floating around my head.  
A few times I even managed to burn myself out on the concept of watching TV shows.

Instead, I either end up procrastinating (usually watching edutainment videos on youtube or mindlessly reading reddit) all weekend, or trying to force myself to work on a project, staring at a blank page for half an hour before getting frustrated and then sleeping half the day.

I was clearly burned out, but I just couldn't work out why. Why would fun thing burn me out, even fun relaxing things like reading books and watching TV shows. I usually could program just fine on the boring things at work, but the ""fun"" programming projects at home were just seeming impossible. 

I wondering if I was just using all my energy at work, so I would occasionally take long weekends or even week long holidays in an attempt to give myself enough free time to work on these projects. But that would just result in more stress and frustration as my free time just disappeared with me unable to get any work done.

-----------------

Near the end of a recent counseling session, the councillor asked me to describe how I pictured my perfect Sunday. 

And I (somewhat sarcastically) replied: ""Well, I'll start work on one of the many programming projects I want to work on, then I'd forget to eat lunch and work continuously till about 8pm when I'd eventually remember about that food thing. After food, I'd probably continue to some early hour in the morning, forgetting to sleep, before going to sleep and struggling to work on Monday morning. I'd probably end up with a headache too, due to sitting in a chair for too long.""

And that's when I suddenly realised, when I start doing something fun, I have massive problems stopping (or even pausing to find food) until it's finished. 

Since then I've been thinking over all the things I've been having problems with:

 * Programming: There is an old saying ""A programming project is never finished, just abandoned""

 * Reading books: I like reading massive books, books that take me 15+ hours to read (and usually in one or two sittings)

 * Playing games: Need I say more. Especially with open ended games like Civilization or SimCity. 

 * Watching TV: With the advent of modern binging culture, it's unsurprising I've run into problems here too.

With all the stress that these long binges of fun give me, it's not surprising that I'm subconsciously dredding even starting on such activities.  
Why is work different? Because the day usually ends at some point, there are plenty of distractions throughout the day and often the programming isn't fun.

Anyway, identifying the problem is the first step, I'm not really sure about how to fix it.

So I'm asking here for advice. Does anyone have some good techniques or methods for avoiding this kind of binge behaviour?",18Mar2018,3
26,"A few nights ago I had this girl over. She just got out of pharmacy school, so I assumed she'd be sane and levelheaded. We had *okay* sex. I showed her where my bathroom was, and while I was there I threw my condom in the trashcan next to the toilet.

After she left I went to take my final piss of the day before going to bed. The condom disappeared. I called her in a fit of panic.

So, tell me how plausible this explanation is - she was peeing and looked over at the condom and saw blood on it. She said it made her embarrassed so she threw it away somewhere else where I wouldn't see it.

Could this be true? If not, what would be her motive? We've only met in person twice, she's going to be making considerably more money than I do, and she insisted on me using a condom in the first place (though I would've worn one anyway).",18Mar2018,299

She's beautiful, talented, driven, ambitious and honestly one of, if not the best friend I've ever had. The only problem, aside from if she feels the same about me, which I'd like to think is pretty up in the air at the moment, is that she lives half the world away on a different continent.

34,"The subect I'm going to talk about is thorny. People quickly get extremely defensive over it, often for good reason. I'm going to frame this as much as possible from my own perspective and experience.

I don't know what the specific problem is, so I can't give a specific solution. Expecting change of others' behavior on an individual level isn't on the table. This is a subject where telling individuals what they should and shouldn't do is simply not an option. But maybe changing how we discuss the problem is an option.

-----

This is a weird thing for me to write about. Even weirder is that I'm doing it in a public coffee shop. But my screen glare is so bad I can barely read it myself, so it's probably fine.

I had a whole spiel going in my head earlier, walking down the street. I'll try to find it again. The start of it was with the idea that suffering comes from within each of us individually. There is no substance of ""suffering"" in nature, like there is water or air. Internal suffering is an unwillingness to accept the current circumstances, and is characterized in different ways. Anxiety, frustration, anger. These are kinds of internal suffering. We bring them on ourselves through our own stubbornness.

So, how do I suffer? In this spiel, my lack of sex is a significant source of my suffering. To say that out loud sounds so insecure and petty and weak. And I think that's part of the problem. I can't even talk about how much of a problem this is for me, because from the start it gets dismissed. ""Just rub one out"" is the reply I imagine. But sex isn't orgasm. I need intimate contact with another person.

Earlier today I described it to myself as a thorn in my soul. That was maybe dramatic. I haven't had sex in over 3 years now. It's a major source of frustration. It comes up in my mind every morning when I wake up, and every night right before I sleep. ""Am I going to have sex today?"" ""Why didn't I have sex today?"" Any positivity I ever inhabit is partially undermined. I'm randomly removed from whatever moment I'm a part of. ""Will this lead to sex? What can I do differently so that it does?"" I can't just fucking live.

Actually removing the thorn is difficult though. Anytime I think I know how I might grasp it I prick myself on a thorn right next to it. It's not a single thorn. It's a nettle.

Should I not care about sex? Is this entirely a self-inflicted wound that I can deliberately stop inflicting? The urge is in me, the urge to see and experience sex, and to see a naked body in a sexual way. Should I undertake to remove that urge altogether? I could. Would it make me a weirdo? Certainly no one I know would identify with that strategy, but people in other societies in other times would. Maybe our current times and society are just fucked. Our current cultural concsiousness doesn't really account for someone ""not getting any"". Either you get some, or you're a loser.

Could I actually remove that urge? The urge is certainly the source of the suffering. My body isn't getting what it wants, and I spin in circles without a solution for it. The urge is deeply ingrained, and the frustration and anxiety that comes from it is just as deep. It might be biological. One of my primary biological purposes in life is to procreate. To seek out a mate. If I don't then, according to a biological view of myself, I actually _am_ a failure. How could I possibly free myself from that? That comes prior to my ego. I might as well try to never blink.

Is it ok to see sex is a basic biological need? Akin to warmth and hygeine and sleep? Is that accurate? Is that harmful? It _feels_ true, but maybe there's a healthier way to frame it.

Do I need to change my lifestyle, so that I actually do fulfill this need?

I've been in two long term relationships previously, and for reasons outside of sex I'm not keen on getting into another relationship of any sort right now. If I _was_ to get into a relationship, or even to seek one, it would only be to fulfill this need. And I'm pretty sure that would be wrong. A relationship is a connection on a deeper level and for a deeper purpose than just sex. There's commitment in a relationship. And I'm not going to commit right now.

One-night-stands and fwb situations aren't something that really come my way, as far as I can tell.

It's so easy for someone to say ""Well, stop bitching and change your attitude.  Change your ways"". But that feels dishonest for me to do. I _like_ who I am.  I've been told my whole life to be true to myself, to be who I want to be, and to pursue the interests I want to pursue. And I've done it, and I'm miserable.

And when I have attempted to change, to pursue activities and interests and social situations which might lead to hookups, I've seen myself become a creep that I hate. Because I had no real interest in those things, I just wanted sex.  It wasn't honest.

I feel frustrated. I feel trapped. I trapped myself. I want to be the best person I can be. I want to be honest to others about my feelings and intentions.  I want to remove this fucking thorn inside of me.

-----

This is my musing about other's experience, you can take it or leave it.

This internal struggle, the suffering I'm describing, isn't a problem inherent to only me. Others might describe similar feelings to mine, or maybe even completely different and unrelated ones. I divert my suffering into (hopefully) constructive introspection and writing. But others let if fester into frustration and anger. Anger gets directed at perceived sources of the frustration. Those who blame others join groups like red pill and incels. Those who blame themselves suffer silently in depression and anxiety.

It's important we confront this. The response I feel from society about this is ""get over it, grow up, control your self"". People don't use those words, but that's the attitude I feel. And it's not healthy. Self-control is a tool which can be used situationally. It is not a lifestyle.

35,"EDIT: Perhaps I did not post this in the appropriate subreddit. However, I would appreciate any comments or helpful advice. Thank you!

Hello,  24 year old male here. I will elaborate if needed, but here is my situation.

I moved to a state halfway across the country for my girlfriend (now fiance) of three years, before we were engaged. I am very far from home, and from my immediate family who I miss very much (two triplet brothers who I am very close with, and my mother and grandmother).

Recently my fiance and I have been unable to come to a decision on whether to move forward with the relationship, or to break up. Now, we are at a standstill where I need to choose: do I continue on and get married with these problems, or do I break up and go back home, and start over? 

We are at this point, partly because I have not been able to totally understand my feelings about moving forward and getting married even though I am uncomfortable with that future (eg., possibly feeling lonely, unable to share major life experiences with my siblings, etc.).

In my current environment, I am very far away from my family, and truthfully, this would not be my choice of residence if I was more assertive (or selfish?), but this is my fiance's home state, and I love her. I would not want for our roles to be reversed, because family is important to her as well. 

Practically, I can only see them twice a year if I save my vacation time, and if I save enough money for plane tickets. I also do not get to speak to them often because of our conflicting work schedules. This might work for some people, but it has caused a great deal of emotional exhaustion and strain on me, due to the noticeable disconnect between myself and one of my brothers in particular, with whom I used to be very close. As a consequence, I have begun to grow distant from my fiance, to the point that I am uncertain if I want to get married.

Has anyone been in similar situations? Did any of you break up and move back home? Was it hard, and if so, was it worth it in the long run? I know that you cannot make my decision for me, but I am having difficulty sorting out everything while under all of this pressure and emotional chaos.

Thank you for reading.      ",18Mar2018,0

Help me fix this oven? 

The stove works, but it seems like there's no gas flowing to the oven. 

I turned it on and tried to light it by hand, but it didn't work. 

I heard that maybe the lighter in the oven wore out, and that's preventing gas flow? 

Any advice is appreciated, but at this point, if I had to take apart the entire thing, it might be more trouble than it's worth. ",18Mar2018,1

I have had depression for a few years now. I have self-harmed before because I felt so out of it. A lot of people at my school bully me and call me ""fat"" ""ugly"" useless"" emo"" and tell me to die.  It's all quite degrading, especially because I've started to believe it. Later on in my life and this is still how I feel now I realized I was Transgender. I told a friend or two at my old school and they turned on me and hated me for it... After that was getting too much for me my mom decided my family and I should move. However, she didn't know why I was getting bullied as bad as I was because I never told her and my siblings were and are still in high school and I'm in middle school so my sisters couldn't have told my mom why.A few months back I thought hey I'm getting bullied at my school again but I'm happy because I'm acting more like myself with more guyish clothes and haircut. When I told my mom she stared at me like I was an alien and my dad just didn't do anything he just left the room. My mom said it was okay for me to be trans as long as I was happy. My dad wasn't as accepting he told me I needed to focus on my school work and not do anything else on the matter.My mom was still supportive no matter what my dad said.After that a few weeks ago I started to tell more of my friend and they accepted me. However, someone overheard that I didn't know.They didn't say anything but after they stopped staring at me like an idiot they said they wouldn't tell.However, they did and now a lot of people at my school know I'm trans. Sure it makes me happy but what doesn't is when it called an attention seeker and so many other rude names. I also kept getting called emo for some reason because one day I didn't wear a jacket and my scares showed. I feel like I cant be happy anywhere I go without being made fun of at some point. I've gotten into self-harming again but my mom doesn't know. no one does. It's just as though I'm never going to get out of this depressive estate. My grades have been dropping and I've been more distant from my family and friends. At some points, i wonder how easy it would be to end it but I don't because I know my family loves me. I just need help I don't know how to get out of this stupid depressive state. Any tips on what I can do? as I've said I know I don't have it as hard as others but this is just too much for me I'm not a strong person.So please any and all advice would be helpful",18Mar2018,4
44,"We were doomed from the start. Any rational person would've seen the red flags at the beginning but me being me, decided to ignore them. I enjoyed being able to be myself around you and that was good enough for me. 

You were far away from being in my mind until I saw that stupid yellow car of yours. Maybe just someone else with the same car... Nope... still rocking that plate frame I put on those years ago. 

This city is too small. Too many unfavorable memories and too easy to run into people you know. I've got to get out of this place. ",18Mar2018,14

47,"I've been single for 7 months after getting out of an emotionally abusive relationship. It's raining and I'm sitting alone on my couch wishing I had someone to be with. 
I don't drink much and I'm mostly introverted so I don't have a huge social life. It's not non-existent it's just not what it was like in my twenties (I'm 33). 
My family is not nearby either and that's my choice, I love them but I don't want to live in the state they're in. 
I'm sad.
