0,"I’m female and 23. 

I’m low key freaking out but also gonna act cool and act like nothing happened. 

I went to San Diego for the weekend. Sometimes my parents come into my room when I’m not home and clean it up (which I appreciate).. but they haven’t done it since I moved back in which was about a year ago.  My mom is on vacay so it was obviously my dad who cleaned my room. I noticed the trash can empty, one or two cups gone, and the floor clean. Then I look at my bed and see my bright pink vibe (basically a rabbit vibrator). 

 I’m extremely embarrassed because he found it.. but moreso because there was still some of my cum on it that was dry. I usually hide it in the side of my bed. I specifically remember hiding it under this really huge surge protector and cords but they were all taken out and on my windowsill next to my bed. 

I honestly just needed an outlet to tell someone cus WTF.  I said hi to my dad when I came home and he acted pretty normal but my dad is also the type of guy that doesn’t express a lot of emotion. I think I’ve learned my lesson, and will now hide in a jacket I don’t use in my closet T_T ",04Sep2018,0

11,"But I want to be.

Two weeks ago was the start of my seventh year of graduate school. It doesn't sound possible now that I've written it out. This year marks the start of my third year in an up-and-coming PhD program and l'm about to try to cross the bridge to doctoral candidacy. That requires passing my qualifying exams and defending my project to my committee.

Currently, my quals are scheduled for one week from Friday. If I took them tomorrow, I would absolutely fail. That generally results in being kicked out of the program. I don't know how much I'll be able to change that between tonight and next Friday. I've also had to rework my entire project because the region in which I work has recently had some pretty extreme political upheavals which negate the most interesting of my previous hypotheses. So, new lit review, new theoretical orientation, new methods. Basically, a new dissertation project. I can tell my advisor is frustrated with my lack of progress and even he is starting to feel the pressure of time running out. He's a patient, brilliant man with a good heart and has held my hand through a lot of this...but at a certain point, your students are supposed to become your colleagues. I'm not there yet. I'm not sure I will ever be.

This isn't depression or stress fueled self-hate. I'm honestly quite calm. I think I'm a fine, lovable person. I'm just not sure I'm cut out for this, despite my desire to be part of it. Every time I mention that it is obvious that my classmates are, generally, leagues above me in intellect, I get scolded for allowing imposter syndrome to poison my self-esteem. I could also point out that these kids also appear to have a better work ethic than me (and yes, I know that many people exaggerate how much they work). I could also note my mediocre academic pedigree, my lack of published articles and small number of conference presentations to try to drive home this point. This isn't about my self-esteem. This is about deciding whether or not have the basic mental qualifications to be an independent researcher. This is about being honest with myself and having my supervisors be honest with me. I wish I could trust someone to tell me the truth without worrying about hurting my feelings. 

In my head, I'm a mountain of unrealized potential and if I could just muster enough effort to realize and harness my distracted, creative intellect then I could be an academic powerhouse...but that is a fantasy. I've been confronted with just how average my intelligence is over and over the past three years. I'm not sure I belong here and this semester, I suppose I'll finally find out.

14,"I don't have them if I'm dead.

But you'd be dead.

No one needs a dead person.

The entire world is no longer your concern if you're dead.

Why does that matter?

But that implies life matters. See?

There's the thing.

If life didn't matter, then neither would life matter after you died.

In fact, it would matter less, because you're no longer participating in life.

Life is inherently valuable to you.

But that's the point I was struggling with.

If I die, and life no longer matters, then did life ever matter?

And if I have a reason to live, then it means life somehow matters? I didn't have much of a reason to live, so that last point doesn't mean much to me.

Well I was being driven closer to suicide.

I did have an answer.

I couldn't think of a reason why me living or dying wasn't just an arbitrary decision.

My answer was that it didn't matter, so I might as well kill myself - or not - either way, I had no reason not to.

The decision was arbitrary.

And in fact, suicide is relatively pain-free, especially compared to living.

So you have two decisions that are arbitrary... 1) live, 2) die.

Living is very painful, death is very easy.

I mean really, I was giving myself every reason to commit suicide.

So out of any two arbitrary decisions, the less painful one seems like the obvious choice, right?

But I didn't like the idea that the decision was arbitrary. I wanted a yes or no answer. So I dug deeper. I asked myself, why do anything at all? Why live? Why die? I mean, suicide is an action. Even not breathing is a choice of non-action.

Why act or not act? I had to ask myself some fundamental questions.

You could say, ""Dying is as easy as not breathing"" but honestly that's not true.

Because try not to breathe. You have to hold your breath. Try to drown. You have to fight your instincts to do it. It's a very conscious, deliberate decision.

That ends up not being arbitrary at all. It ends up being a determined effort.

It turns out that - for whatever reason - for us as humans, living is actually the default state. If you're hungry, you feel a desire to eat. If you're in pain, you want to stop it. If you stop breathing, you automatically breathe. Your heart beats on its own every single second until it stops for good, assuming there's no medical intervention. Blood flows through you constantly. Your thoughts and motivations are driven naturally by hopes, curiosity, dreams well beyond the realms of human possibility. All without you doing anything.

So even if you decide, for example, that everything is arbitrary. I'm not going to do anything at all. Act or not act... I mean, fundamentally, you're already biased toward living. Not acting is the same as living. It takes basically no unnatural effort to live. Not much natural effort, either. Living and life simply ""is"". If you are breathing right now, without conscious effort, you're biased toward living. And you're not doing anything, really.

Even pulling out a gun and shooting yourself isn't that easy. Even if it's a shotgun with a hairpin trigger. It just isn't that simple. It takes mental effort, unless you actually want to die. But not if the decision is arbitrary. You'd never put yourself in that situation if it was.

So at that point, reflecting on this, all of my suicidal urges went away.

Because deep inside I finally made myself answer the question of why do anything at all, only to find out that I was already doing things by default. Arbitrary nothingness was biased toward me living.

I'm still a little timid about some topics, such as guns, but I don't feel like if someone gave me a gun that the first thing I would do is shoot myself anymore.

Because I realize that fundamentally, I have to ask myself, why do anything at all? Why go against the inherent bias of me already living? It takes conscious, determined effort to do that.

Regardless of how I feel about matters of life and death, at that point, the decision is no longer arbitrary. It must be a conscious decision, and unless I had some reason to genuinely despise life - which I don't - then the default is to keep on living.

I don't know why, but I hope it's the same for you.",04Sep2018,10
15,"STOP.

STOP RIGHT HERE.

DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER!

At least... don't read any further if you don't wish to think lesser of me. I'm not sure that I can handle you thinking lesser of me. But this time, my writing, this writing, is not just for me. This is also for you. And if you know who you are, I am so sorry for my actions and the pain I may have caused you. You likely already think lesser of me anyways. 

I'll begin by saying that I have been going through quite the period of self-analysis. It feels like it's been one unique moment to the next filled with self-discovery, self-reflection, and self-introspection. The inciting incident that spurred me down this path of self-analysis is the realization that I not so long ago came to. It's the realization that I had truly lost myself. 

I believe that the way this happened is that I lost myself due to many things: due to my surroundings, due to my environment, due to the cacophony of the world, due to the voices of my respected peers, and most of all due to the voice of my father, both my actual father and that of father society. Or rather, and more exactly, I should say that I feel I lost myself due to the amount of weight and respect I decided to imbue onto these other's opinions when compared to my own. 

To many it seemed that I had lost myself due to alcohol. Which in a way is partially true, but I didn't for one moment fully believe it. I knew that there was something else, something deeper, something that I feel drove me towards alcohol in the first place. I know now that I believe I was already lost well before I became an alcoholic. But it's because that I was already lost, that I believe I was so susceptible to becoming one. I believe that if you are already lost, as I was, that's when the use of alcohol as a means of escape, a means to further lose yourself, becomes truly daingerous. 

I feel that I lost myself in alcohol in order to get away from myself. To escape ME. to get away from who I had become. To get away from the person who was no longer his own person but a person who felt he was but a marionette of the world. A marionette for others to control. A performer to dance a jig whenever and wherever the world demanded. A proxy person.

This new model for an understanding of my past self and my past actions has been a truly liberating one. I have felt alive again in such a way that it can only be described in almost surreal terms, as if a phoenix reborn from it's own ashes. I've also found that along with this rejuvenation I have a newfound perspective of my own experiences that were previously veiled unto me. The understanding I know now is that it was always possible for me to know myself in these terms, if only I had taken the time to truly search inside. To truly grapple with myself, my doppelganger, my social-self-reflection, and derive from it the meaning of my existence, the meaning of me. 

At least, this is how it has felt to me. 

So now I am here, on the other side of all of these experiences and I have been able to afford myself some time to truly ponder myself and all of the events that have transpired in my life to lead me here. It's been a journey of enlightenment and understanding. A journey that I feel I have most been able to truly enjoy due to the many years of depression and bouts of suicidal ideations I endured. A journey I would never wish upon any other. A journey of self-doubt, self-destruction, and self-shame. The journey of how one truly loses oneself.

It's because of how close I came to ridding myself of this world that I am writing this to you right now. I have been prompted to reach out to those who have been important figures in my life, prompted to let them know just how much they have meant to me during my experience here. As now that I recognize and understand my own mortality, how fragile it is, that I know it would fill me with great remorse if I hadn't been able to let these figures in my life know just how much they have all meant to me.

Which brings me to you. I feel I owe you an apology and I don't even know where to begin. What I do know is that by sharing this with you, and sharing it with others, I have no idea how you or anyone else is going to feel about me. And it scares me. It completely and truly terrifies me. But I am writing this to you anyhow, because I do know and believe in at least this one thing; through all of my collected experiences, if you don't face your fears, face your true insecurities, then they will in turn, one day, someday, eventually, truly, rule over you. 

I firmly believe that living a life ruled by personal fear and insecurities is no way for any one person to live. It's in my opinion that a life like that, a life like my previous life, is not a life of liberty and freedoms, but a life of fear, self-doubt and self-questioning. It's the life of a shadow of a being, a shade, a proxy person. A life I have no desire to live again.

So here it goes, it's time to face my fears. Who are you? You were an innocent unknowing person and I was a little older and had just entered that strange phase of life, the transition between childhood and adulthood. That confusing part of life where we begin to reach sexual maturity, puberty. For me this was in the fifth grade. 

I did not know at first what it was that I was doing only that it felt right and that my body, my being, urged me to. It was a new experience for me and you seemed, by my esteem, to be innocently enjoying it as well. It was my first experience with encountering human sexuality with another and I don't even know if you realized what feelings I was experiencing in my body. I actually doubt that you did at the time, but perhaps later, when you too entered your own phase of sexual maturation, it dawned on you what had transpired between us. 

And NO to clarify we did not have sex proper, nothing even close to it. Now that I'm much older I know that what I did with you would be described as intimate rubbing or petting. All of which was upon the top of our clothes. We did not even kiss or anything like that. To me it wasn't a form of love making but simply reacting to new and unexperienced physical feelings which were stemming inside from a part of myself that I had no idea existed before. As innocent as it may have been, I was experiencing arousal from another for the first time, and along with it the release that shortly and quickly came after.

This experience was not only new to me, but it also felt amazing. I had never before experienced anything like it ever anywhere else. The amount of dopamine it provided seemed extreme compared to other positive feelings I had experienced elsewhere. I wanted more. 

So the ugly truth that I have lived with, the ugly lie that I have kept buried inside, the deep sense of grief and shame that I have had to constantly ignore is that at such a very young age, a confusing age, the age of sexual maturation, I discovered the natural physical wonders of the male release. And I discovered this feeling with you as a means to assist in providing me with that feeling. Also, as far as I could tell, I was the only one benefiting from the extreme pleasure of this feeling. As a result, the release that I was feeling such joy from, felt one sided. This one sidedness led me to feel like a thief in a candy store, for it did not seem to me like there could possibly be a fair exchange taking place between us at all. I felt like I was receiving a great reward, and that you had not even the faintest idea that you were giving me any reward at all. 

This imbalance in exchange, along with guilt from my religious upbringing, led me to feel shame in myself. A shame I've carried with me my entire life. A shame I've desperately tried to hide from, to blank out of my memory, to scatter to the winds of a long time past. 

It gets darker though. Darker in that once I recognized feeling this imbalance in exchanges, I could not but help myself from wishing to participate in this exciting dopamine fueled exchange again. I convinced myself that you didn't seem to mind, in fact you seemed to warm up to me. So the truth of it is, as ugly as my past possibly gets, is that in this actuality you are not alone. It's that there were three of you over the span of a couple of years or so. And I feel I owe each of you an apology for my actions. 

I'm sorry for seeking out one sided pleasure for my benefit and using you unknowingly as a means to achieve that pleasure. I don't really know how you felt then and I don't know how you feel about it now. I don't even know if you know that it happened, and if you do know, I don't know for sure that if in some way my actions contributed to some greater pain in your life. However, my feelings tell me that you do know, and my feelings tell me that my actions have indeed caused you suffering. For this I am so sorry. For this I cannot see how there can be any recompense. 

I feel that all I can offer now is this apology, a very late apology, as it's been little more than two and a half decades later. I know that this is very weak and it's very, very late, but it's all I can see for myself to do. Also, I know that apologies are meaningless without some sort of action, without some actual change in behavior and follow through on my words. So I want you to know that my pubescent behaviors did not continue into adulthood and you can rest assured that they never will. My behaviors towards you back then, my shame-ridden actions of the past, were that of an untrained child still learning the world around him. 

Also, just so you know, and so that we're on the same page I would like to share with you that there was actually a fourth person. A fourth person whom I failed to mention above who was also involved in this cycle. That person is me. Years before I ever met you, I too played the role of the unknowing innocent, as someone else who was a few years older than me derived the same sense of pleasure that I found from you, from me. So I played the part in the continuing of this cycle. It had been done unto me, and in turn I did it unto you. 

I don't expect any forgiveness, nor do I expect any understanding, indeed I feel like I can't expect anything at all. Instead I have hope. I just hope to shine some light on this issue in the only way I can; by sincerely telling you that I am sorry and even though I don't expect it, I hope that you can somewhere, someday in your heart find some forgiveness for me. I hope you can recognize the sincerity of this message to you even though we haven't seen each other in such a very long time. And finally, I hope that it's clear, that I truly feel that my actions towards you were that of an untrained child. 

So that's it, that's what's been burning a hole in the back of my psyche for nearly as long as I can remember. Childhood guilt that I believe I felt naturally and that my religious upbringings deeply cemented into my then child-like mind. And now that I am finally here once again, now that I have finally found myself from within my own darkness, now that I feel like I have an opportunity to start anew, I am making efforts to tie up any of the loose ends from my past life that I can. And these past pubescent behaviors of mine towards you have always weighed down on my conscience the heaviest. They weigh more than anything else that I have ever considered myself to have ever been a part of, as to where I was treating others as I myself would not have wish to have been treated. I was only thinking of myself, and not putting myself into your own shoes.

I do not wish to carry with me these heavy burdens any longer... And I don't know that I'll ever be able to truly rid myself of them. What I do know is that while carrying them with me in hiding it's too hard to even tread water, let alone to actually try to make some semblance of progress on my new lease on life. Hopefully by sharing this with you it gives you some sense of reprieve. I don't know that it will, but I have a hope, and that's all I can hope for. I have to believe in hope. 

I truly hope you are well.

We huffed and sweated; I had her hanging off the edge of the bed while I gripped the cuffs of her jeans; I nearly pulled a groin muscle getting her naked; but through it all I stayed hard, a testament to how much I wanted her. She kept her T-shirt on throughout the initial popping, which is just how I like it..

20,"This is my second time trying to complete my degree, I dropped out the first time. Last year was fine, I read over my work, submitted my easy ass assignments, didn't study much really, but still passed my exams. I'm at a university where the exams for my subjects have all been multiple choice, so it was pretty easy. Last semester was basically the same but with me putting even less effort in. This semester however I picked subjects where I have to do essays and use references and stuff, and I am finding it impossible to do what I need to do to complete this work. 

I have now procrastinated so much that It's basically too late and I'm a little fucked. There is still some work I can do and some things I can salvage, but because I don't plan to continue studying next year and finish another semester for the subjects I've fucked up, I have zero motivation to do any salvage work. The only thread of motivation I have to hang on to is to do my assignments just for the sake of the assignments themselves being valuable things to accomplish. Like increasing my essay writing skills instead of my watching youtube skills.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is that that motivation isn't all that much, and studying at home, I have tons of distraction. At some point I need to tell my mom all of this shit, and having that hanging on my back makes doing anything related to work seem too overwhelming. I feel so much pressure to get this shit done, yet here I am, not doing it. I'm busy thinking to myself ""okay after typing this post, I'll have a smoke (to deal with the fucking stress) and then start.) But I've told myself that a hundred times now. Sometimes I actually do start, and then like 30 minutes later, I go to gym or stop for some reason. 

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest thing weighing down on me though, is that if I can't do this, I won't be able to motivate myself in the future for the bigger dreams I have for myself. I feel like if I can't do this now, I won't be able to do that then. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I kinda just give up and start doing some shit I like, which gives me a whole lot of energy, and then I feel like I have enough energy to do this shit, so I come to start, end up procrastinating, and then the whole cycle starts again. Maybe the answer lies in me procrastinating instead of just diving into the work. God damn if I could get myself to do that..

I think he made his alcoholic roommate his power of attorney instead even though she’s 10 years younger and in arguably worse health. 9 years later and he’s still ‘fine’ aside from a small heart attack a couple years ago, but we found out that for his life insurance all 3 of us kids were only getting 10k each of the 70k plan and roommate was getting the rest. I think my mom may have changed his mind about that distribution but I almost doubt it.

28,"Some back story I am a gay guy (18). 

So at 16 I got a job and I met this guy (21). Think of like the most smartest, independent trustworthy guy ever. The moment I met him I felt a connection I can’t explain it, it’s like the universe wanted us to meet. We became really close friends hanging out all the time just the two of us. He claims he is straight but I Sense the vibe he is not. About a month ago he asked me if I wanted to move in with him, And so I did. I told him before I moved in that I had a small crush on him but it was in the past and I was over it. I feel like I just convinced my self that I was over him, but their is just so much connection between us and chemistry we stay up talking every night talking as just friends. I don’t think he realizes that I have so much feelings for him. We literally act like a couple everything I do is with him. We make decisions together. We have planned trips together. Should I confess my feelings? What if he rejects me? It would be so awkward in the house. Should I just keep it my secret?  I feel like I put my self in such a bad situation moving in.  I get butterfly’s 24/7. Can anyone else relate to me? The further i get into this I feel like I’m going to get hurt.

31,"It’s almost 3 am. My alarm is going to go off in about 2 and a half hours, but I haven’t slept yet. Every night is a struggle because I’m scared I won’t wake back up if I fall asleep. The feeling of drifting off has been triggering my anxiety for months. I’ve been in the hospital a few times because of panic attacks, and various other aches and pains that I obsess over until I am certain it’s going to be fatal. Tonight, I’m having these weird spasms (kind of) in the part of my rib cage that’s above my stomach area. I know deep down that maybe I’m being irrational, but what if this time it’s something serious and this is the time I convince myself to ignore it? Then I think about everything I have to do tomorrow, and how my husband doesn’t like me go to the hospital by myself, but the kids can’t be home alone. Especially since they’d have no idea what’s going on. Then I feel like a burden to everyone, but I also am just so scared. 
  Lately, I’ve felt like I’m not fully participating in my physical being, if that makes any sense. In movies, when people  have a near death experience or whatever, they get pulled back into their bodies. I haven’t had that, but I feel like I got pulled back into my body, but not fully. I know I sound like a crazy person and that’s why I don’t say these things out loud. 
  I have a constant headache, my ears are always ringing, my back and a couple ribs keep slipping out of place, my leg is in constant pain. I want a do-over. I wonder if suicide is just a reset button? Start over from scratch. I won’t ever go through with it, because it terrifies me and I don’t want to put my kids through that, but I think about it often. 
  Sorry this is turning out to be an angst diary entry that doesn’t make a lot of sense instead of asking for advice. I guess I’m just trying to distract myself from everything and I don’t really have friends. Not the type I would feel comfortable bothering at 3am anyway. ",04Sep2018,2

But y’know dad, just keep whining to your female friends about your pulled muscle, it’s all cool. 

I mean last year all he did was throw some sand bags in front of the front door, it was only three bags and there was so much space in between them and the door, it was pretty much just for show.

Then there’s no no-microwave needed food, so if the powers out for days, we’re fucked.

39,"I don’t know what being myself is. I don’t exactly know what that means. Saying whatever I feel like? Expressing my feelings openly? Standing up for my opinions? Is that what it mean? I’m genuinely asking. It sounds dumb, but yeah. 

The thing is, I don’t know how to open up. I don’t even know what I need to do to open up, or what about me is closed. 

I respond to people, talk to people, and smile naturally. At the same time, I haven’t formed any relationships that go past friend—bordering acquaintance. 

Maybe I just don’t hand out the title ‘friend’ so easily. But I can’t help but wonder, why have I not gotten close to people I’ve known for years? 

I know that we’re not close because I don’t... feel like myself when I’m with them. So maybe I do know what being myself is?

I’m afraid of the word ‘weird’. I’ve a bad history with it, and as soon as someone calls me that, I can feel my heart drop. They can call me any synonym for weird—good or bad—and I’ll have the same reaction as I do for ‘weird’. I just want to be like them. I want to be normal. I know, though, that I am normal. We’re all different. Just what is it that makes you call me weird, when we’re all, in a way, weird? 

It’s as if I speak another language. I say something, and they wear a smile. Their eyebrows are furrowed, pointing up, inward (like the shape of a cartoon banana peel on the floor). Their eyes sometimes squint, and then “you’re weird” follows. 


Adding onto that, speaking, or telling my little jokes/light comments is something I am conscious of. I’ve held my tongue for so long, over the tiniest things. Obviously I’m not very good at that, since I am still never taken seriously.

They treat me like a child. They treat me as if I’m a naive, innocent, immature, and pure human being. Honestly, that is my persona. That is the outside me that continues after someone calls me ‘weird’, or in general, when I don’t feel a “spark” with someone. That is also, however, me. There’s also the me that is calm, playful, and idiotic. That is when I am at my most comfortable. 

All of those are me, but why does a certain ‘me’ seem to tire me out more than the others? Is that actually because... that isn’t... me? 

I just want someone to delve inside of me, as I truly want to delve inside of them. 

Maybe I just can’t ever initiate, and that I’m always waiting. 

I say I’m trying, and I really do do things out of my comfort zone.

I’ve been reaching out and talking more. What hasn’t changed is that I can never talk about myself. 

I don’t talk about myself because I think I’m boring, and I really don’t remember anything interesting, or worthy of telling someone. I don’t have many stories, and I just don’t rememeber the few that I have. I don’t have so many opinions because I feel that I don’t know much of something to even have one. There are so many things I’m lacking, I can’t bother. I can’t bother so much to such a high degree, that yea, I literally cannot think of what I should tell them. 

I don’t ever want them to stop talking. I love hearing their thoughts, on anything. It’s interesting.

I’ve felt this disconnect with people around me and myself for so long. It’s exhausting. I want to be someone I’m not, but I don’t even know who that exactly is.

40,"I've been watching a bunch of Super Smash Bros. Melee again for some reason and I haven't played for years. For the past couple of weeks, friends have come round and we'll get a few games in. The first time they came round, it felt like it usually did: lack of control over the character, missing followups and combos and punishes, getting locked into the same recovery patterns. Then I watched a bunch of tournament videos for entertainment and when I played my friends the following week all those things improved despite me not having played the game since the week before and also not intending to learn from the videos. My friends and me are not very good at the game but I was surprised when I started to dominate parts of the game and then of course regressed into old patterns as the session went on.

I noticed a similar thing in Fortnite too. I watch way more than I play but again, I watch the streams with no intention to improve. Yet when it comes to actually playing the game again, I often find there's some improvement in building and tactics.

41,"To the attractive, cute darker skinned Asian girl with glasses I met at Chongqing airport 2 days ago but never had the courage to even ask your number. 

My serious looking but actually awkward, lonely Asian behind is sorry and full of regret.

The way you would catch glimpses of me while I pretended not to notice. 

Yeah, I noticed when I was trying my hardest to avoid looking in your direction.  

The way you wrote in your journal/diary on top of your pink suitcase then looked at me and wrote some more.

Even the 3 pimples that I noticed later at the right side of your jaw. 

The sound of your voice when I offered you my seat so that you could charge your phone without thinking about it much at the time. 

When you smiled and told me it was alright that I didn't have to move. That beautiful smile with that high ponytail. And giggled at my bluntness taken as a joke which wasn't a joke.

You proceeded to sit across from me. A little to the left. At that point I just started looking forward and to the right.

Yeah, I wanted to talk to you more but I didn't. I hesitated the whole time.

I wish I asked your name, number, or just talked to you more at least. Truly.

If I wasn't afraid of rejection of women I like, especially when you tried to give me signs, maybe we'd be friends at least by now or more.

As confident as I am with being and doing things especially out of my comfort zone, talking to a girl I actually have attraction to is the few things I can not seem to do right. 

I had so many chances to talk to you especially in the shuttle bus to the security checkpoint after we landed, 

where it seemed like God gifted me with another chance to talk to you. But nope, I failed again.

The last time I saw you was in when we landed in LAX when we had to line up through that hectic mess.

I noticed you looking at me looking at me while I was looking around at the mess of a ""line"" after these two girls walked by looking at me.

I quietly observe things but the most of the trip I didn't think about anybody but you.

(to that red haired wavy haired white girl that stood out most, besides the asian, who stared at me when we landed and during the bus ride, not creepy to me but too obvious. Hope she finds someone) 

I wanted to wait for you after the security check but I would've been late for my 3rd flight if I did and I was tired (excuses, I'm aware) I did barely make it, 1 min off. 

I really wanted to wait for you but ""my can't let others wait for me self"" couldn't do that to the people who were taking the time to pick me up. Hindsight, I should've waited. 

I always seem to neglect my happiness for the sake of others.

I tend to pay little attention to girls but you stood out. I was smitten.

If I could do it again I would've just talked to you right away.

I won't forget your beautiful face, smile or you.

Logically, people will tell me to forget about her or something like that, but I won't give up hope because I am a that one foolish guy. That's who I am. 

I am aware it's one in a billion chance but hey I'd rather be positive and hope then be negative and do nothing. World has enough negativity.

As someone who has lived a life of depression and regrets, now I try to do without regrets and move forward with resolve. Ah, the regret.

Damn my one crippling shyness that could lead to an even happier me.

I wonder if I will ever see you again.

If anything this will be a lesson.

Maybe I'll get a second chance.

If not, I truly wish you the best wherever you are.",04Sep2018,25
42,"So a boy from my high school added me on Snapchat, we started snapping and shortly after he started asking for nudes and flirting and shit. I told him to fuck off numerous times but he never did, I blocked him once but he made a new account. A friend even pretended to be my bf to get this boy to back off but the guy said “he doesn’t have to know” to me. Anyway, nothing was working as I was trying to get him to fuck off.  A few days ago I got a dick pic as well. So a few weeks ago I decided to play a little game with him to get him to hate me. I’d make plans to meet up with him and then never show. I did this about 10 times and he was still messaging me. It didn’t bother him. So I decided to meet him today just to have a chat with him and see what his deal was, maybe get him to stop talking to me. My friend was going to come with me to make sure that the guy didn’t try anything but I told him not to come because I didn’t want him to get involved. So I met the guy at the beach behind a screen near the change rooms. He walked up and he asked for a hug, I said ok but I was confused as to why. He didn’t let me go after hugging me. He started kissing me, I didn’t know what to do so I let it happen and he then asked if he could feel me a little. I didn’t reply but he then proceeded to grab my ass and kiss my neck. Again, I let it happen. He then grabbed my “” and tried to take my shorts off, at which point I moved away and told him to stop. He was saying “I’m so bummed out,” stuff like that to make me feel bad for him but I started walking away to get to the train station and away from him. He then grabbed my hand and started kissing me again. He grabbed my ass again and whispered in my ear asking if I could touch him a little bit. I pushed him off, said no and then ran to the station crying. While I was heading to the station he spammed me with snaps asking me to come back and saying that he’s disappointed and stuff. I got back to see my friends. I told them what happened and now they’re telling me to go to the police. I take full responsibility for everything that has happened, I must have given this guy the wrong idea so this is my fault. I feel so sick because of what happened.

And I jumped the gun and adopted two cats when we were not ready. There’s no denying that I forced my husbands hand though we both absolutely adore cats. We are living in a small one bedroom but planned on getting a large two bedroom apartment and saving for a house, so we thought it could work. But our living situation changed and we will be living in a small one bedroom indefinitely.

Between finances, packing and planning to move to another state, unlimited stressful paperwork to bring the cats with us, and the constant attention and neediness of the cats I cracked. While my husband helps out tremendously, I feel like we’re never able to have a moment to breath. They both have been difficult to handle. And now with this move the idea of taking them with us to be cooped up in a small apartment makes me sick. 

I love them so much, but my husband and i’s relationship has been under so much stress because of them. Mostly coming from the fact I have been having panic attacks for months and internalizing my anxiety. We decided to give them to our parents with much larger houses who will love and care for them.

And I feel a bit weird about things because she seems gung-ho about our future, while I have some doubts. She's talking about moving in together and marriage, but I feel more ambivalent.

And I guess at the heart of my uncertainty is this question: am I feeling ambivalent because of her, and things specific to our relationship -- or am I feeling ambivalent because I'm generally just commitment-phobic? There's evidence for both. On the one hand, we've come close to breaking up three different times, for three different reasons (all stuff she did). (Generally related to lying and semi-cheating-ish things.) And I have doubts about her ability to responsibly manage money and her ability to one day be a successful co-parent. (She generally is very tired out by work, and tends to go to bed pretty much after eating dinner on weekdays -- this makes me worry that she wouldn't be able to handle a child or children as well.) 
On the other hand, I definitely have shied away from serious commitments in the past -- backing out of relationships once they got too serious or avoiding deeper connections in the first place. 

I don't know if it's her, or me. I don't know whether to stay, or go! (To paraphrase that one song.)

It wasn't. T-type leukemia.

There wasn't only that in my experience though, I have met so many beautiful people in hospital, and made lots of friends, from nurses to other patients. Even in such a gloomy situation I have found a family. Sometimes I'd feel like thanking cancer for making me grow and meet so many beautiful people. Simona, a dear friend that met her SO in train, he even changed country (from France to here, Italy) to be with her and fight cancer side by side, or Pietro, an old man that always cracks jokes, Marco, a half deaf man that even with all the pain he had, he always smiled there. Always. In Marco I found a true friend, and we promised to eachother to meet after cancer was defeated. I recognized love in everywhere and I am glad about this, because of cancer I had the luck to know love in its true form at 17. The love that comes from gifting yourself. I am the living proof of it, because my older sister gave me her bone marrow, and now her blood flows in my veins. Every step I make it's the proof of the immense love that surrounds us.

Still, it was hard, and wasn't for all the awesome people that sustained me I would probably have ended my life, I was very close one day, I felt alone and with no clues, and also sure I was going to die because of cancer, but then I decided, fully taken by a ""rage for life"" that I was going to fight until the end. Took some pencils and wrote in my room ""EVEN WITH PAIN, AHEAD!"". That writing is still there, and it accompanies me. Some friends were gone, because of leukemia or lymphoma. Marco is not here anymore. The promise of seeing each other again were the last words I heard from him. But I still feel his smile following me, and because of all the dear friends I have met, I decided to live life also for them, together.

There were insecurities though, like a possibility of cancer coming back, and especially with my looks! I remember posting on r/amiugly when I had an older account with this same name. I always felt like garbage after being left. But things change. Especially with time, and knowing all those awesome souls in hospital.

And I want to share their stories. I have written a monologue I will act soon to raise awareness and I can't feel better about it. Now I also have met new great people after starting uni, I do volunteering with immigrants and homeless people. I see love, everyday since that June in which i've got cancer. I also raise awareness about bone marrow donations in schools now.

I also had few tries with relationships, one has ended few days ago... But it's ok, if we are meant to be, we will meet again, who knows.

I only know that since cancer I am rebuilding not only my life but myself, day after day. And I wish to all of you that have lost something as big as yourself like I did to be strong enough to wait until you will be able to build things again. It is hard, it's very hard, but you will always be the architect of your heart and you can build the grandest of palaces, and offer to yourself and the people you love a place to rest, which is, your soul.",04Sep2018,8
64,"Just a thought I had 

My reasoning is, DNA is very useful for all sorts of reasons.

If DNA is found at a crime scene it’s way easier to narrow down your search, either you find the killer due to the Baby DNA or the search is narrowed because fewer people Don’t have their DNA on file.

For the Very Very (etc) rare cases where a woman doesn’t know who the father is and they don’t want to give up DNA (personal experience with this type of asshole)

Same with a unidentifiable body 

I get it could be seen as a breach of privacy but I don’t see how DNA could be used against the person. Like how selling data is.

I feel the positives outweigh the negatives on this.

Anyone have an opinion feel free to comment",04Sep2018,0

67,"I was just driving down the road about a mile from my house that comes to a fork in the road, a truck was coming from the other side. I came to a complete stop and the truck ripped around the fork without a blinker and without coming to a stop and nearly hit me so I flipped him off and drove away.

In my rear view I see this guy turn around and comes speeding up to me. So I pull over and he pulls up to the side of me and starts screaming at me for flipping him off and giving him shit and he kept telling me to pull over so I could get out of the car. I tell him he blew the stop sign and didn’t use his blinker. He kept telling me to get out of the car and I told him I had to be somewhere so he drove off.

I’ve never really experienced something like this and what I’m most paranoid about was that he was about to pull down my street before he turned around to tail me. I don’t have a garage and I leave my car out at night. So I’m worried that this guy is gonna mess with my car or my house, if he passes my house and sees my car parked out there in the future. 

He’s clearly unstable, he was driving like a complete idiot, got the middle finger and chased me down because of it and clearly wanted confrontation. He also had an empty baby seat in the passenger seat. I’m just paranoid and unsettled. ",04Sep2018,1
68,"At 26, it has taken me three relationships to figure it out. I doubt I will ever be in a position to put it into practice and work on it, but I hope that you can.


I suffer from depression and often have difficulty going to sleep because I am inundated with thoughts of failure and suicide. I started dating my ex-girlfriend four years ago, when we were both at university (she graduated, I haven't). I was the sort of person who used to give everything to my relationships (including friendships), often at great cost to my own priorities. I volunteered more time and effort than warranted and honestly, it didn't take much effort because it came naturally to me. I do not think this came from a place of altruism because I took pride in being a very reliable friend.


My ex-girlfriend wanted to help me get through the anxious nights and implored me to call her up, even in the middle of the night, to calm me down and assuage my fears. In the beginning, I made it a point not to take her up on her offer because it’s disruptive and while my life is erratic, she had classes (and later her internship) to get to in the morning. Eventually, I cracked one night and woke her up. It was a huge relief to have someone to talk to, who could direct my mind from the morbid to the mundane. I grew more comfortable doing it, with no indication of regret from her. Late one night, a few minutes after waking her up, she snapped at me and told me it irritated her and that her sleep was important to her. I do not think that I abused her offer often, but my memory is foggy and I cannot eliminate bias towards myself. Failing to remember that I had understood the disruptive nature of the calls, I took offence because I had always been there for her and it came easily to me, and it should come easily to her; we were in love, were we not? I was hurt. As our relationship deteriorated over time, I took slight at her inability to reciprocate through “equal” acts of personal sacrifice or inequality in effort. I would find it easy it take a call at 3 in the morning and be there for her. I’m willing to sacrifice this and do that, and it comes easily to me from a place of love, but why couldn’t she?


I saw a similar thought process in my father, when he argued with one of his brothers, over the latter’s inability to spend time with my dying grandmother in her final months. They are both doctors, but while my father dropped his work and dedicated himself to his mother, his brother wasn’t in a position to do so, and my father was blinded to his side of the argument and angered by the apparent lack of parity in effort.


Almost a year after breaking up, I am up at 3 am realizing that we are all playing to our strengths, and things that come easily to you need not come easily to your partner or friend and this disparity need not indicate a lack of reciprocation of love and affection. When you are young and in love, “compromise” is a dirty word and compromising somehow dilutes your love or makes the relationship seem like a lot of work. Play to your strengths and let your partner play to theirs. Together, you can fill in each other’s weaknesses and come out stronger as a unit.

69,"It's my birthday and I'm really lonely.  I'm sitting alone in my dorm room - everyone seems to be preoccupied with friends, already. I have tons of anxiety over the chemistry quiz I just completed, and I feel like a failure because I envisioned myself being a successful, confident student.  I wish I had at least one person to talk to, but I don't.  It hurts to invite people to do stuff and getting rejected - they tell me they have homework to do and essays to write everytime. It's always the same excuses though, and I feel some sort of parasite.

I managed to heal from my eating disorder last year and I've been eating rather healthily and exercising regularly, though the urges to give into my disorder again are becoming rather strong.  Depriving myself of my basic need for food is some sort of sick goal to me when I'm in that rut, and it's very comforting to me to see that I've accomplished that goal when everything else seems shitty and gray.  I like being in that lightheaded world because it overshadows the rest of my worries, and to enter it again feels tempting.

I really wish I could cry right now, but I don't know how I'll explain it if one of my roommates come back in.  It gives me some sort of sad realization - I'm never actually truly alone, but inside I still feel terribly lonely. ",04Sep2018,7
