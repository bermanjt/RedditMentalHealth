0,"Hello, I’m just here to vent a little because I’m kinda sad and just not in a good mood. Anyway I’m a gay teenager in a small town with not many other gay people and I guess I’m just kinda depressed because my best friends all have someone and I’m just kind of alone, and like I just wish I could meet someone who was gay and was interested in me. I used to be in love with my best friend (straight) and I’m finally over him I think. But I’m just lonely and wish I could meet someone. Anyway that’s it, thanks for reading ",11Dec2018,1
1,"Hey everyone, my name’s BlueGreyJellyBean, and today I was journaling about the story of my life. I was thinking over a one sentence summary on what to describe my life and make it unique. At first I told someone my life in one sentence would be “it’s about a guy paying off his debt”, but then he recommended I actually write “it’s about an individual struggling in a politicized world, where there is no right or wrong, and people are breaking the rules”. That pretty much sums up very well what my life actually is about. 

I am wondering what everyone’s life in a one sentence summary would be like. It’d be pretty cool to see how everyone is doing and making their lives unique and purposeful. On a sidenote, I am working on writing a novel about a polar bear fighting against an evil old man eho summons evil monsters. I hope you all have a wonderful day reading this post. Thanks.

Leaving the testing room, I thought my scholarship was going to be revoked due to poor academic performance. I nearly had a meltdown. But holy hell what a relief. I passed that class. I won't have to go on academic probation. I get to stay in my major. It feels like I'm allowed to breathe again.

6,"I was sleeping, and when I woke up and walked to my vehicle, I saw someone had left a mess by my vehicle overnight.  I picked it up and went it put it by the house I knew it came from, which was odd because it happened overnight, but I just *knew*.  The next day one of my roommates warned me about how that house (he described it) likes to ""haze"" newcomers, so to be prepared.  I told him what happened.  He paused his gamr and sat up and looked at me with alarm and confusion, like ""How did you know it was him?  You just got here.""  Then he went back to the game like nothing happened.

Also recently I woke up shortly after midnight and felt like I was supposed to be outside, which didn't make sense because it was freezing out (ice all over the roads, flu season), but I felt an instinctual pull in my bones.  I got dressed, went out front off the property and stood on the city sidewalk.  I then heard two young nervous female voices approaching from half a block away, on the other side of the street.  I stayed staring where I knew they would appear, but without really looking so as not to startle them.  Anyway they appear, they don't startle at all or change speed, and then they're on my side of the street (but half a block away).  One of them (the ""follower"") turns her head at a moderate speed to look at me for a couple seconds before turning to look at the back of her friend's head, who then turns her head at the same speed, but only looks at me for a second before looking ahead (the stronger one).  Then they disappear out of sight, and I hear their voices get calmer.

I stay standing outside, and I'm starting to feel the anxiety they dumped in me.  Eventually I stop hearing all their footsteps, but I stay standing in the same spot.  Every now and then I hear a footstep, a rock get kicked, one of their voices, sporadic and weird like it's so far away I shouldn't be hearing it.  Eventually I hear a door open WAY in the distance, then I hear both of their voices but not what was said, and then I hear a door gently close WAY in the distance.

I stay outside for another minute but everything is dead silent.  A car passes where I had been staring and it's weird because I don't hear it.  Then I head inside, lock up, go to bed, and every ounce of the anxiety they put in me unloads and I'm like holy smokes those two young ladies were dipping hard on MDMA, I've done MDMA before, somehow when I was sleeping I heard their voices, woke up with a ""Crap I've had that feeling and it's awful, get dressed and go give them something safe to ground themselves with ASAP cuz out in public like that this late with ice to slip on all over etc. they need it BIG TIME.""  And yeah I didn't sleep with it at all that night because the dip phase of the trip is pretty brutal, and that's what got dumped on me (which isn't a complaint, it's what I was expecting, it's why I was there).",11Dec2018,1
7,"Today I worked a 12 hour shift. I work full time for my city and I love my job. It has had such a big impact on my life, stressful at times but rewarding in many ways. 

I work with at-risk youth and today I was extra sensitive. I spoke with a 15 year old about his home life and learned of how all of his brothers are in jail. We had a conversation about school and basketball and I told him to keep his head high because he is bright and he will go far in life. I can’t get the image of the sparkles in his eyes out of my head. These kids are our future. 

Working in this field makes me want to adopt children. Not now, but in the future. There is more to life than abuse. So much more. 

As I grow older, I am learning so much about myself as well as the people around me. It’s insightful but can also be lonely at times. I remain hopeful.

8,"Just gonna type this out in one go.

I started college in Fall of 2014, fell in love too soon and pushed that love to 3 years where we broke up beginning of 2018 at the turn of the new year. Within that time, I have not taken care of myself financially, educationally, and emotionally.

I have been flunking classes to where I am now academically dismissed this Fall semester with only 72 credit hours earned after attempting 124, and it wasn't until this summer I found what I wanted to do with my life. Unfortunately, I am now 100k in debt with the payments starting in March 2019 and I highly doubt the school will accept my readmission. 

I have failed my parents and my family who gave everything for me to succeed. They are wondering if I got back in to school for the Spring, but the school hasn't contacted me back yet after sending a few emails.

I have always been late on rent for the past few months, and I'm sinking in $2000 in credit. My current internship says they take employees and pay for their school. I have applied to many positions after being there for a couple of years now and they never contacted me about it for the past half year, and I have tried contacting HR about my applications which ended up all being denied. It's a job I don't want in the long run but it would be very helpful as of now, but my internship expires on the 28th of this month. After that, I have no idea what I'm going to do.

This year has to be the most depressed I have ever been going on a 6 year depression stretch now. After being told about my academic dismissal I knew my life was over. I haven't been looking forward to the Spring semester because I have a strong feeling I won't make it. Not counting down the days to the new year but more like counting down of me not making it to the new year.

And I promised myself I would never take my life because it is a selfish thing to do. I don't want to hurt and betray my friends and family. But most importantly I don't want them to have the $100k student debt burden.

I've been told I look a lot happier this year. But honestly I've been awake every night until 4am because my thoughts won't slow down about how much I have failed everyone in my life. It is torture and I can't take it anymore. I am trying to find something positive about this but I can't see a gleem of hope.

Whenever I visit home, I feel like a failure and they don't know how much deep shit I am in.

TL;DR: I fucked up my life financially, mentally, educationally, and emotionally. I don't know how to keep on going.",11Dec2018,1
9,"I love debate. I love formulating arguments, concise rebuttals, and the goal of persuasion (despite how rarely it is achieved). But, I've got to limit how much mental effort I expend partaking in these discussions.

Even if they are respectful, and many are, they still eat away at the limited conscious thought I have every day. Conscious thought and time that could otherwise be spent learning new things, working on hobbies, or just being able to *relax* without refreshing my inbox when in a back and forth argument with the new internet stranger for the day. Despite how much I enjoy it, I just need to stop. I want my life to be about creating and learning new things, not arguing with strangers.

But I'd be kidding myself if I thought I could just stop using Reddit. So instead, I'm going to start using Reddit *differently*. I'm not going to discuss politics (even though I tend to align with the majority on this site in several respects), and I'm not going to frequent on religiously related debate subreddits. It's just doing more harm than good for my emotional state on a daily basis. It's not like I'm depressed or something, but I'm definitely making myself more stressed for basically no reason.",11Dec2018,1
10,"TL;DR: Found my cat. Cat was in bad health. Inspired to go beyond.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an old internet confused lady. I have no idea how to link the original post. Whatever the case I wanted to let everyone know I did find my cat. As awesome as that is, I was not far off with my suspicions. In between when I posted and a couple of days ago, ""other"" roommate happened to be walking to the basement when he heard, (as he put it) ""several weak moans from the wall"". He followed those moans and realized they were in the wall next to ""mentioned"" room-mates room. As he called out he started to hear yowls.

&amp;#x200B;

He kicked in ""mentioned"" room mates door. He found my cat, locked in a cage designed to trap raccoons, behind a massive oak dresser forced into a closet recess within the room. No food. No water. Between the time I posted and the time ""other"" roomie found her? 5 days had passed. She was basically dead. I've had to drip feed her water every 25 minutes through a fucking medicine dropper. Just today she started eating again, but only about a 1/4th of a can and I have to hand feed it to her. She has not made even one effort to leave my side, or my bed which is her safe place. Everytime the one roomie comes home? She freaks out and tries to jump out of a window. I give her cuddles and delicious fish treats and that seems to quell the panic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now before anyone says anything? When I went loco over my missing cat? When no one could prove anything and I was being pinned as a psycho? Every house plant I own was uprooted and tossed to the floor. It was rude, I was offended and I was still reeling from not being able to find my cat. So I got a few security cameras. The doorbell kind. I felt like a total psycho.

&amp;#x200B;

As it turned out I was warranted. Roomie ones daughter is the one ripping out all of my plants from the root. She was the one that coaxed my cat into that cage for 5 days, I caught her stealing my deodarant, coming into my room and stealing my underwear and jewelry and digging through my things for money. I caught her father (one roomie) encouraging her. I caught her father going through my dirty laundry and pulling out my dirty underwear. WHICH EXPLAINS THAT MYSTERY, I caught him eating everyone elses food, I caught him letting his younger son take a piss on an antique grand piano (over 300 years old) just to ""piss that bitch off""

&amp;#x200B;

Bitch meaning me.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitch because I refuse to be a free babysitter. I'm a tenant just like you son. I too have to pay rent on time and help with household chores.

&amp;#x200B;

But you know. I'm a bitch. SO yeah. Punish me and anything you can find that I love.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this has been presented to the the household and the home owner. All of us are working to reach some peace. Me, on the other hand, well I'm tired of being taken advantage of. I'm tired of being fucked with, I'm tired of being teased and honestly? I'm just done with other fucking people. My whole life has been an after school special and I'm fucking done with it. This last week was it for me.

&amp;#x200B;

My roommate might as well be a big-game trophy hunter. He has no qualms about taking life no matter how it might affect the ecology. All he sees is an inconvenience or a chance at glory. He was raised rich and white. He has alot of guns. I've asked him several times to install a lock on his door as my young nephews and nieces and god-kids visit on the regular.

&amp;#x200B;

But then I realized. If he has no problem trapping my cat and sending me through a nervous breakdown or hunting injured creatures on a ranch advertised as ""AFRICAN SAFARI"", would he even give a fuck about a crowd of people before he shoots them all to death? Or am I just giving myself an excuse to fucking murder him before he has a chance to do something worse?

&amp;#x200B;

All I know is that people willing to hurt animals for whatever reason are people that do not deserve to live on planet earth. PERIOD. Maybe it's just me here, but we have enough problems without bored rich white people killing off the only nature or chance we have to survive, and then refusing to share the kill.

Fuck America and FUCK the evangelists. I say this because.... well...

&amp;#x200B;

We've fucked ourselves and it's too late. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I got my cat back. She's barely alive, but she's doing better now and I have high hopes. If she dies I'm going vigilante and thats that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lets hope she lives because I legit don't give a fuck about any human. Don't give a fuck about any generation. Don't give a fuck about prophecy, don't give a fuck about fortune. Don't give a fuck about politics or borders. All I give a fuck about is my tiny cat. All I give a fuck about is my own personal comfort at this point. Anything that interferes with that is DOA.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm no badass. I'm just old, alone and done with the bullshit. I can't find even a single date within my age range that does not advertise a poached creature that they ""saved African tribes"" from. In the form of endangered species they obtained expensive secret licenses to hunt. But you know....

&amp;#x200B;

APPARENTLY? Africans have never had to deal with nature this way before the white man came around. 

&amp;#x200B;

HUH.

&amp;#x200B;

FUNNY HOW THAT WORKS.

&amp;#x200B;

IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY ALREADY KNEW WTF THEY WERE DOING?

&amp;#x200B;

Room-mates killing my cats, room-mates encouraging me to travel the world.

&amp;#x200B;

All this time and I'm dying of Cancer. No one even fucking knows. For all my drama? The only thing I give a fuck about?

&amp;#x200B;

WHERE THE FUCK IS MY CAT AND WHY IS SHE NOT EATING ALL THE PRIME CUTS OF FISH AVAILABLE? I'd already be dead without her. She will be my side when I breath my last breathe. She's too clingy. I cough and she doesn't leave my side for a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

My room mate trapped her in a raccoon cage with the intent of letting her starve to death. My life is to live until the animals in my care either die or find an actual good home. I have to do something. I don't know how long I'm going to live or even be functional. Cancer is a tricky bitch sometimes isnt she?

&amp;#x200B;

Yet here we are regardless. Pushing forward no matter what. Be kind. Be thoughtful. Be appreciative. Turn off your cellphone. Don't be on your cellphone when you order your morning coffee. Be present, be polite.

&amp;#x200B;

Hell is just a step away.

Okay so I know it's counter productive to post a terrible first short film and then a terribly long blog post about it, but I would like to do a few things with this post:

- im not very open about my work, for some reason. You guys seem pretty responsive. So yeah, I need to get it out there, even if it means putting my worst foot forward (bc nothing I put out there after this could be worse I believe. Absolutely nothing)

- i'd like to see what strangers think (bc all my friends are like ""wow how good"" and I'm like ""how can you be my friend and lie RIGHT to my face?"") 

- and about it being bad, yeah I know it's bad. I'd like to help others who are also afraid of putting their stuff out there. They need to know: literally nothing you do could possibly be worst then this bud, you do you!! But feel free to comment on it. I love criticism!

-it feels like there's NO ONE ELSE I CAN TALK TO ABOUT IT BUT IM SOO EXCITED!!
- I mainly want to get y'all's opinion my my blog about my experience, I need tips and like .. what should I have done?? Is there something I could have done to make this experience better for everyone involved?? What would you have done differently? I'd love to know bc I'm gonna redo this shit, Mark my words.

But yeah. I'm here for responses and what not and I'm sorry if I'm breaking the rules by plugging myself, but check out that blog or the other crap I put on that channel. It's not much and it's not terribly good, but one day... One day..

27,"Was coming home from a club, called an uber.

Guy pulls up, I don't really check the plate too much as I see it starts with the same letter and there's an uber sticker in the windshield (plus it was pretty much deserted when I was leaving).

I get in, he's super friendly and talkative, kind of in a fake way but I thought that was just his job. Still, I ask him if he's -insert uber driver's name- (I might have even asked him what his name was first, but he seemed to not hear so I just asked him with the name included).

Anyways we drive for a bit he keeps talking a bunch being very smiley when we pull up to a red light and I get call.

It's from my actual uber driver, he's wondering where I am. I'm very confused so I ask the guy who just called me if he's -insert uber driver- name and he says yes, he 's at my location blah blah blah. I turn to the driver and I ask him like what the fuck who are you? Where are you taking me? and he does the most unnerving thing, he just stops smiling and chatting and silently stares at me.

Basically the second I realized he might not be the guy, I opened the car door so I would have the chance to get out if he suddenly accelerated but I couldn't even really process what exactly was happening so I stammered a bit about what is going on here and I'm going to get out of the car, and the whole time he doesn't say a fucking thing. He just stares at me blankly, doesn't try to clear up things or say oops I must've picked up the wrong passenger (And why would he lie about his name anyway?) and I get out of the car.

The actual driver is really nice and comes out of his way to pick me up and take me home.

what I'm thinking is that I might've actually almost gotten raped or murdered last night. I can't really come up for any explanation as to why that fake driver would've done what he was doing unless he had some really sick motive.

And the club I was at was kind of a more underground grimy after-hours club that not everyone even knows is there, so this guy was clearly in the area just waiting for a female looking kind of drunk-ish to come out.

I even remember that this guy walked by me and my friend (who was waiting outside with me) while we were waiting for the uber and asked if we needed a taxi ride. When he came by again posing as the uber driver I just assumed that maybe he was doing double duty, but if that was the case why would he have walked by in the first place instead of driving the car that was called?

I don't know. I'm kind of talking about it casually with my friends and family but none of the them have really seemed to take it too seriously, my dad said maybe it was just fraud or something, but inside I feel very shaken.

I’ve struggle with pretty bad ADHD my entire life and last school year (my sophomore year of hs) was prescribed medication for it . I HATE my medication as the side effects are overbearing and make me feel not like myself. While in the past I had never realized how my ADHD affected these past couple of months have been a serious eye opener into how it affects my life. I’m pretty good at school and can get A’s and B’s without putting in too much effort but junior year has been hard as I’m taking hard courses that require a lot of time and practice. My ADHD makes it a serious struggle to focus on school and this has lead to absurd level of stress, anxiety and a feeling of defeat from doing worse in school.

The third thing contributing to my depression is my social life. I’ve never really been the type of person to go out with friends every weekend and don’t mind staying home, but that doesn’t mean I’m not a social person. I’m extremely extroverted when I’m myself and have started to go out with friends more and more as my relationship with my mother gets worse. I try and go to my schools hockey games, and go out every Friday and Saturday night with a bunch of different people. While this has been fun, the high I get from spending time with these people and receiving contributes to my lowest lows as I crave that social connection. I’ve began to realize that I lack friends who are there for emotional support as none them are people I can turn to when i feel sad and I feel that none of them are real friends just people to have fun with. All this makes me feel so lonely.

The final contribution to my feeling is my former    
gf. I know I’m just in high school but holy shit I feel lost without her. Our relationship was going well (I think), but she ended it as she felt she didn’t want to be in a relationship right now, as she is going to college next year and has a lot to focus on. This makes total sense to me and I wish her nothing but the best, but goddamn it hurts. We decided to stay mutual friends as we loved talking to each other and she was the only person I’ve been able to say how I really feel, helping me through some hard times. She truest is a special person and I know probably messed up, but we were so happy together and she made all the hurt go away. Even just being friends was nice because she always want a to listen and help me. Recently, though, I feel like she doesn’t want to talk anymore leaving me on read, making me feel like I’ve done something wrong.  She’s the most amazing person I’ve met and helped better me as a person but the separation leaves me feeling like dog shit.

All these things have lead me to realizing that not only is there no one around me who would care if I were die right now, but also that I have zero future ahead of me and that I will be working an awful job I hate with people I don’t like and addicted to alcohol. I’ve never been so comfortable with killing myself as I normally feel that there is more to life and that someone would care if I died ,but I realized now I would become nothing more than a statistic and some memory that gets forgotten in a year. 

Sorry for the length and shitty grammar, but I needed to get this out as I have no one to talk to at the moment and thanks if you read the whole thing

TLDR: feeling contempt with dying due to a rocky relationship with my mom, no real friends, a recent breakup and ADHD.",11Dec2018,1
29,"I’m 20 and never met him (obviously). But I feel such a deep connection to him. I’m a misfit, never understood, and have a weird way of thinking. I have been obsessed with Queen for as long as I can remember. I’m in my feels tonight and he usually helps me through it. ",11Dec2018,1
30,"Yikes so I’m currently a little humiliated... 

I was trying to sell some stuff on the letgo app... like things that hold sentimental value to me... simply because I’m broke and it’s all I own that’s worth anything. 

Well I had a couple people offer really shitty prices for these things and they offered these lowball prices while I was drinking. I just went back and looked at those conversations and I said some *reaaaallly* mean shit. I called one lady a cheap bitch and I told this other guy his offer sucked and to fuck off. 

I get really really really honest and bitchy when I drink. I feel pretty bad. If you’re out there... poor innocent strangers... I just want you to know I’m sorry and I’m an asshole. ",11Dec2018,1
31,"Although I may have struggled in life to find myself. I was genuinely really happy for once. It was a person or a thing exactly. It was about finally being able to feel like I can give something back. Which was love. I was able to give that because I felt comfortable with myself to do that.

But today, it really crushed me. All of my insecurities and worries really broke me. It's been a tough 23 or so years. I was genuinely happy about everything and sad about a lot. 

I lived with severe depression, General Anxiety Disorder and PTSD after witnessing my friends raped and killed in front of me when I was young. I had people after that I ended up loving, dying because of cancer. I'm afraid of whoever that I'm with will end up getting hurt because of me.

 I gotten help for a while. I felt strong and empowered after all of it because I learned to take my disadvantages and wear it like armor. I was really proud of myself for that. 

I learned throughout my healing process that I really believe, ANYONE is beautiful. Even myself. I believe that when people makes mistakes no matter the impact, it doesn't make you into you a horrible person. Maybe to those you affected, through their perspective you are. But it doesn't have to define you. 

I wanted to help others recognize that. 

Today I feel like I can't help myself. My armor broke and I feel like I'm at the end of my life and I feel like although I've been hurt, I had a lot of precious moments in my life that I still cherish. 

I hope that to anyone reading this, don't give up. 

Unlike me, I don't have anything else but leave something behind or a torch to pass on to so that I feel like this has meaning still. 

I love you all. Take care. ",11Dec2018,1
32,"I'm tired of pretending to save everyone's feelings at the expense of my own. I'm tired of pretending we never hooked up. I'm tired of pretending she never said that she loved me. I'm tired of pretending that I don't love her.

I'm tired of pretending to ""save the friendship"" that clearly doesn't exist anymore. I'm tired of pretending not to care. I'm tired of pretending to go to sleep at night when instead I'm just lying alone in the dark with my thoughts. ",11Dec2018,1
33,"So this entire 2018 year, I didn’t have health insurance due to NJ being a pile of crap and after my works sign up time passed, I was told that I don’t qualify for the state insurance I normally get, and the cheapest insurance I could find was like $300 a month for just myself.
Anyway not the point, so  right before I lost my insurance, I was having some really bad pain in my ankle on the inside of my left ankle. Right where that ball is. It was sticking out and hurt a pretty decent amount any time I walked and I couldn’t put a ton of weight on it for long periods of time. I was told to see a specialist, but they’re expensive and I really didn’t have extra money so I just sucked it up and hobbled around literally all year...which I know was not the right answer.
But about a month ago, the pain started on the outer side of my ankle too. I thought it was just because I was depending more on the outside of my ankle,  but a month later it still hurts and  I’m starting to think it’s sprained
Here’s the real kick though...I get my insurance next month and the pain that’s been in my ankle on the inside for an ENTIRE YEAR has gone away now that I can almost see a doctor.
Is there any way to help heal a sprain without a doctor? I’d rather not still get a doctor bill (my new insurance isn’t great) and I have a trip at the end of January so I don’t really want to be wearing a boot/cast because my trip involves a lotttttt of walking",11Dec2018,1
34,"this is somewhat a rant and something i’ve come to realize over the past few months.

I often come up with these versions of people that is sometimes different from how they really are. I don’t realize i’m creating personas until they’ve done something that changes my perception of them completely. I do this CONSTANTLY and I honestly think it’s unhealthy.

I see the best in everyone, and even if there’s nothing inherently good about someone, i’ll try to rationalize them and imagine them as kind. thinking like this makes me a doormat for so many people to walk all over. 

I trick myself into thinking that people are kinder than they are, and I become depressed when their true colours are revealed. I have anxiety, and i’m always picking apart every little movement or word someone says to me and trying to decipher what they really mean. I go too far into things, when most of the time, no one thinks that deeply.

I imagine people as different than they really are and it’s breaking my heart more and more every day.",11Dec2018,1
35,"I’ve been going to sleep around 2:00-3:00 in the morning these pat couple of weeks. But, I don’t think it’s healthy for my physical or mental state. I thought it was okay because I’m not in school right now, but I think I’m hurting myself and my will power. 

I really don’t want to put myself in another state of depression. I thought I’d share this for those who may be in the same boat as me. A good night’s rest can really make a difference. You just gotta force yourself to do the right thing sometimes even if you think you’re fine.

It’s a little past midnight now so I’ll be getting in the right direction.

Goodnight y’all.",11Dec2018,1
36,"Got word that someone I knew with cancer has passed.  Skip the ""I'm sorry"" reply as they lived with cancer for almost 3 years which is a LOT more than plenty of people get.  He lived a great life and enjoyed the last few so I'm trying to stay positive.


Anyway, I don't have a dressy job, so my suit is 11 years old, and for weddings and funerals.  I am NOT getting fat, but I was damn near anorexic when I brought the suit, and for the last 2-3 times I've worn it, I can't button the crotch.  It's zipper and belt only.  Hahaha, but true.


Ok, so I need some new dress pants.  I know nothing about these except I'm not looking to spend a lot.  I bought the suit at Macy's.  I hit up their site, mens, pants, dress...60% off sale through 12/10 which ended 34 minutes ago.  Prices were still showing the discount, upped my waist size two numbers, second pair I checked was valid for in store pickup today, $31.XX with tax, clicked paypal, clicked confirm, and that's that.  


In honestly under 2 minutes, I solved a problem that 20 years ago would have taken several hours.  I didn't have to drive to several stores looking for my size.  I didn't have to call around for the best price.  Hell, I didn't even have to pull out my wallet.  I literally just clicked, clicked, clicked and they will be ready to pick up in 12 hours.  I didn't type a single thing.  ",11Dec2018,1
37,"Like when I was growing up I would be like is it too big?  Too tiny?  Too curved?  Etc.  People would talk with each other about theirs but whenever I wanted to talk about mine people would just act like I said nothing.  As I get older I notice more and more men the first thing they do when they meet me is look at my crotch.  Sometimes they get up out of a chair speed across the room grab my hand to shake it stare at my crotch and introduce themselves.  I don't even talk a lot.  Sometimes they would look at my crotch before going out on dates or whatever.  I'm just really confused about it lately and I don't know why.  It isn't a porn penis, but I don't get it.  Is it the smell or something?  I went to therapy about it in part and at the end the therapist pulled me in front of the 70 year old receptionist, looked at my dick and did ""that"" grin while her eyes watered.  Like what does it mean when a group of women are talking and when you get near they all shut up and look at your crotch in silence, then as soon as you get 4 - 5ft away you hear them start chattering again?

I'm not kidding.  I've had a ton of sex.  So many partners and I am still so so confused.  I am considering, this is really bothering me, I might kill myself over it soon.  Super likely.",11Dec2018,1
38,"I’m 15. My parents are divorced, and I live with my dad. My mom lives on the other side of the county, it’s been nearly 2 years since I’ve seen her. My dad is a bit of a man-whore and a narcissistic asshole, and my mom has been severely mentally ill since she was around my age. She just recently had a suicide attempt, and as someone who loves my mother, and as another mentally ill person, I’m still recovering from it. My dad was both physically and mentally abusive to her, driving her alcoholism out of control. My early childhood was filled with totally fucked up things I’m still trying to process.

I have two siblings, an 18 year old brother and a 10 year old sister. I love my sister dearly. She’s amazing, and I know she’ll do great things when she’s older and wiser. However, I’m kinda fed up with having to be her parent. I love her, again, and I’d keep doing it even if she hated me, but I’m just annoyed that I have to do basically everything. 

When I was 9 and I hit puberty, the beginning of my mental health battle started. Suddenly, my body was changing, I was tired and sad and anxious all the time and I didn’t know how to act. I just locked myself in my room, and when I came out I was just moody. My sister is the same way. She refuses to do her chores without me telling her a million times. Her mood is unpredictable and she has poor hygiene and dress. 

I try to teach her the little things about being a girl my mom taught me, but she just rejects everything I try to tell her. She almost never wants to just exist in the same space, which is all I really want. I’m trying to be the bigger person here and not get angry with her, but honestly, I’m at my wits end. I’ve got my own mental health, chronic pain, school, and relationships to deal with. It’s really hard to do that and try to take care of a moody pre-teen and a house at the same time.

39,"Is there a way to handle this without pissing family off, but also being able to have an actual vacation for once?

Significant other and I fiiinally have 7 days off with Christmas at tail end. Actual time off other than long weekend or some family thing is incredibly long overdue, years in the making. However, one of our immediate families has decided to celebrate Christmas on weekend right in the middle of those 7 days (one sibling from out of town is available over the weekend). We found an affordable option as a nearby getaway. It's not far enough away to be a good enough excuse to miss out on family shit without causing waves, but it's just far enough away that only half of the 7 days off would be utilized, kinda ruining the whole point of having a week off. 

We both really fucking need an actual vacation and found an option on a budget (thats just where things are at right now), but how to do that... missing an immediate family holiday seems so wrong too. Ugh. Any advice much appreciated!",11Dec2018,1

Which I understand. But then she told me how she didn’t care about what I had to say or my feelings about it. The following morning we go our separate ways. Then about 1 week later she asks me what I am doing. And then this week she tells me that I am still invited to her 21st birthday.  I just don’t understand this whole thing.

Immediately I get an answer, and I tell the person my problem. They ask me the standard stuff like the order number, and so on. 

Eventually, the person solves the problem by offering a $5 Target gift card. I was surprised, I was just 32 cents over the person was offering me a $5 gift card. Naturally, I was ecstatic. 

The person asked me for my email, which had my name and prompted her to ask if I was of Korean descent. I was taken aback, as I didn't expect this question from the live chat. Previously, I had thought the people behind Customer Support, in general, were heartless beings. But her asking me that really put a smile on my face. I said yes, and she replied with her enthusiasm for Koreans.

I'm so below the curve already and I think I'm going to fail. Everyone in my study group is doing so well and I don't know how they're able to manage to click with the material. I just got off a phone call with my mom and she sounded so angry and I felt like she only called me to tell me that she was more stressed than I was so now I have her problems and unhappiness to worry about too. I think her unexpected anger threw me off more than I expected because now I can't study and instead I'm thinking about how much my head hurts and how I'm so screwed.

52,"I haven't really been able to share this with anyone to a satisfactory level. When I told my parents I nailed my interview they said, ""yeah you always do"". Which to to you guys reading this sounds like a brag or a humble brag but let me explain. I have always been very good at interviewing for my line of work or work that is in a sense below my line of work. I've been a PCA, DSP, HHA or something of that sort for the past 8 years, minus this last year where I've been a stay at home mom. There is a high turn around rate in this line of work, so when my parents say I am really good at interviewing, they don't understand that it really doesn't take that much to do well interviewing for that sort of job. As long as you seem interested and don't seem like a crazy person you do well, and if you pass a background check and have a valid driver's liscense and a reliable vehicle you almost certainly get the job. This isn't like interviewing for a fortune 500 company or anything. Anyway, after months of researching jobs that fit my schedule as a stay at home Mom (basically I am available from 5:30 PM and beyond Monday through Friday) I finally found something that fit. I have a physical disability (as in I receive federal benefits for my disability) so I am limited in the work I can do, and I am really only qualified in one area as it's all I've done since 2010 except for one short stint at Planet Fitness. So, I finally found a job taking care of the elderly in their own homes that pays what I need and has the schedule I need. After months of looking this is the only job I applied for. So when I got called for an interview I knew I had to pull out the big guns. And I am so proud of myself. This is the best I have ever done in my 14 years on the job market. I dressed to the nines in a blazer, blouse, and dress pants. I even had my Grandma's pin on my lapel for luck. I brought with me a portfolio with my resume and a notepad for notes and around 9-10 questions to ask when she asked if I had any questions. They were really good questions. She told me she was really impressed that I had the questions and that it showed I was serious and really interested in the job. Also, she had me fill answer her questions on paper and I wrote at least a paragraph for each one that wasn't a yes or no question. She told me that I was the best she'd ever seen at answering those questions. I was offered the job on the spot and I am just so happy and proud of myself. I'm nervous to start the job because I've been the one to put my daughter to bed every night for the past year, but it will be so good for our family. I still get to spend every day with her, but we will have some extra money which will be really helpful. I just wanted to share with a bunch of internet strangers how well I did on my interview because it was the first time I've ever gone in so prepared and I am just so proud of myself.

I dont get it why i dont want to study, its with the hating my self part?
I bet its because i masturbate a lot..
And i watch tons of youtube..
Do you guys have any tips for studying??

And i live in iraq/kurdistan. The only good job you can get is through education.

Its not a country for dreams come true and stuff.

61,"I experience anxiety when my uncomfortable silence may in turn lead to the other person feeling uncomfortable, even though silence may be the correct response at the time. This behaviour becomes particularly neurotic when I go to see live stand up, to the point where I can't watch stand up on TV these days unless loads of people are telling me it's hilarious.

Ideally, I'd like the comedian to have me laughing heartily at their material, but if I can see their routine is not going so well, and they're giving it their best, I start sympathising with how difficult it must be for anyone to stand in front of this huge anonymous void and feed it portions of their arduously crafted mental work designed to make it laugh. 

""What courage they have!"", I'll think to myself, not realising that I didn't pay £9 for the opportunity to administer a morale boost to a stranger on a Friday night.

Nevertheless, I will feign genuine laughter at jokes that deserve none to avoid leaving the comedian feeling deflated. It's a terrible decision, because at some point the comedian will be faced with the completely dispassionate crowd whose only interest is to receive entertainment equivalent to the ticket price they paid, and thus have no qualms firing insults at a comedian who is bombing until they've decided upon a new career path.",11Dec2018,1

A guy I work with is 30 and for the longest time I thought this guy was my age (20) or a college student or something. Maybe it’s the way he acts and carries himself.

I pay so much attention to their wider bodies and muscular structure and facial hair. Their big hands and overall manly aura.

Do you know how terrifying it is to know that no matter how good your life might get a genetic condition will force you to hate living, my great grandfather had 6 kids and a loving wife, huge swaths of land and a caring family, he still killed himself. My grandfather had 3 kids and a loving wife, a large property and a caring family, he still killed himself. My father has a loving partner, 2 kids and a caring family, he will still kill himself.

Sometimes I think I should just get it out of the way now, currently I'm not close to anyone so if I killed myself now it wouldn't affect many people.

I've always wanted to have kids, lots of them, I hate it when people say they hate kids, kids are awesome. I've always wanted some kids to bring meaning to my life, but I feel like that would be the most selfish thing I could do, I'd be sentencing other people to live with the same genetic curse which has affected my family for generations.

And a big deal for me, it would also be helpful for some advice on my situation, if your unsure about something or I didn’t explain it right, just ask me, I’ll do my best without revealing to much about myself as I’d like to stay anon (even though you could find me easily). 

Im adopted you see, from like age 3-9 months or something I cant remember exactly. I only know what I’ve been told. (Adoption papers where “lost” I was told years ago, don’t know how true that is, my mum is my mum and my dad is my dad, papers change nothing, I love them unconditionally, biological parents however...)

I’ve always known my biological mother, but the biological father wasn’t there, not even on my birth certificate. He apparently “saw me” after I was born, which we can get to later. It’s a long story, this is the first of a few posts.

Fast forward 24 years. I’ve never really been looking to hard for my biological “father” because it never really interested me, I was very content with where I was and what I was doing, until recently. 

My dads mum passed away not to long ago &amp; that caused me to go frantic over the thought of the loss of my parents. Which somehow made me want to find my biological father. (I think it’s because I just wanted to know why they keep calling him an asshole).  Idk...

Oh!...

Before we go further I’ll just add that throughout my life I’ve always known I’m adopted, just never knew my biological dad, he was “1 of 3 possibilities” (from bio mum). my mum has been trying to contact these three guys my whole life, contacted two of them, had a DNA test done on both, came bad negative so they where out of the picture, that left one other person. My biological mother, my mum &amp; my dad has always said things like “I never really knew your biological father” “he was in a band or something” “it’s one of three guys” “I don’t think the last guy is your biological father” The “clue list” just goes on and on... 

It’s just alarm bells in my head.. 

I had an argument with my biological mum demanding her to find out who my biological father was. And she “yelled” at me “YOU CAME FROM ***** *********** BALLS” which sounded quiet “attacky”. She was never so sure who it was until this point. When I got told this I kinda feel like she was hiding it from me.

I found my biological father (his social media profile (not on FB, which I always use) &amp; approximate location, plus some
Other stuff) 

It took me one week to find him, did some ABN lookup, name finding, hidden details for bits and pieces. I had a few restless nights but I found him, it wasn’t relieving though as I felt as if I had been “checkmated” if that’s even a word. I feel like I’m being lead down some kind of pre-determined path. Plus I don’t want to make matters worse with my father as he has just lost his mother, but I seriously think there is something “fishy” going on. 

As soon as I found him I told my mother, she immediately started acting weird, I can’t explain it, she woke me from sleep the other night because she thought I had a heart attack? I’ve never had one?... I feel like she is scared because she thinks she is gonna lose me some how. I have no intentions of meeting this guy, I feel like I need to be cautious. She’s being extra cautious around me, maybe it’s just the adopted mother thing or something sketchy. 

All of the doctors I see are all connected to each other, the chick who done my blood test today told me “I know your mother very well, my advice is to let sleeping dogs lie” now I don’t know if she meant my bio mum or my mum. She even told me she’s got family in my hometown. Same as my doctors, it’s like I’m being cornered here. I don’t know if this is nerves or stress or what not, but I told my mum I am going to drop it, I didn’t want to know more, she looked at me, laughed at me &amp; told me that SHE wants me to find him now that I know who he is. 

Even my old dealer in my hometown knew my biological mother back in the day. There so much to it I can’t fit it all in one post right now. I don’t know whether I should uncover more information about my biological father as I don’t want anything bad to happen to my family at all. 

It’s just so confusing. 

What should I do? How should I do it? Am I the bad person? 

I feel, like I’m the subject of two people cheating on their partners &amp; having a one night stand, but the question in my mind is, if there is “3 possible fathers” why only invite one to see me AFTER I was born? Did I mess something up? Is that why they just want me to stop? It’s taken me a week to uncover most of this but little bits has been fed to me over the years. 

Do I let the sleeping dog lie? I feel that if I go further I may dig up something toxic, do I continue? Help... 

I’m willing to answer questions when I’m online, this is my first post &amp; don’t know how reddit works so bare with me. I’m a FB user.

I've practiced regular meditation in my free time to try to help this for several years now but I don't think it's helping as much to quell this desire any more.

I don't think I'm all that abnormal either. I have friends I socialize with in real life fairly often. I play games. I read. I play instruments.

I shared some personal things with an ex-friend of mine because it made a great story and it could further the emotional connection. Little did I know that would lead me to my demise. I attend a highschool, and he has threatened to tell the risqué details I shared to my principal, who has strong connections with my mother, UNLESS I sleep with him of course. 
 Now, he's the stereotypical ""jock."" Handsome, athletic, etc. He seems nice, charismatic even, until you're actually alone with him. When he's not around anyone he's duplicitous, insultive, and threatening. I can't go in dept, that's the best I can do to describe him now. I thought this was interesting but he was too risky to be a benefactor and I got the hell out of the relationship. Even more so because he spread rumours of me that I was apparently infatuated with him, and also talked behind my back, jeering me. I have repeatedly stated my disinterest for him and throughout the friendship he was always the one to make sexual comments so this was, confusing. I have tried to diffuse these rumours, to no success, as he and I were often seen together and I have at many times been the one to approach him. (Though it was for something we were working on and nothing more.)  

So, now the publics widely held belief of me is that I am the stereotypical teenage girl who is obsessive over her crush. Regardless of what I say or do, nothing will change that opinion. 

I have tried my share of manipulation and lies to get out of this blackmail. I tried a variety of emotions-anger, sadness, frustration, but he just stares at me blankly, unaffected. All the lies I could possibly tell my principal to get out of this won't work as I used most of those excuses in a previous, very recent drama. It's bound to draw suspicion as to why so many people are saying these things. So I created a plan, I would record his confession of his plot and intent and use that as leverage, however I doubt this will be easy to do to him.   
 Unsure of what to do.

100,"I (22F) have been having some rough years regarding girl friends. Right now, I have no female friends outside of internet and damn it feels tough sometimes to go through life without having someone to be a girl with!

The first time I lost my girl friends was after middle school when I had to move to another city. I lost 3 awesome friends, one of whom has been my best friend for 5 years.

The second time was after high school when I had to yet again move to another city for university. This time too the loss was big, 9 friends.

University started with me clicking with someone on the first day. We became friends with 3 other guys and the 5 of us totally isolated ourselves from everyone. Now that I think about it, we were kinda snobs.

Everything was great and fun for the first year. My girl friend (S) started a relationship with one of our boy friends (A). At the end of the first year, they broke up. A and I got to talking about their break-up and found out some horrible truths. 

S used to talk shit behind A a lot. Telling me he’s so in love and clingy. Turned out, S was also talking shit behind my back in front of A. Slut-shaming me and telling him I hate A and all sorts of lies. 

A and I were both shocked to the core. It was such a horrible experience for both of us and we ended up getting really close. (He’s still my best friend)

Anyway, after things ended with S, I became friends with B. A new girl in our class. Her, A and I had the best time together. 2 years of absolute fun and spending all day with each other chilling at my place.

I loved B dearly. Even though she was extremely moody and self-centred, I loved her. We would lay in bed for hours, listening to music, smoking, talking about sex non-stop. the 

Then... I don’t know what happened. One day she was in one of her moods and after that we just stopped texting and hanging out. We still sit with each-other in classes, but we just chit-chat about exams and rush to say good-bye afterwards.

Anyway... wrote all this novel cause I’m feeling sentimental. Not only I miss having a girl friend, I’m actually feeling a ‘need’ for having a girl friend, for having that kind of energy and intimacy in my life...

101,"Last winter, I drove to Minneapolis to pick up my new puppy. It's a 5 hour drive, so I had to tell my family I'd be missing our annual Christmas party because even though I picked him up at 10am, by the time I got home, it'd be too late. It was the first time I'd ever missed Christmas with them in 29 years - my entire life. I figured 'meh, it's alright... I see everyone fairly regularly, and I'm getting a freaking puppy!!'

My grandpa, the closest thing to a father I've ever known, died two months ago. And I can't shake this feeling of resentment towards myself and my dog (who I love more than anything and I'm so happy he's in my life) for missing what was my final Christmas with my grandpa. I keep thinking, ""If i didn't get him, I would have had that last Christmas"" and then I hate myself for thinking like that.  

How do I get over this? I know it's irrational. I got to see my grandpa a lot before he passed. Both while he was still healthy, and as he was sick. I helped him move into assisted living, I helped with caretaking, I stayed at the hospital when he was ill. I stayed by his bedside the three days before he left us. I was in the room as they carted him away in a black bag. I was there. My whole family was.

But Christmas has always been something special to me. I think it has something to do with him. His white beard, his love for holiday music, baking cookies with him, the annual party.. I think he kind of embodied Christmas. And this year he's gone. And I missed the last one with him.

I interview yesterday and thought it went really well but apparently I was wrong. O was really excited for this competition because in it, I would've been helping manage a company with other students and I was really excited to undertake the tasks and knowledge I've been learning about for 3 years (I'm a senior).

109,"I started to wonder about the fact that when two people start dating and end up in a relationship, the photos they had taken with their previous partner may still be on their social media profiles. Since I've never been in a relationship (but that's another story) I honestly don't know what people do about it. Do they just acknowledge the fact that they are not the first ones and allow their partner to post photos with them right next to photos with their ex? Do they make their partner delete all the photos from their account? I think I would choose the first option but maybe  jealousy could influence one's decision.",11Dec2018,1
110,"I've been a friend to a girl I met in college. We've been pretty comfy with each other. No flirting, fwb etc, but I can feel like myself with her. I did just rant to her about my mom, with whom I'm on bad terms. We talked about insecurities (we both have issues with confidence), and she told me she can feel like herself around me.

It's one of the sweetest things I've ever heard. I've no feelings for her, but I always wanted to be the friend one can feel natural with. I feel natural with her, and now I see she feels similarly with me. I mean, I sensed it before, but it's so fucking great to actually hear it. It made my day that was otherwise bad because of my mother ❤️ 

There's not any particular point to this post. Just wanted to brag because it feels so good. I wish you all can feel as good 😀",11Dec2018,1

I also wanted to post this because I want to look back at this thread later and acknowledge how far I've come since the beginning of this year. 

I'm doing things one at a time, and doing them well. It feels great. I hope I bring this behavior with me into the new year.

114,"i'm just journaling. don't upvote

when i fail, i quit because i feel ashamed, worthless, less of a person, belittled. 

I see myself as weak, unwanted, rejected, low, disgusting. 

I think it's too late for me so there is no point in trying. 

I think i already quit too many times so i should continue quitting. 

I think all is lost, so keep on quitting. 

Almost everything in my life reminds me I'm worthless or I quit too much, so i just keep quitting.

When i quit, i hide from everything and I suppress emotions of fear, anxiety and worthlessness.

i used to not understand how i could possibly waste my best years. how did i let that happen? how can i be such a huge idiot? it was because i simply quit. i knew that but i didn't stop quitting. maybe it was because these negative emotions pulled me down so much or maybe it was just because i didn't try/work hard enough. 

i can feel worthless, less of a person, weak, unwanted, pointless, but i can choose to continue trying despite my feelings, 24/7 reminders of how worthless i am.

i paid $80k and 2.5 years to move to a place for money, better looking women, pleasure, adventure. i tried for a while but then i quit. the more i quit, the more i felt worthless and became useless. i was fit. i'm fat now and i look horrible. i made a few friends but i lost them. i lost some hair. i lost $80k. i lost the opportunity of creating great memories, doing fun things i never did before, living great things. i had opportunity to make six figures a year. i had the opportunity of escaping a place where i can make $10k max and worry about my future to a place i can make $100k/yr and feel safe. it seems that everything i came here for is almost lost. i lost because i quit. everything bad in my life is because i quit. i don't have friends because i quit. i isolate myself because i quit. i didn't have a proper gf because i quit. i rejected opportunities related to women and fun because i quit. i didn't have enough good memories because i quit. i got fat because i quit. i got a back pain because i quit. every instance of quitting made my life closer to hell and made me closer to being a living corpse. idk if i am dead inside but if i am its because i quit. quitting kills your soul, ruins your literal dreams, makes you unable to have a relationship because you are sad and feel worthless, makes you unable to enjoy your food, makes you unable to watch a movie in peace, gives you back pain, gives you visceral fat, makes you sleep deprived and stupider. i can go on but i think this is enough. i think i'm really going to be a fat, unhealthy, mentally ill, alone 40 or 50 years old with a scaringly empty life if i don't develop the skill to keep trying instead of quitting.",11Dec2018,1

119,"It’s not the saddest life and I’m not looking for attention I just need to let it out 

5th grade when I was 11-12 I was sat next to a girl who I started talking often to, she turned out to become my closest friend for a about 2 years until we just drifted apart. We were still “friends” but it was pretend, we tried to act like friends but it didn’t work out. When we started 7th grade (new school, new class) we went to the same school and class with some a couple friends from our last class. We all walked to school together every morning so that we would have people to be with in the new school. It was nice for a while but one day I go to our meeting point the same time we usually meet but they aren’t there. I later found out they made a new group chat without me and met up earlier and went to school. They said they forgot to add just me. I slowly got phased out of the group that I had known for 4+ years and I was pretty much alone. This almost broke me, I found comfort in video games and being by myself. The entire 7th grade I just kinda hung around I did kinda well in school but I had almost no social life apart from Xbox. 8th grade comes around and I start talking more to Isak and Jonathan who became regular meme sharing and joke making friends with me. Liam and Jacob tabbed along later. Now I had 4 friends that I could talk shit with and play Xbox with. 

This entire time there was cute girls in my school every time I fell in love I couldn’t advance our friendship and I eventually lost that love. This made frustrated and as a horny teenager seeing others be happy with relationships and not wing able to find someone to share my love with I was in a constant state of denial “everything is fine” I said to myself everyday. I don’t know if i was depressed because I never sought help. I never had anyone close enough to talk to about my day about the people I liked and hated. So I got used to keeping my emotions feelings and opinions to myself. 9th grade rolls around and I’m doing good I guess, I know how to handle being with other people even though most of them don’t like me.

Nothing special happened in 9th grade finals were the most stressful stuff ever but I pulled through. That year I also got a job, because I had no one else I could spend the extra money on myself which made me feel better. I only bought sneakers and games pretty much. 

When summer rolls around and school is about to end i was sad to leave the class I was adjusted to and kinda liked but I was happy to be set free from being in love being angry being sad and not telling people about it. I could leave all my problems behind starting summer break and begin a new clean slate starting gymnasium .

I think most of my problems are rooted in insecurity jealousy and being used to keeping my feelings and thoughts to myself. Even when people I love talk to me I automatically ignore what I’m upset about. 

To anyone who took their time to read all this thank you, it helps finally talking or writing about it",11Dec2018,1
