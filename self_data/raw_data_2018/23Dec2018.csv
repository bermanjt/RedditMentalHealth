After my parents divorce when I was about 8 I had really no where to turn, I played a lot of dumb games online to help me and honestly it was the only place I felt normal and ok. It very rapidly over took me, and even to  this day it still has partly taken over my life. I’m still ok going to nursing school slowly, very hard for me probably the hardest thing I’ll ever too.

I sometimes think if I had put more energy into other more productive things I would be 10x more successful. I will never let what happened to me, happen to my children.",23Dec2018,1
1,"We are long distance. Been apart 3 months, and it will be another 4 months before I see him.

One of the things that really bring me comfort and help me relax and fully de-stress is cuddling or hugging him. Holding his hand. Him playing with my hair. 

I have access to none of that right now, and I'm going through a rough patch. I can relax through eating a nice homemade meal or having a nice shower, but no where near the comfort I feel when he's around. 

I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to de stress without needing my boyfriend's touch. There's nothing quite like it. A hug from him recharges my batteries instantly.

Naturally, I disagree with the driver's behavior, but because I didn't sustain any injuries, I won't escalate this (i.e. by calling the police). The bus didn't even knock me down. I just wanted to let off steam here.",23Dec2018,1

One things I don't understand about social media is how self-indulging it is. Kind of contradictory of me posting this I know but if you look at the majority of social media posts - Instagram/Facebook/Twitter/SnapChat/Reddit/Imgur/etc, it is really saying ""look at me or pay attention to me"". What purpose does it serve to broadcast your life? Most of the posts I see is that. Posting of your life/thoughts for ""imaginary points"" but this in turn leads to real life popularity. The more active you are in social media, the better your chances in real social interactions among your social circles (if there are any). People follow you and see that you are active or doing something. It is that ""out of sight, out of mind"" mentality we tend to have as humans.

Recently, however in the past few months, Shockey has been on the decline in his health. They tried taking him hunting again yesterday, and they both said that Shockey was miserable. When they went hunting today, they decided to leave him home.

When they arrived home this evening, they went to check on him. Dad shook him, tried to wake him up, but he was gone. Due to old age, and the cold temperatures, Shockey had succumbed to the cold at some point today. I’m kicking myself a little because I should’ve checked on him myself before they came home.

My brother is devastated. He was my brother’s best friend since they were little. They grew up together, and hunted side by side. Now that old Shock is gone, I’m worried that my brother will quit his love of hunting, or he’ll get depression.

When i heard the bombing at her concert it didnt surprise me, because Ariana was inviting cute guys from the audience backstage. One of the guys matched the description of one of the bombers at the english concert. My guess is that the guy she invited back had some kind of islamic radical belief that lead him to his actions. I don't know. Maybe he thought after he did something sexual with her, he owned her something. Just look up the guys name. To me it never made sense the 'random attack' the media portrayed. I was there and this story makes more sense to me.

22,"My boy, my son. I remember seeing him for the very first time, a little bundle of joy. I was so excited for his future, our future together. I was a father and I was proud. 

During his childhood, his behavior was abnormal. He would have many problems with social cues, he would always act out. Screaming, yelling, often hitting me and his mother and sometimes his younger sister. We were never okay with the violence and we tried to teach him, but it was like he couldn't learn. At age 9, he was diagnosed with Asperger's.

It explained a lot about him. And it changed how we had to parent him. We had so much that we had to learn, so many struggles. Raising an atypical child is never easy. And we tried our best, educating ourselves on autism, taking him for ABA therapies. And for a moment it felt like he was getting better. 

When he was 12 years old, he started going through puberty. He would watch porn and masturbate, often in plain sight. He didn't understand that masturbation was something private. To this day, I do not know if it was his asperger's or his fetish. 

My daughter would often complain about her clothes being stretched out. That they felt too loose and for the longest time, we had no reason why. Despite his openness with masturbation, he kept his crossdressing a secret for months. When I finally caught him dressing in his sister's clothes, I asked for a reason. I asked if he enjoyed wearing girl's clothing and if he wanted, his mother could take him shopping.

It was then when he ""came out"", telling us that he was transgender. That he felt like he was a girl trapped in a boy's body. And initially, we were supportive. Me and my wife, we were very progressive. We were huge supporters of the LGBT community. Sure, I might have missed having a son. I would never have a real son to do father-son things with. But I reminded myself that it wasn't about me. It was about my daughter, my daughter who was so brave. Who trusted us with her deepest secret and wanted us to help her become who she felt she was inside.

His transition was not an easy stage for us. It might have been more difficult than when we learned he had Asperger's. He was always in a rush. He wanted to put his transition first, as if it were the only thing he cared about. Even though we supported him, we wanted to take it slow. We didn't want him to regret his transition. After seeing gender therapists, he got a referral to an endocrinologist. He was later approved to start hormone blockers and eventually estrogen at the age of 13.

We got many calls from our school. It wasn't exactly the most tolerable place and my son did not make it easy for them. He would often use the female bathrooms and made many girls uncomfortable. We tried to explain to him while he felt like a girl, he still looked like a boy. That he should respect other girls and try to understand boundaries. Boundaries, it's something that he's always struggled with, something he never understood. He never knew when he was pushing too far, and maybe I was to blame.

At his new high school, things were slightly better, or so we thought. They had a wonderful unisex bathroom that was open specifically for trans or genderqueer individuals. He was encouraged to use this bathroom but often insisted on using the girl's bathroom instead. Again, the school had many complaints. But this time, other parents got involved. They called my son nasty things, pervert, predator. I defended him at the time, but maybe I shouldn't have. After all it was true. Not only did he use the girl's bathroom but he often took pictures of other girls. He was said to peek under the stalls because he enjoyed making girls scream. 

I had a chat with him. I criticized his behavior, I told him how terrible it was but he told me that I was being transphobic. How I somehow disliked trans people because of his appalling actions. We pulled him out of school after these incidents and started home schooling him.

My son, he identified as a lesbian. A transbian to be exact. He would chat with many women online. Something we weren't aware of until much later. He would often send them unsolicited penis pictures and pictures of his breasts. During an argument about his hygiene (he often did not shower or take care of himself), my wife took away his phone. She then looked through it and was horrified to see what she found. When we confronted him, he told us how lonely he was at home. How he had no friends. How it was unfair that we were keeping him confined, that he wanted to go back to school. He wanted love, he wanted a life of an average teenage girl. And we wanted that for him too. But he just made it so difficult. 

My daughter (actual daughter) came out as a lesbian when she was 14. And we were happy for her and glad that she trusted us enough to confide in us. Our son was not happy. He complained about how she was just copying him, how he was an actual lesbian and she just wanted attention. I must add that we weren't very fair to our daughter. Having a child on the spectrum means that we had to spend so much more time with him, and she often felt left out. Not that I believed what my son was saying of course. We told him to respect his sister's orientation. And that's exactly what he did, with a slur. Dyke. He called her a dyke.

It was something that deeply hurt her. And she was right, it was a homophobic slur. We were okay with him calling himself a dyke. Reclaiming slurs, it wasn't something we agreed with but we accepted. But his sister? Completely out of the question! We tried explaining, reasoning. But he kept using it to insult her.

He returned back to school when he was 15. A new school this time, a private school. A school I hoped could help him with his behaviors, as the teachers there were specialized in dealing with transgender teens. And they did help him. But in the wrong way. They encouraged his toxic behaviors, reversed so much of our parenting, so much that we tried to teach him. He was taught that it was okay to use the girl's bathroom even if other girls were uncomfortable because it was his identity, where he belonged. 

It was also at that time that he started to take care of himself and his body. We saw it as a sign of hope. His depression was getting better. And soon he would be back to normal. Or as normal as a transgender ""girl"" with asperger's could be anyways. But him getting better, it was only for one reason. He wanted to get laid. He wanted a girlfriend and nobody liked him before. I doubt it was because of his looks though. It was his toxic personality that drove girls away.

He prided himself on becoming a ""slut"". He started wearing very revealing and tight clothing, clothing that would show off his bulge. Clothing that would make everybody feel uncomfortable. We didn't want to shame his sexual awakening but this was not okay. The school's dress code was very liberal and they often ignored dress code violations. So he showed up at school in the skimpiest clothing possible, despite our efforts. I know that it's misogynistic to say that girls should adhere to a dress code because of boys who get distracted. But he is not a girl!  And what he was wearing clearly showed that he had a penis! And this wasn't only distracting, this was sexual. He took pride in showing off his “girldick” because it wasn’t something he thought he should hide.

His fetishes continued to become more extreme. He often browsed transgender forums that encouraged his behavior. And then started his transition to a ""catgirl"". He ordered a cat ear headband and wore it everyday. He also bought a cat tail which was the one thing that the school did not allow him to wear (Thank God for that!) He bought a spiked collar and he would wear them as well. And some poor girl who we never met, she fell for him. 

They broke up about a week or so after they started dating and he was devastated. And that's when he attempted suicide. Wrote a note about how transphobic the world was. How lesbians are all transphobic and how he hated them all. How he would never be happy so there was no point of living. My son, he's always been impulsive. And he chose to overdose on vitamins. I don't know if it was a cry for help or if he was serious about it. But we brought him to a hospital where he received help for his issues. To the best of the doctor's abilities because my son is just difficult.

After he got out of the hospital, he became moody and angry again. Not seemingly happy like he was in the past few months. Especially when his sister got a girlfriend, who she dated for months. He was jealous, so jealous. And his jealousy got the best of him. 

But he wasn't jealous of his sister's. He was jealous of his sister's girlfriend. We should have noticed. How maybe dressing up in his sister's clothing wasn't completely about his identity. Maybe it was about his attraction for his sister. 

My wife called me at work to tell me that something happened. Knowing it was urgent because she never calls me at work, I rushed home. My daughter was crying while my son was gone, nowhere to be found. She told us about how he corned her. How he pulled out his penis, and told her to suck on his girldick. And when she told him no, he called her terf scum. He told her how all transphobes deserved to die and he assaulted her. Violently. Both sexually and physically. I was horrified because I was never prepared for this. My son raping my daughter, how should any father handle that? I'll admit, I've been a horrible father. An enabler. But my daughter, she was always the perfect one. The girl that my son would never be. And because of his jealousy, he violated her in the worst possible way.

I couldn't deal with this. My wife, she blamed me. She told me I didn't do enough and I agree. I didn't know what to do. I'm just not good with emotions. I didn't know how to deal with my daughter being raped, I didn't know how to deal with my son. My daughter, she said she didn't want to report it. She cares so deeply for her brother, even after everything he's done. But she doesn't feel safe around him. 

I am at a complete loss right now. He's currently in a psychiatric hospital and we're unsure about the next steps. My baby boy, who I loved so much. Who I saw such a bright future for. How could I have failed as a father? How could my son come out so wrong? I don't want him living under my roof anymore. I'm a terrible father and he - he was my greatest failure. I did this. I was too focused on work, too focused on smaller issues that he had. I never really saw the big picture. But I'm sure of one thing. My ""trans daughter"" is an autogynephile. He has never been a girl and it was all some twisted fetish for him. I failed to protect my daughter from him, but I will protect other women from him. He has been begging for a gender marker change and our physician approved of it. But we haven't had the time to follow up. But knowing what could happen to him next, I'm not going to support him being placed with vulnerable women. He is a man, and he needs to face what he's done as a man. ",23Dec2018,1
23,"Kaitlyn has a best guy friend who is a 23 year old shy boy who has never been intimate with any girl before. He's not muscular, not fat, not skinny. Just average shape and although they are strictly friends she always thought he had a cute, round butt. He tells her he needs to do something DRASTIC to get over his shyness FAST, and she suggests that he visits a nudist colony for a week to ""get out of his shell"" (and his clothes lol).

She drives him there to drop him off and walks up to the front desk with him. Once he arrives to check in, the pretty (and fully clothed) girl at the front desk says ""Okay, you're all set. Now strip.""

""Right here?""

""Yup. Nobody enters with any clothes on. Please hand them over.""

He turns to his friend helplessly. She smirks and says ""You heard her. Might as well practice being seen by me.""

He blushes red, reluctantly removes all his clothes and folds them up into a neat pile, awkwardly stands holding his clothes in that neat pile in front of himself to shield his privates, until YANK! The receptionist, with no expression on her face, rips the clothes he's holding in front of him away from him in a business-like fashion and locks them in a safe. He GASPS out loud, as his smaller-than-average package is now exposed to his friend, who tries to hide her laughter. Not wanting to outright cover his package in fear, he then turns his butt towards her as he stands facing away from his friend towards the front desk as the receptionist takes seemingly FOREVER to find his room key, then once he has it, his friend gives him a slap on the tush, he YELPS out loud in shock, and runs his bouncing white buns into the sunshine to find his room in the outdoor colony across the grass.

Here are my questions:

1. As the girl in question, what would you find funniest about this whole scene?

2. Does the fact that he hasn't been physical with any girl make this situation funnier to you, and if so, why?

3. Is the receptionist's business-as-usual non-caring approach funny in the way she rips away his pile of clothes and exposes his manhood to his best friend? If so, why?

4. As he is about to run to his room, is it funnier if she gives him a playful little smack on the bare butt (medium force only, like a 5 out of 10) or if she gives leans back and really gives those unprotected buns a really hard ****SLAP**** right across both cheeks, and why is it funnier?

5. And finally, after she slaps his butt and he YELPS out loud, what are a few funny things she can yell to tease him as he's running away into the sunshine?

26,"Hi, everyone – quick question here. So I met a girl about a month ago on a dating app. We hung out six times or so before she broke it off, which I was disappointed with, but it is what it is. I've been finding myself missing her since, but not in a romantic/wish-I-was-still-dating-her way. We shared a whole bunch of interests, and multiple times I've found myself wanting to share a funny video or cool song or other general conversation piece, in the same way I'd do with my male friends. 

We haven't spoken since she ended it, and I'm wondering if it would be considered acceptable to try to restart things in a completely platonic sense. I'm confident that I would be able to keep it that way, as I could sense that the ""passion"" wasn't quite there, on my part as well as hers. It would just be nice to have someone I could catch a show or a movie or go to trivia with – a friend, you know?

My initial instinct was and still is that I should refrain from reaching out, as she didn't specifically bring up the option of being ""just friends."" But would it be acceptable to inquire?

He's a good man, but, every time I look at him, all I can see is him yelling and screaming at me for some little thing or telling me to ""remember my place"" if i ever had the guts to defend myself. I feel like massive part of my personality comes from the conflict avoidance/de-escalation skills I developed just to survive living with him. This was all 15-20 years ago, he's been better since, but this isn't something i can just forget. 

Anyway... Long story long, I have no issue removing him completely from my life (been financially independent for the better part of a decade), but i keep getting this nagging feeling that I owe him something for all the time, money, and effort he and my Mom put into me.

28,"So I’ve been into this guy for a while but right now we’re just friends. Our relationship is pretty platonic right now. He’s really oblivious when it comes to things like this since he’s kind of innocent but I don’t want to say I like him because I’m happy with our friendship right now. We have met each other’s parents and seem to approve of us being friends. We have a lot in common culturally and interests but like I said, it’s strictly platonic right now. But a mutual friend of ours told me that he doesn’t really open up to anyone but me and I’m not too sure if he just sees me as a really good girl friend or anything more than that.

But last night this guy and I started sc-ing and went into deep thoughts and convos. He opened up a lot and kind of confessed that he was interested in me. But he then revealed later on that he’s had girl issues In the problem and usually got friendzoned in the end.

I moved out in August. I still struggle when my housemates are gone in the evenings, but having a support system and learning how to cope when I AM alone has helped me so much. Undoing years of abuse is so so hard, and I’m just glad that I have people there for me while I work on doing so. They’ve become my friends more than anything else. We’ll sit for hours talking and laughing.

36,"Ok I thought I would put this out here for everyone to know.

Just a backstory first...

I have epilepsy, I am what neurologists would consider a ""high risk"" epileptic because I have generalized Tonic Clonic or Grand Mal seizures. I also have partial-onset seizures and cluster seizures as well. Doctors couldn't find out why the seizures started.

I started having seizures when I was only 9 years old. I'm 29 now. It started off just with one tonic Clonic seizure a year, and maybe 10 to 20 partial-onset seizures a month, no cluster seizures. 

The neurologist I was seeing told my mother that my seizures would either stop all together or increase dramatically when I hit puberty. I got the bad end of the deal. 

I started having numerous tonic Clonic seizures a week and a partial-onset at least every 30 seconds along with cluster seizures every day. 

I started seeing a neurosurgeon not a Neurologist and was put on medication after medication. None of them stopped or slowed the amount of seizures I was having. He would just put me one one max out the amount I could take then put me on another. 

I've been on at least 19 medications. Now I take 3 different medications just to keep me seizure free for at least a month. 

But this isn't why I'm writing this. People have always treated me different because of my epilepsy some even thought it made me mentally challenged. It took me years to explain to them that it has nothing to do with my mental capability. But none the less I was still treated like a nuclear bomb that was going to explode. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is don't treat someone with epilepsy any different then you would anyone else because there is nothing wrong with them except they have seizures. Yes we have memory issues but honestly who doesn't? 

Don't assume what could send a epileptic into a seizure, if you aren't sure just ask. I had friends that didn't want to take me out night clubbing because of the lights they assumed they would make me have a seizure I had to explain the type of lights that cause my seizures (which differ from epileptic to epileptic) I actually had to put it in Lehman's terms to get them to understand. 

Another is for the sake of god don't assume what to do when a person is having a seizure please ask the epileptic what you should do.

38,"2 nights ago I was drinking by myself. I went from vodka, to coffee, while taking up smoking after quitting for a week, etc.

I was still up at like 5am and I started getting super paranoid about there being a gas leak. I started opening all the windows and left them open for a while before remembering that it was pouring rain and therefore a terrible idea to have the windows open like that, like the though never occurred to me.

I then got a splitting head ache and it hurt to see any light whatsoever, while still feeling super anxious and paranoid. I eventually fell asleep and woke up at like 3pm.

Anyway I have been feeling ridiculously off and super confused feeling.

I’m a 25 year old male with a drug problem. Let’s start there. I developed a love interest off and on for about 7 months. Out of nowhere love interest reappears and tells me she loves me. Leads to the best weekend of my life. Fast forward two weeks. Two dates cancelled, so I go ahead and just politely ask and reassure that I’m completely fine with being just friends. Out of fucking nowhere an angel falls out of the sky and ask me to call and talk her through a piercing she was trying to do. This leads to nearly non stop messaging and calling. I’m holding conversations for hours and I’m smiling at the phone like an idiot. She has me feeling like I’m falling for someone for the first time. And I never develop relations over the phone.

46,"I woke up this morning feeling absolutely miserable. I don't know why but I'm close to tears just writing this down. A lot of shit is happening right now, and most days I'm fairly ok with dealing with it. But today I just broke down, because I so badly wanted to go back to being a child. Tbh, my childhood wasn't easy - or rather I spent too much time focusing on the fact that I was severely bullied or that I was under a lot of pressure to get straight A's, to never want to go back to being a child - but I just recalled, this morning, those fleeting moments when I was actually happy. Like a strong kind of happy. I don't know how to explain it. Like when you turn up at school before everyone else and feeling a sort of bliss in the quietude. Or just standing by a tree, listening to the rustle of the leaves in the cool breeze. But all I know is that I don't feel that now, or if I ever will. I regret not having atleast tried to enjoy my childhood. I'm getting waves of that feeling wash over me as I write this down. What was the point of having slogged to get all A's and those degrees when I haven't been able to get a job at all? Why did I get so upset and depressed over the bullying when I should've just like tried to find some hobby to immerse myself in? I wish I had enjoyed my childhood more.

It's hard when you get this feeling that nothing good can ever happen to you. Like you can only ever have lows or at the least just some sort of a static, numb state. That you can never for once have things work out for you or can never have a 'high.' And what's worse, I should be over this or more mature about this, because I'm in my 20s now.

48,"Hi r/self, it's time for 5 am ramblings of someone on winter break and so has no structure to their life right now and is spiraling. Sorry if any of this is written weirdly. I'm not going to be reading it over before posting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some background I guess. I've struggled with depression (self diagnosed), anxiety, and self worth issues ever since the beginning of middle school. I've never been to any professional about these issues. I can't really, with my school's mental health services only giving a fuck about you if you're actively in danger of committing suicide. I never got help before that because I am Asian (meaning my parents are too) and there's a whole stigma against mental illness in the Asian-American community, even more so than most of the country. So basically I've been dealing with this entirely on my own. Anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

I have come to realize over the past few months that I don't want to get better. The thought of being better terrifies me. I don't want to not be depressed anymore. For one, it's pretty much all I know at this point. I've spent pretty much all of my teenage years like this and it has become my identity. I wouldn't know who I am without my mental illnesses. And I recognize that's incredibly bad and that I should strive to find an identity that isn't reliant on these things dragging me down, but then the self worth issues come and kick me in the face and tell me that I don't deserve to be happy, and then the depression comes and says that I will never have the motivation/energy/discipline to find this better me. So to get rid of my mental illnesses the prerequisite is to not have any.

&amp;#x200B;

But the main reason I am scared of no longer having my mental illnesses is that I will no longer have that as an excuse for all of my failures. Right now, I can partially blame my shit grades, my terrible interpersonal skills, and inability to express emotions to other people on my mental illnesses but if I ever get better, then the only thing that's left as a reason for my failures is that I am inherently just a piece of shit human. That I am lazy and bitchy, that I just am not worth it. That no one likes me and never will like me because I am me, not because of the issues that I have. And I know that even now mental illness cannot completely excuse my behavior, and that I must be accountable for my own actions, but right now it just feels like there is a plausible excuse that I can hide behind as to why I am the way I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I am unfortunately very self aware of my issues, it's just that the self awareness doesn't lead to change and growth like it should. Somewhere along the line, that part got fucked up. I just look at myself and think ""oh hey, that's unfortunate because of x y and z, better not do anything about it.""

&amp;#x200B;

The plan right now is to not completely self destruct over the next 2 years, graduate from college, get a job in my field (comp sci), and finally go to fucking therapy so I can tell my depression and self esteem issues to take a hike, and maybe get a move on with my life. But here is where the anxiety comes in. I worry about every aspect of that plan (and everything else). Everything is up in the air because what if I just have a mental break and don't get back up the next day? The next day still comes and I SHOULD deal with the consequences but what if I just don't? What if I don't graduate because of these issues? I'm the failure I'm scared of becoming. What if I do graduate? Then I have to face the reality of trying to get a job. I won't be as competitive as other graduates in my field because of my lack of passion for the subject and my depression putting a damper on any actual effort going towards learning. I'll have a degree and nothing to show for it and any recruiter would be able to sniff that out from a mile away. But say that I get a degree and and I get a job (wow, what a concept). Would I be able to get myself to take that first step to go to therapy? At that point I would (probably) be independent, living alone with no one to force me to go through with what I say I should do. I don't want to be a better person so there's nothing forcing me to go other than the fact that I know I should. And if this past decade is indicative of what I'll do in the future, knowing that I should do something will absolutely not make me do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry I don't have an actual conclusion to whatever the fuck this is. It turned out a lot longer than I was expecting. Originally it was just a shorter version of why I'm scared to be better paragraph. I'd rather die than tell this to any of my friends who love and support me because showing emotional vulnerability? What the fuck is that? So I'm telling all of the strangers on reddit at 5 am. I don't even know what I even want from this post. Fuck man. Send me some acknowledgement you read this. A thumbs up emoji. A rant telling me to get over myself. Maybe a genuine reply telling me to keep my head up. Or don't.

50,"There are a lot of lonely men who struggle with romantic relationships. Many of them fall into the incel trap and frequent those subs.


There are also subs like the ones mentioned in the title who call out and mock the behavior of the people who belong to those communities.


I would like to say that if you are a man who struggles with romantic relationships, insecurity, anxiety over your future, or sexual jealousy but still don't consider yourself to be an incel, I would still avoid looking at subs like r/niceguys and r/inceltears.


It might feel like a way to reassure yourself that you are ""not that bad"" but the language used by the people who comment on those threads will still make you feel like shit. Even though you know they are not directed at you, but at the people who say disgusting hateful things, you can still wind up feeling misunderstood or personally attacked.


This isn't a dig at the people who post there. Many of them recognize the difference between and an incel and a person who struggles with loneliness. But that doesn't mean that they don't still say things that are ignorant or reductive. 


You also might recognize certain thinking patterns within yourself which, although you realize they are harmful, stem from your feelings of frustration and inadequacy. Even if you don't believe these feeling, and want to rise above them, seeing the things that people say about incels who embrace these feelings will still make you feel shitty because you know that you are thinking them.


So just avoid the subs which make fun of incels and niceguys as much as the incel communities themselves. One of them will dry to drag you down into the crab bucket, but the other will still make you feel like shit about yourself even if what they are saying is not personally directed toward you.

57,"Hello, 

There are currently three versions of myself: Healthy me, Sick me, and Limbo me. 

Healthy me - she's good, shes happy, she takes care of herself and her loved ones. She's got it man; a fucking boss bitch with a heart of gold and a wicked sense of humour. I love her and she loves me. 

Sick me, on the other hand, is fucking awful. She's horrible, nasty, hurtful and spiteful. She doesn't let me have anything good. She won't let me eat, won't let me sleep. She makes me hurt myself. Bite, scratch, pull hair, starve. She whispers awful disgusting things in my ear - nothing is good enough for her and nothing ever will be. She turns me against those I love, telling lies and shit stirring, making me believe they don't care for me and are out to get me. And I can't help but believe her. She tells me that she's all I have, and without her I'd have nothing.
""or.."" she whispers, malicious grin slowly spreading over her dark face, tiny eyes shining with glee, ""or, you could kill yourself."" Rasor blade in the bath, rope swaying in the breeze of your favourite tree, pills, train, fly as high as you can off tall buildings, reach the sky! She's told me them all.
""Why don't you? You know you want to. You know your family will be happier without you, without all your stress or effort. You're not happy, when was the last time you were actually truly happy? When you were a kid? You know it's only going to get worse, down down down to the depths until you finally break and do it. So why wait? You can't have a family, what kind of mother would you be if you can't even take care of yourself. You'll be one that kills her kids and then herself. That's what you'll be, a murderer. Do it bitch, fucking do it now you coward.""
I try, I fucking try to keep her away, but she's too strong. I can't fight.

Limbo me is who I am most of the time now. Not quite happy, not quite sad, not quite feeling. Apathy. Sometimes, it's a blessing: not feeling anything after hours of agony is like a snow day on the morning of the big test. It's easy too. I just don't care about anything. You could slap me in the face and steal my shoes and I wouldn't even blink. I no longer care about my appearance, my actions, anything. I went from a girly girl covered in make up, fake tan, fake lashes, the  works, to sketty smelly tramp. But I try to see it as a plus, who has time to make themselves up every day anyway.
She's not always alone, Limbo me. Sometimes she hangs out with healthy me, just to remind me of what going on inside, and to not let my guard down. But mostly she hangs with Sick me, that bitch. Well, Sick me's little sister - not as strong, but still got a nasty bite.
Limbo me is okay. She doesn't want to actively die (just fantasise about being hit by a car, catch some deadly disease etc), but she's doesn't want to keep living this life either. But she gets through. She puts on a face, goes to work, gets home, goes to sleep. Rinse and repeat. She's chugging along, just about. She loves drugs, (alcohol just bums her out) cause they allow her to feel again. Weed is her favourite. She can eat, sleep, laugh - just like Healthy me.

Right now, I'm Limbo me. Sat in my room, listening to Christmas carols downstairs and the sounds of my mum cooking Christmas Dinner. Both my brother and I are away for the actually day so we're doing it today. Should be a happy day, but I've had Sick me whispering in my ear telling me how I've ruined Xmas and am an awful daughter and sister, how my bf is going to cheat on me tonight at his work party, how I should kill myself, but of course that would ruin Xmas for everyone forever, so just shut up and put up with it you fucking pussy. Now she's pissed off and Limbo me's just staring at the pile of washing that should have been done weeks ago. There's cocaine on my desk. Already had a couple lines, hence the babbling (I am sorry). I want more. Tbh, it is helping, I'm finally cleaning and I can actually see my bedroom floor, first time in weeks. Perhaps I will wash my hair today - been a while since that's happened too. Afterwards, I'll go for a smoke and eat food and laugh. No one will know I'm sad. 

To link in the title, I'm scared. I'm scared I'll never see Healthy me again. I'm scared I'll be Limbo for the rest of my life. I'm scared Sick me will kill us all. I'm scared and yet I'm helpless. 

I'm sorry for the long read, I've never told anyone this and its been going on for about 4/5 years now. Time to get it off my chest. I hope you all have a happy and healthy Christmas/festive period.

Much love. ",23Dec2018,1
58,"I do have a mother, as in the woman who gave birth to/raised me is not dead, but at the same time, I really don’t, and likely never will. I’m of the belief that a parent should, within reason, do whatever it takes for their child to be happy and healthy and safe, and never ask for anything back but love and respect. But I don’t have a parent who will do anything for me, unless I do something for them. If my mother does anything to help me, she uses it against me just days later. I still vividly remember finally being able to open up to her about being in a relationship where I was treated badly and constantly cheated on, and I was so happy that she seemed to listen to me and care about what I had to say. But just days later when I’m too tired from crying all night to get out of bed and take out the trash, asking if I can do it later, she reminds me that I owe her because she listened to me talk about how I got myself into a bad relationship. I always owe her for the things she does for me. The things that I would do for my own child, no questions asked, no favours expected. I’m a business partner to my mother, not her only daughter. 

I don’t have any love for her. I want to, but I can’t. Not only did she verbally, mentally and occasionally physically abuse me for the majority of my life, but she denies it and refuses to accept that she has done any of those things to me. When I was 14 and experiencing deep depression for the first time, and didn’t feel that I could talk to my cold and clinical mother who would berate me for talking too softly, and none of my friends at school understood why I was always so sad, the only people I could turn to was a community on the internet of people going through similar things. She found out that I was talking to strangers online and completely banned me from using the internet, putting any blockades in place that she could. I tried to explain to her that I needed the support which I couldn’t always get from having an hour slot every week with a therapist, and sometimes at 2am when I’m at my breaking point I need a friendly voice to guide me through. She wouldn’t listen, she insisted if I really needed to talk to someone that badly, it should be my mother. My mother, who claimed my depression was for attention, that it wasn’t that bad, that everybody goes through “bad times”. Why couldn’t I turn to my mother, the person who would hold me down on the floor and kick me when she discovered I had found a new way to try and communicate with my friends online? Who would call me a spoiled brat because I still wasn’t happy even though I had a roof over my head and food to eat, and couldn’t understand why I was hurting? Who would take my phone, read my texts and threaten to send me away if I continued to tell people how hopeless she made me feel? How could I not talk to her? I understand her fear. I understand that she was worried I was putting myself in danger and that anyone can say they’re anybody on the internet. But she never even tried to have a conversation about it. 

When I was 17 and the only maternal figure I had was my boyfriend’s mother, who would listen to me and help me get through my struggles, my own mother became jealous and called my boyfriend’s mother an “unfit parent” to her over the phone, because she tried to be a friend to her son, someone he could turn to with anything. My mother did everything in her power to stop me from spending time with my boyfriend’s mother, and once again I was left alone.

Things that my mother has called me over the years: useless, lazy, bitch, fat ass (she was aware I had an eating disorder, and at this time I was 17 and underweight), attention seeking, scheming, conniving (because I tried to use my phone to record her verbal abuse so that maybe someone, anyone would believe me and see through the act she put on in front of everybody else), “not depressed, just bone idle” (when I couldn’t move my body and go to school because of how heavy my mind felt). These are the ones that come to mind. When she was on holiday away from home, and I was happier because I was free from her, she told me when she returned that I had ruined her holiday because she was worried about whether I’d go to school and study hard enough. When I felt too drained to make it into school, she would threaten and attempt to drag me out of bed by my hair. 

She would regularly tell me that I would never be able to finish my studies and go to university and have a life because I found it so hard to push through my mental issues and do things like go to school. No one in my life has ever made me feel more useless than she has. She made me feel like I wasn’t strong enough or smart enough to succeed. Through it all, the only thing that kept me going was my friends, and the determination to finally get away from her. 

The worst part of all of this is that she thinks she is never at fault. If she apologises, she says “I’m sorry that you were upset”, she can never say “I’m sorry that I hurt you”. I have accidentally seen an email that she wrote recently to my uncle and grandparents where she said that she didn’t believe I would pass my first year of university because I would sometimes come home and visit for various reasons such as GP appointments. She doesn’t make me feel like I am welcome to come home any time I need. I had to phone her crying at 5am one time because my roommate nearly died in my room at university and I needed to sleep somewhere else that night that wasn’t covered in vomit. She uses this as a reason for my incompetence and of course uses it as a way to make me feel like I should be grateful for her (she isn’t the one who picked me up, it was my dad, but I woke her up with the phone call). She wrote in the email that I would have never achieved anything if it weren’t for her. Here are the things that she did for me while I was studying and trying to make a life for myself:

- fed me
- cleaned the house
- drove me to college occasionally when I was running late or didn’t feel able to walk, though 9/10 times it would be my father who would drive me
- let me stay at home rent free for the year when I turned 18 because I was still in college
- took me to therapy appointments
- fought for me to stay in college when they wanted to kick me out for low attendance (would point out to them that my grades were always brilliant regardless of attendance, yet would tell me regularly that she didn’t believe I could succeed because I would miss school)

Those are the things she has done for me. I am very grateful for those things. I am sure they helped me in part to be able to succeed. But there are things that she never seemed to bother with, like listening to me, trying to understand me, telling me that she believes in me. My perception of myself and my ability to succeed was shattered because of her. 

So, I’m not fighting her anymore. I’m not fighting for a mother who doesn’t want me as I am. She doesn’t like that I think for myself. She doesn’t like that I’m not following the same religion as her. She doesn’t like that I enjoy spending time with friends online just as much as I enjoy spending it with friends in real life. She doesn’t like that I’m not like her. She doesn’t like me. Maybe she loves me, but I don’t feel loved. 

I’m scared that I’m just ungrateful and spoiled. But I see how other people are with their mothers, how the love seems to be unconditional, and it makes me want to cry. I always feel like, and have felt like, my mother’s love is conditional, and I need to earn it. I don’t think I should feel like that. I want to be a mother, and I know this is so easy to say before I am even one, but I never want my child to feel like they have to earn my love. I want them to know I love them and will always love them no matter what they do or who they become. I’m proud of who I have become. I think that I am strong and kind and caring, and always put the people I love before myself. But I think I am this way because of my friends, and the love they have shown for me and let me show for them. If I based myself around my mother, I would be a bitter and cold person. But I’m not. 

So, I don’t really have a mother. But I’m going to be my own mother. I’m going to love myself unconditionally and never let myself feel worthless. Thank you, mum, for keeping me warm and fed for 19 years. I wish that we could have had an emotional bond but I don’t think we’re ever going to be able to do that. I can and will make it alone now.

I grew up in a small village, literally a shithole of the world, not even people who grew up there know exactly where it is. Too far from a city and not close enough to a forest where you could space out. But the only thing you could recognise this place with is the smell of local dunghill. (Smell of home right?)
I often played with neighbour's kids, but they didnt like me as much as my sister, so later on they invited just my sister to stay over and thats where my journey begins. Soon i had to move from my favourite kindergarden and lost my few friends i had. In the new one the teacher didnt like me and often mocked me in front of others, so i didnt find any friends. School was even worse. The teacher didnt like me either, and the kids never wanted me to be part of their group no matter how much i tried. In the meantime when i was being bullied in school, me and my sister got on the same sport, since it was easier for parents to do so. You see, i was never a sport type and i was never so much purposed so i could do something for long time. But i was good at drawing and every change i got i drew, yet since the sport was so hard and you had to pour a ton of time to do it, i didnt have that much time to better my skills. I had no intention to get better in that sport because it was so hard and tbh i was kinda lazy kid. But my sister did so great, she was coming as a winner from every championship, she tried a lot to get better at that sport and thats why she was getting so much praise and respect from my parents. Soon the gap between two of us grew bigger and soon i wouldnt get on her level no matter how much i could have tried. Parents started to kind of 'put me away' since i wasnt so good at anything. I was really sad from it so i did my best to be better at different things as studying, yet i still felt like they always liked her more. I was trying my best, i was unable to tell them how sad i was that they didnt appreciate me as much as my sister. My class was getting worse and worse day by day, they hated me for always being better than them in all subjects. I barely talked everyday, because i couldnt talk to my family and i had no friends. It kept going like that for long, long time, i was getting more and more sad, thinking about suicide became daily basis, i often used to imagine my family being happy again without me. Dad stopping drinking, my mom being able to do her hobbies and both of them having time for my successful sister and giving her all the praise she deserves.
This all was happening in the past 10 years. Now im in highschool and i have the best class in the world. But guess what: i have friends! Actually two of them. Two people i can talk to. Im so happy. I have never been so happy in my life. My best friend came last year around this time of year. I was really depressed and i wanted to die. He kept me from doing something i would regret now. It sure wasnt easy, not at all. But i am happy that i came all that way, it made me the person i am today and i am ready to move on and try to do something i love. Something i can be proud of. To that one person: dude, you saved my life, there are still bad days and good days, but either way i am glad that i didnt give up back then, and for that i thank you.
If you are still reading this you have my respect. Have a good day/night/life/whatever.
(Sorry for mistakes, english is not my native language)

Long story short: after a long time of being depressed and without friends i have the best friends in the universe.",23Dec2018,1

65," I'm sure I'm not alone in this. My husband and I don't have the money to buy anyone gifts, not even each other. We both have family members that have hurt us and threatened us and then other family members that expect us to put that hurt aside and be around those people for the sake of getting everyone together. Then somehow, we're the assholes for not wanting to interact with these people that have hurt us. 


My husband's brother is threatening to try to force us to sell our home and family farm that we're breaking our backs to keep afloat. Thankfully we have the excuse, that our lawyers have advised us not to  interact with him directly and only through a lawyer if he hires one. My husband's mother said in response to that, that he could just hang out in another room...which is just a sad and desperate ploy to try to get us to spend  time around him. He is a direct threat to our livelihood, everything we care about, everything we've been working towards for years. And yet we are expected to set that aside for the sake of holiday cheer and family unity. Fuck that. 


My brother outed me as a witch to my whole family and tried his damnedest to slander me and get our Christian mom to sever ties with me. I was able to salvage my relationship with her, but I hate my brother for this. I hate him for telling my secrets that he had no right to tell and exaggerating the truth to make me sound like this evil crazy bitch who abused him and forced him to watch satanic rituals, which couldn't be further from the truth. I'm supposed to sit across the table and be civil with him and I don't know if I have it in me to do that. But at the same time, not showing up is letting him win. I will not allow him to ostracize me from my family.

67," The good:

 Internship is finally ending and becoming a full time job. Getting payed double of what I use to get payed and salary based with weekends off. Working in my field, 3D modeling/animation.
It feels unreal and I just gave my two weeks for my job at the hardware store after 5 years. 

The bad:

  If there is one reoccurring theme with me, I usually struggle with loneliness and being closed in.

 A friend of mine always stayed by my side, and I wasn’t into her at the time. But I saw other women and it always fell through.

 About a few months ago, I started to see her different. I realized she’s always been there, and I started to feel more appreciative while simultaneously being mad at myself for taking her for granted. Though part of me did not wanna ruin things, I wanted to tell her.

At the same time this new guy at our job caught her eye and she started talking about him.

 I realized its now or never. I asked her out on a date and explained what I felt. 
“I only see you as a friend”.

I saw that coming, ouch. But I told her I always saw her the same way too, until recently.

 We both agreed not to be weird about it.

 I told her if she likes the guy, go talk to him(in my gut it felt like a sucker punch). 

 She still hits me up to go out for food or coffee.

Im thinking of all the places I could have taken her more often to. How much more exciting I could’ve been as a person. 

How I wasted my time on women that rarely gave me the time of day and she was always throwing a lifeline when shit fell through for me. 

Now our communication is becoming more sparse.


Overall, yeah, I know my life is changing financially and career wise for the better. But I also feel a deep hole, like emptiness. Just wanna tell her “please don’t go”. Of course I wont say that. But no amount of money can change how much a person means to you and it can’t fill the space they left.",23Dec2018,1

69,"Kaitlyn has a best guy friend who is a 23 year old shy boy who has never been intimate with any girl before. He's not muscular, not fat, not skinny. Just average shape and although they are strictly friends she always thought he had a cute, round butt. He tells her he needs to do something DRASTIC to get over his shyness FAST, and she suggests that he visits a nudist colony for a week to ""get out of his shell"" (and his clothes lol).

She drives him there to drop him off and walks up to the front desk with him. Once he arrives to check in, the pretty (and fully clothed) girl at the front desk says ""Okay, you're all set. Now strip.""

""Right here?""

""Yup. Nobody enters with any clothes on. Please hand them over.""

He turns to his friend helplessly. She smirks and says ""You heard her. Might as well practice being seen by me.""

He blushes red, reluctantly removes all his clothes and folds them up into a neat pile, awkwardly stands holding his clothes in that neat pile in front of himself to shield his privates, until YANK! The receptionist, with no expression on her face, rips the clothes he's holding in front of him away from him in a business-like fashion and locks them in a safe. He GASPS out loud, as his smaller-than-average package is now exposed to his friend, who tries to hide her laughter. Not wanting to outright cover his package in fear, he then turns his butt towards her as he stands facing away from his friend towards the front desk as the receptionist takes seemingly FOREVER to find his room key, then once he has it, his friend gives him a slap on the tush, he YELPS out loud in shock, and runs his bouncing white buns into the sunshine to find his room in the outdoor colony across the grass.

Here are my questions:

1. As the girl in question, what would you find funniest about this whole scene?

2. Does the fact that he hasn't been physical with any girl make this situation funnier to you, and if so, why?

3. Is the receptionist's business-as-usual non-caring approach funny in the way she rips away his pile of clothes and exposes his manhood to his best friend? If so, why?

4. As he is about to run to his room, is it funnier if she gives him a playful little smack on the bare butt (medium force only, like a 5 out of 10) or if she gives leans back and really gives those unprotected buns a really hard ****SLAP**** right across both cheeks, and why is it funnier?

5. And finally, after she slaps his butt and he YELPS out loud, what are a few funny things she can yell to tease him as he's running away into the sunshine?

73,"Hello there,

I should give some information before I express my concern. I'm 25, about to be 26 in March, I have my own place to live in with a roommate, and I have food stamps to keep the fridge stocked; more like the freezer. I work for minimum wage at the bookstore on my college campus, but I am able to attend school at no cost because I live in the state of Tennessee and get the TNreconnect grant.

So with that out of the way, my concern is in the form of choosing my field of study. I was majoring in Philosophy but decided to switch my major because of how seemingly subjective Philosophy is; I understood the material fine and did my assignments appropriately. The only thing that really bothered me and made me realize it wasn't the field for me was that I was getting subpar grades compared to others who just pulled info out of their ass and got a higher grade than me; trust me these people were ""winners"" if they even talked at all. Though in all honesty, I think my professors were a bit biased on who they decided to give the grades to considering they were both Christians and so were the majority of the members of my class; I'm not religious (agnostic). So with that knowledge, they just allowed my classmates to quote verses from the bible and use its information to answer everything. I refrained from doing this because, as I've said, I'm agnostic and choose to see things from a perspective of actual logic and information to decide whether or not something is factual or fictitious. Yet, this obviously got me nowhere. 

So I've changed my major over to Sociology; a field I feel definitely is for me. I've already taken the Intro to Sociology class last semester and did quite well in it. I understand it was just a basic class but I do well in classroom environments that have objective information. Yet, I'm still a bit nervous that I hope I chose correctly because I feel my time is ticking away quicker every day to accomplish something with my life; I'm sure we could all find that relatable. I just decided to post this to r/self because it wasn't really something I felt was meant for r/offyourchest. 

Besides, if anyone else is majoring in or has majored in Sociology, then maybe I could get a bit of advice. I'm really trying to figure out what is best for me so I'm not wasting my time. I just want to give my life value. ",23Dec2018,1

No relationship with any girl
Born with some very serious eye disease, but still able to see. I know if I don't do any thing to  take care of my eyesight seriously, I'm very likely to lose my vision someday. Plus long time electronics' screen (I just can't get rid of it!) , it's absolutely getting worse.

Lazy from deep heart, no impulse to exercise. Now it's getting more fat.

75,"I have so much problems with the environment around me. My life is like the life of an innocent prisoner. I just have one reason to be alive and that is the dream of saving myself from this environment, growing and becoming an independent human, making my own life with my own efforts and maybe try to save my poor Mom too...

Due to the severe mental illness of my father which he ignores having them, he sometimes behaves like if he's crazy. He gets aggressive, headstrong, and destructive that I'd get so frightened. Luckily, there are so rare and brief times in which he gets nice, but most of the time he makes the environment of the house (which is supposed the only environment that I'd feel better in it) so toxic. 

My poor mom has a cure-less spinal disease since at least 15 years ago. He can't walk normally and has chronic pain and spasms that sometimes ruin her sleep. She's practically like 80+ old people despite the fact that she's just 60. She's the only kind and understanding person that I can talk to her about my troubles in life. She dreams for my life to become better and she does almost anything she can to make that happen. She's not like my father that would get angry of me, treating me like if I am his number one enemy who he hates. My father sometimes cruelly fights with my poor mom for silly reasons that he's the only one to blame, making me hate him and compare him to an evil despite he thinks others are guided by Satan...

Our neighbors are worse. They behave like barbarians. They offense and abuse us, they are loud and noisy, they talk so loud, almost they shout like wild animals even after midnight. They close the doors with so much force (I don't know why on earth they push the door this much hard) that you'd hear a long explosion-like *BANG* sound everytime they are here. We have asked them a hundred times to behave humanely and in a civilized manner, but they never changed anything in their behavior. It seems like they don't understand anything at all.

My father thinks they are deliberately trying to annoy and suffer us to make us sell the house to them for a cheap price. It's terrible. It's like living in a war with the society, with the environment, in your home, and with your neighbors.

I have so many reasons to end my life, but at the same time I have the dream of getting out of this country and its sick environment and go to a civilized country to study and become a university staff or professor. In fact, that's the only thing that would prevent me from suicide, the hope of starting everything from zero. I dream to become a helpful person for the humanity by means of education myself to become a scientist, contributing to science and improving people's lives. I dream to become a Nobel laureate. 

I desperately want to find a way to study in a free university in Germany, but even without having to pay tuition, the costs of living and renting (10K Euros per year) are too much for me and my mother. I thought of contacting the universities and professors and asking them for a sponsorship, but I don't think they would help me. I'm sure there are so much kind people in Germany that would like to help me if they ever learn about my story, but the problem is that I can't find them. I don't know how can I find them and how can I reach to them. Do you have any ideas on how I can find those people online? 

I once wanted to make an online fundraiser, what do you think happened? I can't even have a suitable bank account or a PayPal or anything to receive people's donation all because I live in a terrible isolated and sanctioned country, more likely a prison. You could read my reddit profile to gain a better view. 

Rarely there are jobs found here but they will pay so little that you can't do anything in here but to prevent you from starvation. The currency here is one tenth of USD, so I would need to work and save for decades to be able to pursue my dream of studying in Germany.

I'd like to know your comments.",23Dec2018,1
76,"This will be a little bit long, but it's something that I need to share so please bear with me. This fall semester was easily the most difficult of my entire college career at an already-difficult university (I'm a senior). My maternal grandmother was diagnosed with cancer in the middle of August, and passed away at the beginning of November.

She's always been my role model. Her house is less than a mile down the road, so I've always had her as a constant presence in my life and often as a better parental figure than my father. She's the matriarch of the family, and home base for all of my aunts and uncles and cousins who live out of town. She was a lifelong educator, from being 16 years old teaching the boy across the street how to read, to being an elementary school teacher in an urban area where children needed her kindness, to tutoring Russian immigrants to pass their US citizenship test (100% success rate), to being president of our historical society in her retirement. She raised her 3 daughters after her husband died at a young age, putting them all through college, paying for their weddings, and earning a master's degree at the same time.

She was a graceful woman, and the perfect exemplification of human kindness. Her loss has been devastating. I spent several weeks out of this semester over several trips home to take care of her when she was sick, to visit her in the hospital when she was worse, and to stay and mourn when she passed away. We've had to start sorting through her house and its many memories to get it ready to sell. During all of that time, school was the last thing on my mind. Even when I would go back to school, and especially after the funeral, I was so grief-stricken and depressed that I missed classes and assignments. I stopped caring about my grades - I only wanted to pass.

I had some honest conversations with my professors and advisors. They've been extremely considerate to give me so many extra allowances and extended due dates. I finished everything that I could, up until the last possible second. I wrote 2 final papers from scratch this past Tuesday through Thursday. All of the professors at my university had to submit their final course grades on Friday at 10am, and I sent my last essay in an email at 5:30am on Friday morning.

My grades came in later that day, and I was stunned to see that I earned all As and one B. I'm still stunned. It was literally my best semester ever, grades-wise, and my cumulative GPA is now above a 3.0 for the first time since my first semester. All I could think was how proud of me my grandma-the-teacher would be. My grandma, who faced so many adversities in her life and always pushed through, would be absolutely elated to see what I've accomplished. I broke down crying. I called my mom at work to tell her, and she broke down crying too. It will always be hard without her in my life, but I feel like I can breathe again. I've proven to myself that I can live up to her example. I'll be okay. Thank you for reading.

Tl;dr - This was the hardest semester of my entire college career. My grandmother and role model became sick and passed away over the span of 2 and a half months. She was a lifelong educator and the kindest human being I've ever known. Her loss has been devastating, but in spite of everything, I earned nearly flawless grades. I cried knowing that she would be so proud of me. I feel good for the first time in a long time.",23Dec2018,1

Down the street from her lives an older gentleman, his family, and his mom. They’re kind people, and really a staple of the neighborhood. Every Thanksgiving, Halloween, and Christmas, this man puts up the most extra holiday displays I have ever seen. Huge inflatable decorations, massive string lights, the works. Ever since I was little, that was my favorite part of every holiday.

Lately, life has been rough. I’m no longer on my meds and going to therapy, I have very little contact with my family, and I got kicked out and now live with two roommates. Coincidentally, only a few blocks away from this house.

I feel blessed. Whenever I’m having a particularly rough day, I drive past the house. I see the lights and I remember the various memories I’ve had there. I laugh and tell my boyfriend the stories, if he’s with me. I’m able to look back fondly on something so close to me. It comforts me. It reminds me of a time when things weren’t so hard.

Usually, it starts with them not respond, seeming distant, concerned, and thereafter it just goes downwards. I start to interpret EVERYTHING as a sign of them not liking me, whether they don't seem to notice me in the hallway, don't like my Instagram posts (yes, I have started to keep track of likes), or really do any other trivial but interpretable action. 

These spirals often emerge when I get to know new people, which doesn't really affect me much apart from making me a bit irritated and less likely to continue seeing them. I don't want to be around if someone genuinely don't like me. However, occasionally these thoughts concern people close to me, making my relationship to them potentially toxic...

The chance of me ever acquiring half of the things I want is slim but I know that however I live my life, whether it be saving from a nice job for early retirement, or scrounging pay check to pay check to get by, school will effect that and I'd be an idiot if I didnt try hard at something that could potentially determine the course of my whole life.
