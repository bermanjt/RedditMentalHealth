0,So it’s not sexual assault I don’t think because I wasn’t physically like touched but all I know is I was extremely uncomfortable. So a few years back when I was 17 I had a group of friend who were a bit older. One summer we were hanging at his house (he’s 23) so we were all sitting outside and he asked me if I wanted a drink I said yeah and he said okay come with me. So I went to the kitchen with him I opened the fridge and was looking around and when I turned around he had his pants down half erect penis completely exposed. I was like wth??? And he goes come on suck my dick and I kept saying no over and over he was like just once and finally I yelled no and he pulled his pants up and I ran outside and ended up leaving with my friend. Is there a term for what happened to me? ,14Oct2018,1
1,"I remember when they were just entertainment, and you could play anything you wanted without feeling guilty about it. I used to and still play games for entertainment purposes. I'm honestly excited for Fallout 76 because it looks, not necessarily good, but entertaining. But somehow I'm the idiot because I want to play a game that's obviously a cash grab. And this goes for a lot of games too. Have video games gotten too corporate or is everyone expecting the standard to be Oscar-worthy experiences? I don't play fortnight because it doesn't entertain me, but I'll spend a day playing Pubg. I was playing Half-Life 2 on X-Box today where there where loading screens every 5 minutes and the frame rate was 25 fps on average. I was perfectly fine and never really though ""this fucking sucks"". But now if a game isn't full HD, and running at 60 for it's considered ""not good"". I have to head back into work, but I have more to say on the topic. Let's discuss this in the comments.",14Oct2018,1
2,"I'm 23, never held a job and will graduate college in 6 years.

I spent 6 years of my life doing fuck all, only to graduate college and basically be a useless child. I don't do anything right, I can't handle stress at all, I threw away every opportunity I've ever been handed. At every single chance to do anything of meaning I've been given, I've failed. I don't deserve to live, I don't deserve the opportunities I've had.

I don't have a social life, I haven't made any friends in my time wasted in college. No fun stories, no good times, just a pitiful existence. I grew up around a lot of people who didn't think very highly of me, and it turns out, they were fucking right.

My life is a waste, I've thrown it all away. I'm too scared to just save everyone the time and end my life already.",14Oct2018,1

4,"Last September, I was assaulted by a former friend. He was back from being deployed in South Korea and where hanging out before he had to leave again. We started to kiss and things got more physical. I asked him to stop and he progressed. Every time he touched me more I asked him to stop. He didn’t. Only when he was about to go in me that I said yes. He finished on my face, leaving a disgusting taste in my mouth. 

As I drove home, I thought to my self “there is a hospital right there, I should go there”. I drove right past it and took a shower. I didn’t go to class and felt used.

I attempted suicide that next week, ending up in the hospital.

When I told my therapist about that night, he told me to go the cops because it was an assault. I told him I consented and it wasn’t like that. 

A month later I somehow came to my senses and broke down. I told my parents. Because my assailant is in the armed forces, my dad said military court would rip me apart and couldn’t let me go though that.  After I told them, I put this event away, only lightly thought about it.

My bf asked about my depressive past and I broke down and told him. I cried hard. Probably the first time I could cry about it. Since that night, I keep thinking “why the fuck didn’t I just report the fucker”. A lot of self hatred in that area. But I know it’s too late. There is no evidence and would probably ruin my name in the accusation.

He says it's because he let down his parents and sees them in himself. It's really hard for me to talk to him about it because he's defensive about his mental state and it's really disheartening to see.

and as for Cartoons, I just love Animation in general. American Animation mostly. Looking at its history, watching the rising talent in the industry now. I dabble in some cartooning occasionally. but I mostly suck. But it's still a big part of my identity I guess.

I have a friend who doesn’t like to see me get good grades or marks, he always comes and asks me “ what all have you studied “, “ how much have you studied” and things like these , and try to outsmart me, in front of others. ( I am not jealous of him, but these are facts ). Seriously how to deal with people like these ?

I am second year undergrad in math and physics. My college is competitive and but there’s not much going here other than academics. When I joined here, I was under the impression that Math means “applied math” and I could be like tony stark one day. Then realised it’s far from that. Hence I lost interest, but I can still manage the courses, can do pretty well in them. I am continuing the course only because I have electives next year.

13,"Life goes decently well for me and just thinking about the inconveniences and traumas other face make me feel so goddamned weak. I regret all my foul immature behavior for seeking acknowledgement, even if it was months ago. I just want to fade and forgot the little things that keep piling up. Can’t stop thinking about them. 

For how many decent traits I have, there is a way I feel uncomfortable with my own reactionary impulses. Don’t know why people stay with me, I don’t offer anything to the conversation just stuck onto this other wall of a friend group. Without them I’d feel more alone than anything, my mind would run in circles. 

Weeks ago I would cry half the day but, I’ve felt okay. Thinking about what worried about just fills me with full self hatred and embarrassment. And it’s only relieved by constant validation which I don’t want to burden anyone with. Selfishly, I’d wish to have someone to hold me. Laugh at the smallest things but, when together anything can make you forget. But, who wants to deal with someone who’s full of dull regret and impatience. 

I breakdown and regret it over months I overthink all my actions and it ruins what my confidence has managed to grow in that time. Feel like a bitch writing this but, I guess this self pitying helps me get my shit together and realize others have it worse. ",14Oct2018,1

all i can really do is be her work friend. i'd really like to let her know how i feel even if she didn't feel the same way. it would just be nice to get it off my chest. but i can't do that, it wouldn't be right. maybe she doesn't feel the same way and it would strain our friendship. maybe she does like me but wont leave her bf. that rejection would sting for a while. worst of all, maybe she likes me and will leave her bf. if shes so quick to jump ship in her current relationship how could i ever be confident that she would stay loyal to me.

My depression, well it made me a little brat piece of shit, I stopped taking care of my body, including brushing my teeth. So let's do the math, 6 years + teeth neglect + a soda addiction = A very bad pair of teeth.

Im worried it will effect my dating life when I do start dating. Overall it makes me look like a meth head.

That was just ridiculous imo. Roseanne tweeted a ton of dumb shit before that. She said she did it in her sleep and basically woke up to a shitstorm online.

Just look at the 60s, when John Lennon mentioned that the beatles were ""more popular than jesus"" statement. People went absolutely nuts, and he had to do tons of damage control, and basically say look, this was not what I was saying.

""Some folks, from Alabama DJs to church leaders, misunderstood that Lennon was claiming his band was superior to Jesus. Certain southern radio stations refused to play Beatles songs, church groups organized bonfires of Beatles records and the band received countless death threats.""

Lennon did not want to apologize, but was nudged in that direction by Epstein and press agent Tony Barrow. “I’m not anti-Christ or anti-religion or anti-God, I’m not saying we’re better or greater, or comparing us with Jesus Christ as a person, or God as a thing or whatever it is. I just said what I said and was wrong, or was taken wrong, and now it’s all this.”

34,"Long story short -

Chronic headaches for the past 4 to 5 months, they have become more constant to the point where they are daily and worse in the morning.

I've also been dealing with irritability for the past while, I get easy frustrated and I'm very easy to anger.

I get my pocket or headphones caught on door handles or zippers and I rip the zipper open or punch/slam the door.

I'm also depressed to a certain extent, very pessimistic and somewhat anxious.

The headaches are the main symptom they've gotten worse and more frequent over the past while (this being before I went to hospital). They're on top of my head and I can usually point to the spot of pain, it's usually my right side at the top roughly an inch forward from my ear/middle of upper head.

I went to my GP, I was referred to hospital, I went to A&amp;E, who sent me to the Acute Medical Unit.

Blood tests - Normal.

Head CT - Normal.

EKG(ECG(?)) - Showed an irregular heart beat, I didn't have that before - Cardiology said it's nothing to really worry about.

Chest X-Ray - Showed a slightly enlarged heart, they thought I might be an athlete, I'm not but I'm in okay shape.

They gave me paracetamol and Neurofen - Neither had any positive affect.

I was given a prescription of 10mg Amitriptyline for 3 months (currently 1 and 1/2 months in) and a week of Tramadol for the pain, Tramadol did not help, I stopped for a while and swapped to Solpadol - also very little affects.

Booked in for an MRI of my head - which I had today.

Booked in for an Ultrasound of my heart, and a consultation with a headache specialist after the 3 months on the medication.

&amp;#x200B;

As of now I'm back taking the tramadol - ran out of Solpadol (I had it for a chest infection/pleurisy from before) and I have tremors in my hands, feel somewhat dizzy and still have a bad headache as I'm typing this.

I'm still on the amitriptyline.

I have an Aunt who has a brain tumour her symptoms were severe headaches, worse in the morning and persistent.

She's had radiation to shrink it, and is having regular MRIs to monitor it.

I'm worried it might be a tumour.

The neurologist mentioned cluster headaches, but they're not that bad and I have a low grade headache most days, with intermittent intense stabbing headaches.

Also my eyelid was swollen because I'm prone to chalazions/styes so unless he thought that was a symptom.

I know that CTs are used to check for larger abnormalities, aneurysms, clots, bleeds etc and an MRI is used to check soft tissue abnormalities like tumours, cancers etc.

Obviously it's not very big if there even is anything there.

But I'm still concerned, and I think it's rational rather me being a hypochondriac.

I had my eyes tested first thinking I needed glasses, I don't but the optician saw tortuous veins which indicate high blood pressure, I got that checked and it's normal..

And when the medication isn't helping, the pain isn't subsiding and my mood is very much the same..

What even causes an enlarged heart?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just worried, there's a family history, meds aren't having any affect on my headaches, they're still here months on and I'm experiencing the other emotional symptoms.

42,"Hey guys.

So at the start of the year my ex and I went through a messy breakup and life got real shit for a while so I kind of just threw myself into partying to numb myself to the pain of it all. So over the last 6 plus months I’ve been progressively ramping up my drinking and stuff, I’ve always been a bit of a drinker but lately I just keep drinking to I can’t buy anymore I am literally spending the vast majority of my paycheques getting as fucked up as possible. Lately I’ve been getting real bad and saying and doing shit that misrepresents me as a person and really leaves me the next day feeling like a complete tosser, last night really was the icing on the cake though. I seen this girl for the first time in years and we hung out a bit had a good time and I just kept drinking and started to get douchey I really wanted to take this girl home so when I seen her talking to other people in a flirtatious way I got jealous and mean and I said something douchey to her about how she just likes the attention, I didn’t mean it but I said it and that’s when I lost her respect and frankly my own. I tried to apologise but she didn’t want to speak to me which I don’t blame her. So I left and went home but as it turns out she got real sick and passed out at the club now she’s in an induced coma idk if she’s going to be okay or not but I feel like the worlds biggest piece of shit and my minds left questioning what would have happened had I not been such a dick, no one seems to know how she ended up like that or anything so potentially if I had have kept my mouth shut there might be more answers for her loved ones.

Today I’ve decided to man up and get my shit together no more drinking for a while, I’m going to throw myself into the gym and get my shit sorted because I am not the man I want to be and I’m not doing anything but slowly pissing my life away so I can have a couple hours of fun before I go back to my shit life for another week.

43,"How I am currently feeling:

It is almost 10 AM on Sunday and I just got slightly drunk alone.

I do not feel happy. Whenever I am alone, I am anxious about something.

I am trying to enjoy my relationship, and I really do enjoy the time we spend together.

However, whenever I am alone I start to doubt my relationship, procrastinate on what I have to do to improve my life (study for the GRE in this scenario), and start hyper focusing on scenarios that make me socially anxious, both real and imagined.
Wearing a dumb shirt to a tailgate, getting too drunk in front of a coworker/friend, oversharing with coworkers about my life, thinking about how I have a very small amount of friends, and the only one that sees me regularly is the one I live with. This is also my fault, since I never take that first step to make plans with people.

So as a result, whenever my closest friend is out of town I am stuck alone with my thoughts. I have started lightly hurting myself whenever I have socially anxious thoughts, since the pain makes me stop thinking about it for a split second. Nothing too serious, just progressively stronger slaps. I have also started imagining that I hurt myself badly or kill myself, and it makes me feel good when I think about people being sad for me.

This type of attention seeking behavior can’t be healthy, right? Or at least the imagining of it. I don’t think I’ll step beyond slapping/hitting myself and getting drunk alone, but these are still not healthy habits to fall into.

I hate that I won’t focus on the GRE, I hate that I feel so alone, when in reality I do have at least some friends that care deeply for me and a family that loves me. I do not like sharing my bad thoughts with them though, since I do not want them to worry.

This is all probably being made worse by not sleeping well for a while, and really eating like shit for the last few days(and for longer than that if I’m being honest). I am not happy with my body weight(5’10” 124 lbs as of this morning) but lol not like I’m doing much about it. I wish I was more like my friend- she sees a change she wants to make in life and does it. She doesn’t mope around, she has a wide circle of friends, she has a spine and can stand up for herself. I am a pathetic human being and I am so mad at myself for wasting my potential.

I feel like I should probably see a mental healthcare profesional at some point, but there are people with legit problems they could be helping instead.",14Oct2018,1

45,"And I dont have friends to talk to about this. They wont understand why im attached to my cat. They would say ""hope your cat will be better soon"" but they dont mean it. 

I dont want the cat to die. He's like family to me. 

I want to sleep now so I can visit him tomorrow, talk to the vet about removing the catheter from him and maybe we can do the rest of his meds at home. I just want him to come home.

Plus, there's loads of work waiting for me tomorrow. I dont want to work but it will pay the vet bills.

Speaking of vets, Im more anxious now because I noticed earlier today that the vets and staff were not as compassionate as wxpected. 

I just want my cat home. 😞",14Oct2018,1

47,"In my novel, Mrs. Harris - a dignified, decorated, always well-dressed married 39 year old professor, goes out for a silly, old-school drunken night out with the girls.

They even play beer pong.

Mrs. Harris, not drunk but a tad buzzed, gets shut out, 12-0.

The table of women giggles. Her old rival, Rachel Collins, who defeated her, says:

""Well, you know the house rules, Mrs. Harris.""

""What house rules?""

""If you get shut out in beer pong, you have to run all the way around the block...hehehe...NAKED.""

Can you please answer these questions?

How old are you and are you male or female?

How do you imagine Mrs. Harris reacting to the word ""naked""? What does she look like outwardly? What does she say?

Does she self-consciously cover her breasts over her shirt with her hands? How do her friends react? What does she think inside?

How do you imagine her stripping down and running? How fast? What items in what order?

How do you imagine her run going? What funny things can you imagine happening as she runs around the entire block?

As she makes it back, her old rival Rachel SMACKS her bare, white, jiggling ass with her hand and says WHAT that makes Mrs. Harris blush and the friends all laugh louder than ever?

Thank you!!!",14Oct2018,1
48,"My mom passed away almost two years ago in January. She had a total of 7 heart attacks and had had a heart attack and stroke in May before that. She had been sick for a while, so maybe I should have expected it.

But I was only 16 years old when she died. 16. Even though she was sick, I always had hope she would get better and she was but then one day she left for a doctor's appointment and never came back.

She was my best friend and we acted more like sisters than mother and daughter. My dad has done an absolute great job of raising me since then. They weren't ever married but he picked up the slack with no question and I am so grateful for him but I really miss my mom. She's missed my 17th birthday, my 18th and my high school graduation. I had envisioned her being there for all those things and the fact that she's missed them makes me incredibly sad.

And nothing against my dad, but sometimes I just wish I could talk to my mother just once. Tell her about my first month of college, all the friends I made. I just had a sudden feeling of grief and wanted to share it on here.",14Oct2018,1

51,"I've never had sleep paralysis before in my life. I stayed up to like 5am watching youtube videos talking about bad drug trips. Eventually I got so tired where I would pass out and have a mini-dream, then become semi-conscious and unable to move my body at all or even open my mouth. I was seeing things semi-consciously that weren't really there (like a security camera on my wall). My mom woke up really early  (it was 6am and I heard her walking around). My head was turned away from the door but I sensed her presence and she was saying something like ""I bought you a shirt."" Which in and of itself shouldn't be scary at all, but because I couldn't turn my head to look at her, having this dark shadow walking up next to me was pretty terrifying. I tried to scream but all that came out were some pretty pathetic-sounding moaning noises. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, not sure if it was really. sleep paralysis because the 'shadow' wasn't super vibrant or clear (I couldn't even directly look at it). What was scarier than the shadow was this ominous sense of fear where my dreams and my consciousness felt indistinguishable from each other. I eventually shook myself out of it by forcing my hands to open.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 24 and this has never happened to me before, so I'm hoping this doesn't become a recurring event. It seems like it only happened because I stayed up to 5am.",14Oct2018,1

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my girlfriend met in 2016. I was a senior in high school and she was a junior. I was fresh off the heels of a failed relationship with a girl I was in love with for years, and started dating my current girlfriend as a kind of rebound. She told me she loved me 3 days into the relationship. I am very scared of confrontation, so I said I loved her too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her parents love me, and have helped me through tough times. When I was kicked out of my house in 2017 I crashed at their place for a month until I got an Apartment with a friend. When my friend bailed on rent that I couldn't afford, they paid $800 so I could keep my apartment. Me and her dad are super close, we play in a band together. I'm still trying to pay them back. currently owe \~600

&amp;#x200B;

See, me and the girl I had a failed relationship with were friends afterwards, but my girlfriend made me cut her out of my life.  
My 2 best friends since grade school, I also had to completely cut out of my life in order to make her happy. 

Every person i was friends with told me I changed because of this girl. I only have 2 friends in the whole world. Some guys i've been friends with online since 2012. She doesn't even let me talk to them on voice chat anymore because she ""Doesn't understand"" our inside jokes.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, we live together, have 2 cats and 2 cars. Both of those cars are in her parents names.

&amp;#x200B;

I fucking hate her. I dread the moment she comes home from work because she screams at me about the smallest things. Sometimes when I leave work, i'll stop at my local McDonalds and chat with the people there for an hour, and lie when I get home saying work kept me late. I can't do anything by myself without her being around. I can't talk about stories from work with my female co-worker because she flips out and tells me not to talk about other girls.

I have absolutely no social life, and what little I do she always has to tag along. She is in complete control of everything in my entire life.

She guilts me into sex, buying her things, going places I don't want to go but never going places with me where I want to go. Every fucking day I say ""i love you"" it's a lie. I have never hated someone in my entire life more than her. But I can't do anything about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I break up with her, I cannot afford my apartment. I lose my car I use to go to work. I have absolutely nobody to fall back on because they've all told me they hate me now. I've fucked up everything in my life by being submissive to her and just trying to make her happy and there is no way to fix it. I want to fucking end it all, I just want to save up and buy a place ticket to some other state and leave without notice. But then i'd leave my cats. ugh.",14Oct2018,1
59,"A few weeks ago i had a big fight with my so and i realized the way they were treating me was toxic, possibly narcissistic abuse. I thought it was my fault and looked down at myself and questioned my reality and things I thought I knew to be true. It got to the point where getting a message from them sent me into a spiral of depression and anxiety. I went ex no contact but also started drinking almost every night. I was straight edge up until that point and it is unsafe to drink on my medication as well, so understandably those close to me have been concerned and it's at the point where they refuse to give me alcohol and ban me from drinking when they host.

Now when I was cleaning up I noticed that the plastic white container for steaming was slightly melted and though it could have been that. Are the fumes really dangerous? Should we throw away the food? We ate some food last time steamed like this and ate some food that we prepared in the kitchen while we could smell the plastic melting too.

68,"So I was coming back from my vacation in Germany with two buddies, for some reason the flight plan listed me separated from the two of them, so I ended up sitting in the middle of two others who were flying solo. 

This guy was sat next to me, he wore some kind of mask on his face, must have had some kind of injury or something, he was a pretty muscular dude though, which made the whole situation more uncomfortable for me. 

So we were just talking and shooting the shit when the topic of his mask came up, the convo basically went like this: 

Me-(Jokingly) “If I pulled that off would you die?”

Him-@It would be extremely painful”

Me-“Come on you’re  a big guy” 

Him-“For you” 

I mean what the fuck, “I’m a big guy for you” there was some obvious sexual undertones in the way he said it, this made the rest of the flight extremely uncomfortable for me, I didn’t fly so good at all, he remained pretty much silent the rest of the flight after this.

&amp;#x200B;

Today was a different kind of date. I took her out for a walk on some trails she hasn't ever been on. We had fun, went and saw some cool sights, made-out at the cool sights, everything was great. Came back to my place to hookup, we did, it was great like always, my dad came home halfway through everything so it cut everything short, but I feel like shit now.

  
Do I feel like shit because of me cutting the sex session short? Definitely. Do I feel like shit because I like her and I wish we were dating? Maybe, maybe not still not sure.  Am I just tired and sore and having a bad day? Definitely possible. Another part of me is sad because I feel like she's not everything that i'm hoping she is. Her personality seems great, but she seems to hold back on her mind a lot of the time, she doesn't always tell me what she's thinking.
