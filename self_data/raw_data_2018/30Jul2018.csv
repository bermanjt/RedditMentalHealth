7,"I haven’t found a good subreddit to post this to, so I’m hoping r/self will allow this to stand for a little while. Yes, of course this is a throw away account for reasons that follow. I am failing as a husband. I have been married for almost three years and I recently had yet another revelation (4th/5th time?) that I need to stop watching porn while my wife is not around. I have been struggling for years to stop watching porn as I know it will affect our relationship drastically (divorce is a popular idea from my wife if she ever found me watching porn). I have been constantly lying to her over the past 7-8 years that we’ve been with each other. I would occasionally watch porn while we were dating because we were not in an active sexual relationship until closer to marriage. Ever since then I’ve been telling myself that a little porn here and there wouldn’t hurt. I would watch porn behind her back, wait until she leaves the house for groceries or something and run into the bathroom to masturbate to said porn. I kept telling myself it wasn’t hurting our relationship because I could masturbate two times a day and still want to have sex with her at the end of the day. I also followed this innocence of porn watching because it never included abuse/rape/name-calling/etc, typically just solo. This went on for almost three years. However, just a few days ago when she was getting ready to go off to visit family, she wanted to have some fun sexy time before she left. Of course, I obliged and we went into the room to do the deed. I don’t know what was going through my head, but I just couldn’t be stimulated enough to have sex with her. She knew something was wrong, and she turned off immediately. I tried everything I could, but just couldn’t come to terms that sex wasn’t happening right now. Sadly, I had to work and she left with family. I came home to emptiness and knew she wouldn’t be back for 2-3 weeks. Immediately, I was drawn to my computer where I syphoned through subfolders to find my hidden stash of porn…yeah the porn videos I dropped $360 on. Next thing I knew it, I had masturbated 4 times in a day without any issue. I purchased sex toys to play with and had them priority shipped to my house (\~$160 later). I just sat there the next day looking at all the stupid shit I just spent money on and realized that I am a good-for-nothing liar and cheater. I ended up throwing the sex toys away, deleting all the videos, and just sat wondering why I keep doing this. I have so much credit card debt yet I just rack it up with stupid sex toys and porn videos that I only slightly enjoy. As I sit here I’m only day 2 from this and I can’t help but recall the porn videos and it just draws me to bring up anything remotely pornographic and just wank off until I’m satisfied. I know the first thing in dealing with a problem is finally accepting the fact that you have a problem. I just can’t come to terms with telling my wife because I know she’ll pack her bags and leave in a heartbeat. I’m lost and confused. I am telling myself never again, but like the last 4-5 times, I feel I’ll fall right back into the void.",30Jul2018,8

Hello, Reddit! As many of you know, subreddits like r/TalesFromRetail and r/TalesFromYourServer are really fun to read and look at- but after a while (or a particularly off putting story), you kinda realize that... people suck. There are so many stories of people not even showing the tiniest bit of respect to people in the service or retail industries! 

Now, I won’t be a pretentious prick and say “my parents raised me to be of the utmost character and to be respectful and kind to *all* the commoner peasants I may meet,” but is it really that hard not to be a dick? I mean, all you have to do is say “please” and “thank you,” and treat employees like *human beings.* 

I’m probably very annoyed by this because my (probably narcissistic) mom is always extremely rude to employees in stores, and all I can do as a teenager still living under her roof is say “sorry” really quietly when she’s not looking. 

Anyway, I’m still trying to wrap my head around how people could treat others with little decency and respect. Who raised them? How don’t they recognize that their behavior isn’t OK?

12,"I posted this other places too for visibility.


Last year, in my second year of university, I had a psychosis. I went to my campus medical place because there was a computer chip in my brain messing with the electrical circuits. As it turned out there wasn’t a chip in my brain, only schizophrenia. After I told them about my brain chip I they convinced me to go voluntarily go into the hospital for a while to get things straightened out. I started on medicine and all kinds of things I didn’t even know were wrong started getting better.  I can confidently say I am not in psychosis right now. 

My problem is that I never told anyone about this. When I was around 13 years old my parents had me evaluated by a psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with adhd and dyslexia. I think that this was a misdiagnosis of my pre schizophrenia symptoms. Anyway, I am dealing with my schizophrenia in secret even though I am living at home for the summer. I feel like they can tell something is off with me since I came back from school. 

I feel like I can’t tell anyone about this. I only told a few people at school the real reason why I was in the hospital, and they definitely judged me negatively because of it. I am worried that if I tell my parents they will do the same thing. I don’t want to be a burden on them for the rest of my life. I don’t want them to look at me and know that I went crazy. I feel like I can’t tell anyone anything. I would prefer to never tell anyone about this ever and have it just go away. But the problem with that is my doctors say I will most likely not be stable like I am now in the future and I really could use someone to help me with this. 

Do any of you have experience with my problem? Has anyone kept their schizophrenia a secret from EVERYONE? Advice?",30Jul2018,1

15,"What I think I can and cant control in my mind is loosely defined and I've been struggling with it my entire life. I've been spiralling after a mental breakdown 5 years ago and I feel like this is all a test. To see if I can let go of all the control I thought I once had. If I lost it, did I have it in the first place? 

I feel like I can control all of my mental problems. Like anxiety and depression and now insanity. And I just have to fix myself. Maybe I need to realize I can't fix myself. 

Is this just apart of mental illness? Deluding yourself that you can control it and magically fix yourself. I guess thats me, I guess I was doing that with my problems before my mental breakdown. 

But that means I've been somewhat mentally ill as long as I can remember. Or did I actually have control of another area of my brain but then my ego just assumed I had control over all of it but now that I've lost all control, all there is left is my ego which thinks it can control everything, but now it controls nothing. 

Its just questions like this. The constant questioning of my sense of self trying to figure out anything. I get swept away and go off on tangents. I just think of things and I have a hard time emotionally believing things I come up with aren't true. Not every thing I think is the truth you know, I just feel so strongly in them.

Maybe we all have insanity, just comparing our complexes to others is what messes us up because we all have different road maps. I'm just trying to find someone on the same journey as me I guess. Maybe I already know everything I need to know about myself, and now im trying to fight for control. Ugh.

I do have some ephinanys and wors of advice I've come up with.

You get focused in on the light and the contrast between the light and dark is so extreme that the dark around you will look more dark compared to when there is no light at all which brought up the interesting idea of when you are ""safe"" inside light, you are scared of the darkness around you but when it's completely dark you are no longer sacred of the dark rather the lack of knowing what's around you. So from now on knowing full well that there is no danger lurking in my house I will go about the place with the lights off.

22,"Sorry for long post. 2 friends of mine died on Friday. A couple. Husbands death was due to cancer and his wife killed herself after he died. We didn’t see each other a lot but when we did we were very close. The most fun and happy people. 

I’ve also been through a really shitty breakup recently. I was super in love with a girl who turned out not to be the person I thought she was. 

Since Friday I’ve been having extremely vivid dreams. Like they are real, and I would have control if I could move my body, but I can’t. The dream always takes place where I am in that moment. The first one was on a friend’s sofa when cat sitting. My best friend was in the bedroom. In the dream. I woke (in the dream) and felt a buzzing through my whole body and I couldn’t move. I was beginning to panic. Then my BFF came in the room and lay on top of me, and it was as if my body wasn’t there, and she was laying on the sofa where I was, and I still could not move. 

It took every bit of strength I had to just move one finger. Once I did that I was able to wake myself up, and I woke up in tears, immediately thinking about my friends who had died that day. 

Similar dreams have been happening since and I’m scared to sleep. Twice more that night,

Last night I was sleeping with somebody new. We cuddled all night and I didn’t have it, but they’re back today and I’ve had a shitty sleepless night again. 

My ex had sleep paralysis before. I didn’t know it was a thing until she told me about her experience. We don’t talk anymore so can’t ask her. 

I think I’m broken. Does anyone know how to fix this?",30Jul2018,2
23,"Needed to say this somewhere. I've always thought about moving out from my mother's house, but today I reached a breaking point. She said some very hurtful things, some of which I feel I'll never forget. But I don't even feel angry at her. The reason I feel hurt is because I love her. And I don't want someone I love to hurt me anymore. So I'm moving out. I've put together a plan, and I feel confident that I can succeed.

I know, it might sound stupid to just decide to move out just because of a fight. But it is something I've had in my mind for some time now, and the idea is not so fresh as I might make it sound like. It is doable, and I'll be happy on my own.

24,"I don’t know if anyone remembers my post. I deleted the original because it was so embarrassing after everything that happened afterwards. Warning— this is going to be super long.

But TDLR; I thought the feelings I had for my best friend were mutual. We told each other “i love you”, we would hug, play with hair, talk on the phone for hours and hours. I had a moment where I had my head in his lap and looked up at him and thought, “god, I am totally in love with him”.  So I posted here and everyone told me to go for it. Even his close friend told me to go for it.

Long story short, I did. I confessed, and it ended up being quite awkward. He said nothing. I had to go so I left. A few days later he told me thank you and sorry, so I was left a bit heartbroken. Our friendship resumed as usual (still very flirty) and one night we were texting and he asked me a few questions about my preferences in relationships. I’ve decided to abstain from sex for the time being so I told him that, and he said that he would talk to me later. He kept saying this for months — finally, he fell in love with another girl, went out with her, and I was left gutted. I tried to get over it and eventually moved on. 

He had basically lead me on for months. That was what I believed. And at the same time I thought that maybe I was imagining things and he wasn’t flirting with me at all. So I believed that it didn’t work out for two reasons: 1) sex is important and I wouldn’t fit his preferences or 2) he didn’t like me and he had been leading me on.  I kind of trusted the first reason more than the second, but I had a lot of moments where I just thought, maybe I’m just being stupid and I can’t tell if flirting is flirting or not. I also had a lot of anger/hurt inside because he never gave me an explanation for what happened. I just let it stew inside and eventually got over him.

Well, last night I finally got the closure I wanted. After a few weeks of not seeing each other (school is out, both were traveling) I went over to his house to get ready to go to a black tie party we were both invited to. He had just broken up with his girlfriend  and was heartbroken over it so I steeled myself with the thought that I would NOT be a rebound, or do any flirty things. Except for one moment when we were both on his bed and my head was in his lap, I think I did pretty well. We went to the party and at one point walked outside to take a breather.

That’s when my mind was just fucking blown.

We were on a bench talking about life, our vacations, whatever. In the middle of it there was a silence that spread into the conversation, and I sat back and stared at the floor. He was really quiet and facing away from me, his right leg resting on his left knee. It was dead quiet for a good three minutes and getting a bit awkward when I realized that his foot was shaking. 

“Damn,” I thought. “Is he about to spill some big secret about his relationship to me? Maybe he’s more ripped up about it than I thought.” I kind of touched his shoulder and looked at him, and then I asked if he was okay. He jerked his head back to look at me and I saw he was crying.

“No.” He said. He was crying. And while he’s not one of those men-don’t-cry-man-pride dudes, I’ve never seen him cry before. It freaked me out. Maybe his breakup had been really bad. 

“Oh my god, hey. What’s wrong?” I asked, awkwardly rubbing his shoulder. “Come on, what’s wrong?”

And then he looked at me with red eyes and went, “I feel so bad for how I treated you last year”.

What the fuck?? This initial incredulous expression came over me, and then I shut it down. Really? He was apologizing NOW for leading me on? Then it must have meant that he never liked me after all and that I was just... being lead on. I laughed and went, “it’s okay. Really, it’s okay.” 

“No it’s not.” He said, still crying. “I was really bad to you.”

And it just went on for half an hour. I was just stunned. I mean, I was pissed. But he was clearly torn up about it so whatever. Eventually he told me that there had been two reasons why he didn’t ask me to be his girlfriend — 1), his friends had been pressuring him not to. They thought we were bad for each other and that specifically I was bad for him (this is stupid because we were basically in a relationship, but like, not.) and 2), he didn’t want to create another issue with me and my parents. They were super strict about anything to do with boys at that point, and my relationship was strained.

I was really freaked out. As he kept crying I kind of went on and just rambled about how important his friendship was to me, how I was too much, I understood, whatever. We eventually had to say goodbye and leave, and when I got home, we texted for a while. He finally told me, “yeah, I liked you.” 

I feel pretty satisfied with how this turned out. There was SO much shit that went on between us. But now I finally know, and though it’s like a year late, I feel like I’m kind of at peace with how it turned out. ",30Jul2018,3

My sister and I are a couple years apart but we could easily be twins, personality wise. Our parents raised us the same and it wasn’t a problem. 

I had five kids, five *very different* kids, but my daughter is different from most people, not just her siblings. I don’t know what I would have done without my husband. 

A perfect example is, with all the kids we had a standard curfew we’d have them agree on when they became of age to go out by themselves. This daughter turned that age and I told my husband, “hey, tonight let’s have that discussion with her” and he said “What are you talking about? We can’t give her a curfew.” And I thought he was nuts. 

And he said “She doesn’t want to stay late. It wouldn’t even occur to her. But she will if she thinks it’ll piss us off.” 

And when he said it, I knew, damn it, he was right. Any of our other kids would stay out for days at a time if they thought they could get away with it, but this one would do the responsible thing as long as she thought it was her decision.

32,"Do you know the terror you feel in your dreams? It's a different terror than real life trauma, at least for me. In real life trauma I'm just gone. I turn my brain off. But in my dreams I feel this terror searing through my body when facing violence. It's a white hot feeling in my stomach. It's like when you're on a rollercoaster and you've gone over a big drop and your stomach is somewhere way behind you.

I feel like that all the time when I'm awake now. I used to numb it with heroin and alcohol and cocaine and cigarettes. I forced myself to get sober but I'm slowly slipping back into it, alcohol and cigarettes at least - for now.

I walk around with that feeling in my stomach. I'm terrified of everywhere I am. There is a darkness everywhere I go. What I cannot see terrifies me, even in my own home.

My motivations are heavily drug related - even if unconscious. As a young twenty something I have the luxury of the support of my parents which lets me choose where to live. After bouncing around the country after cutting contact with my family I ended up back at square one. I may go back to the city I first spread my wings which is also home to a party scene accepting of hard drugs and self destruction. It's what I know, even though I know it's no good.

Before the sexual abuse I developed full blown bulimia, even though the sexual abuse came soon after at age 11. It persisted consistently for two years until it stopped. I attribute my eating disorder and low self esteem to what professionals call ""emotional neglect and growing up in an invalidating environment"". Soon after I reached adulthood and years after the drugs and self destruction started I got into prostitution. Albeit, high end prostitution which painted an aesthetically pleasing Art Deco backdrop to my life during that time.

Now, I have been raised to be humble, to do what's good for the majority and to avoid narcissism as much as possible - no exception for my art.
Though, lately I've been suspecting that this might be the reason I'm not getting anywhere with what I'm doing. I love making art - it's what I'd like to do for the rest of my life, but if I want to profit off my work or even be able to live off it someday, I must change something in my way of self-advertising, I guess.

I have few friends from around the world in the online art community that are around my age. The ones that are serious about their work already had their so-called 'breakthrough': They have a decent amount of followers on social media, are somewhat established and known in the art community to be recognized by the 'big artists' and do have enough backers and fans that they can make a decent amount of money off their work.

Personally, I think their way of self-advertising is questionable, though. On Instagram, for example, they usually post their daily Story, saying: 'New post! Gimme love pls', 'Give me likes', 'Look at my recent', which I personally find distasteful - be it self irony or not. It's just odd to me, because I couldn't imagine talking about myself that way - I would never want to beg for likes like that. I'd honestly feel like an attention whoring idiot, if I started doing this on my small account.

But is that the thing I'm wrong about? While the people I've talked to about this share my opinion, I haven't really seen anyone bothered by it and it seems to be working for most artists...

Right now, I'm 25 and I'm studying. I'm on my masters, in about a year I'll be done. But I feel like I'm running out of time.


You know those seldom days where you lie down when you go to bed, thinking back on all the things you've done, being content, and falling asleep exhausted and just... Happy, I guess? That's what I want my life to be. It doesn't need to be glamorous, or better than anyone else's, but I want to be able to have a life full of things I did. I know others have that, I know it's possible and it can be achieved by simply getting off your ass and doing what you actually want to do. And that's where I just feel stuck.


I've been doing this shit all my life. Everything I do is for my education. I'm doing something sciency in one of the best universities in the world. My education, once completed, will literally be one of the best available. I don't say this to brag, I say this because I think that it should make me excited or happy, when in fact it does not. My passion for what I'm doing has been dwindling continuously over the last six years I've been in university. This shit drains me. I acknowledge the immense privilege I'm granted by being able to do my education, and yet I'm so unhappy.


I see I'm 25 now. I guess I won't get significantly older than 75, so one third is gone. All my live has been preparation. Working hard on myself, investing so much in my future to, one day, have it nice. Of course, I understand the concept, I know, I'll have a good paying job that'll probably make me happy. I'll be able to get my own company started maybe, which is a dream I've had since I was a child. But goddamn, time just runs.


I'm preparing for something that's always just ""coming some day"". Now, it's within reach, but that doesn't change the fact that I was unable to profit from any of my work I have done yet. Everything I do I invest in myself. Nothing I do is productive, gets honored in any way (be it praise or money). I want to earn money. I want to live on my own. With 18, or 20, you're still coming of age. You start to do stuff yourself. Now I'm 25. Others my age literally have a house, a family, a car, are entirely self providing. I don't need most of that just yet, but I'm so tired of just feeling stuck in my parent's house, feeling like a prepubescent boy going to elementary school.


There's a guy I grew up with who died of cancer a year ago. And it terrifies me. I'm so afraid of dying. This isn't something I ever was concerned about, but right now, I'm anxious to cross streets, I see the car crashing into me every time someone takes over too fast. I'm so afraid of being unable to actually live the life that I've been working on all this time. That, in the last minute, It'll just evaporate into absolutely nothing. There'd be nothing left behind by me. All that just tells me that I'm not where I want to be. I dream of being able to do as I please (which involves working, which I very much enjoyed in the past and look forward to a lot), just being an adult and feeling like being at eye-level with others in society. I just cost and cost, devour recources of both my parents and society. I want to build, live, work, be responsible, be independent and most importantly, create and have an impact.


It's a bit over a year that's left. I won't quit now. But it doesn't help, because nothing ever changed. It still feels like it never ends. And now I'm learning for my finals which stress me out so bad. I want to have a choice. I want to live a life that makes me happy, but I just feel so stuck.",30Jul2018,4

43,"I remember back four years ago I was still in high school and for the first time ever, I thought I was fat. I would look around at the other girls and ask myself why I didn't look as they did. I was jealous because all of my friends were getting guy attention and attention from other people and I constantly asked myself why I too wasn't receiving that same treatment. Even though looking back then I was a perfectly normal weight, I decided to ""fix"" myself. At the end of my sophomore year I made the decision to slowly start backing off of food. That summer going into my junior year, I dropped 15 pounds quickly. For someone who is short the weight was a drastic change on my small frame. I can recall waking up every morning thrilled to see the numbers plummet on the scale. My face was looking thinner (my chubby cheeks was something I was most insecure about). My body was the way it wanted it to be. I was also a cross country runner who ran almost 6 miles every single day eating around 800 calories. At the time I didn't think anything was wrong. I was getting compliments left and right about how I looked, guys and people who had *never* approached me were all of a sudden walking up to me and chatting up a storm. The feeling was night and day for me. Until...

my hair started falling out in clumps. All I could do was sleep because I refused to give my body the proper fuel. Most days I couldn't even find the energy to talk to my friends or hang out because I needed to go home and sleep asap or else I'd binge. The binging and restricting cycles started. Finally in November of my junior year I wanted to recover. 

When I first started starving myself I also went vegan. Coming to find out three years later that veganism had depleted a lot of nutrients from my body. It messed up my thyroid, and prevented me from doing a lot of social outings. With recovery I felt great. Unfortunately the weight was quickly being put on, fat in places I had never seen before. My face broke out with severe acne (probably from all the sugar I ate while being vegan) 

The girl in the mirror was no longer me. She disappeared a long time ago. 

Ever since my recovery I have attempted more times than I can count to try to lose weight to get back to to where I was, but I don't think my body can do it anymore. The weight just won't come off, my hair is thinner than ever, and I feel hopeless. 

Till this day almost four years later I still have repetitive disordered thoughts about my eating habits, and the way my body looks. If I could go back and **yell** at myself for even thinking for a second I was fat, I'd go back and slap my 16 year old self and tell her that she's not fat, that she's beautiful and that hell would be ahead if I kept it up. Sometimes I feel so alone because of my past and although I am weight restored and other things have gotten a little better, it's something that still haunts me to this very day. You all are beautiful and you don't have to change yourself. Believe me, the grass is *not* greener on the other side. It's actually dead. ",30Jul2018,9

I was in a long term relationship of a few years , so the “game” has kind of slowed down accordingly. I feel like society is just extremely needy in terms of needing the feeling of acceptance for something. Yes I get we are that millennial age, but it seems that most of these people I talk to are just waiting for you to edge about something sexual or a fantasy right away. They might be modest about the approach, but it seems to be readable and very alike amongst other people too. Texting seems to have concluded to -“ wyd, nice, wanna hangout?” It seems like it’s just a quickie service, like real conversations are more rare to come by then people thinning you out like it’s a dating game. I think we are addicted to attention as a society, we want to be praised and noticed all around. So when we text people, I think we adhere to their rudeness or bluntness of being up front. I believe we do this because we gamble and think that there is more good to come regardless, something good instead of a lack of care. I might just be talking out of my ass, but to me, finding a good match could be rough because face to face is seldom unless it’s FaceTime now a days. I wish we could be less insecure as a society and accept the little shits and be happy with our little shits. It would make a lot more beautiful people in the world.

I lost most of my high school friends had a lot of family problems and became very depressed. Depression took a huge toll on my self esteem and I stopped going out. I’d stay in bed all day and eat and eat. I gained a lot of weight back. It really doesn’t help that my dad always reminds me that I’ve gained weight and how I used to look “way better”. I already weight lift 3-4x a week for a long time. Everyone knows losing weight is 80% kitchen and 20% gym. So I’ve been trying to improve my eating habits a bit. One of my biggest weakness is drinking teas 4-5 times a day with milk/cream and Splenda. It’s like a little happy place for me the time I take to make the drink. Kind of forget about how shitty my life is while I drink tea. I HATE drinking black tea/coffee. Even the idea of it disgusts me. But today for the first time I did it.

56,"And I feel pretty good! I noticed my masturbation habits combined with porn was having a definite Pavlovian affect on me. Sitting in my desk chair at home would get me aroused, and I would almost assuredly masturbate to a very specific type of porn (kinda went deep in the rabbit hole), and would not be satisfied with anything else. After I was done I'd be disappointed and mildly disgusted with what I was watching, and would essentially sit in a pool of my own juices and shame for a little bit before cleaning up. Afterward I would be pretty disinterested with anything else and usually just play video games (without really enjoying it that much. Sometimes I would become obsessed with the idea of getting home and masturbating to that porn when I started working - essentially thinking about porn for 9 hours until I got home.

Now I feel a lot more relaxed, and don't constantly have porn on my mind. I still masturbate, but without porn, and there's no more shame. I picked up running around the same time I quit, and it's an awesome way to burn through any pent up energy/frustration. 

I'm sure I'll fall off the bandwagon at some point, but I'll just hop right back on. It's a benign fun thing to do, and for a lot of people it's not an issue - but I made it an issue for myself, so now I gotta address it. And I am, and feel like I've got more control over my life :)",30Jul2018,443

I developed a bunch of mental issues from an event that happened to me when I was in 5th grade. Most of these issues I still have them. I developed chronic/ major depression, selective mutism, and social anxiety. (Along with a bunch of others but those are the main 3) 

I guess you could say I was angry with life for giving me those things, along with letting what happen to me happen especially coming from the people who were supposed to love me. I always told myself life “owed” me something. 

In the beginning I had really low self esteem and I did have a bunch of mental issues but I did know it wasn’t as bad as it could get. Some people were born with severe autism and disorders that don’t let them function without help from others. I always told myself I owed it to them to keep trying and to never give up because I at least had something they didn’t have. If I killed myself then I’d be literally wasting something they couldn’t get 

Later on I started to get a little more attractive so compared to many others I had it good all things considered. I kept telling myself that if I did go on with it then.. yeah.. 

Then I progressed in life instead of staying in the same spot by doing the same but reversed.

59,"so, I'm going to try to keep this short...(I didn't, I'm sorry)

I (F21) met my best friend (F21) 3 years ago at the beginning of our first year of university. We had been joined at the hip ever since, so we decided it would be a great idea to live together for our 4th year of university. We signed a lease in April for a 2 bedroom apartment (lease starts in September so we haven't moved in yet).

Fast forward to now, her parents are ""insisting"" she move out of the apartment and find someone else to take over her lease. The reason for this being that after a night out, I hit her in the back of the head with a glass bottle (a 26 ounce bottle). I don't remember this happening because I was blackout, but apparently I threw it at her when she got up from us laying down on the couch. She had to get staples and I'm not sure how severe the cut is (she was driving a few hours later, didn't mention being concussed).

I know what I did wasn't not only a terrible thing to do but also illegal, I'm not making any excuses - it was a shit thing to do to someone whose supposed to be your best friend and I know I fucked up.

I spent all of last week being really depressed over what happened, this week I feel as though I've made peace with the situation. I know I have a lot of things to work through as a person in order to become a better one.

So last week I sent an apology text to my friend which she appreciated and told me she was happy I reached out and that she knows had alcohol not been part of the equation, that I never would have hit her. She then added how her parents wanted her to find someone to take over the lease. I responded by saying I was sorry I wrecked everything and that if she too didn't want to live with me anymore (not just her parents) to tell me and that I would understand. I know that was a dumb thing to ask, like of course she doesn't want to live with me, but idk I just said it and didn't think very far ahead before doing so...

She hasn't responded yet, and I just logged on facebook to see that she has posted ads for the lease take over. So my question is...should I have been the one to offer to move out (and let her stay, instead of it being the other way around)? Before answering, please consider: her and I have bonded over partying - drinking, drugs, everything (blackouts are common, getting fucked up was a big part of our friendship), the apartment was a bit over her budget and she stressed about it a lot, and lastly - there is a part of me that just doesn't care if she never speaks to me again over this. I know I fucked up, I know that drinking isn't an excuse for what I did and that this whole situation is literally on me, but for some reason I just want the apartment. In my gut I feel I should just let her sort this out. I know this may make the possibility of becoming friends again more unlikely; but sometimes I think ""is that so bad?"" We wouldn't drink together anymore because of what happened, and there was so much more to our friendship than partying, but I almost feel like its best if we both go our separate ways for good, at least for a while, because I really do think we had a toxic friendship. I also think that the fact that I feel this way at all shows that maybe I care more about having a friend that who the person is whose actually filling that role - and most of all it shows that my friend deserves a lot better out of a best friend.

The reasons why I'm apprehensive to just stay in the apartment is because I don't want to lose all my friends, but these are the same friends who I developed my drinking and drug problem around, the people I do it with, people I skip class with, people I fail classes with - I just feel like if I take this apartment, I can focus on me, and my friends can focus on themselves.",30Jul2018,3

We would curse at each other make stupid jokes all night, duel, make teams and I felt welcomed and equal and whenever I came clean to someone or just straight forward tell them I am a girl from the day 1 we talked their behaviour would be so different and never in a bad way, no guy ever hurt me or anything actually quite the opposite they would be so much gentle and nice and willing to help but it just fed the fire of my alienation.


I also live in a country where you can't just go to the doctor and get help. I see all those happy people on the internet transitioning and glowing and talking about how miserable they where before and I know that my whole life would be miserable I will never get out. I can get testosterone illegal from the internet and self administrate but I have bad heart problems and I only read about how harmful it is for people with heart problems and I am afraid I would make it worse.

I also fight anorexia for years and its also weakening my body and its another barrier between me and people. I make so many excuses because I don't feel good about myself or because I don't want to go and do social stuff and eat that I barely have friends in real life. I can sit on the house for months if my mother would not invite me out from time to time. My self hate and depression has gotten to a point that I don't wash myself if I don't need to leave the house because I hate to be naked in the shower and I would sleep and wear the same clothes for days. I fight so many things at once to get out of the house I would just lock myself in. The house its usually in a pretty horrible shape because I hate to move around and feel my body moving to clean it. What I do day to day? Sleep as much as possible. Work from my computer and play games from my computer where I can be who I am and no one knows. And it hurts so much when someone gets a bit more close as a friend and wants my contacts to keep in touch or wants to voice chat. I always have to make 1000 excuses of why i can't do that and eventually block them with no explanations. 


I am tired of this feelings...I want friends I want to live my life... and I met this guy with who I became friends really fast online because we have the same humour and he's a great person I would love to have in my life but he insists so much to talk via voice and its that time when I have no more excuses and I block him and it hurts so much I just sit on my bed and cry. Its just another friend I lose. The only thing that ever made me happy where those people. Those people that treated me like one of them and played games with me... but I was always the weird full of excuses kid that blocked everybody... I am sorry... ",30Jul2018,2
79,"I'm not employed by Facebook per se, but I do work at a Facebook office. My job has me setting up expense accounts for candidates coming onsite for interviews. My employer didn't tell me that I would be working for Facebook until I got my offer, and since I was unemployed with almost 60 grand in student loans to pay back, I took the job without hesitation. Ever since the Cambridge Analytica story broke, I've felt like a horrible person for working for a company that causes so much pain and suffering in the world. Now even John Oliver is tearing Facebook a new one, and it makes me hate myself even more than I already do. I've been trying to find a new job for a few months now, but so far it's only resulted in two interviews and zero offers. I can't afford to just quit my job on principle and wait for something better to come along.",30Jul2018,4
80,"Okay so there have been a couple of events in my recent past that have made me contemplate my own perspective and wonder why I feel the way I do about things.  

Lets start off with my ex-girlfriend.  We broke up last October.  We were together for 6 years, roughly.  I obviously wasn't the best boyfriend in the world but I wasn't the worst either, not a good story for claiming myself as ""keeper"" material I know, but bear with me.  Well, we had this sort of agreement that I would go to school and get a degree in something which didn't go well.  Before we started dating I had already royally screwed up a semester by never showing up and just smoking weed all the time.  I was in the process of paying that semester off when she came along.  

After I did that we moved in together, and started going to school at another college.  I did alright the first semester but I'm the kind of person that if I'm not genuinely interested in something then I won't put all the effort in the world into it.  As a result the 2nd semester went much like the one before we got together and I did poorly again.  

Fast forward a couple of months and I'm working part time at The Home Depot and she has been on my ass to get a better job and get on track to make something of myself.  She then threatened to break up with me if I hadn't found something by a certain date.  I don't respond well to threats, so I told her she might as well break up with me if she's going to make threats.  We then set a date to break up.  Seems stupid I know.  Well we ended up not breaking up because even though we fight all the time I couldn't fathom the idea of being alone again.  

After that we moved into a trailer on her mom's property while she went to nursing school and I worked to pay the bills and buy groceries.  After she graduated nursing school I was looking into going through with trade school to do nursing as well.  However, I had succumbed to severe depression, partly because I felt like a failure for dropping out of school several times, getting kicked out of the army for weed, and not being what she wanted me to be.  I had been working at a small loan company for the better part of 2 years when I finally quit because the job was too stressful and I was abusing my Klonipins because I couldn't ever get the anxiety to stop.  That's when she broke up with me and immediately starting seeing one of my good friends (not anymore obviously) while I was still living there.  I was furious. 

 I ended up in the hospital after attempting to overdose and ended up spending several days in a rehab center.  All I really wanted to do was leave so I could go back to work (my current job that I love) because I couldn't bear to lose it.  I worked really hard to get where I am there and my world would crash so hard if I lost that.  So I managed to get them to let me out after 4 days after the doctor's deemed me fit to go back into the real world.  All I really did while I was there was play along so they'd let me out.  

I am still so furious.  I honestly wish something horrible would happen to them.  If their families died all of a sudden, I'd throw the biggest party in town that I could.  If I see them together in public I don't know if I'd have the self control to stop myself from making him swallow his teeth and beat him into an unrecognizable pile of slime.  I've seen multiple psychiatrists, counselors, etc.  I don't feel like killing myself anymore but the hatred is still there burning in my chest.  I have tourette-like outbreaks where I'll be sitting there lost in thought and will blurt out vulgarities, hatred, and something along the lines of ""please stop you're hurting me"", or ""please leave me alone.""  I hate them so much that it literally sends pains through my chest.  I know I deserved what I got, and I know it's not his fault either.  I know it's also not all my fault.  But I just can't accept it, I want them to hurt.  My friends don't talk about them around me (they're friends with some of my friends) because they know I'll get angry really quick.  

And then there's my father.  All my life just worked in a factory, came home and drank.  Did absolutely nothing with us.  Once my brother and I were big enough to overpower him there was no more corporal punishment.  Guy would've ended up in the hospital for putting his hands on me.  When we were little we'd get presents from all sides of our family.  This pissed my dad off because he couldn't afford to get us a lot of things and told them to stop buying us so much stuff.  I still resent him for that, and many other things.  

I have no stories of going on adventures, hunting, hiking, learning how to build things, etc. -  stuff that normal dads and their sons do together.  The only thing me and my dad did together consistently was fight and argue.  He retired a couple of years ago and since then just added more alcohol and less of doing anything else to his daily regimen.  He reached about 450 pounds at age 68 and just drinks like a fish, yells at my mother, and demands we get him more liquor.  I told him he could go to hell, I'm not buying him shit.  He's drank himself into oblivion and can't even move on his own anymore.  Doesn't mean I'll help him.  If the dude falls down, I'll leave him there to die, I don't care.  Honestly I hope he does soon.  He's in the hospital right now due to his congestive heart failure, and while he was there his kidneys and liver started shutting down.  I hope he freaking dies there.  

My mom has taken about 5 weeks of FMLA and goes and sees him everyday.  I've seen him like maybe twice, I'll say hello and exchange a couple of words.  He'll tell me how he wants out of there and how he wants to come back to the house.  I don't care, there's no one there to take care of him.  I'm sure as hell not going to.  The man needs to hurry up and die.  When I overdosed and wound up in the hospital the only thing he said to me was ""well that was brilliant.""  I had told him before that I was thinking of ending it and he rolled his eyes at me.  If there was something I wish I had done with him it would be that I wish I had punched him in the face as hard as I could at least once and watch him roll around on floor in agony of his newly broken jaw.  I hate that man with all of my heart.  

All of this begs the question.  How did I get like this?  How can I stop myself from feeling so much hate?  It hurts me every night.  I get around 3-4 hours of steady sleep a night because once I go to bed I just think about how much I hate everything and everyone and how alone I am.  I'm up to my neck with all of the hospital bills, psychiatrist bills, and counselor bills so I can't see any of them until I get that squared away, but it's never helped at all.  I feel like once they all die I'll feel better.",30Jul2018,2
81,"The weekend before last, I suffered a severe laceration on my femoral artery. By the time the ambulance got me into ER, I had lost so much that the doctor said “I seriously was amazed you were still alive: you should have, by all medical estimates, already been dead. The pressure damaged my left ventricle, and although I survived, I suffered heart failure.

I would have died. It took six units of blood to simply stabilize me.

Now, a unit of blood doesn’t have a long shelf life. Chilled, it will only be useable for a month. It will last 3 hours at room temperature.

So because 6 people in the last 30 days gave blood at this hospital, I’d be dead. 

Four of those we set to expire in less than a day.

Please consider that when the blood drives pester you. I didn’t know any of this until this event and assumed blood stored for years.",30Jul2018,24
82,I feel like a failure. I have no friends and I hate myself most of the time. Sometimes I wish I had a boyfriend who I could do many fun things with and talk but I know that having a boyfriend right now is not a good idea for me. Most guys I’ve met are assholes anyways and only want to have sex. Wish I wasn’t always in this shitty mood. ,30Jul2018,10
