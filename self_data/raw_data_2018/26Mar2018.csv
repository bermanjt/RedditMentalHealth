5,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I guess I'll give it a shot. I'm really sorry if the post or title don't make much sense. My anxiety is making me confused right now, and I don't necessarily have a good grasp of language (or even thinking) when I'm really anxious.

I've been (regrettably) lurking in a certain subreddit that prides itself as being a successor to a certain other subreddit that was banned awhile ago. While I share a lot of the general concerns that the people on that subreddit have (being ugly, lonely, depressed), I don't exactly identify with all their ideas. Anyways, here's my dilemma: 

So I was browsing that subreddit today and I saw that someone posted a video of Emma Gonzales (that girl who's been leading the March for our lives thing), and in it, she basically admitted that her school ostracized the school shooter and that (at least from what I could tell) she had no regrets about it. Most of the comments in the thread basically sounded like hate against her and other stuff that sounded like the shooter was justified. At the same time, there were a few other posters who sounded like they agreed with the girl, and said that anti-bullying efforts never helped anyways. 

And this is where I'm torn. I don't believe the shooter was justified, but at the same time I felt really sorry when I heard he was bullied a lot. I just don't see how she could say that bullying was the only other option they had. It makes me angry that they took the last-resort route. I really don't want to blame the kids for the shooting, but I can't help but feel inclined towards that train of thought. Maybe it's because I'm overly-empathetic and also a victim of bullying, or maybe it's because I'm just a dumb 18 year old who doesn't understand politics, but either way I'm really confused. I'm in support of reducing gun violence in schools just as much as the next guy, but I don't understand how you could also say bullying didn't also take a role in this. I know that the shooter wasn't justified in taking out his vengeance physically, but the idea that bullying is justified doesn't make much sense to me. I'm sure that even just a little compassion towards him back then would've reduced the likelihood of him committing this atrocity. I would never   commit mass murder, but I know that if someone was willing to show me some compassion, I would have felt a little less depressed and lonely. I just don't get it. 

I just need someone to help me understand what's going on, basically. Am I wrong for feeling a bit of empathy towards a murderer? Does that make me just as evil, especially since I'm also guilty of being a social loner too? I just don't know what to think right now. I'm confused and scared and I don't know what's going on (sorry)

6,I had no date or friends to bring. But that's not the funny part. The biggest problem my sister had was that she couldn't bring all her friends because we could only host 300 people. Apparently 20 girls are now sad because they couldn't come.,26Mar2018,22

A big talking point for the right is that gun control advocates don't know anything about guns and they have no right to constrict guns because they don't understand them.

Well, I'm not an expert, but I know a decent amount about guns. I know about guns because I've played a lot of video games about guns and I got heavily involved with airsoft which is a hobby that uses model guns heavily influenced from their real-life counter parts.

The first argument of conservatives will be that I don't *really* know about guns because my knowledge comes from video games. Okay - that may be a valid point, but then you must concede that video games have no impact on mass shootings (which is backed up with years of scientific research).

I think the main point I want to argue in this post is that ""assault rifles are just an aesthetic style of rifles"" is bullshit. Why do M4A1's not looks like M1's? We have determined through many years of experimentation that the ultimate killing weapon come from a compact rifle with a collapsible stock and short barrel. The M4, and by extension the AR-15, has progressed to make a rifle that can expel a high powered round in a CQC (Close Quarters Combat) situation. 

These mass shooters aren't using a Remington Sendero SF II, and there is a reason for that. AR-15's are made from the ground up to kill human beings. To deny that is a complete denial of reality. 

Yeah, AR-15's are really, really fun to shoot. I won't deny that. But you have to accept that they are made to kill people. Maybe we should heavily restrict them to make sure you're only using them at the shooting range?

""But I need an AR-15 to protect my family!""

No, you really don't. You really don't even need a handgun to protect your family. If you are really concerned about protecting your family, you will buy a shotgun. A shotgun requires pretty much no aim - a perpetrator in your path with be totally fucked up by a shotgun blast from your general path and it has the added benefit of not killing your family or neighbors if you miss. 

There are so many people being brainwashed by people that have interests in the gun industry. It's fucking sad. I am a *strong* proponent of the 2nd amendment, but you are all being mislead. Mass shooting are only a problem in this country. Why is that?",26Mar2018,3
11,"i have a friend that im very close with and he is a nice, smart, and a relatively open person. he's been one of my first friends in college and is also in the same frat as me so pretty much one of my closest friends in college. despite this, i get a very deceitful vibe from him a lot and i've noticed that he over-dramaticizes a lot of stuff and a lot of times i can sense his jealousy of me. a lot of times he can also be very dark and it scares me. i see this all the time because he says things behind my back, has told my secrets to other friends, and does other snakey things. i feel that it would be impossible for me to cut him from my life because my entire friend group is also great friends with him. i'm pretty sure i am the only one who gets this feeling from him and i don't want to complicate things with my friend group too much. what should i do?",26Mar2018,1

Already being a sophomore I feel like I can’t drop out due to a huge bill that didn’t come with a degree. I am also extremely far from my family and keep getting hit with homesickness. I am still in a rut on what I should do should I stick with it? Go home? End it?

After failing too many times, then taking time off, failing more, learning I needed more help than I wanted to admit, then getting help...

I did it. I finally fucking graduated college.

This is a dream that I would shed tears over about how badly I just wanted to get to...

And yet, It finally happened and I feel nothing.

I haven't had the ceremony yet because I finished a quarter early. It was just so... Anti climatic.

I finished my finals and that was that. Well time to delete Blackboard app I guess... Time to check final grades. Commencement info? Got it.

I don't think it's a case of it not hitting me... Because I'm fully aware.


But I wonder if all those years of wanting something and then finally obtaining it made it lose its magic maybe? I'm not sure.

Saying I feel nothing is a lie actually... I've been quite depressed. I'm not suicidal don't worry.

I wasn't very good in English and my participation wasn't great either. It didn't helped that people liked to make fun of me and I didn't actually have any friends. 

One day we were learning new words and had to say a sentence ""I would be this country, because..."" 
And so I asked the people nearby what ""clean"" is in English and then proudly lifted my hand and said ""I'd be Poland, because it's clean."" thinking about all the greens and nature and stuff I see everytime I'm there. He then just looked weirdly at me and was like ""okay..."" and moved on. I felt weird.  

About 2 years later I think I was sick on the precious day and when I returned the teacher said ""alright, go to your groups."" and I obviously did not have a group or partner and became anxious about it. He saw me, started to laugh and I think pointed at me? So everyone looked at me curious and he then said something along the lines of ""me getting pale."" I did not like that kind of attention.

34,"Studies have shown that positive reinforcement and rewards are more effective in encouraging children then punishment is. 


There are also theories and indications that Hunter-gatherer societies from the beginning of time have often used exile as the capital punishment of crossing their own people. The inverse implication is that family and belonging is the ultimate reward.


Then I started thinking about crime. When we think of who often conduct crime. It's often the poorest parts of society or minority groups that are pushed out of the mainstream society. Often times, harsh punishments Don't move the needle on crime enforcement. 


People have even started looking at the popular strategy of the broken window policy as an antiquated strategy in bringing down inner city crime. But what if the inverse is the truth?


What if isn't about punishing the person who broke the window? What if it's about rewarding the group with a pleasant environment and the feeling of inclusion? 


Maybe cutting down on the broken windows doesn't fix crime. Making neighborhoods feel included in the bigger group fixes crime. .

In effect, we've pre-emptively exiled whole communities. It's no wonder they resort to crime, regardless how harsh the consequences are. Meth neighborhoods in the southwest. Opioid dens in Appailachia. Violent crime in inner cities. Alcoholism in Native territories. 


I believe it has more to do with the fact that we've economically and culturally exiled these communities then it has to do with enforcing law.",26Mar2018,5
