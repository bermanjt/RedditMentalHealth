1,"So, admittedly I'm nearing the age of freedom. I'm about ready to hop out of my window and escape into thay fresh air to work my ass off and not have to deal with badgering and nagging for chores and basic things. I've come to the conclusion as well that I am temperamental.

My dad was in my life when I was young, birth until around seven or eight years old. In that time and before that he did drugs and at eight years old was put in prison on account of that. My mother has always worked at nights, so this didn't change when my dad went to prison. (Before he was arrested I really barely knew her.) Now, those eight years held a lot of troubles involving lack of food, not enough money for bills and my dad taking said money and my mom's vehicle which often caused her to not be able to get to work when we moved towns. I don't really care about that, though.

I actually remember when my dad got arrested pretty well despite subconsciously blocking a lot of things out.. He had went off to the store about ten minutes away in another town when there was a knock on the door. My dad had been arrested quite frequently, so I really didn't have any reason to not do what I did... Which was run into my sister's (half sister's on my mom's side) room and start crying because I  knew what was going to happen. Yada Yada, he gets arrested.

I live with my mom three years (four of just her, technically.) in this time she works her night shift job, barely spending time with me and on off days often playing this video game I introduced her to in hopes we could play it together. As soon as she found out other adults were playing it she quickly stopped playing with me, though. Now I used to be shipped off with my aunts, grandparents and my sister during the nights. My mom would pick me up on the days after she got off of work and would take me to school. Eventually she just left me on my own at home. During this time I talked to my dad and whatnot. Three years go by and my dad gets out of prison only to stay a little bit of time and go off to a different state while I finished the school year.

We ended up moving several states away from the one I was born and mostly raised in. Since living here, I've moved twice in four years. My mom and dad have broken up, gotten together, and broken up again. As of recent my mom completely moved out of where I live to live with her boyfriend up and out of nowhere. She didn't even try to take me with her, this left me with my dad. At first it started off pretty nice! My dad would be gone a lot, but at the same time there was food and things to do and my sleep schedule was fucked up anyways. It was like living a spoiled kid life for like, less than a month. Then my dad invited someone to stay with us. For this purpose, let's call him Paul.

Paul is a lazy sack of shit who only did things until he got phone service. Since data being a thing he's continously made messes and doesn't clean after himself. Now, not only is Paul here but another person my dad knows his here as well. Let's call him John. Keep in mind, I'm living in a two bedroom apartment and my dad isn't even sleeping in one of the bedrooms.

So, some of this is opinionated, but let's get into the really opinionated things. My dad yells a me... A lot. My dad yells at me from big things to small things, and the biggest thing he gets angry about is my chores, which I understand, but I have asked him time and time again to stop yelling at me. Here's just a little list of things I've been yelled at for...

1. There was water on the floor, and he yelled ""Mop it up."" continuously louder and louder as I tried to say I'd use a dish towel until he got so pissed he drove off.

2. He's yelled at me because I don't know how to word his Google searches.

3. He's yelled at me over my Playstation remote glitching because it was low battery.

4. He's yelled at me for playing Dungeons and Dragons.

5. He yelled at me for using the word Correlate.

Now, this has been going on for FOUR YEARS. My mom has abandoned me to live with a man who yells at me, and when I ask for help she won't do it. My dad spent two hours the other night screaming at me!! For no reason other than I put someone as more important that fucking dishes. The other night he was drinking milk out of a bowl instead of cleaning a mug out and then he has the audacity to call me lazy.

I'm not trying to sob story, I understand people have it worse, but mental health is suffering and I've never cried this much. I'm just tired and trying to work things out. Needed to ramble to internet strangers before I lose my cool and do something dumb. I'm just trying to find a solution aside from waiting to be eighteen, y'know? ",11Nov2018,1
2,"I had just started my freshman year of college at a school 5 hours away from home. I was nervous as hell, but so is everyone at the beginning. I had three pretty good friends from high school going to the same school and we were all excited to hang out together, and I thought the nervousness would pass. Within two days of being there I knew it wasn’t going to. That summer before I had developed pretty bad anxiety due to being in a very unhealthy relationship with my now ex girlfriend, but I hadn’t had an attack in almost a month before going, they disappeared when I broke up with her. Then they came back, and they came back hard. I began to go on walks to just take my mind off of things and to tire myself out so my body literally couldn’t have an attack. I would be walking for hours, just wandering with no end in sight and trying to stay away from people at all costs. Finally at about day 4 I gathered the courage to call my mom, and god bless her she was so supportive. I was bawling while trying to talk to her, standing under and underpass as far away from anyone as I could be because I was so ashamed. I was a popular kid in high school, got good grades, was a good athlete, had a lot of friends, so I told myself that I should be able to be doing what everyone else was right now, why am I being so weird and why can’t I deal with being here, why can’t I be happy, why am I bawling my eyes out telling my parents I can’t go to school here, it wasn’t normal. I realize now that normal is relative, and just cause some people can do some things, doesn’t mean you’ll be able to, but at that point I couldn’t think straight. I’ve never been severely depressed, I’ve never been suicidal, but I remember at one point I was walking over a high bridge and I looked down at the water below and I thought to myself, “If you jumped it’d all go away, and you wouldn’t have any of these problems.” I’ve never ran faster in my life, I got off of that bridge as fast as possible. Every time I went back to my dorm my attacks would come back, and they would be so bad that I could hardly even move, I just sat there shaking for what felt like hours. I wasn’t eating, I was hardly sleeping, I wasn’t going out with my friends. I would wake up, feel my anxiety coming, and walk for hours, then I’d come back to my dorm and have an attack. Thankfully my mom put me into contact with our family doctor and I was able to get a Xanax prescription, but I had to take the train a half an hour in order to get it. So I got on the train, in the middle of an attack, and rode out to a Walgreens that I’d never been to before, waited for the prescription to be filled, took the train back, shaking the whole time and being too paranoid to take the pills, until I finally got back to my dorm where I just collapsed at the door as soon as I got in. That trip had taken everything out of me, I had no energy left, so I just sat there, hardly moving at all. I was beat, the anxiety had won. I called my parents and I said I couldn’t do it anymore, I needed to come home, I couldn’t take it. My dad didn’t understand but he said he’d come pick me up in a few days. The next morning I woke up, took a Xanax and went to unenroll in classes, cancel my housing agreement and turn in the iPad the school had given me. By the time I was turning the iPad in, the Xanax had begun to stop working and I felt the anxiety coming back, so I walked as fast as I could, effectively causing an attack to happen because I thought it was going to, and as soon as I got back I took a pill and crashed in my chair. All the energy had left my body again, and the anxiety had won. At that point, I was able to start eating and thinking straight again though, the Xanax and knowing I was going home was keeping me sane. Eventually my dad came and picked me up and he drove me home, and when I got back the first thing I did was go on a run. But all that did was bring anger to the surface, I kept thinking to myself, “how the hell could you not do it? How could you let it win? You’re a fucking idiot man, it’s all in your head.” I found the biggest stick I could and I started to swing it as hard as I could at the nearest tree. I’ve played baseball my whole life, but I guarantee you that’s the hardest I had ever swung anything. All the pent up energy just came out in those swings, and on the last one, part of the stick came back and hit me right in the lower lip, causing me to start bleeding profusely. I had to call my mom to come pick me up and the first thing she told me when I got in the car was that I was going to start going to a therapist. I enrolled in classes at the local community college, I went and saw a therapist once a week for nearly 8 months, and I was sad seeing all of my friends loving the college life away from home. But I got back on my feet, I did well in school, I started working, and eventually I got accepted into a school a 45 minute train ride away from home, but somewhere I could also live at. Today, I’m doing really well at that school, living away from home, and honestly the only way I can describe how I feel is just happy. I fucking did it. I know that what I’ve gone through isn’t nearly as bad as what 99% of the people out there have seen, but god dammit it was scary to me. A year ago I had no direction, I didn’t know where I was going in life and I didn’t know what I was gonna do. But now I look around and I’m just happy. I’ve never been more content with where I am in my whole life, and it feels amazing. I still have a scar where that broken tree branch came back and hit me in the face, and every now and then I’ll run my fingers over it just to remember how low I got, to remember how I felt on that bridge. And then I think about how I feel right now and I just smile. Life is beautiful, and things do get better. All it takes is a little bit of time. ",11Nov2018,1
3,"My mom lost custody of me when I was very young, and I was luckily raised by my wonderful, supportive father. I saw my mom about once a year, and the older I got, the more I started to see just how messed up and selfish she was. As a young child, she would have me hold her alcoholic beverages for her while she was driving, completely plastered, with me in the passenger seat. She would leave me in sketchy apartments with leering men while she went off to ""see a friend"", which I eventually realized meant doing drugs in some back room.

By the time I finished high school, I had nothing but contempt for her, no interest in seeing her again, and cut her out of my life for many years. However, at a certain point I decided that I should forgive her. I became more sympathetic to how much trauma and violence she had been through starting at a very young age, and had to concede that she had the worst upbringing of probably anyone I had ever met (and, as her child, I'm sure she left out a lot of details in what she told me). I went to see her again and she had become a shell of the person I'd once known. Where once she had been a loud, quarrelsome drunk with some scam up her sleeve all the time, and a kind of mischief about her that was one of her better qualities, now she was sobered up with no friends, no human contact save her angry abusive ex, and no interests whatsoever.

She had a stroke while I was visiting, and that set off the 3 year process of helping her out that led to where I'm at now. After years of flying out to see her and help her through medical and mental-health crises, I've now moved her to an apartment 20 minutes from my house. She has early-onset dementia, is an opioid addict, and is one of the least pleasant people I've encountered in my life. She has limited abilities, lives off $700/month in social security, and I am her only living relative. I took her in because the only other option was to see her institutionalized or homeless, but having her nearby is testing my tenuous forgiveness. Even though she's helpless and degenerating mentally, it's hard to keep feeling sympathy for her because she is just out and out so negative, paranoid, and rude.

I have spent all my savings helping someone who will never be grateful for it. I had just gotten my life together, and it feels like she's ruining it. After struggling through my 20s, I finally have some amount of stability and comfort in my life. I have a great partner that I'm planning to marry, a well-paying job that I enjoy, and a great group of friends. I thought all of that would be enough of a support structure, but the truth is that none of it enough. I'm so drained by this awful woman who barely did anything for me when I was a child. 

I don't know what I'm looking for here, I just wanted a place to rant. I would also love to chat with anyone who's had to deal with being a caretaker for an aging parent. It's hard because as much as I do have great friends, we're all still young adults and none of them have had to go through this yet. It feels lonely and isolating, and I'm so sick of the fact that all I've had to talk about in the last month is dumb stuff related to my mom. I don't really want to talk about her anymore with my friends or my partner, because it just makes it feel like she's taking over even more of my life, and there's nothing of me left. Obviously I need to get a therapist, and I think that will be my top priority in the next week...

Feel free to ask me any questions, give me advice, relate, rant, whatever. I just needed to get this off my chest, because I'm so sick of talking about it with the people I know, but it is on my mind almost 24/7. Even my dreams lately have been about my mom. Three nights ago, I dreamt she wouldn't stop slapping me in the face and calling me a ""little bitch"". It's just fucking getting out of control.",11Nov2018,1
5,"2 years ago, I barely graduated after 6.5 years. 1.5 years ago, I started my dream job and career in Hawaii. Now, I've started working cyber security in support of NASA. 

It's been a long, hard road. It was trying on me and my parents, and I hated almost every minute of it. I have tons of regrets, but I know I can't change them, only move on and correct them where I can. I'm super thankful for the support my friends and family have given me, and I don't think I would have made it this far without them.

I know this is r/self, but I want to make this about you for a moment:

Don't ever give up. Keep working and trying your hardest no matter how many times you fail. You can achieve anything you want, as long as you persevere through the hard times. Don't focus on the things that drag you down or take you off your path, just know that there are always multiple ways to get you to your goal.

Have a great weekend. :)",11Nov2018,1
6,"I was invited by my parents to stay at their home after being a victim of domestic violence.  I am 44 years old and they would treat me like a child and also lock me into the basement.  When I smelled smoke one night and they wouldn't answer the phone I hip checked the door to gain entry in order to wake them up.  But they called the police and stated that I broke in  and damaged their property.  When police arrived I was very upset and taken to the hospital for evaluation.  Hours later I was released and attempted to go back to retrieve my dogs, valuables and some clothing when my parents called the police again and I was arrested for criminal trespassing.  I'm not sure how that will be a viable charge yet as I was released from the hospital and only trying to obtain my most valued assets, but it's a terrible awful shame that you are enduring this and haven't called the police but my parents who have no damages issues with me remotely close have called the cops twice and are going to ruin my life and finances with the allegations and costs I have to pay in attorneys fees",11Nov2018,1

8,"Throw-away because I want to remain anonymous in this. 

**Preface:** I've had suicidal thoughts for about 2-3 years now, but have never acted on them. If I'm going to kill myself, I want to be sure that it'll be quick and it'll work. With this being said, I would always have a little plan in the back of my head, a little ""trapdoor"" that I could just fall through. My ""trapdoor"" was the shotgun that belonged to my GF's dad. It was only the two of them that lived together in the house before she moved out for school, so he just had it in a pouch in his room; no lock or safe protecting it. I knew that I'd have to wait for the right opportunity to do it.


**Yesterday:** Girlfriend and I left school for the weekend, took a detour to go to a store she wanted to go to, then started heading back to our home town. Right before we got to her house, I stopped by a store to get 12g buckshot. When my GF saw that I had ammo, she questioned it and got a little upset but then believed me when I told her that I was going to a friend's house to shoot this weekend.

We finally get to her place, her dad's still at work, and I help take her belongings inside. She stays inside, but I go back out to my car to get a single shell. After going inside, I told her that I needed to use the restroom just so I could go upstairs and grab the gun. However, she was at the bottom of the stairs waiting for me the whole time so I had to wait. 

We went outside to take care of our pet ducks, but then I made an excuse to go inside the house to get something. Once inside, I went straight upstairs, took the gun out of the bag, and loaded the shell in. At first it jammed, so I took the shell out. At this point, she comes into the house and is calling for me. I take the shell and load it via the ejection port. The sound of the fore-end alarmed her, at which point she screams for me and runs up the stairs. By the time she came into the room, I had just disengaged the safety and was getting ready to put it in the roof of my mouth.

Once I realized she was going to see it all happen, I ejected the shell, pocketed it, and then put the shotgun back in the bag. Shes in hysterics and is freaking out, screaming at me, asking me what I was about to do. I placed the bag/gun back in its original position and tell her ""I'm fine, nothing's wrong"", then walked downstairs. She asks me what I was going to do and then begins sobbing once I told her what my intentions were. At this point, I was just attempting to leave until she took my keys away and said that she can drive me to the hospital or take me to my parent's house.

I have her take me to my parents where she tells my mother what had happened, and my mother talks with me about it all, and eventually my father comes into the room as well. The whole time I kept telling them that I was fine, nothing was wrong, and eventually just left after they felt that they could trust me. 

**Reflection:** This whole time, I had no emotion. I was fine with doing it and I felt fine afterwards; no remorse or sorrow. My only regret was not being able to properly load the gun the first time. Even now, I'm unsure if I'm supposed to be feeling a certain way. I don't want to talk about anything because I don't want to seem like a whiny little bitch who can't help their emotions, but at the same time I'm just confused on this and feel the need to talk about it. As for yesterday, it felt like my shoulders got heavy and the rest of my body felt light.

The reason why I didn't follow through with it is because my GF would've seen it all happen or she might've tried to take the gun away from me and accidentally hurt herself. I didn't want either to happen. The situation simply presented itself, and I tried to seize it. 

Don't know what I'm trying to accomplish by telling my story, but I feel better talking about it, that's for sure.",11Nov2018,1
9,"Without delving too much into my life story today I was depressed. Severely so. I felt so desperately lonely and that no one cared and that basic tasks where too draining. Honestly I wanted to die. My brain had me convinced everyone hated me and I would never feel happiness again. 
 I was at the library, trying to get work done. I sat there for hours and hours. I did so little. The urge to just curl up on the floor was strong. I just wanted to disappear. Thoughts of suicide had been going round and round in my head for a while and today my desperation and sadness was at its peak. 
I don't know if I looked just as awful as I felt because as soon as I let my head rest on the desk I hear footsteps approach me and something being placed on the table. I look up and see a woman walk back to their desk. They had left a wee bar of chocolate on the table.
I know it seems small but I can't stress what it meant to me. I cried silent, happy tears to myself as I ate it. I don't know why it made me want to carry on but it did. It gave me just enough of a boost to get through the day and to reach out to someone for help. Maybe all I needed was someone to notice. I slogged through the day wanting to die and now I'm writing this with hope in my heart and the desire to live. 
I've always been told how important small acts of kindness are but I've never truly understood it until today. You never know what someone might be going though. 
Part of me wanted to write this just as a thank you to whoever you were. You might have just saved my life.

Last year, he finally said ""ok you can have a phone the summer before 9th grade starts"". So I wait and fucking wait and summer ends. No phone. So I ask again and he starts talking about some condition he set (he never set any). I didn't even do anything bad enough to not get a Phone.

16,"Hey all.  New to reddit and not sure who might see this, but I was hoping to get some comments from others about a situation I'm in.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a first semester freshman in college.  It's been great so far, I've taken good care of myself, physically and emotionally, and I've made a number of friends.  I had also been dating a really sweet-hearted girl since a few weeks after the start of the semester.  Dating was really pleasant, and I had been fortunate to be in several healthy relationships over the past year and a half (after many years of having little luck in the dating scene).  I got to college with the attitude that I would take pride in myself and be confident.  That mentality had treated me well since the end of high school, after all.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, unfortunately, after being in a committed relationship with this girl since September and really liking her, she cheated on me.  I'm of a mind where people should do whatever they can to be happy, so I was obviously hurt, but I'm not bitter about her wanting something else, and we still keep in contact.  What I've found in her absence, though, is that I really don't feel as close to any of my other friends (at least to the same degree) as I did with her, and that's a feeling I miss very much and something I would like to find with someone else in hopefully the near future.  I'm just not sure how to go about it.  I don't know what in particular I did to be in that wonderful position over the last year plus, but any words of wisdom would be great at the moment.  How should I go about finding people that allow me to be myself, to be vulnerable, to open up?",11Nov2018,1
17,"So, this is a bit of a cliche, but it will feel good to write it all the same. 

I’m a typical 20 something year old male, who up until around a year ago, had been enjoying a simple life of enjoying strictly the female form. Things... changed... largely due to a friend that wandered into my life a few years ago. 

I’ll cut to the chase, he’s a handsome man, but I hadn’t thought much of it until recently. When we met we clicked almost immediately, we had the same hobbies, the same sense of humour, and we both enjoyed each other’s company. He was funny, smart and kind: everything you’d want in a friend. 

What can I say, it was nice, and we became very close. People always threw around terms like bromance about us, and to be honest, I liked it. I found myself slowly falling for him. When drunk we would be a little more, I don’t know, affectionate than your normal friends would be. Flirting with the boundaries, but nothing outright flirtatious - just subtle hints here and there. In my head there was very slim chance he could be thinking the same about me, but even  that slim chance filled my heart up. 

I found myself thinking about him pretty much all the time. At this stage I found it pretty obvious I might well be bisexual, but that’s no big. Fast forward a year. We’re still very close, but I’ve not spilled my guts or anything like that. I’ll level, it’s been difficult. Where before I’d cheer him on and wingman him with girls, now even the mention of a date sticks a dagger in my gut and my heart skips a few beats. I’ve found myself uninterested in others, of both genders, to the point where I may as well just become a plant - a pine tree might be fitting. 

So here I am, gushing to reddit, unsure of how to proceed. I’m not really looking advice, as I *know* what I should be doing. The obvious answers are 1) tell him or 2) move on. On one hand, he’s too important to me to risk losing, and the other, I don’t want to be stuck in permanent limbo. There’s no easy answer, but life’s like that sometimes. I’ll bide my time and feel out the waters a little more, but it was nice venting in the mean while. Peace out. ",11Nov2018,1
18,"For a little more background detail, I am 18 years old and male. I have been living with my mom for about a year now, in the state of Hawaii. My parents divorced early and my father got full custody, so I never had much contact with my mom growing up (I only saw her during summers). You can imagine how excited I was to spend the summer in Hawaii with her, reconnect and make up for our lost time. My relationship with my father is pretty bad, and I was more than happy to be able to leave the house when I turned 18. I had planned on staying only a few months before starting college, but enjoyed Oahu so much that I decided to get a job and enroll in the local university. My mom is a therapist, she runs her own private practice and everything. She has always made good money, and always seemed to like her job.

So now for the whole insurance thing: I have Medicaid, which is covered by the state, so I have no monthly fees/limits. Since I don't get bills I almost never check my insurance but happened to do it today on a whim. What I found completely shocked me. For 6 months now, my mother has been billing my insurance as if I were a client of hers, collecting hundreds of dollars a week. There were pages and pages of charges. I genuinely couldn't believe it; I wanted to think there was some way this could be an honest mistake. My mom has always had problems, but I never thought she would be capable of this. According to the internet, fraud charges of more than $1,000 are a felony. My mom has stolen nearly $5,000 from the state. 

If I report her, she loses her job, and most likely goes to prison. If I say nothing, I am worried that I will be implicated in all this. After all, I am her son, it could seem like I was helping her all along. On top of that, I have hardly any savings, I have no car, and my job is barely above minimum wage... Without her, I think I could be homeless. Obviously I would be better off if I kept my mouth shut. But I don't know if I could live with myself, and the anxiety of knowing that she could get caught at any minute and uproot my entire life? I have yet to confront her, can you imagine confronting your own mother with this sort of thing? Every time I think about it sickens me, makes me literally nauseous. I just got her back into my life, I honestly don't know if I can emotionally handle this, and what it means to our relationship. 

There is no way to stop her without turning her in, I can talk to her but honestly don't know if that will discourage her. The fact that she's gotten away with it for so long makes me feel even more certain that she's going to get caught. So now I'm left with a choice. Do I send my own mother to prison? Do I pretend I never saw this? How do I even go about confronting her? I've taken work off today to think about it, and to read/reply to your comments.

19,"Me and my best friend (both 21M) have been super close since we were 15. We went to college hundreds of miles apart but always stayed in touch. We're both quite low maintenance so wouldn't really message except to share the odd song or reddit post, but once a month or so we'd call and talk for hours without realising we'd spent the whole night on the phone. We were there for each other through all the highs and lows, bad breakups or shitty family, depression or anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

We lived together last summer while we were off college for summer and it was honestly the best months of my life, in spite a terrible breakup on my part. He told me the same, and when we called to talk he'd tell me how lucky we were to have such an epic friendship. I've never had a friend like him, no one has ever got me or been on my wavelength in the same way and from what I understood he felt the same. We weren't able to meet up over this summer, but I made plans to go visit him in his new city this summer for my birthday. He told me that he would love that but just needed to check a few things with his flatmates.

&amp;#x200B;

That was the last time we spoke.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to call him every week or so for the last 3 months but haven't heard anything back. I've tried messaging him in every way I can. Because of our history of struggling with mental health after the first month I got incredibly worried. I spoke to his dad and made sure he was okay, I even spoke to his ex-flatmate who told me he'd been having a rough time with mental health and talking about suicide but had come out the other side and was now doing okay. I assumed that was why he hadn't picked up or my calls and messages had been missing him. His ex-flatmate told me that best friend had said there wasn't anything going on between my self and best friend. So I kept trying.

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago I tried to call and, for the first time, he rejected my call. And every time I've tried to call since. I feel such a deep sense of loss I cannot put it into words. I always thought we'd be there for each other and I never realised how much I needed him till he wasn't there anymore. I've moved to a new city by myself and have made so many new friends and I've never felt so alone, I just want to talk to him like old times. My girlfriend and my sister knew how close we were but don't seem to understand how hurt I am and I don't know how to talk to them about it. I've tried calling a few times since and have just ended up crying myself to sleep when the call gets inevitably rejected.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know whether to give up or whether I should keep calling until he blocks me or picks up and tells me to leave him alone. His ex-flatmate offered for me to stay with him and to come visit, but I don't know whether its fair to force myself back into his life if he doesn't want me there.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: my best friend suddenly ghosted me with no explanation, I have no idea how to move forward",11Nov2018,1
20,"Okay. I consider myself to be generally on the right wing of politics. I see both sides most of the time and hate the political divisions that have entered our country. I try to fix things, i tell people to work together, practice what they preach, etc. I don’t personally like socialism, Hell I’ve helped a friend of mine leave Venezuela and I’ve heard horrible things from her about what goes on there. But I would never attack a socialist or even a communist. But every day I’m constantly attacked calling me a nazi or a nasty bigot as well as much worse things. It honestly breaks my heart. 

For some context I was diagnosed with cancer at 15, and I’ve had many horrible things happen to me in my life from abuse to sickness to car accidents, but all that taught be that I need to spend my life helping people and trying to make the world better. For the most part I do, I’ve made mistakes like all of us of course but i feel it draining me.

I don’t hate trump supporters, I don’t hate communist supporters, Hell I only hate a handful of people. For some reason I keep trying to make left and right cooperate and I see both sides I honestly do, but it’s just led me to be hated by both sides. The right calls me a Libtard, or globalist, the left calls me nazi or bigot. I generally have thick skin but I’ve half of my family doesn’t even talk to me anymore because I don’t want to help them #resist Donald trump or help them debate “communists”

22,"Hi! Hopefully someone can give me some advice. I have found that any time I'm alone (especially when I have nothing to do) I start to slip into this terrible feeling of being disconnected from everything and everyone and spiral into a depression. I almost feel like I'm on another planet. I sometimes will just sit on my bed for 30 minutes and stare at the wall wondering what to do with myself or aimlessly scroll through instagram for an hour without realizing. I feel like time is moving in slow motion. I will also compulsively text friends asking if they're free, sometimes 5 people at a time. I think the problem is that when I'm alone it means I'm also alone with my thoughts which are very negative and lead me to spiral (I have depression and very bad anxiety), so I always try to be around someone else to distract me. I have a boyfriend who I'm with 4 nights a week + during the day on weekends and I have a lot of friends but I find that nights/days where I'm alone with no plans I panic and put tons of pressure on myself to be busy and social. I also REALLY don't want to be relying on my boyfriend and friends to keep me from being alone/make me feel ""okay"" because I know that's not healthy. If my friends are busy and I'm alone (like tonight), I get really depressed and feel useless. I put so much pressure on myself to always have plans or something to do which is hard because my job is freelance so I often don't have a ton to do during the day as well. I do a HIIT workout 4 times a week, have been in therapy for 10 years, and I've recently begun doing meditation using the app ""headspace""- I feel like I'm doing all the right things. I'm always actively working on my mental health and I'd love to hear from anyone who has had this issue and can give me some advice or insight. Thank you so much!",11Nov2018,1
25,"I’m 16 now and am pretty happy with my life however a lot has happened for me to get to this place and it baffles me looking back on it.

About a year and a half ago I was a naive 14 year old boy with a crush. I’d had a crush on them for about 2 years at that point which it bloody ridiculous but being an introvert made it a little less “r/niceguy”-esk. Anyway, I had started talking to a girl from another school, the first person I knew from a neighbouring school, and she very very quickly became my best friend. We snap chatted every single day after school and talked about a lot of stuff which I don’t remember. 

Fast forward 2 months and I start to realise I like this girl from the new school a whole lot more than my crush of 2 years. I was in LOVE! Fuck, my heart was racing as I typed to her I don’t like the girl from my school anymore. It took a little bit and she responded with:

oh why’s that? 
Because I like someone else. 
Who’s that? 
Well I don’t really want to say. 
Oh come you have to. Please tell me.
||After some serious thought came to the conclusion - fuck it.||
I like you.
Really?
Yes I didn’t realise it for a while but now I do.
It’s been bothering me for a while too, she said.
What has?
You know what.
You like me?
Yes I do.
|| heart was now capable of breaking my ribs. No one has ever liked me back until now ||
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Will you go out with me?
Yes I will.
YOUR BOY JUST GOT HIMSELF A GIRLFRIEND!
AND IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY IN 2 DAYS!
LIFE AINT THAT BAD AFTER ALL!

Birthday party plan was originally to go to town with my 2 best mates. Now it was to go with my two best mates and significant other. I was actually gonna meet someone I love ( in more than a friend or family kind of way).

My birthday arrives and in the morning I open my presents. The most memorable things I got were a pair of turtle beach headphones and a Sony Walkman. Great bloody items might I add. At 11 my mum drove me and my mates into town, gf lives there. We got to the place of agreed meeting and waited for about 5 mins. Got scared she might not show up but then, looking gorgeous as all hell, she comes round the corner and I forget everything I’ve prepared to say. Awkwardly introduce her to my friends. She doesn’t want people to know we’re dating (don’t think much of it at the time).

A few funny sentences of dialogue occur which I cannot remember and it results in her telling me to jokingly walk over to a bin and get in it. So I act it out. Get half way and turn back. My gf and one of my best mates who’s good at speaking to people - unlike me - have disappeared. My other mate and I start looking for them.

#TWANG

That’s jealousy. In the throat. Can’t breathe properly. Maybe she already likes him more. Maybe they’re kissing. Maybe she leaves me for him. But no, they’re trying on hats in H&amp;M. Jealousy walks off for a moment. Feel better now that I’m with gf again.

Next part I don’t really remember but we ended up in a park and mate that’s great at talking to people tells us the best comeback to a comeback (as in a retaliation to someone insulting you) I’ve heard up to this point, and I quote:

“If you want your comeback you’ll have to scrape it off your mums teeth” - all burst out laughing and then a couple more hours pass. We end up in a different park under a tree because it’s started tipping it down. I have a jacket and like the rain so I go out into it and climb some near by apparatus. Gf takes a video of me with mate that’s good at talking singing in the background and uploads it to her snapchat story (don’t know this until I get back home). 

It reaches time to leave and we walk my gd part way back to her house but don’t want to get lost because we don’t know our way back to picking up point. Turn back and get to where my mum is gonna pick us up. Get there early so mate that’s good with people (let’s just call him K from now on) messages gf on snapchat and asks if she got home safely. She says yes. I’m glad about that but not that he asked her that. Why didn’t I do it?

Mum arrives and we drop K off at his house. C my other mate had to go home earlier. After K it’s dropped off I feel lonely and the amazing rollercoaster of emotions I experienced that day starts to sink in. I start to think my gf likes K more and they clearly get on better right? She did run off with him at the beginning.

Get home and see her story from earlier, she mentions K but not me. Jealousy walks up to me now and punches me as hard as possible in the jugular. It hurts. Really, really badly. I start to cry. I know I shouldn’t but I do. After a few minutes my fingers find my way back to my Nvidia shield tablet (I don’t have great phone at this point) and snapchat is opened. I ask my gf if she had a good time. She says yes. Not a very descriptive answer so I feel something is off. Ask her. She says no. Don’t believe her so ask her again. Won’t leave her alone. Get riled up and tell her about how I feel with the “situation” involving K. She asks me why would I like him over me? She barely knows him. I say:

Because look at me. He’s better looking, better to talk to, better to be around.

One thing leads to another and I yet again ask her if she’s alright. She says yes, now in caps lock. I am balling my eyes out and shaking. I’m messing this all up. The person I love is angry at me, my life is over. I stop texting for a bit. Dinner is ready and I’m called down by my mum. Quickly pretend to go to bath room in order to wipe away tears. Big myself up so I stop crying and head down for dinner.

During dinner mum asks if I’m alright, I say yes whilst trying not to well up. Can my mum tell something’s up ? Probably.

Dinner ends and head back upstairs to tablet. Heart races as I pick it up, message from gf appears. Open it:

Yes you were right, I’m not in the best of moods. I get mood swings a lot and this really isn’t a mild one. I don’t need help just some space.

Of course I decide to tell her thankyou for telling me. She opens it and doesn’t respond. Not knowing what to do I try to make her talk to me, for reasons I do not know why. She says she doesn’t want to talk about why she’s in a bad mood. Don’t listen to her and carry on asking. Convo heats up again and there are many capital letter from both of us scrawled across the screen. Start crying again. This goes on for a while but then it’s time to go to sleep. Obviously don’t and instead watch video on how to improve yourself as a person. Discover the amazing geezer Alan Watts. Great voice and some interesting ideas. I listen to him and he talks about jealousy and I cry about the events of the day and I don’t get to sleep till late. When I did sleep I do not remember.

Next day comes. It’s a Monday. The first day of work experience. I still feel shit from the day before but it’s a little less bad after the sleep. Wake up and get changed into smart clothes as it a very very successful company I’ll be working for in the coming week. Go to work and sign a confidentiality agreement that says I can’t tell anyone what I do with my time at the company, for the next 5 years. So 2021 I’ll update whatever this is. Work is pretty awesome, get to do some cool things. Company still very successful so probably doing things correctly. 

Come home at 5 and go straight to tablet. Message from gf. Open it:

I can’t do this anymore....

I couldn’t get her out of my head for the entire day and now she cants do “this” anymore and tears, oh there were a lot of tears. I was confused and hurt and yes an very “r/niceguy” at the time (just with out the asking for nudes). I put my tablet down and tried to forget about it. Well that’s not gonna work so I messaged her:

What do you mean?
I can’t go out with you anymore.
Why not?
I just don’t want a relationship.
What have I done to make you feel like this?
You haven’t done anything I’m just not in the right mindset right now.

(Don’t really recall how the convo went but pretty much lead me talking about K and being jealous and she said the same things as she had before) 

I got angry and said something along the lines of I’m not like the rest of your boyfriends (she’d had 6 boyfriends in the past year who’d apparently all left her and I believed it I guess) and then I said you shouldn’t predict your future by what’s happened in the past (she has had a very rough past, I won’t go into it but she got what I was referencing and now there really wasn’t a chance in hell this could get any better). That day I fucked up the worst I’d ever fucked up in my life. I’d lost all chance of having Skype calls from 9am to 1am (the next morning which we had previously done) ever again.

From this point I don’t remember a lot, it’s probably my brain trying to get rid of horrible memories. I do remember Skyping her and she answered and I’d told my previous crush of two years about what had happened - don’t ask me why. I tried to explain to my ex gf why I’d done that but I couldn’t. It was my fault she had left me, if broken her trust in me not telling other people we had been going out. But there was more to come. 

About 20 days after we’d broken up we were still arguing. She’d put on her story a picture of questions and I had replied: 

Answer all of them.
Why?
Don’t know just curious.

One of the questions was “do you want a relationship?”. She put yes. BUT SHE HAD TOLD ME SHE DIDNT WANT ONE RIGHT NOW!

That made me really angry. I told her how I felt, just blatantly told her (unusual for me) and boy was I surprised when she didn’t take it well. I don’t remember what she put back but on her story she put a red faced frowning emoji and I knew it was for me. I replied to with I’m sorry but then I started to cry. A lot. The most I had probably ever cried. I curled up into a ball on my bed - this was about midnight. 

I felt sick so I got off my bed and lay down on the floor. That didn’t help and my mind kept on telling me to get my parents, just get your parents. It took about 20 mins for me to listen and so I knocked on my wall - parents room is next door. My mum starts walking down the hallway to my door. Quickly contemplate if I’ve made the wrong decision. Too late. She opens my door and sees me with tears streaming down my face. She quickly comes over to me and asks what’s wrong. I can’t speak properly. Manage to get out I was talking to my ex, which she has no idea I’d had a gf. She asked if my gf had been nasty to me, I said no. She asked what had happened. I said I’d said stuff I shouldn’t have and that it was my fault she’d left me. My mum said it wasn’t but I was pretty sure it’s my fault.

My dad comes through and I try to explain but my mum does because it was just easier. My dad and I both being males are left to talk it out. He’s also a psychiatrist and helps treat depression. He says I should lie down on my bed. He then talks to me about his first girlfriends and he says the first proper girlfriend he had was when he was about 16-17. He’d had so called girlfriends before but they hadn’t been proper girlfriends. He’d also been heart broken and felt like shit. He said the thing you should try and do is spend more time with your friends and let try to let yourself be happy. 

That’s life tip number one: #LET YOURSELF BE HAPPY AS IT WILL BE EASIER TO GET THROUGH THE TOUGH TIMES.

And so after about another 20 mins of talking I felt the best I had since my ex and I had broken up. I went to sleep happy but woke up sad. That sense of people are there with you doesn’t last forever. But my parents time and time again over the next few months showed that they were there for me. Which leads me up to my second girlfriend. I’ll get into that another time because it’s about 2 am now and my fingers are tired of typing. Hope you’re all doing great.",11Nov2018,1
26,"Yeah the title says it all.

It's called ""The Cave"" and it's about this guy who finds a mysterious cave. The thing is, it changes your memory so he says that not everything will be accurate (my way to try and make it seem like it's a real recounting and helps cover for any plot holes I make)

So, any tips or tricks?",11Nov2018,1
28,"Recently, I broke up with my boyfriend, my longest relationships to date. I still care so much for him, especially since he was my first for a lot of different things, and since I still consider him a close friend...one of my only friends. It was hard for us to break up but after having a difficult discussion and sharing tears, we both ultimately agreed it was what was best for us. 

A few days after the breakup, during one of our ""daddy-daughter days"", my dad unknowingly took me to one of the last few places I spent with my ex, a particular specialty food store. I couldn't even step out of the car. I was just locked in place, hysterically crying, thinking over and over of different bits from that day my ex and I spent together. It seemed silly to be crying over a grocery store of all places but I couldn't help it. It really is the smallest things that make you think of the people you miss.

Today, I went there again, and I didn't cry. I managed to pick out a couple things for myself, and enjoyed getting to walk around. I still have a long way to go before my heart fully heals over. I'm new to heartbreak. I remind myself that I can always make new connections when the time is right, and I remind myself of the reasons we broke up in the first place--why this is a healthy change for me. 

I'm lonely, as I have no friends near me. My old college friends (all out of state) never reach out and it's starting to wear on me more than usual, now that the only person who I could talk to about my day and my worries and my moments of pride, who I could hug and hold and spend time with is gone. It's been killing me, not reaching out to him, even platonically, but I hope he's doing okay, and I want to give him the space he asked for. I hope that when some time has passed, that we can meet again as friends.

29,"So yesterday I just realised that I have stress, which was never really obvious to me despite my daily  experience with it. I always had these kind of stress-induced headaches that also could be triggered by overthinking, or when I’m extremely uncomfortable socially or physically. It was just always a thing that was there for me. And living in a hostile home environment does not help at all. Hostile meaning constant arguments, nags, and scoldings. The thing is, I don’t want to become a rebellious child, I wanna make sure I’m going down the right path with my character. In contrast, taking things with a pinch of salt **does** reduce my rate of headaches and stress, but it makes me a more carefree, nonchalant person. Which isn’t necessarily a good thing when you are required to do chores, do homework, study, etc. I can’t just say “I won’t stress over it” whenever a task is assigned to me. Can I? Sure, sometimes my parents’ nags **do** make sense, but should I ignore them to reduce my stress? And yeah, I have talked to them before, and it didn’t work out so well. Actually talked to them quite a lot about how this lifestyle of non-stop arguing isn’t any good for my social and academic development, but they take it with a pinch of salt. They are very stubborn and I feel, egoistic, that they can’t accept that what they’re doing is affecting their children (yes I have a younger sister). I just hope some of you here can help me and guide me on what actions should I take to not only reduce my stress, but also change the attitude of the home I live in.",11Nov2018,1
30,"I don't expect anyone to legitimately read the text wall but boy this is good to get off my chest, and before you ask, yes, everyone involved is still alive. (Located in PA) 

The background:
My ex best friend, M, had a really tumultuous relationship with an awful guy that we'll refer to as C. M absolutely loved C, but he didn't love her back; he'd just text her between breakups for an easy hookup and play her like a violin, saying he loved her and only wanted her but when he got his fill he would tell her she was crazy and ugly and all matters of horrendous things. Rinse and repeat, about 4-5 years.

Holidays of 2016, he had just broken up with some blonde model girl while overseas in Korea and started texting M again. She fell right back into the pit. When C came back from deployment he attended the house parties and social events just to see and talk to M again, and then he moved to Colorado to a military base. After just a few days of having been talking to her again, he told her he wanted to get married. She was completely convinced for whatever reason that this time around, he had changed. We ended up discovering later, and her getting audio proof, that he only did that so he could get military benefits from having a spouse and that she was the only person he could think of who would drop her entire life in an instant for him.

I begged and pleaded with her not to go but the very next day after he asked her this, M hopped a plane to Colorado and it was all down hill from there. They got married in a courthouse that week and the abuse was pretty much instant. At one point he'd literally beaten her black and blue, and when they were rough housing he grabbed her by the hair and smashed her face into the ground repeatedly and told her she had fucked up teeth. He wouldn't let her leave the house without makeup on. I was horrified at this information and just wishing she would cut him off, and still can't figure out why she won't. Neither me nor her family could talk sense into her. 

When they came to visit for Christmas 2016, I became aware of the fact that C had cheated on her here in PA 3 weeks into the marriage. M was not the one who told me; it was a mutual friend who mentioned it and I believe M didn't tell me because she didn't want me to hate C (too late, really). I didn't gain an opportunity to talk to her about it while she was still visiting so I finally texted her a week later, just around New Year's. I told M that the unhealthy relationship had gone on long enough and she needed to get out of Colorado and come home, and that he was disgusting for how he has treated her for years and this abuse is the icing on the cake. 

Here's the kicker; instead of her responding to me, she gave her phone to C and let him text me, in which he promptly told me to drink bleach and slit my wrists, and he threw a bunch of personal issues back in my face that he wouldn't have known unless M had talked shit on me, which is probably what hurt the most. The woman who I had thought was my most loyal friend and who I considered a sister had betrayed many things I had thought she kept secret, and I finally ditched the friendship. The fact that she let him do that and directed him to do so, especially so maliciously, showed me where I stood in her life. 

I couldn't even tell the difference between the awful things he was telling me and what she was telling him to say. I couldn't handle so many stressors in my life caused by her, including her staying with him despite the way he treated her, me crying at night worried about if she was safe 2,000 miles away from me, me always being the ugly friend no matter where we had gone in the past (which was another personal issue I was battling that for the most part was no fault of her own), it was literally M's life and I was always a background character. I know she enjoyed the attention she got or the ""I win"" factor from marrying a man that was sought out by many other women and who was extremely popular online. 

This may make me seem like a shitty friend, but I was burnt out from worrying about her and couldn't handle it anymore. At this point, she was a completely different person and was acting more like him than herself. Nasty and abusive. I spent so long trying to get her to leave him alone once and for all and she'd always go back, and at some point you have to call it quits.

Fast forward about 8 months later, August of 2017, and I was meeting up with M's sister for lunch, A, who I am also good friends with. A brings M with her to lunch and it's the first time I had seen M in about a year. I didn't speak with her much but I was very civil during lunch. I did take note that she looked terrible. Bags under her eyes, sallow skin, and she had lost so much weight it was terrifying. She looked like a skeleton. I gave A and M a hug and when I picked up M (I am a very tall woman so I usually pick up my friends when I hug them) she was as light as a feather and couldn't have weighed any more than 80 pounds. That night I told my boyfriend about it and just cried and cried because to this day I do still worry about M and if she is okay but I just can't be friends with her after what she did and I can't get wrapped up in the soap opera that is her life. Her family and I did make attempts to report the abuse but apparently nothing could be done since M would never say a word against C.

So this is the fraction of my story and I wonder if she thinks about me too and if it was worth it to her to lose her best friend over a guy like that. I've heard several times that they are divorcing but they always end up back together. I'll believe it when I see it. I just wanted her to be happy and healthy and I guess it just didn't work out.

32,"My dad is not the type to say I love you. Many of us have dads like this, and for me it seemed it took a long night of drinking wine to get a 'You know I had a tough childhood and a poor relationship with my father, but I love you son' out. But even if the most direct affection I got was head rub while sitting on the couch that was okay. Because he put a roof over my head, and always made sure I was taken care of. He worked his ass off at work to make sure we could live in a good neighborhood, with good schools. He took me on vacation, and took me out to eat. He would take me to basketball games, even though he himself couldnt name anybody but Lebron or Kobe. We shared a million experiences together, and talked about our passions, and our dreams. We would make dinner together, put on Frank Sinatra, and talk about the economy, or politics, or gossio, or the movies, or whatever was on our minds. When I didnt get played much in 3rd grade basketball, he spoke to the coach very sternly that 'we are going to have a problem if I dont start seeing my son on the court'. Now that my childhood is over, it's a lot easier to see that most of what he did, he did for me. Even if I havent said it much either. I love you, Dad.",11Nov2018,1
33,"So I’ve stumbled upon a strange predicament on iTunes. I found this album I liked called Double Dragon on YouTube, a synthwave album. The genre of this is important. I went ahead and looked it up on Apple Music to see if the artist had any more music. Apparently it was produced by an artist named Soryu, and they’re quite a versatile band. Apparently they’ve made this album, two hip hop albums, and three heavy metal albums, some in french, some in English. This was pretty puzzling to me, so I looked up each one. Apparently there is an Australian heavy metal band called Double Dragon, on their Wikipedia page it includes the 3 metal albums I saw on iTunes, but strangely enough, on their google page, it shows one of the french hip hop albums, “Start”. I went to the synthwave Double Dragon’s bandcamp and found that album was their first self titled one. Additionally, their about page simply said “Scituate, Rhode Island” which would lead one to believe that’s where they were from, except that some of the titles to their songs were french, even though they were then sung in English. Okay, maybe it’s just an aesthetic choice. I couldn’t find anything on the hip hop people, only that they had two albums, one entirely in french and one in English, which would lead me to believe they’re different groups entirely. Okay, Double Dragon was a famous video game in the ‘80s. It could be some insane coincidence that there are possibly 4 groups named that. The thing I’m most confused about is why Apple said the artist name for every single one of these albums was “Soryu”. That word isn’t mentioned ever in any of those albums or groups, and I don’t understand the significance of it. I’m stumped as to what’s going on here. ",11Nov2018,1
34,"So let me give you some backround knowledge about whats going on in my life (ignore my bad English, im horrible at English, sorry)

So basically I'm from saudi Arabia and I'm gay! For those who dont understand why this is a problem, well..... Look up lgbt right in saudi Arabia! They'll will kill me or tortured me for a couple of year's. But I think they only kill you with the consent of my family, and my family is really religious. They are also sexist.

Another problem is that saudi Arabia is also really religious (Islam) but i dont believe a single thing about islam (I'm sorry if you are offended by that, I just really dont believe in Allah, please dont get offended or try insulting me) and they will also kill me or torture me. And I'm scared that they will.

I really want to date this girl in my class or make a move but I'm really scared. I'm also a minor so i cant do anything get and I currently live in america but I will move back to saudi arabia soon because I'm not a offical citizen. 

I'm really scared and i don't know what to do, I'm thinking of commiting suicide (if they ever find out) cause this is all stressing me out. I've never heard of someone from saudi arabia thats gay having a happy ending. I just need some advice of what i should do cause I'm scared and I don't know what to do.",11Nov2018,1

36,"This started last year, actually exactly last year. There was my crush and a movie we were talking about was coming out that week, all her friends said she liked me and all my friends said she liked me. So being 16, naive and a hopeless romantic I asked her out, at first she said yes and I was elated, I ran home that day. Fast forward 3 hours she makes some dumb excuse as to why she couldn't go. I was hurt sure, but I figured that I could move on. Then there was a party that weekend, a party which I struggled to get invited to which already hurt my fragile self confidence but hey maybe it would help me feel better about her saying no. So I go, to find that she has told her friends, who are my friends to stop talking to me and to help her by keeping me away. Fine that hurts a bit but I can live. Then she begins binge drinking, shes never drunk before and now shes pretty fucking drunk. Okay fineeee maybe she doesn't like me at alll and shes trying to drink to forget.  Then she becomes lesbian which thanks to my growing ego I believe was because I was ""that bad"". Some other assholes in my school the week after of course give me shit for this but I just laugh along. This pretty much breaks me.

I didn't realize that I was becoming the asshole, it didn't happen overnight and I only saw it now. I slowly started becoming more self centered, believing that people did things because of me. My anxiety went mad and I slowly started believing the idea that everyone was out to get me or thinking about getting rid of me. I started whining about how sad I was to my friends, not like asking for help, but being miserable, complaining about it and doing nothing to fix it. This just slowly intensified for the rest of the year. To make matters worse, to satisfy... my needs, my taste in pornography started becoming depraved and frankly when I look at it now, sick. I started incorporating people I know into my sick fantasies as well. I start doing stupid things to be ""funny"" or 'relevant"" in the vain hope that my friends don't just ditch me, I started becoming louder but with bouts of misery in the middle where I would clamp up and not talk to anyone so they would notice me and ask what's wrong .This all happened over a few months. The story above might not even be the real reason i'm like this, it could just be the excuse I've used to justify my deplorable behavior recently. I also now have no motivation to do well in school, I just sit on my laptop accomplishing nothing, browsing reddit, youtube , video games or looking at fucking porn.  

I've moved to a new school and i'm starting to see the affects of my self centered whining and paranoia, i'm seeing my old friends starting to cut me off though this might just be the paranoia I don't know anymore.  Did I mention the paranoia? The intense paranoia where I assumed that even my closet friends were against me? There was a lot of that, which is also made worse by the fact that one of my friends also stopped talking to me for like 5 months. The thing is, this isn't constant, I can be generally okay ""funny"" guy but there will be episodes where I become the asshole described above. To make matters worse it's just dawned on me that the new friends in my new school i'm making are probably part of the ""bad crowd."" The bright side of this, the only bright side is that I have realized this and I have time to steer this sinking ship around and end this shit show.  The recent post about that father and his incel son have really opened my eyes to what i'm becoming

37,"I'm not writing this because my family is mean, abusive or anything like that. I'm writing this because I feel so... estranged from the people I live with.  There's a story behind this, a long one, and I need to get it off my chest.

  
My parents immigrated to the U.S. before I was born, and they're in their late 40's now. My dad was finishing up med school when they had me, their baby boy, and I was important to them. They were so proud of how smart I was; It was pretty obvious I was really intelligent before I even turned one. Right before I turned two my sister came along. My sister and I drove the residents in the apartment above us nuts when we would play, even if I don't remember it much I know it was a good time for the most part. The bad parts were when my parents yelled at each other. They would get mad a lot.

  
Around when I started kindergarten is when the mess began. Right before school started, my youngest sister was born. I started kindergarten at a private school, and this was the time my parents started working extra hard to start their business and pay for everything. The babysitter I had before turned into a full-time nanny, and I started not seeing my parents much. My little sister was a nightmare at this age: her terrible twos lasted into third grade. She specifically hated me, and we would fight all the time. I actively avoided her when I could. Since my parents weren't home and I've always been really smart, I could solve most of my issues on my own. It was at about this time we got a new computer, and it quickly became ""my"" computer because I would use the most by far. Google was my most reliable source for anything I needed help with since my parents always either got home late or were busy. I also learned about flash games early on, and I'd play tons of those. It was around this point I stopped listening to my parents. They weren't home most of the time so they hardly ever noticed any negative behavior. When they did notice, they weren't home enough to enforce any kind of consequences. I would stay up for hours and hours reading whatever I could get my hands on. Most nights I didn't get more than 4 hours of sleep. The last thing relevant for this part of my life is my diet. In pre-school, I was a scrawny kid who would barely eat. My parents would do anything to get me to eat, and after a certain point they stopped caring what I ate as long as I ate it. As a result, I went from borderline anorexic to obese in under a year. I've always been slightly shorter than average, but I was over 100 pounds (45.4 kilos) by 3rd grade.

&amp;#x200B;

In first grade is probably when I started showing signs of Autism. I started to become anti-social, mostly on the grounds that I thought other kids weren't interesting. It was also in first grade that I got a Wii and a DS, and those soon became how I'd spend most of my time. The few friends I did make were my friends solely because of video games. Everything I've been talking about went on all the way through elementary school, just with subtle changes here and there. My relationship with my middle sister was downright abusive until about when I started 6th grade. My youngest sister and I got close, she's the only person in my family I ever really talk to. My parents still didn't really show up unless there was a school event like a class play or one of those ""graduations"" used to make kids feel like they're growing up. My Autism kept getting more noticeable, and I'd get made fun of by the other kids. Fortunately, I was too socially oblivious to care. I would breeze through school without even trying, and use my homework as an excuse to stay up as late as I wanted. Looking back, this was 100% a product of my ADHD. My parents never even batted an eye when I was up until 12 AM doing ""homework."" During long vacations, my parents would take the whole family out for trips to places like Disney World or Niagara Falls, but they weren't home enough during the rest of the year for it to matter much. The few times they noticed my bad behavior, my dad would yell at me and roughen me up some, and that was it. I never wanted to listen to either of my parents. We were also trying to work on my weight. My dad would bring in a personal trainer twice a week starting in fourth grade. The trainer's name is Chris, and now he's my best friend.

&amp;#x200B;

When 6th grade hit, there were some transitions. My relationship with my middle sister got better once she stopped throwing temper tantrums over everything I did. I was more social by then; I had 3 friends I would hang out with consistently. I also started getting more work. My abysmal work ethic was starting to get in the way. 6th grade was when I got my first bad grades in any class. The signs of Autism were steadily showing more, but they didn't peak until the next year. I still worked out with Chris, albeit not quite as much since he was getting his degree now.

&amp;#x200B;

In 7th grade, things started going wrong. This was the year I had more homework than ever before, which meant now I wasn't just staying up late goofing around, I was staying up late trying to get all my homework done. But because of my ADHD, it would \*actually\* take me until 1-2 AM every night to focus enough to get it done. I was exhausted all the time... there was one time I fell asleep in the middle of class without realizing I was falling asleep. I got made fun of for that for weeks. I was also in the noisiest, worst behaved group in my grade for half of my classes. A common problem for people with Autism is an acute sensitivity to sensory stimuli. Things like bright lights and loud noises. For me, loud noises, and even worse, lots of different conversations overlapping at once while I'm trying to pay attention, were a \*huge\* issue. I was consistently not able to stay in class for longer than 20 minutes at a time by the end of the year. My grades were slipping, I hardly ever slept, and I started to get really anxious about my grades. There were times when my parents would try to get me to do my homework and I'd slip into a panic attack. Throughout all this I was playing League of Legends. I played it \*way\* too much, past the point of ""harmful addiction."" But it was the only coping mechanism I had. It was the one thing I looked forward to most days.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for 8th grade, probably the worst year of my life. I was a straight-A student across the board for 3 months. September, October, and November were pretty good overall... but I was breaking down. My work ethic had barely improved at all. Staying in class was emotionally exhausting. I still wasn't getting enough sleep. By December my body had had enough. I got hit with depression full force. One week I was getting ready for school and doing great in all my classes, the next I would only leave bed to go to a different bed or grab something to eat. For two straight weeks I refused to do anything but lay in bed to read or watch TV, or eat. Eventually, my parents got me out of the house to see a therapist, who I still see to this day. Almost right away my therapist picked up on my Autism since he has Aspergers. After December vacation ended, I started ""going to school"" again. That's in scare quotes because getting me out of bed was really difficult. It was less than a 50/50 shot that I would get out of bed, and nothing except literally dragging me out of bed would work. I was still fat, but I had built up a lot of muscle in my legs and core with Chris. It would take at minimum an hour every day to get me to leave the bed. 

&amp;#x200B;

At first, just going near the school building would send me into a full blown panic attack. I was legitimately terrified of going back to school to the point where I felt like the school building was out to kill me. At some point Christ started helping out in the mornings. He went through a similar rough patch when he was in middle school, and he knew I was a good kid. He wanted me to be all right, so he would come in \*every. single. morning.\* He would wrestle me out of bed and take me to school so my parents could drive my sisters and go to work. I have no clue what I did to deserve him, but he stuck by me no matter what. He's like the older brother I always needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout 8th grade I kept getting better. I still wouldn't show up to school half the time, and even when I did I didn't take half my classes, but I was getting better. My parents made sure to be there every step of the way, because despite how little they were home before then they still loved me dearly. In the spring I took a neuro-psych test, and the info in the report explained \*so much\* of why I had such a hard time in school despite being incredibly intelligent. My brain is either \*amazing\* or \*absolutely terrible\* at everything. I could keep going through the recovery process (I was a terribly angry 9th grader and an absurdly edgy/moody 10th grader) but by now you know enough to understand where I am today, and how much I've had to go through to get there.

&amp;#x200B;

The point of this long story is that I don't know how to deal with my parents. They're loving and supportive and do everything they can for me, but they entirely miss the point most of the time. They were only neglectful at first because they wanted me and my sisters to have everything we could financially. But now... I'm a senior in high school. On the rare days I have panic attacks in the mornings, my parents still don't know how to deal with it. My mother still ridicules my passion for video games no matter how many times I tell her that they're important to me. Ever since 1st grade, video games have been my main way of making friends. I've been trying for years just to get my parents to listen, and no matter what I try to say or how much they try to listen, there are certain things that they just... don't get. I grew up in a different country, surrounded by technology that was nowhere near existing when they were kids, I'm autistic and they're not, and I'm way smarter than they ever dreamed any of their kids would be. I don't know if they ever will understand me properly. Is there something I can do?  Do I just have to wait until I move out? 

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless, thanks for reading all the way through. Even if I don't get a single word of advice I needed to put this somewhere. There's something incredibly liberating about being able to post things anonymously.

38,"I have been with the same woman for 11 years. Since i was still a child. A few months ago, we decided to end the relationship. I wont go so far as to say it was a mutual decision, but it wasn't exactly on bad terms. Its been pretty hard on me, though. If not the relationship ending, then just the fact that i only see my daughter 2 days a week. 

Last night, she met the guy she has been talking to online, in person, for the first time. I had nightmares about it last night. Well, maybe they weren't exactly nightmares, but i sure couldn't sleep because of it. I've been stressing about it all week. I almost went to her door with some dumb excuse last night. Sometimes I fantasize that he stood her up, and that she isn't doing well this weekend, at all. Other times, I hope that its going great, and that my daughter might end up with another good father figure in her life. 

Seems like the only thing getting me through all this is my daughter. Getting to see her every weekend seems to be the only real happiness I feel lately. When she woke up and looked at me this morning it all seemed to just disappear. Shes only one, and she doesn't deserve to be the one getting *me* through anything. I've got to get through this, be more resilient, for her.

44,"I live in the middle of nowhere Nebraska and I love basketball and my friends do to. We are one of the only all white teams that can play in top divisions at big tournaments. 

This today we played in one of the biggest tournaments of the year in Omaha Nebraska and we played against 2 all black teams. We played the first team clean game no arguing between teams.

But in the next game against a different all black team we were beating them 47-20 with about 10 minutes left. And then every time my teammates and I would run down the court the other team would go “What’s up country ass fag boys” and “ White trash piece of shit go pick some corn”, and lots of other things.

But what frustrated me the most was that I knew I couldn’t say anything back. If I called them a “city slicker” or a “Nigger” it would have been a news story.

We lined up for some free throws toward the end of the game and I was standing by the ref and one of the players on the other team goes. “Hey white boy let me get this board or I’ll knock your country ass back to a cornfield”. 

The ref (who was black) obviously heard it and just chuckled. We went down the court after my friend made the shots and he said something and I look at him and tell him to shut the fuck up.

The same ref who chuckled at him insulting me and my teammates all game stopped the game and gave me a technical foul. (For those of you who don’t know a foul on steroids). 

The ref had a conversation with me and the other kid and I told him about what they had been saying the whole game and he said “I don’t care”.

Later we were shooting more free throws because they kept fouling because they are assholes and one of them shoved my friend the stepped on him and then fell on his leg. He limped off the court and still can barely walk.

46,"Hi all.  I've been struggling since the 27th and want to be able to just talk about it without burdening my family.  
On October 27th I got woken up from texts from my mom saying, ""911."" Within the first 15 minutes of me being awake I found out that my step-dad had passed away suddenly. 
He had gotten bilateral hip surgery done on the 3rd of October and was doing fantastic, he could walk on his own and feel very minimal pain while doing so.  I can't describe how heavily this hit me. When my mom called me and said he was gone I kept repeating, ""No no no."" I began to scream and began to sob, I'm sure that me screaming and crying wasn't pleasant for my roommates to wake up to. I can barely remember getting out of bed and throwing on a shirt and jeans,  I ran to my car and called my work crying to tell them I couldn't go in. I could barely breathe or see, I'm not sure how I even made it to the hospital.  

I opted to see my step-dad's body to say goodbye one last time, I fell to my knees seeing him, lifeless and cold.  His fingernails were blue, his ears were blue. I didn't even know that ears turned blue when someone passed.  I tried my best to keep his hands warm,  I stayed by his side for an hour, sobbing.  

I screamed, I cursed, I cried and I continue to do this when I am alone. My biological dad is no longer in my life and my stepdad was in my life for almost a decade.  

The hardest part of all of this is, my mom is on nothing. She is not on his bank account, the mortgage or loan for the house, the cars.  Nothing was in writing. I've been fundraising for her since the first night and doing everything in my power to be her rock.  She had to pay over 5 thousand upfront for guardianship papers for my 14 year old stepbrother.

Whenever I get to a job I alert management that I'm starting work so people can be aware of whats going on but more often than not they don't notify any of the employees so I occasionally get interrupted and questioned. 

Not always a big problem but on this day I was around back of this place doing my job and there were some other employees working out there. One of the guys notices me and his whole posture immediately changed and he yells out at me to stop while he bears down and starts asking who I am and what I'm doing. Thankfully he relaxed when I told him what I was there for but the second he had raised his voice and put on the aggressive posture I felt my eyes prickle and almost started to cry. 

Any time I've been in a situation that's mildly intimidating like this I can immediately feel my heart speed up, tears form, and all of my muscles tense up. I don't know if it's an anxiety thing or what but I really wish I could get it under control. Once the feeling starts it puts me on edge for the rest of the day at least and makes me feel like my guts are being twisted up. I'm very rarely able to pull back into a calm and carefree mood. God forbid the tears start actually falling because then I'll be involuntarily crying all day, unable to speak without choking up, and suffering secondary crying spells for days to come.

49,"Me and my mom have a weird relationship. She's been unstable for as long as I can remember and caused me constant pain throughout my childhood. 
She was an alcoholic and a single mother. Brought strangers into the house, experimented with drugs and left me alone to go out and party. I saw her blacked out drunk to many times to remember, even roofied, and watched her threaten to kill herself in front of me at least 5 times. 
But one thing I did that never makes sense to me to this day, is that I covered for her. I covered for her 24/7. I lied to people I loved so she wouldn't get in trouble and didn't cause riffs in the family. I was a people pleaser and didn't want people to be upset because of my expense. So I thought if I hurt alone and lied it would be best for everyone in this situation. 
And above all, I loved her. I loved her so much, even tho I hated her more than I could hate anyone. I know that makes no sense, but when she caused me pain, I hated her with my whole soul.... but at the end of the day I love her. 
I still wish that I would have stood up for myself and the abuse a lot sooner. It would have stopped so much faster. 
I am now grown and moved out and our relationship is still estranged because of what has happened, but I no longer have to live in an unstable home and it's refreshing. I feel so happy.

I sat down at my desk and opened my porn folder. I scroll through all the weak nonsense such as hentai and loli until I get to my futa furry toddler nugget porn. I start jerking it and within two minutes I was covered in my own seed. 

The speed at which I wanked made me incredibly tired so I laid down and went to sleep, hoping to dream of My Little Pony and their tight pussies. 

I suddenly wake up and am very itchy. I look down in horror to see hundreds of little ants crawling over me, eating the sweet, sweet semen. The feeling of their little feet walking all over me was enough to make me bust again. This time, however, they noticed the source of the sweet nectar. They began forming lines and burrowing themselves into my foreskin. I arched my back and moaned loudly as they nibbled the head of my penis. 

They began to go into my urethra and make little ant nests in the residue. I was thrashing on my bed because I wanted to nut again but I couldn't. My mom walks in to see this and she screams in horror. As soon as I turn my head to look, I busted the hottest, fattest nut I ever have. An explosion of ants rocket out of my penis and all over the floor.

I know a lot of people are calling him fake, like how the timeline doesn't match up when he says ""The last straw was this week"" then proceed to describe what happen last year but that's irrelevant, real people like this exist. My brother was one of them and it felt like reading what happened to my brother. 

I have always been a pretty troll-y brother and we'd joke up these things ironically. But it didn't occurred to me how deep in it he was, that day when he confided in me and told me he was an incel. I thought he was fucking with me, I mean, look at me, I was his older brother and I got one without even trying (she was totally out of my league but I guess something just connected). 

Although I was pretty suspicious of that from how much he smelled, I'd told him ""You smell like a fucking incel, a deodorant is like ten bucks"". But he insists on not getting one, I kept asking him why, he said it was not worth it and he wouldn't be able to get a girlfriend anyway. I bought the deodorant for him anyway and forcefully sprayed him and his room while he was playing Warcraft. 

So one day, we were at home, I was making out with my girlfriend on the couch and I joked to him that he can watch while he jerks off but of course I meant he should stay in his room. It was funny until I saw him actually there as I was about to perform intercourse. His face looked red and he was shaking. I zipped my fly up as we both awkwardly got up. 

""Dude, stay the fuck there. Don't come any further. I was kidding about watching, get your ass up."" 

He was mumbling something under my breath as my girlfriend frustratedly get dress and began to menacingly whisper in my ear about what the fuck was going on. She hasn't gotten acquainted with my little brother and didn't know he was an incel, I mean, I didn't believe it either so at this point I was as shock as her. 

Suddenly he began taking off his clothes and pants while screaming ""GIMME SEX!"" at the top his lung, throwing his hands down as his face turned red, it was horrid, I was speechless, beyond shock and mortified. It was so comical but it occurred to me that this was my little brother now, my sweet little brother has been turned into this unapologetic and confrontational incel beast. He began to hump my girlfriend in an awkward and confusing way, she was a feminist trained in MMA and black belt in Krav Maga, but she was so confused that she forgot to be disgusted. I finally got a grip from how confusing and stupid that was and violently shoved him away. 

Immediately, I yelled at him. 

""Maybe you should use that fucking confidence to do such perverted and demented shit to get a fucking girlfriend! YOU FUCKING MORON!""

then he was like 

""NO! I CAN'T FUCKING DO THAT!""

At that moment, I knew he was a lost cause but the big brother in me still felt guilty for not knowing this. My girlfriend told me afterwards she thought that this was like a prank for Youtube, and that was why she laughed the whole way through our exchange but I shit you not, as surreal this is, it happened.

""WHY?""

""I AM AN INCEL.""

""WHAT?""

So at that moment, I actually thought, okay, there is no fucking way this is real but as he continued

""I HAVE NO SEX CAPITAL, SEX COMMUNISM! THE BOURGEOISIE WOMEN MUST STOP OPPRESSING US PROLETARIAN MEN! 

At this point I was convinced that it wasn't real. 

""You know humping my girlfriend was too much even if you are fucking me, you know that right?"" 

""I LIKE UNDERAGED GIRLS."" He yelled confusingly again. 

We were both panting from shouting so much, so I didn't thought there would be any sudden movement. But he leapt like a predator to her, huffing like the predator that he was and decided that he wants to hump her again. Finally I decided that I had to defend her honor because I don't know why it didn't occurred to me the first time he was humping her and only decide to defend her honor the second time. Either way I defended her honor. 

I slugged him mid-air in the face and he was out cold. I immediately went to his room and unlocked his computer because obviously he was too dumb to lock his computer and phone with a password. I found 20 TB of Chinese cartoon child porn in it. Needless to say I immediately called the FBI, but next thing I know they were already here and Chris Hansen was there too. It was all very surreal. Anyway this was what happened during Christmas last year this week. Coincidentally enough. ",11Nov2018,1

55,"So I’m a freshman in college, (18M). My roommate once again was hanging around his gf way too much, or she wanted his attention idk. But the point was that they had to cuddle up in my dorm room again and spend all of the night together. Note this is especially annoying towards me considering that I had a breakup back in August where neither of us are talking regularly to each other. It’s especially frustrating considering that we both agreed on staying friends, but yet I’m the only one who has somewhat initiated being 3+ hours apart. She says that it’s “her busy” schedule but I know that’s total bullshit considering that roomies gf is working two jobs, full college workload and has time to cuddle with him every night (My ex is a hs senior).

Anyways on to what I made the title about, I my friends from hs called to FaceTime last night (shout-out iOS 12.1) while roomie and gf were in the room. Basically, they could hear everything in the background, but the couple couldn’t hear anything they were saying (I had headphones in). Long story short, absolutely hilarious shit they were saying about roomie and gf. For the past month and 1/2, I was the only person who got to regularly see and deal with this. They didn’t care that I was facetimeing either, she still snuggled up to him and tried to have clothes sex after he fell asleep. We mocked them while they were sleeping together by blasting different selections of music that they picked out for me to play.

Overall, it was so nice to finally feel like there was people with me (even though it was virtual) while that damn couple was together in my room. I would feel shitty and down way too much when I was just on the other side alone watching them snuggle and laugh. And both roomie and gf are both nice people, it just that the shit gets tiring after a while. So glad I have such great close friends from home.

TL;DR- Friends helped me feel good about putting up with tiring roomie/gf situation

56,"In therapy recently Mr Therapist man says I need to organise my thoughts. And not to make rash decisions, which I might regret.
So, I was doing research into Jacksepticeye, and Markiplier, since I’d rather not support someone who seems like a H3H3, but turns out to be a SoFlo. And... I seen a lot of contrasting recounts, positive, yet also negative, about the two.

I’m not trying to find any reason to simply hate them and jump on a bad bandwagon, but if they genuinely bad, I don’t want to support them.

Is there something actually wrong with them? I know they’re not perfect, and most probably done something wrong, but is there something... really wrong?

TLDR: What genuine reasons do people have for disliking Markiplier, and Jacksepticeye?

59,"Like many people, I was once very active on all kinds of social media. I tweeted at least once a day and regularly posted to Instagram, Snapchat, and to a lesser extent Facebook. I recently took a two-year break from social media and upon returning I've seen its detrimental effects on society. From fostering narcissism and increasing vanity to creating massive political echo chambers, I believe social media is the reason for a lot of the social issues today. I believe it's far worse for our mental health than we currently understand. People base their self worth on how many likes/upvotes/whatever and have a constant need to publicize every thought for the gratification of others.

We already know some of the negative effects of social media, but I believe in the next few years there will be more studies showing us the toxicity of social media.",11Nov2018,1
60,"I admittedly phrased the title the most eye-catching, yet still true, way possible.

So at this time I was &amp; and “Jerry” was 10. Our ages give context. We aren’t/weren’t *completely* stupid...

It was the year 2000, summer or fall. I don’t remember exactly but the olympics were going on and I want to say they were coming to an end. I remember Michele Kwan from the winter. That last sentence is pointless and adds nothing to this story.

Anyway, I slept over a lot at my grandparent’s house when I was growing up. In fact this is the same house I live in now. And now I remember it was still summer because “Jerry” (stabber) comes over pretty much every weekday morning at like 6am. His mom had to pass our grandma’s house on the way to work and grandma was free babysitting. 

Myself and Jerry were extremely close up until a 4 years ago. We were basically brothers growing up, and he was two years older. I looked up to Jerry a lot. He was a very good baseball player and our family is really into baseball. I was never athletic so I looked up to him in that way. 

So Scotty shows up at our grandma’s house and woke me up at 6am when he gets there because Scotty is the devil.

He’s super excited on this particular day about having seen the Olympic “javelin” event. 

I didn’t know wtf that word meant but Scotty was excited about so I was already sold on that shit. But I couldn’t let him know that he’d captured my sense of wonder so I just bullshitted and pretended to be a fucking javelin aficionado.

And it’s great because he doesn’t know enough to call me on my shit. 

So the day is off to a stupendous start. Grandma made bacon.

After bacon Scotty asked if we could go outside and this part is where this whole ordeal is really my grandma’s fault. 

I still remember this exchange. Like I can still see and hear this unfolding in front of me:

&gt;Scotty: Grandma can we go outside?

&gt;Grandma: *very stern look for no reason* You can go to the side yard but ya’ll bet not go to that alley (behind the house)! Don’t go anywhere near there!

And I just remember wondering why she’s even mention the alley. We did this same routine 3-5 times a week for months and we never went back there. The alley was filled with garbage. It was literally just a big gross trashcan. People would throw old furniture, mattresses, clothes, shingles, whatever back there.

Got so bad the city bulldozes it “clean” once a year now.

But...why did she say anything about the alley? What’s back there that we can’t see? 

So of course the very first thing we do is go to the alley. 

Scotty finds a long piece of broke. Fence. It’s about 3 feet long and very thin. Imagine the staff on a golf club.

Words burned into my brain:

&gt;Scotty: wanna play javelin? 😏

He pretty much made the face the emoji is making. 

Pride is on the line now. So you goddamn right I wanna play javelin.

Things start off fine. We just stand about 10 yards away and throw this tetanus riddled hunk of metal back and forth at each other trying to get it to stab into the ground in front of the other person. 

Scotty starts raising the stakes and steps slightly further back and starts throwing it way harder and making fun of me because I couldn’t throw it as far. 

But it’s all in the technique because I ended up getting a great throw off that went further than any of his had gone.

I had won. Or so I thought.

So now I’m talking shit to him like “yeah nigga I’m the javelin king and don’t you fucking forget it” (I didn’t use these words but this is how I was feeling at the time. 

Well, that was a mistake. Because Scotty launches that shit back towards me and I froze like a dear in headlights.

It plunged into my stomach just above my belly button and towards the left side of my body. 

So a few seconds (3-5) pass and I look back up at him with this thing still in me. The pain hasn’t hit yet and I’m just like “damn” in my head. 

And do you know what this motherfucker said to me...?

He puts both hands up, palms towards me in this posture that Steve Irwin would use when approaching a bear or some shit, and he says to me, with fucking conviction:

&gt;Scotty: I can fix this. 

And after he says that, the pain starts from me being fucking impaled, and anger bubbles up because no the fuck you cant fix it, Scotty, I don’t trust your decisions anymore. 

I yanked it out of me, ran inside screaming. 

Things got pretty hectic so the details escape me (I didn’t pass out or anything wild, but I was screaming and thought I was gonna die because of the blood and my grandma was fucking livid), but I did end up getting s few stitches and shots. 

My mom pretty much grounded me because we went to the alley. So I got stabbed and punished for it basically lol.

Scotty held this over my head (playfully) for years until one day it crystallized in my head and I said, “You stabbed me.” We laughed that day because that’s kind of hilarious.

62,It was in grade 6 i dont really know how but i became really good friends with a boy on grade 8. We were both gamers so we always had things to talk about. O followed him to his class one day (there's 5 boys in his class) he goes to his group of 3 friends introduces me we get along well. Im invited to their discord group and we talked about everything from girls to things we hated anything that came to our mind. Forgot to mention i go to a really controlling religious school and i hate it. Boys and girls cant be friends dating isnt allowed(for religious reasons that i still hate) if your caught being friends with a girl you'd get suspended. I became good friends with them we would play video games together all the time and it was a great time. Fast forward to summer i dont keep contact with the 8th graders during this time but i made friends with some boys joining the school soon through another friend on skype. They were gamers too we would play around 4 hours a day together and it was great we grew close before school started and when it started we grew even closer. Through my 2 existing friend groups from out of my class i became friends with majority of the grade 9s and all but 1 of the grade 10s(previously grade 8). Grade 8 was great i was friends with everyone i wanted to be friends with. The grade 10s were pretty good friends with the grade 11s these guys  were really funny. There's only 4 guys in the class but 1 of them idk something about it made me want to be good friends with him. Grade 8 was amazing. Summer after grade 8 the guys i met on skype were asked to leave the school and i was looking forward to hishschool with them cause wed have the same break times. Well we grew apart. I started gaming with my grade 10 friends and it was amazing. One day they invited some of the grade 11 guys to the discord group and they join us. Well we played from 10-1 everyone left the voice call 1 by one except the guys that i mentioned earlier. Let's call him J. J and me continued to play and talk and we laughed so hard we nearly woke up our parents. We did this every night me and J and sometimes another person from the group would join. We would play from 12-3 every night for the 3 weeks left of summer. I can confidently say that these 3 weeks were the happiest ones of my life i had so kuch fun. School starts im in highschool now me and J good friends still but he has lunch with the guys in his class and the grade 11s( these guys were the grade 8s) and i would have lunch with the guys in mine cause i felt outta place in that group and hey he can be with his friends and ill be with the ones in my class. Wed play every weekend still from 12-3 and still had fun. This is what changed it all ill call it the purge. The school is anti gay they kick out gay students ok cool no ones gay anyways our religion forbids it so no one really cares about their anti gay stance. Well now they think all the highschool guys are gay so they bring in all the guys parents 1 b1 1 questions them. They talk shit about J and give them a list of people i can be friends with. J is not on the list and they also threaten to expell me if they didnt put a parental monitoring program on my pc which tracks everything. I dont care about it get caught at 2 am with J they take everything the director said as true they think J's a predator who wants to fuck me. Me and J are still friends but not as close. We dont do late night gaming anymore and whenever i check discord at night i see all my friends playing together. Im really sad these past 2 months whenever when i would check the discord beofr going to sleep and i see them it makes me really sad. I even cryed myself to sleep these past few nights. I havent gamed with my friends for over 2 months. Ive started thinking if the future and i know im getting an arranged marriage i cant talk to the girl i like and im really sad. I know i dont get a say in my future relationships cause if my religion and i hate it. Most of this probably didnt make sense but i just needed somewhere to say this stuff. Also im in Canada not a third world country. I cant talk to girls cause of my religion unless their related to me or if its absolutely necessary. ,11Nov2018,1

64,"I've been in a deep depression since about 14 and nothing has pulled me out of it yet. Parents don't care or just never tried to help, no difference really. I always figured I'd be dead by my age since I used to participate in risky behaviors so I've had no life direction and no energy to try forcing my way out of that since. I wouldn't even know where to start.

It's so pathetic but things started to change a little for me once I discovered what an absolute ~~snack~~ inspiration Clancy Brown is. I feel like I have a reason to wake up and get out of bed, even if only to watch movies and shows he's in. I found the strength to get myself a therapist and an endocrinologist (for transitioning), and I'm going to get a psychiatrist to get me started on antidepressants, all things I didn't think I was capable of before. I've got a gf now who's just as into him as I am. I haven't drawn a single thing in 3-4 years, a passion I gave up on in the mindset that I'll never be good enough to do anything meaningful with it, but I'm starting to try again. Granted it's all drawings of him but it's a start. 

I'm just so worried I'm being gross, weird, creepy, stalkerish. I like every post he makes on Twitter, it's a bad habit, I have to check it daily. It's probably so unhealthy to be this fixated on one person that I have a whole ass group of friends on a few sites I talk to regularly who like him too. My only dream in life now is to one day create a cartoon he'd be willing to voice a large part in. I  couldn't stop my autistic tendencies from fixating on this man and I feel so obsessive and wrong, and the only way to right it is to quit all this and probably go back to the way I was before.

65,"and I have feelings about both sides.

As a 41-year-old woman who was born disabled physically, mentally and emotionally, I am very grateful I'm not the type who thinks I'm weak if I need a guy's help in anything. I was sexually abused by two men who literally told me women were only created for guys to have sex with them, to wash dishes, to cook, to clean the house, to have babies and stay home to take care of the babies.

I know a lot of women can't physically or mentally do the same things as their male coworkers but they want equal paychecks. A lot of men don't have what it takes to be a stay-at-home parent and a lot of women don't have what it takes to get a job outside of the house. It is what it is. I think a lot of miscommunication has happened over time causing a lot of unnecessary misunderstanding.

Yes, we deserve to be respected, even if we don't have the necessary equipment to be members of the P&amp;T club. But for as long as humanity has existed, gender skills and smarts have \*not\* been equal, but we still deserve to be treated with love and respect.

I had to wait most of my life for a gadget to be made to open cans with pop up tabs because I can't open them with my own fingers. I have not been too proud to be a female to ask a male to open up the cans for me. I have had to wait most of my life for a gadget to be made to open jars and before that, I had to ask others, guys or girls, to open the jars for me. A man, not a woman installed my chair lift. My sister's male friend installed my shower head that my mom couldn't install.

I understand the gist of gender-equality discussions and think it's much-needed in this world where many males are gender jerks, same with many females.

I am not weak for wanting and needing a man's help in life. Both my dad and my stepdad have been strong enough to carry me when I couldn't walk. None of the females in my family are strong enough to carry me. No, I'm not fat.

I'm not weak for admitting I need a man's help. Getting mental or physical help from a man does not victimize me. If anything, I think I am wiser for recognizing it's okay to ask others for help and not limit it to only females. I also do like that there is awareness about this issue because there are still both males and females who don't see the pros of having life with both males and females inhelping one another.

I will not be afraid to ask my husband in the future to help me out. I hope my husband is not afraid to ask me for help on things to.",11Nov2018,1
66,"Up through my mid high school years, my dad was emotionally and physically abusive and I’m still uncovering and learning how to deal with the aftermath of it all. Part of which is feeling unsafe expressing my thoughts and feelings due to shaming.

Long story short, I’m having a house built and officially “living” with my parents until it’s finished, but staying with my boyfriend 5 or 6 days a week because it’s a much easier place to be and he’s half the distance to work. My boyfriend comes from a family who’s very open about loving and missing each other and are very warm and accepting. Even though my dad has gotten professional help and is no longer abusive, we are still not an “I love you” family by any means and he hasn’t made an effort to fix or even acknowledge our strained relationship.

I have been trying really hard to stay engaged emotionally with my boyfriend and be open and honest and vulnerable with him. I’ve known him for going on 6 years now, dating going on 5 months, and I have made huge strides in communication, vulnerability, and honesty with myself concerning the things I feel and my emotional needs. I still have a long way to go, but seeing my parents once a week makes it ever so apparent how much I’ve grown in a few short months. But that unfortunately doesn’t make it any easier.

I’ve started to notice how much was missing from my childhood and how much is still missing in my relationship with my parents (more so my dad) today. The problem being I’m terrified to be the one to bring it to the table. That whole thing about not feeling safe to express my thoughts and emotions? It’s difficult enough with other people, and even my loving and supportive boyfriend, but with my family it’s absolutely debilitating. I see a therapist semi-regularly and she has recommended bringing him in for a session, but I can’t even bring myself to ask him to go. I have no doubt that he would, which might even make it more terrifying. I crave affection. I crave appreciation. I want to feel wanted by my family and I just don’t.

I think I needed to just blurt my thoughts out about this. I’m really just frustrated that I have to fight through deep rooted fears (that are a direct result of my father’s actions) to repair a relationship that my father himself broke.

Life isn’t fair, dude.

69,"This happened today, well, earlier today, approximately 4-9 PM MST on November 10th, because it will probably be 12 AM or later by the time I post this. 

At my school, one of the families that everyone in the area knows hosted a gala. It wasn't a super special type of gala, it was mainly just one on dating and relationships. The man running the event gathered the boys (and young men) in one room in the school (a place we call Siberia because it's cold as hell), while his wife gathered the girls in the library.

There is this one girl in my class (who I shall not name), we're both in grade 11, and we're both pretty short for our grade. I'm roughly 5'4"" (yes I'm a manlet, I know), while she's roughly 5'2"". For quite some time now, I've been able to tell that she has had a crush on me for a while now (talks sarcastically to me quite a bit, smiles when we make brief eye contact, etc.). I like her back, but have never really been able to ask her out.

Failed Opportunity #1: After each group had their first session, we had a break time where we could do whatever (everyone went to the gym). She managed to single herself out for a decent period of time, but my friend who shot himself in the foot (which is a story for another day) kept trying to annoy me with his wheelchair, so I wasn't able to approach her.

After that we had a few games, both groups would periodically try to make the other gender smile/laugh to win. I try to be a well-mannered guy most of the time, so I broke down after a while (one of my friends kept his cool with at least 30 girls trying to get him to laugh). This game was followed by another session.

The first session was where both genders would write questions (relationship related or not) on a small piece of paper. The second session is where we answered the questions that the other group had for us. After this, we had another do nothing half-hour/hour. Mind you, this whole gala was 11 hours.

After that, there was a third session. It wasn't really special, just discussion about standards and boundaries in dating. By the time it was over, we had a tiny bit of time left to do nothing before the guys got into their suits, and girls got into their dresses. 

After everyone got ready, the guys, based on grade groups (I'm Canadian, so grades 10, 11, and 12 are senior high at my school). Juinor boys would seat one or more junior girl/s, and the same went with the seniors (19 boys total to 30 odd girls). It was random who got who, so I went along with it, complemented the ones that I had to seat and went on.

Since we were supposed to be gentlemen, we carried in appetizers, the salads, then the main dish, first to the women, then for ourselves. Once that was over, it was pictures.

Failed Opportunity #2: First up were the group pictures. I wasn't the tallest nor the shortest for the guys, so I was put into the middle row. Then came the other pictures. I wanted to ask the girl from before if she wanted to have our picture taken, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Afterwards, she again had singled herself out, so I went up to her, and made small talk. (I contemplated on how she looked good, she did the same to me). I could haved asked her right there, but the spaghetti fell out of my pockets before I could even think about asking her out.

Failed Opportunity #4, 5, and 6: After pictures, we started to clean up around the school to return it to normal. As I was helping to move folding tables, chairs, and other misc. items, the girl singled herself out again almost every time I was carrying things. It kind of felt on purpose, but kind of not at the same time. I know she's not clumsy or friendless, she's smart and knows what to do all the time. Anyways, I wasn't able to talk to her other than a little bit of small talk every now and then as I was helping clean.



TL;DR, I wasn't able to ask out a girl (one that happens to like me) 6 times over an event about dating.

70,"Yesterday I was cleaning a public restroom at work and got pricked by something behind the toilet. It was the same kind of pin-point wound you get from a finger prick from a doctor. I didn’t find a sharp or anything solid, let alone anything that I thought could make a wound like that. 
I would normally not be so concerned, but there is a homeless encampment not far from where I work with at least a small population of addicts. It’s getting cold, so more people want to do drugs inside and not in tents. Just a week ago I had to trespass someone (who was a freaking asshole) for shooting up in the restroom (sharp was surrendered to security) and taking so long the automatic light went off. I did all the paperwork as a work injury and stuff to cover my butt just in case something crazy awful comes of it, of course.

So glad I got my tetanus shot last year when I stepped an inch and a half into a sewing needle. Not the normal kind, either. The still pointy but thicker embroidery kind. I was too stress-sweaty to pull it out with my fingers. I didn’t want to move across the floor all the way to find a pliers, so I got a thread from closer by threaded it and pulled it by the thread. The whole experience was gross and weird. I hadn’t sewn in a very long time and definitely not right next to the kitchen where I stepped on it.

Thing is, needles don’t bother me. I’ve got some piercings and tats, including some painful and nsfw places and am always planning more. I donated plasma regularly when broke, too. They just don’t like me back, I guess.",11Nov2018,1
71,"I’m 18 years old now living on my own for university. Growing up I’d never really found an interest in masturbating; it just seemed like a hassle and a mess, and I didn’t want to get addicted to it or let it consume me or anything. I still got horny on occasion, but I would usually just think about a crush or something and got a boner, which was enough for me. I never watched porn because I was too scared of my parents finding out. I don’t ever recall having more than one or two wet dreams every few months.

I was also pretty reserved (i.e. awkward) socially throughout high school but managed to get myself in a relationship with a girl a year older in the summer of 2017. She was really into making out and cuddling and I found out that I was too, and I believe that if we had continued dating after that summer we would have started having sex.

I moved to a new city five hours away for university and vowed to be more outgoing and social, and I figured the best place to practice non-committal casual conversation was Tinder. I actually found moderate success on there and girls started actually being interested and asking for sex.

The premise of having sex had now dawned on me and I became very anxious and insecure about my capabilities because I’ve never jacked off. My friends who know about it joke about how I’m “sexually deactivated” because I spent all of puberty rejecting any form of sexual exposure.

This month  I started exposing myself to porn and planned to eventually start masturbating to relieve my anxiety and just be “normal”, but I’ve had no success. Watching sex just isn’t arousing for me; the most success I’ve had is with jerk-off instruction videos because they feel more personal, I guess. But regardless of the means I can’t ejaculate or even produce much precum.

I feel like a sexually deficient freak and I’m worried that this will impact future relationships I have, because sex is now seemingly a given when dating around my age and I’m not sure how patient a girl can be with me not knowing what the hell I’m doing.",11Nov2018,1

As the title says, I’ve been keeping most of my friends in the dark about all my problems, and now I have no way to talk about them because I’ve internalized them so much.
I’m an open pansexual, closeted non-binary person in high school with some of the best friends, parents, and sister anyone could have. But I have so much trouble opening up to anyone because I’ve spent so long not talking about any of my problems. Everything was fine until I found out that the person I fancied was in a relationship.
Finding that out was completely devastating to me, and it sent my into a spiral that just seems to keep getting worse. And here’s the worst thing, no one knows that I’ve been getting worse and worse because I mask it and say I’m fine every time they ask, every day, every week and so on.
So here is my question for everyone on this subreddit, what do I do in this situation? I’ve opened up to one friend, but I still haven’t told him about most of what I’ve been going through. Should I open myself up to everyone else? Should I confess to the person I fancy so I get it off my chest, not expecting for them to drop their relationship for me? Or should I continue lying to everyone?

Tl;dr: I’m conflicted on whether I should talk to my friends about my problems because I’ve held them in for so long.",11Nov2018,1

77,"A recent, very sad story that's been making the rounds has encouraged me to come out with my own painful experience. This is something I've kept hidden, and it's something I've felt ashamed of as it made me feel like a failure as a parent. As a parent, you don't dream that your own beautiful children can turn into something so vicious and hateful. That the boy you were playing catch with a decade ago could devolve into an antisocial, misogynist, hateful monster. I tear up now just thinking about it, but there's just something that's motivating me to just ""get it out there"", and finally open up about this. Hopefully it will also help other parents who are suffering from the same situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start by just giving other parents and anyone else who isn't familiar a primer into these incel communities, as I've spent the last few months monitoring them, trying to understand this depraved world, and trying to understand how my own son got sucked into this filth. First, the word itself, ""incel"". ""Incel"" is supposed to be a portmanteau of ""involuntary celibate"" - it's supposed to just describe people who want to have sex, but consistently cannot for a variety of reasons. Under this definition, a very large chunk of men would fall into this definition. What is wrong is the demented reasoning these incels apply.

&amp;#x200B;

Incels like my son believe in this absurd theory that [""looks"" are all that matters](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19558447) when it comes to having sex and getting into relationships. They also believe supposed ""bad personality"" is excused [when it is coming from attractive men](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12147-015-9142-5), and that judgments of ""creepiness"" [are predominantly dependent on looks and not the behavior itself](https://i.redd.it/s92mq1v7ypo11.jpg). They have a crazy theory for everything! 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been trying to sit down, man to man, with my son, to put him in order. I tell him, ""son, women aren't rejecting you because of your height and unattractive facial features. How do you think your mother fell in love with me?"". His response as always is this nonsensical argument about [""female sexual selection"" in a ""liberated environment"".](http://humboldt-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/2148/624/ThesisFinal.pdf) (They have all this bizarre pseudo-scientific lingo!). He basically argues modern sexually liberated that women ""select for"" looks whilst they're ""at their peak"", and as a consequence many of them sleep with the same few men during these years. He says the ""sexual value"" of these women declines as they get older, and consequently they cannot secure these ""high value men"" for themselves - so then go on to ""settle"" for ""average/short/ugly"" guys like myself (he actually said that!) when they're older, as long as we can ""provide"" for them.

I don't even want to dignify such misogyny with a rebuttal! He's even become so disrespectful and rude that he tries to argue the fact that his mom and I don't have much sex means she married me primarily because I'm a ""safe"" provider, and not because she's attracted to me! The absolute nerve!

&amp;#x200B;

This is ""the blackpill"" reddit, and it's this nonsense I'm trying to fight every day. I've actively confronted him about his misogynistic personality being the cause of his inceldom, and then he tells me that ""women actually date men who *physically* abuse them"" - as if that's supposed to prove anything! 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and, just a few things I'll mention about my son:

1) He's 5'3"" and has a recessive jawline - BUT he also has unrealistically terrible hygiene, and refuses to take a shower for some reason. I keep telling ""just take a shower"", but he refuses so he can't blame his lack of dating success on ""genetics"". Clearly it's his personality and hygiene.

2) He's a racist misogynist pedophile pervert rude angry creep who sexually harasses women and ejaculates in young girls panties - I'm just mentioning this to ensure that the figure you have in mind is something you completely cannot sympathize/empathize with. Uhm, he also worships the incel serial killers. And he enjoys killing kittens in his spare time btw. And uhm, yes, all incels are 100% like this!!! If you weren't aware by now **this is the only group of people for whom negative stereotypes must be taken as fact!**

3) If you don't believe incels are absolutely this stereotype, go to r/braincels \- all they post about is rape, pedophilia, and murder fantasies. It's absolutely disgusting andI don't understand why Reddit hasn't done anything about it. It makes me sincerely fear for the future.

78,"I was confused a lot growing up. I didn't really know what gender to conform to. Rough sports, tackling, fighting, it made me so uncomfortable. I was not like the other boys. And when I raised the point with my (very liberal) parents, they supported me fully and suggested I may be ""born in the wrong body"". I was even more confused when they said this.

For all these years growing up I had looked at Disney movies wanting to be not the prince, but the princess and frequently dressing up as one. My parents encouraged me to even take my dresses to school and to tell the other kids ""This is who I am, deal with it"". They felt it would toughen me up. And teach the other kids a lesson about acceptance. Reality was, I was mercilessly bullied.

Fast forward some years. I am twelve and have already been in therapy since age 9. I am suicidal. I want to be a girl so I won't be bullied anymore. They put me on puberty blockers. They tell me about the dangers, briefly, but it does not really reach me. At first it's bliss... I do not get the beard. I do not get the larger genitals. I can still hide and tuck easily. I'm free...

Fast forward another four years. I am sixteen and start hormones. Doubts are setting in my but my father took me aside and told me, before my first shot: ""You have gone too far at this point. Don't throw away the years you suffered for being who you truly are"". I go through with it. For about six months and at that point, I insist on stopping. That it is not who I want to be. I have a bit of a ""reverse coming out"" with my parents. It's scary as hell. Mother cries. Father comforts her. I almost feel like a disappointment.

Now I am in my twenties. Scary thing is, my development never fully caught up. I am short at 5'6"" and I have very thin, whispy facial hair. My penis is underveloped, only about four inches fully erect. My testicles are small as well, Orchidometer puts me at the age of twelve. They produce no sperm. Zero. I went on testosterone at 17 trying to patch things up but my body just never started to develop sperm anymore. The ship has sailed. And because I never even had any to begin with, going on puberty blockers age 12, I never had the chance to store sperm either.

I am now in my twenties. Sterile. I am far shorter than my male cousins and father who are all in the 6'3""-6'5"" range. I feel insecure about my body. I feel like my life was stolen from me by overly permissive parents.

79,"I come from a country which is culturally obsessed with class. People here are very class-conscious.

I would identify myself as middle class. I did however grew up with kids from the upper-middle or upper class as I went to one of the most expensive private schools in my area on a scholarship. There was a lot of mean girls type od drama and bullying going on. Many of the ultra rich kids were also obsessed with luxury items, posh cars, and status so I stereotyoed rich kids as selfish, greedy, and vain. Back then, my social circles at school were restricted to the rich and I really wish I had the opportunity to meet people from the same social class as me.

I am now in college. I know people from all social classes. In the last, I romanticsed less wealthy people to be kinder and nicer. Now I realise less wealthy people can be just as nasty as the rich. Some of them even dislike me as they see me as mlre privileged even though I didn't tell them my social class and it was them digging deep into my historical social media posts or asking stuff about me from other people. It made me realise stereotyping people wealthier than you as greedy isn't the right thing to do.

These days, I just tend to make friends based on common interests. I tend to avoid disclosing information which reveals which social class I am from. It is kind of ironic how a disproportionate number of the people closest to me are upper-middle class when I've wanted non-upper-middle class friends so desperately back in high school. Don't know if this is a coincidence or not. It's also ironic how some of the nicest people in my life are upper-middle class despite how society and I tend to stereotype them as greedy and selfish.",11Nov2018,1

81,"I am a 430lb 26 year old autist that will never amount to anything. Everything a person needs to make it in this world we live in I lack. I have no discipline. I have no motivation beyond self pleasure. I have never been able to put more than the bare minimum amount of effort into anything. That worked for 22 years. It's been downhill since. 

College was not a choice for me, it was an inevitability. I spent 2 years working on an Economics major. It was at that point I realized I did not have what it would take to continue. The basics of almost any topic I can understand perfectly with no effort but once things get tough I am lost. I switched to computer science, and 2 years later I was at the same place. A worse place. I was skipping half my classes, unable to even get out of bed. Dreading the idea of going. Even when I went I was in the habit of not playing any attention. I would be on my laptop all class, reading books, Reddit, anything but paying attention. 

I could blame my professors. And if I am being fair, I am the failure but they are not blameless. The department at my school was small and the professors were not effective. But my classmates were able to make it. So it's my failure.

I could blame one of my friends at the time who got me comfortable with not paying attention in class. I used to at least try to be a good student, but I adopted his habits, but he could keep up and understand the material in a way I could not. Still he helped me pass many of my classes that I surely deserved to fail. We had a falling out and two weeks later I dropped out with no intention of ever going back. 

A few months later I convinced myself that maybe I could go back and finish with Economics. I did not even last a semester. I took what credits I had and ended up finishing with an Interdisciplinary degree last May. Or rather I should say my mom did. She completed all the classes I needed to finish that degree. Some bullshit Interdisciplinary classes and some upper level electives I needed. I am a fraud. 

I got a Job doing phone center tech support the March before graduation. I thought I would hate it. Somehow I did not, I might even go so far to say I liked it. But it did not last. My bad habits manifested. While I always did a good job(a great job) there would be days that I could not get myself out of bed. Therapy was not helping. Meds were not helping. I could never call in or even text my bosses on those days. Somehow though they did not care. It helped that I would never miss more than 2 days in a row, and on some of those bad days I would be able to get myself in late. It probably also helped that my bosses were based in a different office multiple states away. I never had to truly face anyone over my failure and I think that is why i lasted as long as I did. But I did not last. There was a week, 7 months after I had started this job that I missed more than 2 days in a row. It could not be ignored. The shame from that kept me from ever going back. I am a failure. 

It's a year later. I live alone in the house my brother was forced to leave behind when his dreams failed him. Out parents pay his mortgage, my living expenses. At first I really was making an effort at finding a job. But nothing came of it. No one would call me back. I was doing some /r/WorkOnline stuff but even that I gave up with. I stopped trying. That was a few months ago. I cannot picture a future for myself where I am a productive member of society. I live day by day, drowning myself in video games, media, whatever just to pass the time. I live in a city where I know no one. I can't bring myself to even try doing any of the social activities I used to(playing MTG, attending board game meetups). I can't stick to a schedule. I sleep when I am tired enough to fall asleep. I wake up when I wake up. I am nocturnal for weeks and then back to being awake during the day. I'll wake up at 7am every day for and then back to staying up to 6am and sleeping till 2pm. Part of why I can't keep looking for jobs is that I cannot bring myself to falsely pretend that I am capable of being a good worker, showing up to work every day, on time. I know that I can't, not for the long term anyway. So I am stuck. I might be able to do it if I could work from home but I can't get those jobs. 

As a coder I have no projects I have worked on, no desire to work on anything that's already out there, no ideas of anything to make. So I can't show that I actually know my stuff. In fact I probably don't anymore. I have not coded anything in years. I have tried various online courses to try to build on my skills or to give myself a guided way to build something that can show off what I can do but I can never follow through with it past the first session. 

As a tech support... If I could find a job like my last one that would let me work from home full time maybe I could do it. Maybe. But the longer it takes the worse my resume is. There is no good way to spin my employment gap. 

I can't reveal the full extent of this to my dad. He would not react well. I don't think he realizes how I get by, putting everything on my mom's credit card. It makes it hard on her though because she has to squirrel enough money away to pay it each month. They both make over 6 figures. How fucked of a relationship is that? But I am blessed to have a mom that will go so far for me. Or am I? Would I be better off if they cut me off? Would that have been the kick I needed? I don't think so. I am terrified of what would happen if they did. I am not suicidal. Even if that happens I would not be. But if I were cut off, I know that even then I would not be able to change. It terrifies me. Worst of all is my own guilt. But my mom is an enabler. She goes so far as to say I should everything I need *and want*. And I take advantage. And it kills me that I do. I don't deserve this. Getting the latest game I want. Eating out a lot. But I won't stop. It's some of the only joy I have. Clearly I am depressed. But I can't get help myself. My mom just enables and any attempt to talk about it leads nowhere. My dad is useless and would just make my life more hell than it already is. My brother is in his own hell, giving up on his dreams to move back to out hometown and work for our parents. Working with our dad is a living hell but he puts up with it. He has a fiance and baby on the way. I don't get their relationship. They both are unwilling to comprise on some fundamental things, and so they comprises in a way that makes them both miserable,  and yet instead of breaking up he put a ring on it.

Apparently in the late 70's to 80's my mum and her best friend in high school were often bullied for being slow and ""stupid"", which brought the two closer to each other. They came up with an idea to deal with the bullying by making little characters that each represented their last brain cell in their brain. My mum's brain cell was named Bertram and her friend's was named something else but my mum can't remember since it was so long ago. The two even made little bead stick-men of the cells to carry around as charms to class and would have them on their desks during lessons and often joke about them to deal with the bullying.

Eventually when they graduated, my mum's friend didn't know what to do with her little cell charm, so my mum promised she'd keep it until they meet each other soon again.

102,"One of the most frustrating and least talked about aspects of living with a mental illness is that frequently our entire emotional experience of life is attributed to mental illness. This undermines the legitimacy of our experiences.

Yes, we have illnesses that affect the processing of thoughts and emotions. However, that does not negate the legitimacy of our human experience.

For example, almost everyone's nervous when going for a job interview. It's an entirely normal emotional response. Where mental illness comes into play is to take that entirely normal emotional response and take it to a level where you can't function, much less actually go into the job interview.

No one is confident all the time. I have never met a person that didn't at least once look in the mirror and criticize their appearance.

It is an entirely normal part of the human experience to go through periods of self doubt and confusion. That is NOT a sign of mental illness. Life is a confusing journey with so many more twists and turns than we are lead to expect when we are young. It's not easy. And it's not easy for everyone. We're all faced with challenges that we never expect and don't really know how to handle.

The emotional reactions of those with mental illness are normally rational and sane things. We all have anxiety. We all have fear. We all have hurt and sadness and all of it. All of it are entirely normal reactions.

Mental illness doesn't deligitimize our emotional experience. What mental illness is is that we have issues with processing entirely normal experiences. And this issue is entirely, completely based in the functioning of the brain. It's neurological.

Let me give an example....

The neurotransmitters that are naturally released during times of stress are dopamine, acetylcholine, glutamate and GABA. What neurotransmitter is the primary player in hallucinations? Dopamine. That's right. Hallucinations are the abberant variety of a natural stress reaction. An entirely normal and understandable reaction turned into a processing issue by neurology.

I am so tired of seeing not just those without mental illness, but those with it too, accredit our entire life experiences to mental illness. It's just not true. First and foremost, we are people. We live relatively normal lives. We get up, we get a cup of coffee, we face the world as best we can. And that's exactly what everyone else does.

By attributing our entire emotional experience to mental illness, it not only deligitimizes our experiences, it also greatly increases the supposed divide between us and those who are neurologically healthy. And that divide should never be there in the first place.

My therapist taught me a very simple way to explain the difference between rational thought and mental illness. If the majority of people experience the same thoughts, it's rational and normal. That's it. And we all have an outstanding tool to know if it is. If we can't talk to others about it, there's Google.

Mental illness doesn't deligitimize our thoughts. It just changes our abilities to process them.

People with mental illnesses can have entirely normal emotional reactions to entirely normal life experiences.

It's hard enough to have the world tell us that ""You don't feel that way. You're just crazy."" Do we seriously have to keep doing it to ourselves?

You have an illness. It doesn't mean that your entire life is that illness. It only means that you have some issues with processing. That's it.

Your experience as a person is whole, complete, and valid. And having a mental illness doesn't deligitimize your experience in the least.",11Nov2018,1

* More time in a day. Although I'll probably just replace my Facebook time with something equally unproductive.
* Peace of mind. No more of having people going through my old posts. Although Facebook allows you to make all old posts visible to friends only, they do not allow you to make your posts private or to delete them... unless you go through them one by one. No thanks.
* I'll be subjected to less crap. Seriously, I've never seen a ""friend"" (using the Facebook definition of the term here) post anything well-written, and very few Facebook pages have remained active for long **and** had good intentions (i.e. not selling out to clickbait websites).

110,"My boy, my oldest child, was so good when he was little, but something broke inside of him when he was a teenager. 

My wife and I always accepted, loved, and encouraged him. We pushed him to work hard and treat people with respect. I don’t know where exactly we failed him but as a father I feel responsible for the thing he’s turned into. 

It started when he was 14. He had began to become withdrawn and emotional. We chalked it up to teenaged mood swings. For some reason he was just so angsty and bitter all the time. We were worried about his lack of social life and his over-reliance on his computer. He kind of hid himself in the online world so my wife and I began to limit his computer time, but he simply became more aggressive and confrontational. 

His hygiene was bad, and he was always confrontational when we told him to shower or do laundry. His room stank horribly and we eventually had a huge fight over it where he physically shoved my wife and called her a bitch, and eventually we got him to at least clean and air out his room regularly on the grounds that it was our house and if he couldn’t maintain his space he wouldn’t be entitled to it - essentially we got to the point where we told him he wouldn’t be allowed his worldly possessions or privacy unless he took care of the space we all shared. the room still smelled and he was still rude about cleaning it but we could tell him to get it clean and he would do it after that. 

We ended up getting a call from his school saying that a white student felt harassed by him. We were shown messages where, despite the fact that we are both white, he continually badgered her to have sex with someone else who was not white, or to be sterilized, threatened to “punish” her for not contributing to the ""mayocide"", sending her unsolicited nudes of black men, telling her some violent white genocide fantasies of his, and eventually just descending into some horrid rage-filled rant about how she is just another “mayo” and other things. 

We were shocked. We explained to him why this behavior was unacceptable, and I explained to him that it was ok to be white.
 
I tried mentoring him man-to-man, taking him on camping trips and whatnot and talking to him about race realism, nationalism, and trying to give him advice. I suggested he try showering, changing up his hair and facial hair styles, trying out different fashion styles, maybe going to the gym. 

I told him some hard truths - that he only supports the ""mayocide"" because it will eliminate the competition and he will feel less self-conscious. I explained to him that intelligence is more genetics than socio-economic but he refused to accept what I said to him. 

After that I caught him on this very website, specifically browsing a board called ""/r/Drama"", where I saw widespread anti-white racism and heterophobic propaganda. He assured me it had nothing to do with genuine hatred of the white race, he said it was just ""ironic"", but still I gave him hell for it, and he was grounded and lost his computer for 6 months. I went through his computer and I was disgusted by the other kinds of hateful, racist, cuck forums he frequented, the horrid things he said about whites, and his save file was full of cartoon porn with girls of questionable ages. He had even shared pictures of his genitals and anus with other users of some of these forms, calling them ""bussy"". Bizarrely, he had also been playing on an /r/Drama-themed Minecraft server where the racism was as common as ever. I wiped the hard drive completely and began strictly monitoring his online activity. I used parental filters to block cuck sites and and porn sites that hosted cartoon and homosexual porn.
 
The next big issue was something he did to my daughter’s friend. My daughter is 5 years his junior, and one day after a sleepover, my daughter came to me and said her friend wanted to tell me something but was afraid of what I would say. 

My son cornered this 13 year old girl and physically blocked her path and touched her hair and face while making very inappropriate comments about her body and asking her if she liked cucking her ""mayo"" boyfriend, and also ranting about the supremacy of non-whites.
 
I tore into my son for that, my wife and I both shouted at him, and told him his behavior was horrible and I told him then that if his actions got him arrested I would not defend him. He accused us of not loving him, but I told him the reason I was so passionately angry in that situation is because I do love him, and I want to help him become a good man so he can stop being so predatory and bitter and miserable. I told him some hard truths. That he did this all to himself and that he is the only one he can blame for how bitter he is.
 
I suggested he look to women of his own race and he went on a rant about how it was a waste of time because white women were already whores (and his definition of a whore is a woman who has had sex even just once) by 17. I called him out on his bullshit and expressed clearly that if he harassed white girls anymore I would personally turn him in. 

I invited my daughters friend over after and I personally apologized to her for her experiences, I cried in shame for my son’s behavior and begged her forgiveness for allowing her to feel unsafe in my home and promised her that if she ever felt uncomfortable she could come to my wife and I and we would always believe and help her. Luckily, my daughter didn’t lose this friend, but for safety I installed a lock on my daughter’s door. 
We got my son therapy but he refused to engage with the therapist, calling him a “sand nigger”, “pajeet”, and “terrorist”. His next therapist was a “chad”, so he didn’t relate to that either.
We fought about him not trying, not getting a job, and he said he couldn’t get one because of the immigrants, and furthermore that he did not deserve one until he had done more for the ""mayocide"", to which I pointed out that work is life-fulfilling and that he was struggling because he got fired from his high school jobs for being lazy. 

After those fights, my wife tried to empathize with him and understand what made him so bitter but he flipped out at her, and called her a cock-gargling whore and said that she fucked her way through dozens of men until she found a “beta-fag” who was willing to shelter her for missionary sex and white, Protestant babies. 

My wife, who works and contributes to the family income, who is an independent, professional woman. 

Honestly, I lost it more than ever before. I had never been so angry when I heard what he said. That may be his mom, he may be my son, but the woman he was abusively tearing into is my god damn wife. No one can treat my wife like that. 

I am ashamed to say in my anger, he shoved me and I physically retaliated, shoving him back, and pinning him against the wall. I felt ashamed of myself, I have never been an angry or violent person, but I couldn’t control myself. I’ve never put my hands on either of my children in such a way in my life, I hate child abusers... but this boy was no child. He was a grown man. 
He was intimidated and backed down, and for a while he was peaceful.

The last straw was this week.

My daughter has dated 3 people her whole life. A boy, a girl, and now another boy. We were as open about sex with my daughter as we were with my son. We asked if she would like to have a question-free steady supply of condoms left in her bathroom drawer, and if she wanted to get on birth control. She said no to both questions with her first boyfriend. She never really brought him home but we met him at one of her recitals. When she had a girlfriend she went over to her house all the time, and didn’t want to bring her to the same house her brother lived in, a sentiment I understood. 

But her most recent boyfriend has a lot going on behind the scenes in his family. He’s a nice boy but his mom is a single mom of 4 and they struggle.
 
This boy started coming around a month after they got together. I like him. My daughter is happy with him. He treats her with respect. He is an intelligent boy. He’s an absolute gentleman. He’s respectful and polite in our home. He calls me sir, calls my wife Ma’am, he offers to help with the cooking or dishes or cleaning while he’s visiting, he talks to us, he’s a bit of an amateur cook himself and brings us food all the time to say thank you for taking care of him, when we go out for dinner he always offers to pay for himself and my daughter (though I know he doesn’t have much money so I always pay). When getting out of the car he opens the door for my wife and offers her his hand (he sits behind her for leg room). He holds the doors, when we leave somewhere he helps my daughter put her jacket on like those sweet old fashioned couples. He joked playfully (although I knew, to my satisfaction, that it was his genuine sentiment) that if he married my daughter he would only raise white, Christian babies with her and would disown any who tried throwing away their DNA by race-mixing.
 
This young man works hard, and gives what little he has to his mom and siblings. Like I said, I really respect the boy. I offered him money once for groceries for his family but he turns me down and says he would feel guilty accepting ""gibs"" like certain demographics. He’s appreciative of things - in the winter, it was -20 and he had only a hoodie, so I draped my jacket over his arms, and I said “take it son, it’s cold.” He had tears in his eyes as he said thank you, and I made some excuse about wanting to get rid of the jacket and told him he could keep it if he brought cookies for us next time he visited. 

When Christmas came along, I invited him over for supper, and when I went to pick him up I delivered some presents for his family, and on the ride back to my house we had a moment. He was crying because he didn’t have much to give us - he got everyone in our house a present but he cried anyways because he felt it wasn’t enough to make up for what we gave him. I pulled over, and I just hugged him, and I said to him that it wasn’t the value of what he got, it was that he got us anything at all. I thanked him for treating my daughter so well, and I told him he would always be welcome in my home. 

My own son didn’t get us anything for Christmas, except a card bought with the money we had given him that he had written ""Reminder the blacks had to deal with constant bullying and discrimination in schools for decades and never shot one up."". This boy got my wife and I matching wine glasses since we like to share a bottle every now and then. 

My son didn’t eat with us. He pillaged the food table and ran away to his room alone - where he possibly continued visiting cuck forums, as he may have found a way to circumvent the filters - while my daughter’s boyfriend met my sister and her family and my parents and my uncle. They all told me how charming he was and how polite he was. Meanwhile after dinner my son told my 5 year old nephew “fuck off Faggot” for asking to play a game with him, before saying he would do it if he ""posted bussy"". A man over 20 years old.
 
Last week, my wife and I went out for an evening to ourselves. We went to dinner, then we went to an upscale bar to play some pool, then we went home. 

When I walked in the door, the kids were screaming at each other. I came in to see my son and my daughter’s boyfriend fighting. The boyfriend was just pushing my son back and trying to redirect him, my son was throwing punches and charging him. My daughter was crying and sitting against the wall clutching her face. I got between them and pushed them apart, and demanded to know what was happening.
 
My son went on a tirade about how he found birth control pills and heard “whore” sounds from her room, so he kicked open her door and discovered them having sex, he said he couldn’t believe his own sister would “be a mayo's whore” and called the poor boy a monkey (despite being an Aryan) and other things, while lecturing them on the health benefits of miscegenation. He said that while they currently weren't trying to produce children, they were on slippery slope to ""helping to perpetuate mayo tyranny"".

My wife got my daughter and her boyfriend out of there and I yelled at my son for how he was acting. Eventually I got nowhere with him so I made him wait in his room. I went to talk to my daughter. I apologized to her boyfriend, crying as I did, telling him that I hope he could forgive me for letting this happen. He said he was sorry for getting violent but that he only did it because my son hit her. My daughter cried and said he was a psycho and threatened to arrange a black person to rape her, and that he admitted to ejaculating on her toothbrush and hair brush. 

I charged into his room, and I said firmly that he should pack his bags and leave. I told him I would pay to have his things sent to him, wherever he went, but that he was leaving tomorrow. 

My wife stayed at my sisters, and my daughter and her boyfriend spent the next few nights at his place. 

The next day I practically threw my son out of the house kicking and screaming. 

I took his key back and changed the alarm codes and garage door code. A day later I had a message requesting some of this things - mostly his gaming stuff - be delivered to some strange apartment block I didn’t recognize a couple of towns over. A college aged man buzzed me in and I delivered the stuff. I didn’t see my son. 

My wife and I then went through his room. My daughter’s boyfriend came over and helped me move his furniture to the garage. We threw out his semen-stained mattress and some other more gross and smelly things, and we took out the carpet to be replaced. 

Hidden in the closet was a treasure trove of my daughter’s underwear, so saturated with old, moldy semen that they were as hard as bricks. The unnerving part was that there were a few pairs my daughter was adamant didn’t belong to her. And they were too small for my wife. It is possible he stole them from my nieces. 

There was a sketchbook containing graphic drawings of my satisfied son wanting blacks violently raping different women and keeping little girls chained up in some kind of sex dungeon. I went through his old phone that was still working, and all his photos were screenshots of my nieces and their friends in their bikinis, lots of cartoon porn, pictures of the genitals and anuses of full-grown men, lots of blue pill memes. He still had messenger, so I checked his messages, most of them were just him trying to harass women and underaged girls who had white partners.
 
I checked his Email and... much to my disgust, he stole private photos of my wife from her phone, and he was selling them. 
Today, I went to the police with everything and told them everything.
 
I gave my baby boy everything... I don’t know why he went down this road. But I’m just so sorry I failed him. I don’t know what the police will do... but I hope they stop him before he hurts someone else.
 
The sad thing is... yesterday, once it was all over and settled, yesterday we had a wonderful day. One of the happiest we have ever had.",11Nov2018,1

112,"My dad, my oldest parent, was so good when I was younger, but something broke inside of him when he started using Reddit.

They  say that when you take drugs, it permanently alters how you measure  punishment and reward - pain and pleasure. I think this is what happened  to my dad after he started getting fake internet points.

It  all started when my friend, a friendly afro-american boy (He is an  intelligent boy, an absolute gentleman. He always  calls me ""Bro"" and  calls my sister ""Sis"") came over to my house. My sister (Sis)  was  cooking chicken dinner and innocently said ""You gotta put it in before  it gets cold"" (talking about the oven). My friend of course immediately  chimes in with ""That's what she said"" as we all groaned. My dad however,  overheard this joke for the first time and burst out laughing. He  continued laughing nonstop, occasionally repeating the line back to  himself, for the next 45 minutes.

We  didn't think much of it, I mean, it's just dads being dads right? Well  the day after is when he got online and made a reddit account for the  first time. That's when the real trouble began.

His  first 15 comments in a row consisted solely of him saying ""That's what  she said"" to an unsuspecting redditor. Every time he got more upvotes  than the previous post he would yell ""SHARON!"" (My moms name) from  upstairs, forcing her to come look at his ever increasing point total.  She supported him.. for a while.

Soon  all his hours began to get consumed by Reddit. The ""Thats what she  said"" jokes eventually not only stopped giving him major internet points  - they started losing him points as well. 2 weeks in and he was already  in Reddit debt. He became obsessed with getting his previous karma back  any way possible. At first he started rickrolling random comment  chains. Just like in gambling, this only worked sporadically. +15 votes  here, +50 votes there, then boom -300 votes. He was back in Reddit debt.  He began getting desperate. He started associating with some really  shady groups, names like 4chan and Tumblr, and even in his darkest hour, 9gag. He started reposting the Navy Seal copypasta, creating his own  greentext, and eventually agreeing to overthrow the government with  whatever political group gave him the most upvotes.

And this is only the stuff we knew about.

Then  came the day where everything imploded. My sister came crying home from  school, screaming that her life was over and she could never go outside  again. My dad had wrote several stories about her but included enough  personal information that people were able to find out who she was.  Crazy stories saying she's starting to date my black friend, getting  pregnant, turning into a trans lesbian, and something about entering  into a non-consensual sex relationship with her desk lamp. None of these  were true.

I  confronted my dad and we got into a physical confrontation before i  finally subdued him with an old jacket and he started weeping in my  arms. Everyone started clapping but I silenced them with my hand and  told my dad to just tell me what was wrong.

""The Karma.."" He said ""I need.. more..""

""Dad!"" I yelled ""You can do what Gallowboob does, you don't have to resort to this!!""

Suddenly his eyes got big.

""My  legal advice thread! I need to post an update on our neighbors who  kidnapped our dog, did a sex change operation and tried to get him on  Oprah as the worlds first transgender animal!""

""But that never happend!!"" I yelled as me and my mom chased him up the stairs

When  we finally got to his computer we were appalled at what we seen. Pages  and pages of fabricated posts solely for the intent of farming karma.  Posts asking advice about my mom, saying she abused men, that she even  captured the mailman and was keeping him in a sex dungeon, only  occasionally feeding him tootsie rolls and ovaltine. Pages about my  sister having an uncontrollable furry fetish - supposedly tearing up the  house linens in a desperate craving for a new costume. Family advice  questions about me, saying I drew lewd pictures of random women,  masturbated for hours to cartoons and left semen all over my sisters  underwear. All of which were true, but it didn't need to be brought up  in this context.

Long  story short, we eventually kicked dad out of the house, telling him to  only come back when he gets control over his internet addiction. Last we  heard he was resorting to posting cat pictures on Weibo, then trying to  exchange the views for credit towards food stamps.

My  sister moved to a new school but never did get over the stigma of being  a supposed sex craved furry in disguise. My mother received a visit  from the sheriff's department about a mailman locked up in the basement.  She was so offended that she considered kidnapping the policeman  himself and locking him up in the basement - but she thought better of  it.

As  for me, we had a family talk and sorted things out. We eventually  collected all of the semen stained underwear from my room - some of  which had been sitting there for years - and did a family sniff test. We  were able to determine some of the underwear weren't even my sisters!  Many belonged to my mom and some smelled strongly of my nieces.

The  lesson here is don't always believe what you read on the internet, some  people have a lot of time on their hands and are very convincing  writers.",11Nov2018,1
113,"Not exactly sure where to start this, but i might as well start at the beginning like every other story. This story is completely true, no faking. I know i haven't had the worst life, but its hard to imagine what it would be like if none of these things ever happened.


(4-6 years old)


So to start, I was born into a loving family, and hard working oarents. My dad owned his own contracting business and we never went without. He was the type of man that went without when he was younger, so never took things for granted. Even if i left some steak on my plate he'd talk about being wasteful, and how we were lucky to be able to afford such things. I had a brother and a half sister (my brother and I  considered her full because of being such a huge part in our life). I grew up with lots of relatives, everyone doing well, and everyone seeming.. happy.

My father would take my brother and I on jobs when we were really young, and teach us stuff. We'd ride in his work truck, and even though it was hard work, and extremely hot, it was some of the best times of my life. I'd do anything to go back to those days. It was great for awhile, my parents were in love, but not married. But they loved eachother like they were for 50 years. My father was a outdoorsman. He loved hunting and fishing. For the very few things i remember about him, i know he loved nature.

We'd go fishing, and he'd teach my brother and I everything. The littlest details bring tears to my eyes. He would show us how to shoot BB guns out in the woods, he'd show the proper way to handle BB guns to transfer over to when we'd eventually go hunting together. My brother and I would always race to the front seat of his truck to be closer to him and look at him while music was playing. But one day my mom got a phone call, and he wrecked his truck. He turned out to be fine, just lots of bruises and scrapes. His truck was totalled though. My mother said ""he was extremely tired while driving and drove off into a ditch."" Not exactly sure how true this part is.

Things were okay for awhile, things seemed.. shakey. Things felt like there was slight tension in every room you went into. My brother and I would play outside ALL the time at this point. We loved basketball and playing war outside. Once again we're between the ages 4-6. My father worked all day while my mother took care of the house and us. She'd be the good mom who made you do your homework as soon as you got home, and make you a snack. My sister at this point was in late middle school. So we'd all do our homework in the kitchen and wait for dinner to be made, and my father to come home.

Some nights.. he didn't come home till after dark. I know as a hard working contractor i'm sure work can go till dusk sometimes. But other times i wasnt sure if that was the reason. It started to become fall and Halloween was around the corner. My brother kept thinking about what we wanted to be this year. My mom made baked stuff for the halloween party at school. I still have pictures of that party. I went as a ninja, and my brother as a pirate. Little did i know that week would change the rest of our lives.

A few days later my brother and I were sleeping in our room, we shared one. I saw lights outside of my window, like really bright lights. Something didnt seem right. I whispered for my brother to wake up, he didnt. He was a really heavy sleeper. Then i heard police sirens. So i shook him awake. We both looked out the window at the street, noticing its right out front of our house. I started to get extremely anxious. We start walking towards our door to go downstairs, and my sister ran down the hall and made us stay in our room. She made us play sega genesis. We were playing NBA Jam. I remember everything about that night.

We heard screaming and crying. Something was so wrong. I felt the world crumbling around me without even knowing what happened. We sat in that room for hours. My mother and sister finally came upstairs crying and sobbing. Each of them sat on a bed, and said that our dad passed away. At the time, my mother said ""heart attack"". He died sitting in the bathroom. People brought so much food.. so much. After that day.. everything changed. Im so sorry this is so long, this isn't only for myself, but incase someone else can relate to any of this so far.


(7 years old)


Everything was quite for awhile. I was out of school for a little bit. We didn't wanna go back. Everyone knew. People came to his viewing, and as a child, I had to stand next to my dead fathers casket, and have people give me their condolences. It felt.. unreal. I didnt want to even face the daylight. I frequently sat in my room bawling my eyes out. Or even sometimes in the shower so no one could hear me. My mom decided that maybe a pet would help us. We went and got a pure black cat with golden eyes. We named her Abby. She seemed to of been abused before we got her, she was extremely distant and didnt like guys. My mom got another pure black cat, and we named her Buffy. She wouldnt leave either my brothers, or my side. 

My mother went and got a full time job basically right after he passed away and knew all we had left was her. She got alot of insurance money and showered us with gifts. With the fridge always stocked. New shoes and clothes. Skateboards. New games. Everything. Even bought my sister a car in cash when the time came, then another after she totalled it. We didnt go without for awhile. She tried to pay up on debt, and get everything placed back together. She struggled to keep herself together sometimes and would go to her room where i heard faint crying. She kept paying on past due things, and showering us for awhile. Until that money was gone. Bills piled up so high. I could even tell then she was drowning financially.


(8 years old)

My grandma got sick and needed regular permanent care. So she sold her house. Split the money between her kids. So it helped my mom for awhile. My sister got pregnant, at this point is almost out of high school. But eventually we started drowning again. Paranormal things happened in that house after my dad passed. Everyone experienced something. There was no heat sometimes during the winter. No food in the fridge. Electric being turned on, shut off, turned back on, only to be shut off again. We would bundle up in the living room with a space heater. We'd go to food banks and stand out in the cold. I constantly ate. My brother and I both did. We went to therapy and never talked. It used to upset my mom so much. We literally wouldnt say a word.


(10 years old)


My brother and I constantly ate. Gained so much weight. The house eventually got forclosed on. My sister got her own apartment, we got our own. So my brother and I still shared a room. My brother and I continued to gain weight. I was 199lbs in 5th grade. I got bullied constantly. Kids would make jokes about having no father. Id get bullied for my weight. Kids are so cruel. My brother protected me constantly at recess. We're both large framed taller guys. My father was 6'4 and very bulky. People were intimidated by my brother, and knew he protected me. He was a good brother then. I got into fights and held my own. I didnt want people walking on me anymore.

The school didnt listen about the bullying or anything, and constantly gave me in school suspension. I felt at peace in there. I was alone and away from bullying. I was a good hearted kid. I didnt want to fight or anything. I did it out of wanting to stand up for myself. I got followed on my way home and would have kids jump me. I had some birthday money so i bought a bike. Which helped me in that aspect. Id still constantly skip school to keep away from other kids. I was so self conscious, super low self esteem, knew girls didnt like me, just so many things. It felt like i was walking into a prison and being jumped by inmates.

Id stay home and play halo 2 all day, and eat. I gave my mom so much grief. She worked so hard and i just shit all over it. I skipped so much school she'd get fined. I kept doing it. I knew i had to go, but something deep inside me just couldnt. I wasnt lazy. Im not stupid. Id pass tests without even studying or reading.


(11-13 years old)


Middle school was alot of the same as elementary. I skipped alot and got bullied. Gained alot more weight, and did nothing about it. Girls were uninterested. I was a fat, funny kid. Who loved video games and hated life. My cat abby died due to cancer.


(14-18 years old)


High school. Good for some, awful for others. Mine was idk. It was okay sometimes, but it was awful others. I was kind of popular, but didnt get girls. I was fat, funny, had semi popular friends. Got invited to parties. Smoked weed. Hung out with alot of people, but what held me back was not showing up for school, and having very low self esteem. I played video games, didnt do school work, didnt go to school, but i loved my friends. They helped me alot. I had extreme depression, which i was diagnosed with in like 5th grade. I thought about suicide multiple times but never did anything. I was way too scared. I had crushes, and knew i couldnt even compare. I eventually dropped out in 11th grade. My grandma died shortly after that, when i was roughly 17. At this point i was maybe 290lbs after my mom went to the gym with me and walked while i ran, with her help i lost 70lbs. My highest was 360lbs. 

But since apparently my life wasnt rough enough at this point.. my mother started coughing up blood while watching tv. So i knew something was wrong. I called my sister.. she picked her up, and took her to the hospital. Hours later my life changed again. They were both bawling their eyes out. She had lung cancer. I dont remember what stage.. but she had to start chemo. I drove her to her appointments. I sat with her while she had chemo. I watched her go to work full time right after she got chemo. She refused to stop working. I worked at the same place as a temp worker. I helped her with bills occasionally. But mainly on myself.. looking back i regret so much. Almost everything. She now told me my father died due to a heroin overdose. So the heart attack was due to that.

I had to see tears rolling down her face as i shaved her head. She was worried about people staring at her. So we got her some really nice head wraps. People would stare. I used to be so protective. Almost like how my brother was with me. People would stare, and blatantly out in public at walmart, id ask what they were looking at. So theyd scurry off. She eventually got terminal. So she stayed at my uncles house while my brother and I took over the apartment. She got us gifts, and it was xmas eve. So i spent the night with her and watched xmas movies. She was so out of it. She didnt know who i even was. Stared at me like i was a stranger.

I slept in her room on a couch. She got up at 3am and knew my name. She said my name and asked for help up. My uncle told me to get him if she needs help up. So i go get him, and when we get back.. its as if she never moved. Like she never even asked for help and continued sleeping. So i go back to sleep, wake up, and notice her chest isnt moving. I checked her pulse, and she passed away. On xmas morning. Everyone was called. Coroner came. And i sat in that room and didnt want to leave. I kissed her head, said my goodbyes, and went home. I cried and cried. Later that day we went back over for xmas, with my whole family there. I had to open gifts from my mom who literally just died. I couldnt keep it together. My uncle handed me a envelope with a letter in it. I read it when i got home. I couldnt keep myself together.

My brother constantly brought people over and would sniff pills, smoke pot, cigarettes, chew dip, and drink. He did landscaping and would never pay his part of the rent. He blew all of his money on drugs while i continued paying for everything. We both got our GED's with ease.


(20 years old)


Lived in that apartment for a while. Worked ft and payed what had to be paid. Then i moved in with my sister so i could go to school and get away from my brothers habits. My brother started doing heroin.


(21-22 years old)


Alot of the same. I worked alot. I worked 2 full time jobs. I worked between 18-20 hours a day. I was burning out. I wanted to move out into my own apartment again. I wanted to start a career in something. I just wasnt sure what made me happy. I lost 160 lbs, and felt absolutely amazing. I was very lean with muscle mass. Had a mustang. Felt like i was finally succeeding. I met my now girlfriend and we moved in together. We both had ft jobs. My cat (buffy) was bleeding profusely (she's fixed). So i called my union steward to make sure i could call off. She said yes. So i took her to an ER vet, and she was okay. Needed surgery for a anal gland rupture. Next day i go into work, i got fired. My union steward was wrong, so i lost my job. I tried to find another job and eventually did. 



(23 years old - Current)


Both have jobs at a big factory, make about 85k a year. We did well for awhile. She started having lots of medical problems, as did I. Had doctors notes and everything for days we were off. But the company fired us without going through the union, and wouldnt take the notes from the doctor. Believe me. I read thay union book front to back. This is a worldwide company, so i figured i had no leverage. We lost my mustang. Our apartment. Almost everything. We stored our belongings in my sisters garage and became homeless. 

We were homeless for 6 months. Ive pissed in some really weird places. Now as i sit here 23 years old, almost 24. I realize so much. If anything in this post relates to u, please know that things will be okay. Ive lost almost everything i hold dear. Most of my family doesnt care, neither does my girlfriends. Since i lost all that weight, i sit here at 395lbs. My highest ever. Constant pain. Why would i do such a thing to my body? I had nice veiny arms and wore beautiful clothes, and looked great. Now i wear shorts alot, and a hoody so it helps me feel more covered of how ashamed i am. 

Depression is real. Dont let others tell you that you're fine. Do something about it. Talk to people about it. Seek help. Take things from this post and use it in your life. Appreciate your parents or family and love them everyday. Say goodbye, goodnight, that you love them, everything you want to thats meaningful. Because in a snap of your fingers, everything could be gone. 

If you need someone to talk to, post below. Ill talk to anyone. Thanks for reading.

115,"I don't know where to begin.

I first began masturbating at age 6. I didn't know what I was doing, just that it felt good. I had a feeling that I should keep it secret from adults but didn't know why. When I was maybe in 2nd grade I got this really cool electric eraser for Christmas. (It could erase printed ink!) It was a rotary device that spun an eraser around very quickly. I brought it to school, and I and another kid were fooling around with it when two much older girls told us to put it on our penises. It was amazing, so I started using it to masturbate. One time two boys and their sister came over to my house, and we passed around the eraser and an electric toothbrush to pleasure ourselves.

Although I had been exposed to porn several years earlier, I first sought it out in 6th grade. But in 7th grade, I began having phantasies of being a girl. At first I thought nothing about it, but by 8th grade it was becoming a larger part of my identity and I tried to destroy it. I succeeded in repressing it for a while, but in the spring of 9th grade I started shaving my legs. On the last day of school, I left a letter for my mom coming out as trans. She and my dad were surprised, but were okay with it. However, nothings changed. I don't know what I expected to happen, but I hoped maybe I could openly be myself, but nope. I'm plagued by fears that it's just a fetish. The fact that I'm bisexual doesn't help matters. I'm confused and don't know what to do.

I first discovered the furry fandom on the internet about a year ago, but I knew I belonged instantly. As young as 3 years old I would role play as a cat. In elementary school, my friends and I pretended to be different animals (I was a snow leopard), but we took it further, genuinely wanting and believing that we were actually our respective animals. Now I have a well developed fursona that I desperately want to be. It is a black and white female cat anthro with 1 red eye and 1 blue eye. She has 4 arms and wings; she's also a hermaphrodite (for increased compatibility). Oh, she also has the ability to begin lactating at any time, and the milk is vanilla-flavored. Like that isn't fucked up. What worries me though is that I've been attracted to real animals. About 6 months ago, I had sex with my cat. A few weeks later, he got an infection, and I'm worried that I caused it. The worst thing is I would do it again except I don't want to hurt him.

I'm also into feedism. I want to gain tons of weight and become fat. It is extremely sexual, but also a lifestyle and identity. I can't explain it. I am rather underweight– I am 5'8"" and only 110 lbs. I tried eating over 3,000 calories per day, but couldn't sustain it. I'm an extremely picky eater but I love food. I dream about food all the time. I will eat a massive amount of food, but I can only eat small portions at a time, so when I'm restricted to 3 meals a day I'm underweight, but if I can eat continuously I'll probably become overweight. 

I've been having violent tendencies. My sexual phantasies have steadily gotten more abusive, and recently I've been reading transcripts of rape recordings and then imagining myself as the victim. I search out violent content, and it makes me feel good. Everyone's heard of 2 girls 1 cup, but have you ever seen 1 lunatic 1 icepick? I recently watched a video titled ""Finnish Man Decapitates Goose with Golf Club."" It was so satisfying how the head came off the neck exactly like a golf ball off a tee, and I giggled when its legs were still moving after the head was gone. I've been frequenting the sub r/enoughinternet, but instead of putting me off, I want more. I can find joy watching Turkish soldiers being burned alive, or a girl eating a live mouse, or a woman being hacked at with machetes. Several times I've had an intense urge to cut myself, and afterwards I feel extremely satisfied.

I'm in 10th grade now and am going to a different school. I like this school much more, and I've made friends. They know I'm a furry, and I use it to get attention. I say things just to make people laugh or be revolted. I don't care if it's positive or negative attention, I just want attention. Our entire friend group is composed of depressed, chaotic people, but I still stand out. I never study or do my homework, but I still manage to get good grades. I'm very smart but very lazy. At the moment, I'm supposed to be working on a major paper that was due a week ago, but here I am on Reddit. I guess the only reason I can pull this type of shit is that I'm extremely good at bullshitting.

I have but a few assets:

* I'm smart
* I'm training for a pilot's license
* I can play piano and violin
* I can compose my own music
* My dad is a petroleum engineer, so we have financial stability

I want to become a music producer. Writing music is one of the few things that I'm good at, I enjoy, and is a productive activity. I can write better music than 99% of musicians, but that 1% is still huge. I just not sure that I can become successful. Also, I have trouble practicing. I physically can't focus on it, and spend most of my practice time lying on the ground in agony. I guess I'll try to make it as an artist, and if I really try and I still fail, *then* I can kill myself.

I want to see a therapist, but I don't want to fix my problems– I just want to be happy and to have someone to talk about nothing but me. I think about myself constantly, and spend lots of time talking to imaginary people about myself. Most of my sexual phantasies are just about me. I just imagine myself as my ideal form, or myself in a humiliating situation, or as a victim, but its always only about me. I guess that's why I'm posting this, just so other people know about me and so that I can get those shiny internet points.",11Nov2018,1
116,"I keep imagining myself doing something in kind of an alternate reality from what actually happened.

It's often before something happened that I wish didn't or with someone wherever they are now that would make them like me/forget/forgive what happened in the past. 

Sometimes it's just random things that would make me feel fun or cook etc.

I feel like it's stopping me from changing my life as I'm often pretending that I did something cool to stop my mind  thinking about what I wish never happened.

Anyone got any experience with this or any clues or thoughts. 

Thanks",11Nov2018,1
117,"I just remembered that my mum told me this story when I was little and just had to share it.

Apparently in the late 70's to 80's my mum and her best friend in high school were often bullied for being slow and ""stupid"", which brought the two closer to each other. They came up with an idea to deal with the bullying by making little characters that each represented their last brain cell in their brain. My mum's brain cell was named Bertram and her friend's was named something else but my mum can't remember since it was so long ago. The two even made little bead stick-men of the cells to carry around as charms to class and would have them on their desks during lessons and often joke about them to deal with the bullying.

Eventually when they graduated, my mum's friend didn't know what to do with her little cell charm, so my mum promised she'd keep it until they meet each other soon again. Sadly, neither of them have crossed paths but my mum still has the two little brain cell bead-men in a little box, safe and sound just in case.",11Nov2018,1
118,"
So I uh hope this is ok to post here, I just really wanted to share. It's considered religious but I'm so loved and my life is changed and going well.
 I hope it encourages you.
Since it IS considered religious then be warned.

So two and a half years ago I was at a downward spiral with my life. I had nothing no where to really aspire towards. Was doing drugs and played video games, dropped out of high school. Of course I tried a lot of stuff (new age) to somehow alleviate my life and get a better self esteem but it never really quite hit me deep, at least not even deeper than my soul. At the I really didn't wanna kill myself only because it would not have been reasonable for other people.

One particular summer I got heart broken until the point I started breaking my own promises to myself about drugs and started doing harder stuff(I only did MJ up until then).
It wasn't as bad as it could've been but still I consider shrooms and LSD hard drugs. I did my first and only LSD trip in my life and I kind of.. met God.  I went through the Adam and Eve story in my head (meanwhile I actually was stealing apples from someone else's garden).
Anyway I have no real ties to Christianity or Judaism or any religious foundation other than occultism and new age. I did have my grandma and greatgran who were Jehovah's witnesses but like nah, I didn't really hang out with them and avoided that cult like the plague. And where I live atheism is the norm by a long shot.(Maybe 10% room for religion and rest is atheist)

Anyway I started searching what or who I had met during my LSD trip. Ofc when I asked occultists, ""seers"" and new age people they just kind of laughed at me and said I smoked too much and shouldnt take it seriously, one dude even mockingly said if I have been brainwashed with Jesus... Thankfully there was one person who started talking to me instead of hating me and turns out we had similar experiences. 

We started reading the Bible together and just kind of started questioning the world around me. It was still a dark place in my life but I felt like there was more. I began to grow in my life and how I approached it. I started praying and talking to God and indeed He answered me quite often, almost always reassuringly. 

I started getting courage to go outside again. Met some people who were also Christian(again, where I live there is almost 0 religion). Got to know them and they were pretty great people, seemed to have it together.

My life at this point has changed a lot. In about 2 and a half years I've had a job successfully for 2 years, I even moved out for an entire year to live in my own!
 Previously I was able to max handle work for like 6 months and even that very irregularly with taking days off and ""sick leaves"" just to smoke pot and not deal with people.
Where I used to be completely broken, Jesus has healed me. I still talk to Him, often He comes to me. And I know this sounds so weird for someone who can't even think this might be real, but sometimes God's presence comes upon me so strongly that I'm crushed by the weight of His love. I've never really felt love in my life and God has just picked me up and told me ""You're mine"" . And it's like I have these waves of love just crashing over me really deeply changing my heart about people. Sometimes I just weep out of love for people... cuz I love em and God does too. 

I've changed a lot. I used to be so vindictive and an angry man. Hating people and trying to manipulate them to my will (common with occultists I'm sorry) I just tried to find an escape. I've never ever been loved like I'm loved by my heavenly Father. Now I'm helping around in church, picking people up. Man I love the homeless Id like to be there for them one day. Id never even consider marriage due to my broken past with previous relationships (lots of trust issues..), but now I would be open to marriage and I'd definitely want to adopt, I'd love to ...
I love these broken people around me and it's such a great blessing to just be in their life. Instead of bashing people I now try and encourage them to do as best they can and not criticize. That's how I'm loved, I'd love to extend it y'know.

I'm not perfect by any means, I still have a lot to learn but I've learned so much with Jesus I'm so so very different. I approach life with love and I'm so grateful for what I have, it's so humbling to live and love - Ofc I still do dumb stuff like how I act with my brother sometimes(I kind of bash him down as Im used to), but where I did that more before I've begun to change, I've apologized multiple times and just trying better and it's changing my heart. My brother clings to me now and he loves me a lot and I'm starting to really love my little brother and my family.

Also...at the monet I don't really have a job and it does get to me sometimes,( even though being a dirtbag ain't too bad with God around) I've still actually been led to finish my high school!
 So I'm currently finishing school and it's going really well.  I've learned to embrace my brokenness and give it over to God constantly and it's changed my life. In a weird way I love being weak and not better than anyone, I feel like I can love a lot more this way. So it's so good now and I feel actual joy in my life that previously had been replaced with just laughter through most of my life, and I'm just kind of happy yknow, at peace. 

Life ain't easy, but there is joy promised to broken hearts and broken in spirit. That's how I go about life now, with an embrace towards ..you.",11Nov2018,1
119,"Not exactly sure where to start this, but i might as well start at the beginning like every other story. This story is completely true, no faking. I know i haven't had the worst life, but it's hard to imagine what it would be like if none of these things ever happened.


(4-6 years old)


So to start, I was born into a loving family, and hard working parents. My dad owned his own contracting business and we never went without. He was the type of man that went without when he was younger, so never took things for granted. Even if i left some steak on my plate he'd talk about being wasteful, and how we were lucky to be able to afford such things. I had a brother and a half sister (my brother and I  considered her full because of being such a huge part in our life). I grew up with lots of relatives, everyone doing well, and everyone seeming.. happy.

My father would take my brother and I on jobs when we were really young, and teach us stuff. We'd ride in his work truck, and even though it was hard work, and extremely hot, it was some of the best times of my life. I'd do anything to go back to those days. It was great for a while, my parents were in love, but not married. But they loved each other like they were for 50 years. My father was a outdoorsman. He loved hunting and fishing. For the very few things i remember about him, i know he loved nature.

We'd go fishing, and he'd teach my brother and I everything. The littlest details bring tears to my eyes. He would show us how to shoot BB guns out in the woods, he'd show the proper way to handle BB guns to transfer over to when we'd eventually go hunting together. My brother and I would always race to the front seat of his truck to be closer to him and look at him while music was playing. But one day my mom got a phone call, and he wrecked his truck. He turned out to be fine, just lots of bruises and scrapes. His truck was totalled though. My mother said ""he was extremely tired while driving and drove off into a ditch."" Not exactly sure how true this part is.

Things were okay for awhile, things seemed.. shakey. Things felt like there was slight tension in every room you went into. My brother and I would play outside ALL the time at this point. We loved basketball and playing war outside. Once again we're between the ages 4-6. My father worked all day while my mother took care of the house and us. She'd be the good mom who made you do your homework as soon as you got home, and make you a snack. My sister at this point was in late middle school. So we'd all do our homework in the kitchen and wait for dinner to be made, and my father to come home.

Some nights.. he didn't come home till after dark. I know as a hard working contractor i'm sure work can go till dusk sometimes. But other times i wasn't sure if that was the reason. It started to become fall and Halloween was around the corner. My brother kept thinking about what we wanted to be this year. My mom made baked stuff for the halloween party at school. I still have pictures of that party. I went as a ninja, and my brother as a pirate. Little did i know that week would change the rest of our lives.

A few days later my brother and I were sleeping in our room, we shared one. I saw lights outside of my window, like really bright lights. Something didn't seem right. I whispered for my brother to wake up, he didn't. He was a really heavy sleeper. Then i heard police sirens. So i shook him awake. We both looked out the window at the street, noticing its right out front of our house. I started to get extremely anxious. We start walking towards our door to go downstairs, and my sister ran down the hall and made us stay in our room. She made us play sega genesis. We were playing NBA Jam. I remember everything about that night.

We heard screaming and crying. Something was so wrong. I felt the world crumbling around me without even knowing what happened. We sat in that room for hours. My mother and sister finally came upstairs crying and sobbing. Each of them sat on a bed, and said that our dad passed away. At the time, my mother said ""heart attack"". He died sitting in the bathroom. People brought so much food.. so much. After that day.. everything changed. Im so sorry this is so long, this isn't only for myself, but incase someone else can relate to any of this so far.


(7 years old)


Everything was quiet for awhile. I was out of school for a little bit. We didn't wanna go back. Everyone knew. People came to his viewing, and as a child, I had to stand next to my dead father's casket, and have people give me their condolences. It felt.. unreal. I didn't want to even face the daylight. I frequently sat in my room bawling my eyes out. Or even sometimes in the shower so no one could hear me. My mom decided that maybe a pet would help us. We went and got a pure black cat with golden eyes. We named her Abby. She seemed to of been abused before we got her, she was extremely distant and didn't like guys. My mom got another pure black cat, and we named her Buffy. She wouldn't leave either my brothers, or my side. 

My mother went and got a full time job basically right after he passed away and knew all we had left was her. She got a lot of insurance money and showered us with gifts. With the fridge always stocked. New shoes and clothes. Skateboards. New games. Everything. Even bought my sister a car in cash when the time came, then another after she totalled it. We didn't go without for awhile. She tried to pay up on debt, and get everything placed back together. She struggled to keep herself together sometimes and would go to her room where i heard faint crying. She kept paying on past due things, and showering us for awhile. Until that money was gone. Bills piled up so high. I could even tell then she was drowning financially.


(8 years old)

My grandma got sick and needed regular permanent care. So she sold her house. Split the money between her kids. So it helped my mom for awhile. My sister got pregnant, at this point is almost out of high school. But eventually we started drowning again. Paranormal things happened in that house after my dad passed. Everyone experienced something. There was no heat sometimes during the winter. No food in the fridge. Electric being turned on, shut off, turned back on, only to be shut off again. We would bundle up in the living room with a space heater. We'd go to food banks and stand out in the cold. I constantly ate. My brother and I both did. We went to therapy and never talked. It used to upset my mom so much. We literally couldn't say a word.


(10 years old)


My brother and I constantly ate. Gained so much weight. The house eventually got foreclosed on. My sister got her own apartment, we got our own. So my brother and I still shared a room. My brother and I continued to gain weight. I was 199 lbs in 5th grade. I got bullied constantly. Kids would make jokes about having no father. Id get bullied for my weight. Kids are so cruel. My brother protected me constantly at recess. We're both large framed taller guys. My father was 6'4 and very bulky. People were intimidated by my brother, and knew he protected me. He was a good brother then. I got into fights and held my own. I didn't want people walking on me anymore.

The school didn't listen about the bullying or anything, and constantly gave me in school suspension. I felt at peace in there. I was alone and away from bullying. I was a good hearted kid. I didn't want to fight or anything. I did it out of wanting to stand up for myself. I got followed on my way home and would have kids jump me. I had some birthday money so i bought a bike. Which helped me in that aspect. Id still constantly skip school to keep away from other kids. I was so self conscious, super low self esteem, knew girls didn't like me, just so many things. It felt like i was walking into a prison and being jumped by inmates.

Id stay home and play halo 2 all day, and eat. I gave my mom so much grief. She worked so hard and i just shit all over it. I skipped so much school she'd get fined. I kept doing it. I knew i had to go, but something deep inside me just couldn't. I wasn't lazy. I'm not stupid. Id pass tests without even studying or reading.


(11-13 years old)


Middle school was a lot of the same as elementary. I skipped a lot and got bullied. Gained a lot more weight, and did nothing about it. Girls were uninterested. I was a fat, funny kid. Who loved video games and hated life. My cat abby died due to cancer.


(14-18 years old)


High school. Good for some, awful for others. Mine was idk. It was okay sometimes, but it was awful others. I was kind of popular, but didn't get girls. I was fat, funny, had semi popular friends. Got invited to parties. Smoked weed. Hung out with a lot of people, but what held me back was not showing up for school, and having very low self esteem. I played video games, didn't do school work, didn't go to school, but i loved my friends. They helped me alot. I had extreme depression, which i was diagnosed with in like 5th grade. I thought about suicide multiple times but never did anything. I was way too scared. I had crushes, and knew i couldn't even compare. I eventually dropped out in 11th grade. My grandma died shortly after that, when i was roughly 17. At this point i was maybe 290 lbs after my mom went to the gym with me and walked while i ran, with her help i lost 70lbs. My highest was 360lbs. 

But since apparently my life isnt rough enough at this point.. my mother started coughing up blood while watching tv. So i knew something was wrong. I called my sister.. she picked her up, and took her to the hospital. Hours later my life changed again. They were both bawling their eyes out. She had lung cancer. I don't remember what stage.. but she had to start chemo. I drove her to her appointments. I sat with her while she had chemo. I watched her go to work full time right after she got chemo. She refused to stop working. I worked at the same place as a temp worker. I helped her with bills occasionally. But mainly on myself.. looking back i regret so much. Almost everything. She now told me my father died due to a heroin overdose. So the heart attack was due to that.

I had to see tears rolling down her face as i shaved her head. She was worried about people staring at her. So we got her some really nice head wraps. People would stare. I used to be so protective. Almost like how my brother was with me. People would stare, and blatantly out in public at walmart, id ask what they were looking at. So they'd scurry off. She eventually got terminal. So she stayed at my uncle's house while my brother and I took over the apartment. She got us gifts, and it was xmas eve. So i spent the night with her and watched xmas movies. She was so out of it. She didn't know who i even was. Stared at me like i was a stranger.

I slept in her room on a couch. She got up at 3am and knew my name. She said my name and asked for help up. My uncle told me to get him if she needs help up. So i go get him, and when we get back.. its as if she never moved. Like she never even asked for help and continued sleeping. So i go back to sleep, wake up, and notice her chest isn't moving. I checked her pulse, and she passed away. On xmas morning. Everyone was called. Coroner came. And i sat in that room and didn't want to leave. I kissed her head, said my goodbyes, and went home. I cried and cried. Later that day we went back over for xmas, with my whole family there. I had to open gifts from my mom who literally just died. I couldn't keep it together. My uncle handed me a envelope with a letter in it. I read it when i got home. I couldn't keep myself together.


(19 years old)


My brother constantly brought people over and would sniff pills, smoke pot, cigarettes, chew dip, and drink. He did landscaping and would never pay his part of the rent. He blew all of his money on drugs while i continued paying for everything. We both got our GED's with ease.


(20 years old)


Lived in that apartment for a while. Worked ft and payed what had to be paid. Then i moved in with my sister so i could go to school and get away from my brothers habits. My brother started doing heroin.


(21-22 years old)


A Lot of the same. I worked a lot. I worked 2 full time jobs. I worked between 18-20 hours a day. I was burning out. I wanted to move out into my own apartment again. I wanted to start a career in something. I just wasn't sure what made me happy. I lost 160 lbs, and felt absolutely amazing. I was very lean with muscle mass. Had a mustang. Felt like i was finally succeeding. I met my now girlfriend and we moved in together. We both had ft jobs. My cat (buffy) was bleeding profusely (she's fixed). So i called my union steward to make sure i could call off. She said yes. So i took her to an ER vet, and she was okay. Needed surgery for a anal gland rupture. Next day i go into work, i got fired. My union steward was wrong, so i lost my job. I tried to find another job and eventually did. 



(23 years old - Current)


Both have jobs at a big factory, make about 85k a year. We did well for awhile. She started having lots of medical problems, as did I. Had doctors notes and everything for days we were off. But the company fired us without going through the union, and wouldn't take the notes from the doctor. Believe me. I read thay union book front to back. This is a worldwide company, so i figured i had no leverage. We lost my mustang. Our apartment. Almost everything. We stored our belongings in my sisters garage and became homeless. 

We were homeless for 6 months. I've pissed in some really weird places. Now as i sit here 23 years old, almost 24. I realize so much. If anything in this post relates to u, please know that things will be okay. I've lost almost everything i hold dear. Most of my family doesnt care, either does my girlfriends. Since i lost all that weight, i sit here at 395 lbs. My highest ever. Constant pain. Why would i do such a thing to my body? I had nice veiny arms and wore beautiful clothes, and looked great. Now i wear shorts alot, and a hoodie so it helps me feel more covered of how ashamed i am.

125,"Throughout the majority of my life, I've been generally plagued with self-doubt and serious self-image issues that have resulted in crazy levels of social anxiety. I've been generally unhappy with the way I look, think, sound, etc. I've tended to feel that others dislike me or are only putting up with me as an act of kindness. 

However, and it seems to have occurred almost unconsciously, these feelings have slowly but surely subsided. I'm not sure if it has to do with self-improvements I've tried to make, if maybe the process of aging itself has made me a more positive person, or what exactly it is--but I've recently realized that I'm probably the happiest I've ever been. The waves of panic I'd often feel in regards to being observed or talked about by other people have seemed to alleviate themselves from my life, leaving behind only this sort of miraculous peace that I've been chasing after for over a decade. 

I still have things about myself that I dislike, or that I wish were different. But for the first time, I'm not drained or dominated by them. I just sort of don't care anymore, and that not caring may be what's brought this bout of new feelings on. It's almost as if I'm seeing the world, for the first time, through my own lens; and not the lens of others, in an attempt to conform myself to the expectations that I've presumed they have.

My parents didn't monitor my internet usage so I had a lot of freedom. I spent time on Tumblr and kik, posting selfies of myself for fun. I'd get comments from people which made me feel better about myself. Most of the comments were from old men but I didn't think much of it. 

A guy started talking to me on Kik, his username had Darth Vader in it and I thought he seemed cool and nice. I don't remember if he ever told me his age, but he didn't conceal it either. He was about 50. He was nice at first but eventually turned the conversation to sex. I'd be lying if I said the thought of sex didn't excite me. I felt flattered and curious when he started talking about bdsm and his kinks. He'd call me things like ""sweet little baby, princess, kitten, etc"". I showed the messages to my friends and they were perhaps less naive than me, because they told me to block him. But I didn't and it just got worse. 

He told me to be his slave and I agreed. I sent him pictures. I can't remember why I did it. It felt bad. I told him I didn't wanna do it anymore. He got angry and told me to stop being a bad slave. He told me to record a video of myself saying I consent to being his slave. I can't remember if I did it or not. 

He said we should Skype. For the first few calls he told me to have my camera on and his screen was black. He told me to undress and do stuff. Eventually he showed me his face. He was old, from Singapore (he told me), morbidly obese, and smoking the fattest cigarr ever. 

He told me I was like his daughter. He said he wanted to help me. He was sweet too so I got hooked on it, I don't remember. I felt guilty saying no. I wasn't mentally stable, I was cutting myself and felt worthless. I remember he gave me orders and told me to follow. Once he told me to record myself eating my own period blood. To get out of it I ate red paint instead. 

Eventually I talked to a friend of mine about it and they literally forced me to block him and made sure I kept him blocked on all sites. 

I'm 19 now and left with a bad feeling about it. I wonder where those videos of myself are, because they showed my face. I hope theyre deleted but I don't know. I wonder if he did worse stuff to girls irl. I regret not seeing how wrong it was but at that age I didn't realize it.

140,"Today I saw a father walking in front of me on the street. It was going dark, and he held his daughter on his shoulders, her little legs in his hands. Behind him, a woman who I assumed was the mother. Pushing a baby in a stroller. They seemed so happy. So complete. It was a happy little image of bliss. And one I will never get to experience myself.

The woman looked at her husband, or boyfriend, I have no way of knowing their marital status. She looked at him, carrying their daughter. Maybe she was thinking at this very moment, how that man she was with had become the father she always saw in him. The man she always felt he would be. She may be very happy. Fulfilled. Completed. She certainly… looked the part. The happy little family. 

I don’t have that.

And I never will.

My wife wakes up, crying at night sometimes. She cannot stand to use social media any longer. Being given the honor of being a kid’s godmother is already painful to her. She wants to have a family. She badly wants it. But I will never be able to give it to her. She wants to carry a child inside her belly. Nurture it. She wants all the food and minerals she takes in to form that tiny human being inside her. And feel it grow. Feel it kick for the first time. There is nothing in this world she wants more. She told me this, in these exact words. Tears in her eyes.

She only wants it from me. 

And I can never give it to her. I am infertile. I am her infertile soulmate. Her barren life partner. There was a time when I wanted to be the mother. The woman. The one carrying the child. I wanted that when I was a child. Weird, I know, but somehow, I did. I was told I never could. Because I was a boy. And I would never be a girl. I felt like I was a girl. Like I wanted to be. But I never could. I think it was all about this ideal of motherhood… somehow it was so deeply ingrained in me. I was raised by strong women. Close, perhaps too close, to my mother and grandmother. I loved them to death. My aunt too. My older sister. I loved them so much, I wanted to *be* them.

They let me. I tried. I struggled. I tried to condition myself. I tried to convince myself. I wanted this very much. No matter the cost. No matter the effects. No matter what I had to surrender… I had to. I needed to. Become that person. That woman. But I couldn’t be. I never could be. No amount of introspection, analysis, meditation, drugs, hormones and clothing styles ever changed me. Not the long hair. Not the makeup I learned how to apply skillfully. Not the way I walked. Not the boys I dated. Not the boys I was with. Forced myself to be with. Not the attention I craved, and was given. Not the validation I fought for and received. Not the battles I fought and won. No matter how much I won, how much I gained, I always felt like losing. 

I stopped it all. 

Tried to be a man. But I wasn’t much of a man anymore at that point. Not much of me was left. I was confused. Stuck in a limbo. I look the part now, more or less. But I don’t function as I should. I’m still so confused. I got legally emancipated. Lived by myself since age 17. Tried every drug and liquor under the sun. got close to dying more times than I can count. I got into fights. Woke up underneath bridges, my head on slabs of concrete. I had sex. Tons of sex. I dated. Whored. Lied and tricked. Dealt. Then I met her, at the age of nineteen. We were married three months later. Sometimes, you just know. 

I knew it right away, with the certainty of a man who has never known a thing in his life. With the certainty of a lifelong doubter: she was The One.

I loved her so much but I can never give her what she wants. And she can never give me what I want, either. I’m writing this down because honestly, I am at a point of dying. In a way, I have been dead for a while now. But I’m clinging on to life for her. 

Maybe I need to be even more terrible *to* her. So she will realize I am terrible *for* her.  

Maybe I need to drive her away. So, it will be easier for her to deal with my inevitable death, once I end it. But I can’t. I just can’t. I am so terrified of hurting her. I want to die. But I don’t want to hurt anyone. I have been hurt too much already. By others. By myself. I have been harassed, online and offline. Lied to. Insulted. Invalidated and called a liar. I want to share my story but I risk being made into a pawn by people I despise. And hated at the same time by people who I thought were my friends. 

There is no helping me and there is no way out and there is no outcome at this point that goes beyond me just postponing the inevitable. I know the way, the method, the location. I got it all planned out. Part of me wants to write some sort of life story down first. Maybe a manifesto of sorts. I want to hurt as few people as possible. Shock as few people as possible. I just want to disappear into thin air. But I don’t know how.

Thank you for reading. I’m empty.

141,"Last night a couple of my friends (Austin and Jacob) and I decided to have a game night by bringing our PS4’s to Austin’s house. We had just had one the night before and Austin decided it was so much fun that we should come back and do it again. The first night we mainly decided to play Diablo 3. Jacob was well advanced in this game and already had a paragon level 1350 character (high level). So he carried us through the entire story and then carried us through grinding to get our endgame gear and whatnot. We hadn’t completely finished and still had some grinding to go, so when it came up in our group conversation what game we would play, the text went like this. 

Austin: Y’all wanna do a new game each time?
Jacob: Maybe not a new game every week but we can alternate games
Austin: Yeah maybe one game until we beat it or get tired of it
Me: I’m still enjoying diablo rn, but I’m down to try some other games
Austin: Yea I’m still cool with diablo I was just suggesting something we could start doing
Austin: Be on the lookout for the next game...
Austin: What y’all doing tonight?
Me:  Nothing probably
Austin: another game night?
Me: hell yeah!
[yada yada]
Jacob: What game we playing tonight?
Austin: Same one
Jacob: Diablo?
Austin: or whatever
Jacob: ok

And that’s about the extent of our conversation concerning what we were gonna play. Come later that day, we’re all there playing Diablo, and like 30 minuets in Jacob says “Ok, I’m done with this” and quits out of the game. So Austin and I were like ok, and decided to choose a new game to play. We landed on playing Ark, but Austin and I had to buy and download it. We get the idea to use the disk, since Jacob already had it on disc, to download the game in hopes that it would go faster (later found out that you can’t use a disk download as a digital downloaded copy for the game for some reason). Jacob goes to his bag and discovers he doesn’t have the disc. I say “how did you not bring all your games?” He blames it on us saying that we were only gonna play Diablo. Austin doesn’t want the blame on him so he points out that I said I was still having fun with diablo, so we didn’t plan on playing anything else and it was essentially my fault for hindering the group from playing anything else last night. I argue that I also said “but I’m down for playing other games” and that Austin and Jacob were apart of that conversation too and had just as much of an opinion/vote as I did on the matter. AND that Austin pretty much finalized the situation by telling Jacob that we were playing Diablo. To be specific, I used the metaphor of him stamping his agreement to the decision. Austin said, “So if we’re all sitting around and eating cake, and I ask, ‘hey guys are you enjoying this cake or do you want to do something else?’ And you say ‘I’m still enjoying this cake right now. ‘ That I should slap the cake out of your hands?” I went back to my point of me also saying BUT we can play other games if y’all wanted to and that I would be ok with that. 

It went back and forth like this for awhile with both of us bringing up the same or similar points with different metaphors and somewhere in there Jacob had said that I might as well have not said anything to which I did agree with. I said that what I had said in the group was essentially me copping out of making a decision all together.

We’re all good now though. We ended up taking a trip to Jacob’s house to get the game, downloading Ark regularly on both our consoles and having a lot of fun the rest of the night. But in the moment it was something that really upset me and still upsets me and I wanted to hear what others thought. 

TLDR; Two of my friends and I had a game night at someone’s house where we had decided beforehand to only play a single game. Really quickly we got tired of it and wanted to play something else but someone was unprepared and didn’t have their disc. We had texted beforehand and I said I was fine with continuing to play the game we got tired of but would also be fine with playing something else. Blame went around as to who it was that put us in the situation to be playing only one game in the first place. It was argued that I said I was enjoying said game and it was my fault, but I argued that we were all entitled to our own opinions/vote on what to play and it wasn’t my fault for everyone just going with what I said.

143,"These things are somewhat related and may depend on each other. I hate living at home. I've been doing so since I graduated from uni and I've reached my boiling point.

Around 4:45 ok i'm crying, I head for the stairs to go to my room in-case my dad came home and saw me in the living room crying, but I get half way up the stairs and the clouds must have just covered the sun as the whole upstairs was very dark, and it felt like a demon was luring me into my room so he could make me feel like shit, so I thought I should rush out the house before I can convince myself otherwise, which I did. Around 5pm I get to the gym. Instantly go to and lock myself in the rather spacious disabled changing room (with heated flooring which is so bliss to lye on) instantly start crying again. For no reason whatsoever I feel so defeated, so grey, so dull, so I'm lying on this heated flooring listening to music not so much crying but still teary eyed up until about 6pm. Then I get a sudden burst of anger and motivation, and start pacing back and forth in this disabled changing room until around 6:30. Then from around 6:30 - 6:45 I'm dancing so happily to the music, I mean, I am ANIMATED. I'm laughing (silently) and smiling ear to ear. Then at around 6:45 I feel really shit again and lye back down until about 7pm, at which point I realise my water bottle had been leaking in my bag that I'd been using as a pillow. This created a certain sense of urgency, so I tried drying the bag under the hand-dryer, but it wasn't doing much. At this point, around 7:15 I say fuck the gym, simply do not want to do the workout. So I take a 20 second walk from the gym to the nearest McDonalds, after realising the only thing I'd eaten so far today was a banana. Proceed to order A filet-o-fish meal with large fries and coke, chicken legend meal with large fries and a coke, 3 chicken breasts, oreo mcflurry, and a double chocolate cookie. At this point my phone is dead but I still have my earphones in to drown out some of the sound of the McDonalds. Get done around 8pm, so I head back to home, stopping about 3 times hurling thinking I'm gonna be sick. Now it's just past 9pm and I've had a shower, brushed my teeth, and generally feel a lot calmer and more collected.

After giving my my order to someone who clearly wasn’t “J-Boy” I move up to the first window. When I arrive at the first window there’s a girl there. When I look at her nametag it read “Kay Kay”. Now I know society it’s moving towards more relaxed work environments, but when did we start putting our street names on our professional name badges? Professional athletes don’t put street names on their jerseys. Not to mention she had Long fake fingernails about 3 inches in length, which I know is not very allowed or sanitary when working in food service. But I guess it was ok because her long fake finger nails at least matched her hot pink eyeshadow which did not make her look like a prostitute at all.

So once Kay Kay with the nasty nails swiped my card I moved up to the next window. Now here is where it all goes downhill. I get to the next window and there was no one there.

After I honk my horn, another young girl walks up to the window, opens it and with an attitude and says “What-chu ordered?” She said it just like that,  “What-chu ordered?” Doesn’t even attempt to speak in any type of polite or professional manner. So I tell her I ordered 2 happy meals to which she reply’s“Hole’on” then slams the window. It gets worse. After slamming the window she then screams to someone out of view “Dawg, where the fuck my 2 happy meals at dawg?” Then she starts laughing at something someone says and runs out of view. 

At this point I’m just at a loss of words. I would’ve asked to speak to the manager but it’s not even worth it at this point. The whole store is just too far gone. Chances are this is the same manager who hired these employees, or at the very least, allows them to act in this was and continue to be employed despite their clear lack of manners and professionalism.

I’m officially done with McDonald’s. 

Chik fil A going forward. It really didn’t have to be this way

153,"I've struggled for years with my mental health. I was in a long-term relationship, thought I was going to get married, and was cheated on 11 months ago. I dated again, and made many mistakes. I was trying to fill a hole in my heart the wrong way.

I stopped feeling happy a long time ago. Maybe years ago. I mean sure, there were moments where I was happy, where some success was something that warmed my heart a bit. But it was never my baseline. And the happiness faded back into the fog and gray of sadness not long after. I never woke up happy.

I started therapy a few months ago. It's been an uphill slog, and my life is full of stress, but today I woke up with a smile. It was the first time I can remember. I sat up, I smiled, and I felt good. Normally I tell myself that I'm unloved, unloveable, and more. Today I sat there and the only thought I had was, ""I'm happy"".

I nearly cried with joy.

Just writing this I'm still nearly crying. It was so beautiful to have a minute's reprieve, where instead of the constant sadness and pain I had a moment of happiness. Normally the only way I could forget myself for awhile was by drinking, but here I am, making progress without needing that as a crutch to shut my brain down.

I don't have a lot of people to share this with, so I figured I'd post it here. I hope you all feel happy today too, and if you don't, then I hope you do tomorrow.",11Nov2018,1
154,"I got a story that I always wanted to tell to anyone that wanted to hear it. I wrote as response in a ""askreddit"" post, but thoght that it belongs here. Sorry for grammar, I'm brazilian.

I've got two best friends since we were 9 y/o (we are 21today). We shall name them R and J (abreviation for Rafael and José). We were best friends forever for many many years, but they were closer to each other than I was from both. I met them in my school at the time we were 8, but they studied in the morning period, and I studied in the afternoon.I used to go to school in the morning for extra-classes, where I met them in the playground time.

Fast foward 5 years, i migrated for the morning period and we felt like the three mosketeers, we used to do everything together, group works, playground time, lunch etc. We three weren't satisfied with our school -neither were our moms (this was in 5th grade)-  so we moved to another one, more expensive, with rich kids, boring kids where we were separated, again. They both were alocated in the B class, and I was on A, but still we were the best friends. I didn't talked with anyone besides two new friends, Andre and Igor (J' cousin)

Fast forward 4 years (I think, I've never really told this story to anyone, so the facts may be confusing in the matter of years), and we are in the collegial (not college, here in brazil it would be like, the 10th grade). We were starting to go out more often, parties, with a wider group of friends, and I still would be catching up with R and J, but they were more friends with each other than with me. I was okay with it, and they still were my best friends. We kept going on each other's houses, but less frequently, and still talked with each other every day. R got a GF, and so did J. I didn't, I couldn' find any girl in the school that would like me - and didn't care that much too, cause I never was a ""going out"" guy, and being so young, I couldn't talk with any pretty girl without almost passing out.
 
One year passes, one day I go to school and both R and J missed class. ""Okay, maybe they've gone to some party yesterday, and the hangover didn't let they come today"".

One week, both gone, couldn't find them, so I texted them like ""yo, u good?"" for both. J didn't answer, R started to tell me that everything was okay. In the monday, both appeared in school, and for the first time, they were not together in the lunch time. I was never someone very sociable, and I was studying for the final tests and college applications - the vestibular would take 3 years to happen, but still i was studying early bc medical school is very difficult to enter here - so I wasn't catching up with their parties and stories, I had no ideia that they had a fight.

Soooo I asked both, separated, why they weren't talking to each other. First I asked R, that said ""J is being too selfish, he's an douch, and it isn't my fault if he don't know how to please a woman"". I don't understood at the time, in fact he said this and i was like ""haha okay wut?"" - later i discovered that J have broke with his gf. When I asked J what happened, the story got all ""wtf"" vibes. R fucked J GF, and J just discovered -two months after the affair- cause his now ex-Gf were preagnant - wich couldn't happen since J and her never had sex!


I heard all of it and was like ""wut"". Yet i kept talking with both - I was never the type of guy that take sides in fights that don't concern me. Passed 6 months, J missed class another entire week. He was distant -and today i know he started using pot with the bad/bully guys of our class- while R was very very changed, like he was nervous all the time - I think that keeping such secrets from his family was consuming him. One day a J friend call me, tell me to talk to J, that he was not normal and needed help. I called him on skype, and - after 1 hour ringing - found J red of tears, holding something off camera and drinking some cheap vodka alone. I ask ""the fuck man, what's going on?"".

J start to tell me that R persuaded his ex-GF to an abortion, and still kept with his own GF. He was upset cause everything seems to go the way R wants, and show me what he was holding off camera - his dad gun, a pistol (i don't understand about guns, but it wasn't automatic, it was one of that old pistols with 6 rounds). He said to me that it would be a good ideia to miss the class on monday, cause they both and whoever were in the way would appear in the news at night. 


I got very very lost, as I said, I'm not good with people, so I start talking like ""man, he don't worth it, stop drinking and put this fucking gun in the fucking closet before your fucking mom fucking sees it and you get fucking fucked"". I think he heard me. We talked a bit more, and he passed out in front of the PC after drinking more vodka. With hurry, I called his mom with a anonymous number and yelled ""GO LOOK FOR THE GUN GO LOOK FOR THE GUN JOSEHASTHEGUNLADY"" and turned the phone off, hoping she got the message and didn't think it was a prank. So i saw her entering his room and turned off the call before she could see me - I really didn't want to be associated with this shit.


While J was probably getting ripped by his mother, i called R, told him to not go to school monday, said that this whole situation was fucked, but as they both were my friends and human beings, ""I don't want to be in the next collumbine story"". He, scared, missed class the whole week. J calmed down, shit hit the roof, R actual Gf discovered about the J ex-gf abortation, and so his mom, things got thought for him. His actual Gf dumped him, his mother- well i don't know about his mother, but i don't think she liked that- and J found some piece in R's personal hell.

Neither R or J left our school, but never talked to each other again. 2 years passed, we were in the graduation year, R were every day less talkish with me, while J kept a good friendship, but not as it used to be, as i studied 10-12 hours a day, so i couldn't go to his parties with his pot friends. J started Law school in our city, with a new GF, I started one year of study revision as i didn't get to college in the first year trying, and R disappeared, gone to another city with his mom and sister, didn't even care to say good bye.


Now, I'm in the third year of medical school, J is almost graduating law school, still dating his ""new"" GF Isa, a lovely person that put him away from the bad friends, and I never heard of R again. I get to reunite with J two times a year (my college is 438 killometters from my hometown, in another state), but every time we got together, is like we were the two kids that met in the playground time in the school, probably the best friend I have today, even talking to him two times a year. About R, i never saw him again, heard he's doing Mechanics Engineering school, and kinda miss him, but not that much to the point to text him. Next month I'm coming home and already called J to go to Isa's place reunite. 


This is a very important story to me, is kinda the story of my life, but I'm not the protagonist, and I'm glad that for the first time I get to tell anyone this story. Thank you to everyone that read it all, and sorry for the grammatical errors, my native language isn't english.",11Nov2018,1
155,"It all started a Friday, as I was 11. I'm eating dinner with my mom and my sister (dad comes home late). We hear someone knocking on the door: it's the police. They tell my mom that my dad had killed himself, and that he left some three letters (one for each member of the family).

I learnt later it was because his relationship with my mom was extremely toxic, but he refused to divorce as he would consider it a personal fail.

The three of us just cry for a solid 15mns. It takes me several minutes to realise that it's all over, that he won't come back even if I really need it.

But life continues. I go to school the week after, and only tell my best friends about it. The news spread out, and the guys that were supposed to hate me come to me to say they're sorry, blablabla.

I stop sports, as my two favorite sports (ping pong and basketball) were introduced to me by my father. It just felt wrong. I start binge eating. My grades go down.

My mom starts being a strange vegan anti vax irritating typical mom. She's not motivated to do anything. I had to cook for myself, do my laundry, clean the house, go grocery shopping, take the bus because she stopped to wake up. It was hard. Would've been hard if my sister didn't basically become my mother (she's 4 years older than me, I admire everything about her, and I'd probably be an incel if she didn't exist). I'm constantly exhausted. I have trouble focusing in class, start getting behavior remarks.

I have less and less friends, essentially because I smile and laugh less. I get fat, shower twice a month, don't brush my teeth, never go out except for school.

At some point, I realise that I won't be able to do as the smart kids and choose the science path when I'm 16 (French system) and that I'll have to go with all the chads &amp;stacies in the economic path.

During the summer holidays (in France it's two months) I literally don't go out of the house except for grocery shopping. I just play video games &amp; watch shit on YouTube. I wake up at 6PM. It's hard. The first sucidal thoughts come haunt me. I have nothing else to think about because I'm always bored. It was a cry for help, but no one noticed.

But a few months ago, it changed. I told myself that in September, it would be different. I motivate myself as much as I can, and it works. I tell myself that I want to be as successful as my father (he's still someone I admire).

It works. I have a fine hygiene. I'm constantly getting good/excellent grades. I start reading a book. I uninstall League of legends from my computer. I'm bonding with my classmates. I wake up early, with a smile on my face. I try to eat healthier, I sometimes go out with the chads, and this week I started going to the gym after school. I like to think that it's all uphill from here. As I'm writing this post, I'm 16 and I'm the proudest I've ever been. Special thanks to my sister, that is hands down the best human.

If you're a teen that's struggling with depression or anything else, here's the message: it does get better. I understand that it may look impossible to do. I understand that small things, like showering once a week, can be extremely hard.
I'm not gonna tell you to ""just cheer up"", because it has never helped me.
You need to understand that we all go through hardships in our lifes, and that life just gave you the harshest one.
It's one step at a time. It all started with a shower for me.
Life does get better. Each and every one of us have so much to life for, so much to see, so many to meet, so much to accomplish, so much to experience.
Sorry if this post didn't made sense to you, I just typed as I felt.

156,"Hello everyone. I'm here to talk about something that's been on my mind for the last few days.

You may be able to guess what this is about by the title of this post. Before I begin, may I say that, if you're feeling suicidal, or are having suicidal thoughts, please talk to someone. Ring one of the suicide prevention helplines even, anything. Just talk to someone, please.

First of all, a little backstory: me and my ex-girlfriend met at our first year at college. We got talking and started getting to know one another. More similar than we could have imagined as it happens. Before summer break, I got her number, and during that summer I told her that I loved her. We started going out. Due to certain constraints, we couldn't actually go out together. The only time we had together was at college.

We dated for about 8-9 months, I forget. I'd had a few secret girlfriends in the past, but she was the only one I'd actually been with a lot, and felt proper love for. In the end though, things didn't work out. She practically, no, she DID beg me not to leave her, but I did in the end. 

After that, she became really depressed, barely eating, crying herself to sleep every night. She told me all this, and yet I felt nothing. Cold hearted you could say. The woman I loved was in pieces and I didn't give a damn. I just carried on with my life, not responding to her texts, and eventually deleting her number. She tried to reach out to me, to try to get me to help her with her depression... I ignored it like the cold hearted person that I can be.

After some time, while I was at work, I got another long text from her. I read through it. She was going to kill herself. It was a goodbye message to me. My heart sank. I know what being at the tipping point feels like, I've been there. I've contemplated ending everything. Because of knowing this, something reached through the hard shell that encased my heart, and motivated me to try to help. 

I texted her back as soon as I could. It was a struggle. She was so damn close to going. I just about managed to talk her down from it (pardon the ""pun"" if you can call it that, no double entendre was intended), when the same happened a few days later. Luckily with the same end result: I talked her down from that feeling. She said to me that she was actually about to commit suicide when she texted me. If I had ignored it, or responded later, she could be dead.

She later told me, that before I had talked to her and calmed her down, that  she had previously tried to overdose on Paracetamol I believe. Once she'd taken the pills, she instantly regretted it, and didn't want to die. She apparently tried to find her phone to text me goodbye, but couldn't. She curled up on her bed, clutching her sheets, thinking of me. She cried herself to sleep, knowing that she might never have got to say goodbye to the man she loved most in the world... Despite him tearing her heart in two. When she woke up the next morning, she felt horrible. She told me that she realised that if she had taken a couple more pills, she'd be gone. Forever. 

I have no romantic feelings towards this woman anymore, none at all. She still loves me so much. I keep thinking that this is because of me. If I hadn't have acted on that initial gut feeling of attraction, If I hadn't have been so hard on her, If I hadn't have done so many things, that she might not have nearly ended it all. I realise all that, and yet I still feel cold towards her, even after all that. It almost makes me doubt that I'm human.

I saved her life. I protected her from herself, and yet I still have no desire to keep contact. Rather the opposite I'm affraid. It puzzles me, how I can still be so naturally heartless towards her. In some aspects, I see myself as a very affectionate man, and yet, a heartless shell that feels nothing towards his fellow man. Is this a common thing?

I showered her with love and affection. I loved her so much. I couldn't imagine life without her. I wanted to be so intimate with her. Yet in the end, that love grew cold. I wanted to have her out of my life. I didn't even want to hold hands with her. The poor thing just wanted to love me, and I broke her poor heart in two. I shattered her dreams. With one move, her world came tumbling down. 

I find it so intriguing how one can be so heartless. I'm gradually learning from my mistakes. I'm not looking for another relationship, granted I'd love one again, but I'm putting it on a back burner. I need to sort my life out first. 

She thanked me so much for saving her life. She said that I'm the one that stopped her. I'm the reason she's still here. I feel responsible for her, after everything that's gone on between us. Sometimes the urge to be back in that relationship can be so strong, I'll admit that. But that's all it is, an urge. A sudden rush of emotions, a longing for what I had. I've screwed with her head too much already to do that to her. 

I'm sorry that this has turned into more of a person rant, but that's how I tend to go in long personal posts like these. Thank you for reading all of this. Even if you've skipped straight to the comments, thank you for taking the time to even do that. Have a good day my friend, bless your soul.",11Nov2018,1
157,"Something I see a lot online, beyond all the pretty blatant trans hate and wilful ignorance, is the idea that the vast majority of people ""don't really feel like a man or a woman"". It's a completely innocent thing to say - I can't say for certain, but I imagine that people who aren't trans don't have some sort of distinct feeling of man- or woman-ness - but it's often wielded as a weapon of sorts, a pin to pop the trans balloon. How do I know that my gender isn't what it should be when most people don't even consciously feel like a gender?

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to do right now is address this as best I can. I decided to do this about 5 minutes ago; I haven't exactly planned this out, and I have no doubt it'll be a little emotional to write at times, so I apologise in advance for the interesting ""structure"" this will probably follow, if it can even be described as such. I want to explain, as best I can, how I grew up a boy who felt like he really should have been a girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the best place to start tends to be the beginning, I'll start there. I could ruminate and theorise on how all sorts of vaguely esoteric childhood events were signs of my transness - my curiosity surrounding the flat crotches of Action Men toys stripped naked being one such weird bit of shit - but I think definitively trans things work better.

&amp;#x200B;

My first memory that strikes me as 100% symbolic of things to come happened at around six. I remember that I was reading an Animorphs book - for those not in the know, they featured children who could turn into animals they had touched, but remained stuck as any animal they spent longer than two continuous hours as. They'd seen a tiger at a zoo, maybe? The thought I remember having, loudly and clearly, was that I wanted to give my female cousin a tap on the shoulder and be her twin sister forever. This idea filled me up with an abundance of childish happiness; it just seemed like the best thing ever.

&amp;#x200B;

I also really distinctly remember two things. Without getting into the nitty gritty of it, the first is that I was really distinctly...not disturbed, or disgusted, but more *afraid* of my genitals. Having to touch them kinda freaked me out a little, like that sense of energised anxious fear you get when you handle a hairy spider or a snake. This was the case as far back as I can remember. I didn't really get over this fear until I was around 11 or so, and even then I held a very strong dislike of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

The second thing happened at about 7 or 8; I found out that girls didn't tend to have penises. We were at the beach, and I was kind of fascinated with the distinct lack of anything penis-ey visible among the women there that I had suddenly consciously noticed. I remember the feeling of that realisation; it was like that sinking feeling in your stomach and throat, and the heaviness that sits behind your eyes and pulls your lips down, when you see a crush with someone else, or your friend bullies you to look cool. It was this fascinated sense of loss. I knew, in a way I would never have been able to verbalise, that I'd lost something from the moment I entered this world.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't really pin down exactly when I fully realised that I wanted to be a girl. It's hard to even put that feeling into words. ""Wanting to be a girl"" sounds like mere desire, when this has always been far more than my want for a shiny new graphics card or to get into my dream university. *I felt like I should have been born a girl*. Even that feels sketchy; I hardly have the divine powers to know what should and shouldn't be. The other ""should"" feelings that sprang up over the years - most often my feeling that it felt unfair that I and my family were working class, and that we should have been richer - felt more like desire, like I didn't like something and wanted it to be better. My feelings on my gender were more than even this sort of desire. I not only felt that being a boy was Very Not Good, but that something had gone seriously wrong, and that this was a matter of rectification over mere improvement, of changing a wrong to a right than simply making something I didn't like into something more palatable.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't feel like a girl trapped in a boy's body or anything like that. I felt like I was a boy, but as a result of some divine mistake. I was a boy who should have been a girl. Not a boy who wanted to do feminine things - I was a touch feminine in my mannerisms, but always had fairly masculine interests - but a boy who felt like it would be right to be a girl.

&amp;#x200B;

About 10 years old was when the feelings went from ""I should have been a girl, being a boy isn't really me"" to ""I should have been a girl, and being a boy is starting to get actively bad oh god help"". I remember that this was when the envy started. Oh, oh, oh, the envy. I looked at girls and what stared me back was the normal life that had been torn away at birth. I was jealous of their names, their hair, that when the teacher separated the girls from the boys that they didn't have to ignore their sinking stomachs and that feeling of wrongness. My envy turned into this toxic black sludge that sat fetid and stagnant in my head when I thought about what girls had and what I didn't. Seeing girls made me feel disgusting. I was reminded of what I was, and the absolute slew of awfulness this envy caused me grew over the years into hate, into anger. My envy, to this day, makes me feel like a bad person.

&amp;#x200B;

I was somewhat apathetically religious until I hit about 13 or so. I used to pray at night from about 10 onwards; roughly biweekly, sometimes more, then less as time went on until I stopped. I cried most times, as quietly as I could. I'd pray to please let me wake up as a girl. Later on, I begged for God to make me be happy as a boy. Towards the end of my religious period, I just wanted to get hit by a bus or something. I didn't really want to die, but I also didn't really want to live as a boy, either, and the thought of being a man filled me with this deep existential dread. I had fantasies of heroically saving my friends and dying. I had long ago decided that I was going to kill myself at 25, and held to this until the dam finally broke at 20 and I came out to my parents a few days after Christmas crying more than I ever had, when my Christmas wish to wake up a girl was denied again. Our bin still has the dent my mum kicked into it.

&amp;#x200B;

Puberty was an utterly nightmarish experience. I cannot fully describe how hellish I found it with words alone, and to anyone who has a trans kid and on the fence about puberty blockers, I urge you to read this part if nothing else. 

&amp;#x200B;

I entered a strange sort of doublethink at puberty. I knew I was trans; like the parent who knows their child is not as good as they claim to be but still proclaims their greatness, I knew I was trans as some sort of higher truth, but continually denied it for years. It was a fetish. I was a person who could be happy as both genders. I was happy as a guy. To some exent, this denial was a shield. I was able to have a surface-level pride in my ever-masculinising appearance, even as a voice told me that I didn't really like it at all. I could function during school, in exchange for a permanently miserable mood I constantly hid, constant nasty and spiteful thoughts about women, and massive breakdowns every few days in secret where I sobbed over the life I'd lost. Later on, after noticing how toxic I was becoming, I gradually accepted that I was trans, and that I would never transition. I felt like a better person - less angry and horrible and nasty - but my general mood worsened and my anxiety over my sex became everpresent rather than bundled away until it hit me all at once.

&amp;#x200B;

I always felt lonely. I was, after all, the world's greatest actress. Everything I ever did was done in the name of ""is this what the boy me would do?"" The person my friends knew, that my family loved, didn't exist, and I was separated from the world by a solid wall of artificial personhood. I was a fairly popular, good-looking guy, especially when I hit 19 and decided that I would try and be the best guy I could to de-trans myself once and for all. I had the best facial hair out of everyone I knew my age. My red hair became a boon rather than the butt of jokes. I grew into the always-too-large ears and teeth that child-me was burdened with. Though I couldn't start lifting because any sight of masculine muscle growth ended with a lot of sobbing, I looked good, and I had a lot of friends. I dated a few pretty girls, and even had sex regularly, provided I remembered to not think too hard about the snarling beast that was my envy and constructed fictional shopping lists in my head. I was utterly alone, and growing more and more miserable.

&amp;#x200B;

My envy became firmly settled on physical characteristics as the distance between myself and other girls grew to be greater than just a penis and different hair/clothes. This is where what I'd recognise as dysphoria started. My body felt disgusting and foreign to me. Facial hair felt like dirt spreading up my face, like ants crawling under my skin and forcing their legs through my pores. My shoulders got wider as I grew taller; I felt lumbering and oafish and horribly large, even though I was incredibly slender for a guy. I remember my grandfather complimenting me on my broadening shoulders and crying in his bathroom in disgust. Having a flat chest felt alien; things would touch it where my brain told me I shouldn't be capable of being touched, like some eldritch feeler had slithered inside my skin and was touching my insides. Looser shirts would make me uncomfortably aware of the gap between my chest and my shirt; one time, when putting on a tuxedo to go to a university ball, I curled up under my desk, crying and hyperventilating for half an hour over the feeling. It wasn't fun.

&amp;#x200B;

I came out at 20 after a week of pure, perfect misery, and ended up on hormones eight months later, on the 11th August, 2017.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I think I understand why most people say they don't feel like a man or a woman, they just know they are. Hormones lifted my day-to-day mood to basically normalcy, and gave me an emotional depth I never realised I was missing. They made physical changes, and now not much of me resembles a man at all. At first, this was exciting, but now, it doesn't feel like anything. I have boobs. They're there. They feel...normal. They're just there, the same way my fingers and toes are. I can consciously appreciate them, but aside from that, they just *are*, and that feels like nothing in particular.

&amp;#x200B;

This, more than anything, tells me that I am trans, and that this is what being a woman feels like to me. It feels like feeling completely normal with female sex characteristics, to put it clinically. It doesn't really feel like anything at all, by itself, but in comparison to the pain of being 100% male, it's definitely there. To me, *this* is being a man or a woman - it's having a body that maybe you're not totally content with, but that is at a baseline comfortable and normal. I could stand to lose a touch of weight, to have a smaller nose, but at the core of my body, having breasts and other female sex characteristics is fine to me. I think that's what gender is, and I think that's why so many people just don't feel like anything at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's like breaking a bone, or having your appendix burst; just because you don't notice it until your leg snaps in two or you get that awful pain in your side, it doesn't mean that you lack bones or unnecessary organs. You just don't consciously notice it until something's wrong.",11Nov2018,1
158,"I've spoken to people about these things, but I feel as though I just want to get more out there, more things which I can't imagine ever telling anyone I know. I don't even know what I'm trying to say, this is probably just going to be a huge rant with no real purpose.

I'm 17 years old and I've only been in one romantic relationship which lasted for more than a day. The one girlfriend I have had is still one of my best friends to this day, but I'm afraid that I think about her too much. Every now and then I say something too open or complement her in a manner which she finds uncomfortable. I know she has issues with personal space but I go past that boundary far too often. I force myself into conversations she's having. I have no reason to do it, and it doesn't actually appear to annoy her very much, but I constantly feel terrible about the way I treat her, and I don't know why. She clearly enjoys being around me, and I enjoy being around her, but I can't stop thinking about her, and I can't stop thinking about the possible of her hating me for whatever reason. About a week ago she said I was one of her best friends in passing in a conversation, and it's something I constantly keep thinking about. I obsess over everything I do with her, and I genuinely feel awful about it. I don't even know why, I can't say I've done anything extremely wrong. I just feel like I have constantly whenever I think about her and I just feel selfish.

Similarly, there's another girl I'm close to. She's really bouncy and fun and exciting, and I know for a fact that she would want to be in a relationship with me. Only problem is, I'm not sure I'd be willing to go out with her. Whenever she's gone out with another guy and they've broken up, she's utterly despised them afterwards, even if they aren't terrible people or they broke up with her in a rational way. I would go out with her, but I'm obsessed with the possibility that she might hate me. I couldn't imagine her hating me, but I know for a fact she would if we went out. I don't want to make it sound like I'm some creepy guy who's only interested in sex but I can't stop thinking about asking if she's down for us to start fucking, casually. I'm too afraid to ask but I know she'd be up for it, I'm just afraid to bring it up. Recently I've been thinking about that possibility far too much. I'm really afraid that I'm starting to think about her too often, and I seriously think I might be overestimating my position in her life, and I just feel selfish.

I also realised I was bisexual this summer. I have genuine romantic feelings for one of my closest friends but I know for a fact he wouldn't be interested in me because he simply isn't attracted to men. He doesn't know, but I keep thinking about him too, and it makes me feel awful because I obsess over him in the same way I do so many others, and I just feel selfish.

A couple of months ago I went to a concert and met this amazing girl. We clicked instantly, and had amazing chemistry. Even though I only knew her for two or three hours, it was as if we had spoken for years. We went pretty quickly, and we made out at the concert. She asked if I wanted to go back to hers and I said yes. Only problem was that she was 22, and it was obvious that she was uncomfortable about the age gap. She left before I could go with her or before I could get her contact details. We worked so well together but that age gap just put a barrier between us. I haven't seen her since, but I really can't get her out of my head. I'm probably obsessed with this person the most, just because I don't understand how we worked so well, and because it doesn't seem right. I only knew her for one night, but I've never felt closer to someone. I just can't seem to move past it. Sometimes I think she just saw me as a one night stand, but I really like to think she wanted more than that, but then I just feel selfish.

Overall I'm not sure what to do about it. Everyday I just hope that I can meet the right person and just get out of this slump but at the moment I'm really stuck. I've felt like this for months.",11Nov2018,1
159,"In my early 20s I had very bad acne. I was looking at old photos and I realize just how bad it was. I would get into fights with my family about washing my face and putting cream on. When you don't care about living personal hygiene takes a back seat. I don't blame them for my acne but I also don't think it was all my fault. I mentioned to my brother about looking at old photos and seeing how bad my acne was. The first thing he says is ""I remember fight with you to wash your face."" I was hurt that I was immediately to blame for all of it.  There were so many  extenuating circumstances. Am I just being too sensitive or is he in the wrong with he response. ",11Nov2018,1
160,"Don't know where to start really, I just think I should talk with people who could relate. 
Im not that great at social interactions and that makes me not like my personality, I often feel a lack of energy or laziness which doesn't help. The type that friends won't initiate convos with unless I start them, run out of things to say and that's it.
Yet, reflecting on my views, I see small talk and random comments unnecessary and useless, thus think before speaking and won't speak if I don't see my comment would be important or make a difference. And so when I observe convos taking place I would ask myself what the purpose of a certain comment they said was and why won't they think before speaking if they're going to say something that wouldn't have made a difference, had they not have said it.
And I feel I should repeat these two point: I feel lazy very often, and I think before speaking (and as the German saying says, Reden ist Silber, schweigen ist Gold &gt;&gt;speaking is silver, silence is gold, and I agree with that saying).",11Nov2018,1
163,"I think there's different types of romantic love that occurs over time. For a very long time and from the start, my bf and I were both infatuated and in love (I believe both can occur together). Slowly (it took over a year) the infatuation faded a bit. What had taken over was a more stable and comforting type of love, in a deep bond type of way. Just now I realized I've felt that infatuation feeling again though, and it's just amazing. It's like I'm falling in love all over.. and it's really fun. This was just a rant, and I wonder if others can relate or share their experience",11Nov2018,1
164,This just seems like lazy moderation. Literally you'll read a big long post on something and have a legitimate comment. Then you go to comment and bam it's locked.

165,"I thought maybe it was a fluke at first, when I changed over to the Reddit redesigned mode. When I did, I ended up subscribed to a ton of different cryptocurrency subreddits -- which I've never visited and have no interest in. I had to go manually unsubscribe from each of them. But today, I found that I've been subscribed to more subreddits I've never visited, and apparently I even upvoted some topics. I unsubscribed AGAIN and changed my password. Again, it was a cryptocurrency subreddit (and also a programming language subreddit). Just really strange. Anyone else experiencing this?",11Nov2018,1

167,"Good day. I'm here just to vent off my feelings about my late father. 

This is a subject that may be somewhat devided on where people stand on the matter. But nonetheless, here it goes.

My father was born in 1943, I forget the month. I've been told about the ins and outs about his upbringing, but I don't really retain that sort of information very well. Because of this, I'm going to forward about 55 years. Around the year 1998 (I believe) my mum and dad got married. My mum had two other children with a previous husband. In 2001 I was born. I was one of four: myself, my mother's other two children, and my dad's daughter, who was a fully grown woman with a family of her own by this time. 

The following year, my dad was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. This was in 2002. He ended his days on the 9th of January 2003. Before I was 2 years old. Needless to say that I don't remember him. Because of his death, I always felt that right from an early age, I had an above average understanding of what it meant to die. 

Everyone who had dealings with my father in the last 5 years of his life, said he was a very respectable man, always ready to help. In the last 5 years that he lived, his daughter said that he was a changed man, after the multiple other marriages and years of service in the armed forces he'd been through. I soaked up this information like a sponge. Until things started coming to light. 

In 2013, my mother had been researching my family tree. Boy did she let the cat out of the bag. Turns out, that I wasn't one of four, I was one of seven. He had other marriages that weren't spoken of. A whole different life that he never told us about. He had kept so many secrets.

My three siblings that we had found out about, didn't even know that I existed. Here's the clincher: after 10 years, they didn't know he had died. He hadn't told them that he was going to die. For 10 years they believed that he was alive, when he was 6 feet under. Apparently he had kept big secrets from everyone in his life. 

Everything we knew about him was put under question. After a short time, and after getting in contact with the ""other family"", things settled down, and it became sort of a running family joke. I used to buy into it. Now though, it's a different story. 

Now I've started having my own thoughts and opinions on him. I used to think that he was an honest man. I used to think that he had really changed. Now though, those thoughts have long since gone. I've talked this out before with my mum, and we've reached two very different conclusions. Even after knowing everything I've said here, everyone still says that he was a good and honest man, and that he had changed since he met my mum.

It seems like I'm the only one that has a free thought about him. Everyone puts him on this pedestal in their mind. Seems like I'm the only one who doesn't. Before I say what I'm about to say, let me make it clear, that I know he loved me, that much I do believe. Also, I know the dead can't defend themselves, but that doesn't stop me from having an opinion. 

You want to know what I think? I don't think he was a changed man at all. He was no better than he used to be. He didn't even tell his children that he was dying damn it. THEY had to find out after 10 years. My dads previously mentioned daughter, knew about both sides of the family, and yet she never told either one about the other. 

He hadn't changed one bit. He was still a liar. He lied about his past to keep people from finding out the truth, which wasn't even so bad! He kept the truth from his family, his friends, and the woman he married. He deceived everyone. I feel nothing towards that man, regardless of the fact that he brought me into the world. 

I feel no love for him. I feel no sympathy. I feel nothing. I don't even like calling him my dad. I refer to him by his first name usually. I don't like admitting that such a man is my father. I don't understand how everyone seems so blindsided to the facts of who he was. 

I have some of his personal effects, like some cufflinks engraved with his initials, an old pocket watch of his, and two Franklin Min collectors knives. I'm genuinely thinking of giving them to one of my siblings. I don't have any sentimentality attached to them. I haven't even worn the cufflinks. Every time I wear a cufflink shirt I wear every other pair but those.

I feel like, If I talk to someone who knew him, and tell them how I feel, that they'll just brush it of. That's how I feel my mum reacted when I told her. Granted it was at a time when my feelings weren't as concrete or dividing. Even after learning everything about him, she still holds to her beliefs that he was a good man and that it's no big deal. It feels like I'm the only one that has something different to say, and yet if I tell them, they'll get angry because I don't see him as they do. 

I don't know the man who was my dad. I don't think anyone else truly did either. No one did. To be honest, I'm almost glad I don't know him. I don't have people in my life like that, so just because he was my father doesn't mean I should just accept him for who he was. I don't have any feelings for him.

I know that he'd be heartbroken to read this, but these are my unadulterated feelings. He doesn't mean anything to me. I don't want to know him. I've gone through nigh on my whole life without him. It won't hurt. 

People say that I look like him. People say that he'd be proud of me. People say that I remind them of him. But I don't want to be like him. I'm not going to be anything like the man he was. That's for sure.

Well, thank you for reading this rant of mine. I haven't really expressed my feelings about him before, but here it is. Thanks again for reading, and have a good day. ",11Nov2018,1
