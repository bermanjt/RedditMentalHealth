3,"Man, such a long post maybe.....


So, anyways ... I decided a long time ago to stop taking my medication for BP1 ""disorder"" (manic episodes) close to a year ago. I wanted change in my life. I was taking them for close to 8 years consistently.

When I get off my meds I am so excited, and have so many creative ideas. I can go on for hours on inventions/new tasks to do...being creative. Etc, and I think it's great. Sometimes...I sleep for 2 hours and feel energized the next day.

But, this time was different when I had a manic episode. I controlled everything internally (I have worked for the Japanese for over 10 years) and can keep all my emotions bottled up until I am alone. I have never threatened anyone, and I really never was a mean person (except when I was really young).

Anyways, I reached a crossroad a few months ago and I just want to create more and do things but everyone around me tells me to settle down and enjoy life.

Like, there is so much improvement to be made, I believe.

I can look at a product and think of a million different ways to make it better. Everyone says, ""why can't you just accept things for what they are?""


I really don't know. I just want to see the next, next, next. .etc. learn how it's made. Take it apart.


All my family always wants to send me to the hospital because I don't sound normal in their eyes. They like to watch TV and and do the daily thing. Never go out, etc.


I don't have any garage to work in anymore. I have a small house with my 2.5 family and I just don't know what to do. 


Why nobody likes me for me? I don't know.


Then, my dad's business has failed. He closed shop. Tells me to learn Japanese and kind of abandon my culture. That ki d of hurts ... 


It makes me so sad inside to see his dream get crushed all so familiar like (it's the 3rd one I've witnessed). 


That's hard! 


I guess I just want to rant. 


I wish I had a space to make something. Weld, or maybe even grow a garden. I just like doing stuff. I can basically do anything I put my mind to.

&amp;#x200B;

So in August I got very drunk after a night at the bars and blacked out and woke up with a jagged cut on my dick, right under the tip, kind of on the left side, (my left). I have no idea what happened, nor do my friends, I guess the two of us who were blacked promised the designated less drunk friend we were walking home and then went and did more shit for like an hour. I think maybe I put it through something with a sharp edge, like a window with a hole in it, or maybe I had it out and fell on it or against a wall or something, I dont fucking know but kms embarrassing and stupid and shiiittttyyyy, felt like such a jackass because I missed two days of work because of it, so fucking dumb. I got stitches on the underside of the tip of my penis. ugh, I hate typing that, I hate that that happened, the doctor has absolutely zero respect for you when you tell them this, because you DESERVE NONE. BUT I DIGRESS.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am currently under strict orders from the urologist not to engage in sexual activity with myself or others for 5 weeks. My first thought was *PPPSSSHHHH try no sexual contact for 6 months honey, you dont know who you're talking to, I DONT get laid*. The thought of the challenge not to masturbate didnt even really concern me, because I have never been all that frequent of a masturbateur, like once a day for some short periods in high school, but now that I am older like once a week, so I figured nbd. 

&amp;#x200B;

OH MY GOD do I want to orgasm!!! 

&amp;#x200B;

I have never experienced this before in my life, but I swear to god I have forgotten what my fully flaccid penis looks like. I know what people mean now when they say ""thinking with his dick"". I cannot go about my normal activities. My hormones are so fucked up I fall in love with any woman that comes within a 5 foot radius of me. I will be on the bus thinking ""I wonder if she would be down to take a pottery class together for our 10th anniversary..."". I opened pornhub the other night and just looked at the home screen for like 6 seconds and then just closed it. This is insanity.

As soon as I can masturbate without my frenulum splitting open nobody will see me for like 2 days straight.

6,"Perfect grades, juggling part time jobs, hanging out with friends across the world, getting accepted into a top tier company... I can't believe how accomplished my classmate's life is. The thing is, I know it's after tons of hard work and discipline (not to mention talent), so it's well deserved.

But it paralyzes me with anxiety. I know, in the rational part of my brain, that comparing yourself to others is a huge trap. Don't do it. Achievements and happiness are relative to *you*. But it still stresses me out.

And, to my dismay, I feel this frightening urge to channel all of this insecurity into putting others down, to make others feel bad so I can feel better about myself, because it's so, so stressful and I want it to go away. I've always been the type who finds it hard to be happy for others, as I myself have zero work ethic, no discipline to change.

8,"after going through several systems and what on, I have discovered that 4/4 is most suited to me.

however most sites use 5 or 10. So, I have found a way to use 4/4 system in the 5rating system. Since i would only use the first 4 number of the 5 rating system, i will use number five for favorites.

my system is basically this:
5 = favorite (given for few)
4 = worth watching
3 = ok
2 = not good
1 = shit

side note: i rate movies and shows based on how i feel and care about the given story. I dont care much about hype or ratings or hive mind.

13,"My mom has had a rough time for a long time now. She lives on very little money, and now her home is going to end up at tax sale.

&amp;#x200B;

She's been disabled since i was 12 - she worked her whole life in factories, then for 17 years as a waitress. Her shoulder and back got so bad in 2005 that she had to stop working and go on disability. Times were rough throughout high school - i got reduced lunches, we got food stamps for awhile, and my dad's child support (and other assistance he gave) helped too. My grandfather was a help too during high school, and when our home went up for tax sale in 2011 he bought it back, but he passed away in October of that year. And as I got older, things sort of dried up. We went to food banks, didn't have cable or internet, the electricity got turned off at least once a year.  That's how it is now for her.  Because we lived in our house for four years while they should've foreclosed on it, they take $400 out of her social security a month. She lives on about $800/month right now.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad isn't well financially either - he has diabetes, and pays around $3-500 a month for his medications. As he lives on a fixed income, he wasn't able to pay his property taxes last year, so I took out a loan for him, which he pays.  Now, i'm in the same situation with my mom. If we can't come up with $1800 before September 20th, i'll put the rest on my credit card. I can't let her become homeless, but I've already got debts of my own.  I just feel like I can't get a break - this is after two emergency veterinary visits that cost over $600 together, and I lost my job in March. I'm working part-time, but I've had to go into debt to pay for things (thank God I was able to live with my dad until i moved in with my boyfriend). I'm scared my credit card won't even let me buy a prepaid visa with that big of a balance (has to be cash, check or money order).

&amp;#x200B;

I am the parent to my parents. I have no one to lean on other than my boyfriend, who said he'd give me $500, but that leaves $1300 minus anything mom can contribute. She says she'll be able to pay me back

But I must say... especially graduating from a prep school, I just feel like there is so much pressure for me to ""go"" somewhere. It's like everyone has to go by the standard plan which is going off to college somewhere right after high school. Sometimes I feel really alone in my decision, even though I feel like it's right for me. Did anyone else not go off to college? Does anyone else feel this pressure? Am I the only one that feels like everyone is doing this same thing but you? I just wish people could see that life is good without absolutely going off to college for 4 or more years of my life somewhere else in the world. I'm not missing out on anything...

15,"I love my family and my best friend. I love my cat and my dog. I love myself, even if I fuck up.

How do you love someone else besides family? 

Looks are obviously important to an extent, but I can’t seem to ever want other people to be more than “just a picture” to me—if that makes sense. 

I know you are attractive. I know you are good looking. 

But I do not care. 

I know you are easy to talk to. I know that you are kind. 

But I can’t seem to want more. I can’t find myself wanting to start something, unless I want something just from you specifically.

I think that “specifically” is what makes you finally understand that what you are feeling, is love... right? 

Maybe I haven’t encountered you, specifically. 

I’m still young, and I have a lot more to experience and people to meet. In a way, I guess I don’t want to deal with tending to a relationship so intimately just yet.

But I want to love. 

Am I only in love with the idea of love itself, rather than you, specifically? 

I want to learn this feeling. If it’s something you can even learn. 

If anything, the thing I want most, is someone I can be anyone to. Because all of me is me, and their’s, too. ",08Sep2018,5
16,"I am curious to here what you guys think. Am I actually causing what is happening to me? If so, how do I stop?

TL:DR; I have a lot of medical/personal issues that are getting worse because of what I unintentionally do to cause what is wrong with me.

So I have been having a lot of problems around my life.

Medical: My eardrum has been ruptured. One night after a shower, I put on my new sound cancelling headphones and played music at a really high level. It is no doubt I shouldn't be listening to music at a high level, but the water is probably what pulled the trigger on my eardrum. Except, that night was 9 months ago. I delayed seeing a specialist because I was in school. I didn't want my disabled mother to come get me when I was at college 4 1/2 hours away to take me to a ear doctor and then drive me back soon. So I pushed it off. Over the summer a specialist checks it, gives me ear drops and now my ear is hurting worse. I think it is because I am a night twitcher. I scratch and irritate my ear at night and can't stop.

In the morning, I sit straight out of my bed. That is what I think is causing my lower back pain. I jump up scared due to my alarm. It stays across the room so it's not that loud. Then I usually drag myself across the room within a minute of dealing with migraines that I get when I wake up. This is(according to the internet) caused by not drinking enough water and staying awake at night.


I don't really feel like I have friends, but I do nothing to make them. I basically go to class, stay in my dorm, walk by everyone on the sidewalk. I can't make friends because I am to paranoid and just quite-frankly suck at reading the air. People tell me this is because I don't make friends, if I do then I will. It's kind of the system, you need money to make money. Does this mean if I have no money, then I can't make it?(money is a metaphor for friend) I need to make friends by waking up at 6AM, and then go to sleep like everyone else at midnight. I need to get at least 12 hours of sleep to function. If I dont then I wont be able to perform well on my tests and assignments and then also pay attention in class. If I stay up until midnight, then I accidently sleep until 3pm. I basically have no idea to fix the endless circle. 

How the hell do I stop doing the things that are causing me to suffer? It's not like I am doing it on purpose. It's subconscious/unintentional and I can't stop it. ",08Sep2018,1

36,"So I have a cousin who’s throwing a party for her upcoming 21st. Shes a year older than me. She’s a very outgoing person, has a lot of friends and has invited a bunch of them to her party (like around 50?). One of the people being me. And I’m not sure whether I should go, cause I have major social anxiety. 

Besides my brothers, I’m not close with anyone there. I’ve only been to like two house parties in my life and I felt uncomfortable and antisocial in both. So I’ve never gotten drunk, hooked up, etc. And I don’t trust my brothers to take care of me because they’re very outgoing people so they always try to push me to be the same without trying to understand my social anxiety. 

Anyway, normally I don’t mind getting to know new people, but I’ve went to the same school with my cousin and most of her friends that are going to her party, and they know me as my cousin’s shy boring cousin who doesn’t talk much and annoyingly follows her around all the time (when I was at school, I followed my cousin around a lot because I didn’t really have any friends and hadn’t developed my own sense of independence). Some of them even picked on me for it. I mean I haven’t seen any of them since graduation a few years ago but when I do I still can’t shake off the sense that that’s how they see me? Also it doesn’t help that I don’t really have common interest with people my age (I don’t go to college/uni, I don’t have a job because I live with my parents and resell stuff on the side to make money. I hate having to tell people this because when I do I always get an uncomfortable reaction), so I don’t have anything in common to talk to them about. 

Overall I just really don’t know what I should do. I want to go and support my cousin but at the same time I don’t know if I can even handle being in a social environment like that. Any advice? ",08Sep2018,1
37,"I tried posting this to r/TIFU but apparently it breaks their rules so I thought maybe some of you guys might get a good laugh out of my stupidity. Enjoy :)))

Our primary school teacher used to organise these sorts of ""summer camps"" every year, which were essentially just glorified 2-3 day stays in a different city. The 10 year old to adult ratio was around 12:1, so as you can imagine something stupid was bound to happen at some point. This particular fuck up happened in the summer break between 3rd and 4th grade.

2009's trip took place near a mountain resort kind of city in central Romania (can't quite remember which one tbh). We were staying at a 3-star guest house just outside of town. Our daily activities involved playing camp games with the teachers and visiting landmarks, which still left plenty of time in the day for us to do pretty much whatever we wanted.

At some point while visiting some random castle or similar thing we stumbled upon a souvenir shop which, besides the usual fridge magnets and cheap knock-off toys, also sold a large variety of airsoft guns, ranging from basic pistols to shotguns or even AK-47s. We were technically not allowed to buy any of them, since our teacher said they were ""dangerous"" and you could ""shoot your eyes out"" with them. Of course that didn't stop most of us (the boys at least, the girls knew better) from purchasing at least one toy gun, some even more. As I wasn't given that much money for the trip and wasn't a big fan of firearms anyways, all I purchased was a pistol and one of those grenade shaped containers with a lot of pellets inside.

As anyone would expect, once we got back to the guest house and the teachers went away, we immediately started shooting each other, pretending we were soldiers, fighting wars and other stuff 10-year olds who have access to toy guns do. It was harmless fun really, and as I recall nobody actually got hurt. Well, with one exception...

You see, I was fascinated with how the guns actually propelled the pellets, and would often fire my gun without ammunition just to hear the sound and see the ""air that came out"" (dumb 10-year old me thought that was how they worked, now I know they were spring loaded). During my countless experiments I would often shoot myself in the eyes, ears or mouth (without pellets of course) to feel the effects of the ""air"". Unsurprisingly, no air came out since that was not how it worked, but I was very disappointed. I came to the conclusion that my particular gun was not ""powerful enough"".

As I was thinking this I stumbled upon another kid's gun on a table. The owner was probably playing somewhere else, so I picked it up and started to examine it. It was a shotgun (only looked like one, still shot a single pellet like all the other guns), and was considerably bigger than my tiny pistol. *Naturally*, the right course of action was to shoot myself with it in order to see whether it shot more ""air"" than mine. After around 10 seconds of thinking whether to start with the ears, eyes or mouth, I decided to go with the last one. 

And here I go, putting the barrel right in my mouth, closing my eyes, and pulling the trigger. To my surprise, ""air"" wasn't the only thing to come out. I'd forgotten to check whether the gun had any bullets left in it...

Shock, immediately followed by intense pain. I had shot a pellet into the roof of my mouth from 5cm away, and it was bleeding. I started crying and heading for the bathroom in a hurry to pour cold water over it (what else could I have done, really?) only to be baffled by the logistics of actually pouring water from a very small tap onto the top of my mouth. 

After around two minutes of trying with no real success I went out of the bathroom, still crying, and had to explain to my teacher how I'd shot myself in the mouth with a gun that we weren't even supposed to own. I also ended up calling my mother, but I don't think she really understood anything that I was saying, since I was crying and also couldn't talk properly because my mouth hurt

To this day I still have a scar 1mm in diameter on the left size of my palate, and I can feel it very easily with the tip of my tongue. However, I dare not imagine what would've happened if I didn't start with the mouth. The ear would've probably been ok, but just the thought of how close I was to shooting a pellet **directly into my eye** still makes me phisically shudder to this day. With that in mind, I'll gladly take my small scar on the roof of my mouth as a reminder of my stupidity. 

I like to think of that moment basically as a turning point in my life. I just can't imagine what would've happened had I shot myself in the eye right there, yet the odds of me doing that were basically 33%. I like to think there's another me on Reddit in a parallel universe writing the story of how he lost his sight in one eye because of his own stupidity at ten years old.

Don't shoot yourselves, people. And if you still really want to do it, please check that the gun is empty before doing so.

TL;DR Was is a summer camp when I shot myself in the mouth out of curiosity with someone else's airsoft shotgun without checking if it was loaded. Before doing so I pondered whether I should try an ear or an eye instead.",08Sep2018,3

45,"And it was 10/10. It kind of remind me Marvel movies but differently this movie’s scenario was a bit complicated. If you’re a computer sciences student or any tech related someone, I highly prefer you to watch it! I said “Holy shit! Another hacker sorta tech movie” when I saw sudo command on the screen :D It’s a must watch movie if you would want to ask my opinion! 

Film is revolving around Grey (the main character), his wife is dying due to her car’s command error(out of control). Then Grey got paralyzed. He went to Eron(his close friend)’s place. He introduces him Stem (a microchip). They implement it to Grey, then he starts to gain his functionality. But then turns out Stem played the innocent and wanted to take over someone pure’s body. So it was Grey in that case. Eron sends Fisk(another microchipped person) to kill Grey but Grey kills him by himself. (Grey figures it out by listening to call logs of Fisk’s). Then he goes to Eron’s place in the end, finds him and Eron tells that he(Eron) was working for Stem. Grey first stabs his hand cause Stem controls his hands but it never works. Then as he stands up from floor, it(Stem) kills Eron and after that creates an illusion and sends Grey to that illusion and kills Detective(Detective was who was investigating the case).

everyone my age is corrupted and cynical because of over-exposure to internet. my peers are wary of each other, especially due to fears of school shooters and overexposure to ideas such as alt-right/incel/SJW etc, which makes it harder to meet new ppl. kids my age use stupid memes like ""lit"" and ""mood"" and ""dat boi"". they take everything too seriously, you can't joke around and be silly anymore. anti-intellectualism: while the video game/anime/DnD nerd culture has exploded, it's more uncool than ever to actually like calculus/chemistry/history instead of disregarding it as ""s**t we won't use in real life"" and trashing the education system. Incel ideology is spreading among young troubled males. Everything that's slightly awkward is ""cringy"". Even hating your generation is cringy. Everyone is always on their damn phones. What are they even doing on their phones, I don't know. Most kids my age don't know how to make scrambled eggs, let alone cook anything from a recipe. Girls are very narcissistic with inflated egos because of sites like instagram where they get heavy praise for every selfie, while boys are less likely to get the same praise, leading to a funny social imbalance between the sexes where girls are much more confident while boys have lots of personal and mental health issues

i bet things will be better in the 2050s, i will be a 50 year old man looking back on the 2010s like ""man that decade sucked"" kinda like how old ppl now look back at the problems of the 1960s

Reasons I hate myself:

* I'm so much of an introvert I can't stand to go out long enough to develop decent social skills
* So instead I stay at home and do autistic man-child bs like write fan-fiction and read manga
* When I do go out, I take walks by myself and engage in more autistic man-child behavior like listening to rave music
* I come up with story ideas in my head as I take my walks like some two cent Tolkien wannabe.
* Instead of being invited places and hanging out with friends like a normal person, I stay at home and read about weird things like science and history.
* I'm just another embodiment of a socially awkward nerd stereotype, if it wasn't already obvious
* No girl under 300 lbs has any desire to touch me
* So I stay at home and masturbate because it's the only sense of reward I can ever get
* I can't even find reward in the skills I've developed, because once again, all my skills are just autistic man-child bs
* I've been hyper-sensitive to any external stimulus for as long as I can remember
* This is basically just another way of saying I've always been a soft little worm
* This later developed into a massive anxiety problem later in life
* It took so much out of me over the years that I haven't been able to feel much of anything for like 15 years
* I was never strong enough to overcome any of it
* I don't even think I could ever really feel any sense of attachment again if I tried
* So I don't think I could ever really love another person anymore
* And no one could ever really love me
* Because I was so weak and fragile that I couldn't stop myself from killing my own soul
* That sounded cringey and pretentious like pretty much everything else I say
* I've tried and tried to get better, but all I seem to know how to do is come up short
* So how I deal with my issues is telling strangers on Reddit how I basically never grew up past high school
* In order to fix all of this I'd have to give up everything I love, but then I'd just be empty
* All of this is my fault, because I choose to stay attached to what I love
* Because the only things I love are keeping me trapped in childhood
* I've never found anything outside of the things I love that could ever replace them
* And that makes me nothing but a loser",08Sep2018,2

55,"I’ve had cats my whole life. I’m a self proclaimed “cat person” and have always kept them as pets, each until they either went missing or passed away at home. I haven’t ever surrendered a cat to a shelter, but I’m at my wits end. 

I have two cats right now. One of them I adopted several years ago that is an absolute sweetheart, and the other is a jerk that I got from a family member’s litter about 4 years ago. 

The jerk cat has had his shots, has been neutered, and has been in our home his entire life. Despite all that, he is impossible to deal with. Even after being ours for so long, he is still the most aggressive and destructive animal I have had. He literally still bites my SO and I if we get too close to him. He poops on the floor almost daily. 

My SO and I now have a child together, and this cat is becoming a bigger hassle than he is worth. My child obviously takes precedence over the cat. Now that she is mobile, I am not willing to put up with him clawing at her, or having her find his piles of poop before I do.

Before anyone accuses me of being a heartless animal hater- I’ve put up with this crap for almost 4 years. He was this way before the baby, and is the same now. He has always had a bad personality- but that never stopped us from taking good care of him. We even paid $1000 to keep this damn cat alive a couple of years ago when he got some mystery virus that two different vets couldn’t identify (they actually thought he had MRSA!). It was disgusting and difficult to deal with, but I have always been of the attitude that if you own an animal, it’s your duty to take care of it. 

Well, I can’t do it anymore. Not now that my baby is on the move and I don’t feel like I can take my eyes off of her if the cat is in the room. We are moving in November, and I’m not going to pay another pet deposit and deal with him pooping on the carpet and destroying the new place. 

I’ve tried to rehome him via social media, but of course anyone who knows me knows that he has been nothing but a pain in our ass for years. Every no-kill shelter has a wait list (which we have been added to). We have from now until mid-Nov to get rid of him and I hate how guilty I feel at the thought of him being euthanized (even though he has been nothing but trouble for 4 years). I’m a good pet owner but my daughter comes first. 

I HATE the self righteous attitude from shelters when you tell them you have a cat you can’t keep. I know they hear it all day long, but I’ve been a responsible pet owner my whole life. I have a cat now that is not a good fit for my family anymore, and my HUMAN CHILD is so much more important to me than this ass of a cat.

58,"Slightly long story but I'll try my best to condense it down. I just want to get this off my chest.

When I was 12 years old, I had a massive crush on someone in my school. Being the young kid that I was I decided to send them a love note on Facebook saying that I like them and things like that. Next thing I know, I get a call to the guidance counselor at school. Apparently her parents saw the note and called the fucking school resource officer on me, telling them I was ""stalking"" her. Since I was young and insecure, I completely believed that what I did was wrong. In my mind, I was told that showing someone you're attracted to them is wrong and creepy, and that's when I started to ruin my own life. After that, I spat on the idea of being in a relationship. I went out of my way to avoid the thought of it completely, even going as far as getting angry when people said someone ""liked"" me. I began to reject myself from even pursuing literally ANYONE because in my mind I was fucking creepy and harassing them. 

Fast forward a few years, and my mindset has not really changed. People all around me were talking about their crushes and ""dating"" (middle school dating) and I just sat there bitterly judging everyone else for doing what I wasn't ""allowed"" to do. One day, I got a text from a girl that I had a slight interest in, and she ended up asking me out. Within a week of texting and talking all day every day, I completely believed she was into me and my slight interest turned into something much more. However, one week in, I got a message saying that she only did it because someone fucking told her to as a joke. Are you FUCKING KIDDING ME? I had a toxic view on myself and dating in general already, and now apparently I'm a joke. We still talked after that and she became close friends with me, even though I was depressed as hell because of all the snowballing thoughts that I was worthless and creepy. To be honest, she became one of my best friends, in her mind too. It was like that up until the end of freshman year of high school, when during the peak of my depression, my ""friend"" cut me out of her life. 

Already depressed and bitter as it was, this was the icing on the god damned cake. I was destroyed on the inside, all I thought about was how disgusting I was and how no girl would ever want me. I went so far that it became a self fulfilling prophecy, where I completely ignored any girl in my life and in turn they ignored me. Noticing that no girl payed attention to me enforced my belief even more, despite me being the cause of it. 

This kept going on for year and years, with ""evidence"" that I was unattractive being reinforced every day.  One day I started to abuse the fuck out of benzodiazepines because I couldn't stand how horrible I felt because I was unlovable and a creepy freak. I ended up going to the hospital for an overdose, and ended up quitting and began to lift weights. I made a lot of progress very quickly, with people asking if I was on steroids and telling me I looked ""massive"". Even now I still don't feel I'm attractive, even though I objectively look like a Greek statue compared to most people in my life. 

I'm 19 years old now, and I know this is all completely irrational. I know my views are illogical, that they are a self fulfilling prophecy, but even then I can't get over it. If I see a girl I'm attracted to, even though I know that it isn't actually creepy to approach them, I still can't help but believe I'm not ""allowed"" to. It's completely unconscious at this point and I don't know what to do. I wish that I could approach that girl, but even know I find myself unable to even say hi. I'm so lost it's not even funny, at this point it feels like I'm going to be like this forever. My mind is my own worst enemy. 

Looking back and reading everything that happened to me in words, I can't help but think what happened was just some stupid incidents that didn't mean anything. I'm not actually creepy or unattractive, I never was. I made myself believe it. I made it my own sick reality and I can't escape even though I know it's irrational.

TLDR: I cannot bring myself to approach girls because of stupid incidents that happened as a teenager, leading me to live in my own twisted reality that no girl would ever love me and I'm an unattractive freak.",08Sep2018,1
