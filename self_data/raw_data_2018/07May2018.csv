2,"Just venting here. I’d like to start off by saying that I’m very grateful for college and the hard work my family put in to getting me to a school I love. 
This is why I can’t tell them this. I was a neuroscience major until I decided that spending 20+ hours in a lab each week wasn’t my thing. However, since this was during my sophomore year, I had a good number of psychology credits. I decided “okay, I’ll just major in psychology”. 
Then one day I was having a manic episode and I over-estimated how much I could handle, thinking that I was the shit and that I could do anything I set my mind to. So I said, “I should probably major in something else too because psychology might not be enough and I could probably do something else too”. I’m very into politics. So now I’m also a politics major. 
And the SAME DAY I decided that I was going to be a pre-law (or legal studies) minor because some of the politics credits overlap. 
This was the worst academic decision I’ve made in my entire life. I’m not as interested in psychology as I was previously. Now I’m drowning in work, I have no social life, and every time I engage in a leisure activity or take a break I feel horrible and that I’m a lazy failure. 
2018-2019 will be my last year. I’m very very close to both degrees, so I can’t back out now. I’m reaping the consequences of thinking that I have the superior ability to handle 2 majors and 1 minor without a problem. 
But no. I’ve had a history of mental health issues and I didn’t consider that when I felt sky high. 

I hate the way I’m living. I want to be singing and drawing and not having to study 10 hours a day. One major would’ve been good enough. I could have had a balanced life. But again, I felt like I could jump off a building and nothing would happen to me. 

It’s been a year and a half since this episode. Now I’m just depressed and I kind of want to die because I feel like an ungrateful child who didn’t deserve her parents’ support and financial aid. I don’t even know what I’m gonna do with this combination... a lawyer? Do I even want that? 

Sorry for the long post. It’s finals week and I hope I can make my mom and dad and grandpa and grandma proud by not giving up. I need someone to tell me that it’s all worth it, I don’t care if it’s a lie or not. ",07May2018,13
3,"And this makes me pathetic and pretty laughable, but the reason I can't is because it's Summer.

I have self-harmed before, many times. I used to cut off chunks off my arm with a pair of scissors, but since it's easy to gain attention when you have sleeveless clothes, I've been more conscious of it.

It's Summer, and it's going to be too hot, and I'll want to wear shorts, or cute dresses, or vests or lounge clothes.

I can't cover up all the cuts I want to make. It hurts less if I do it on my arm but I'm too scared to try on my torso.

I've been feeling incredibly useless and depressed lately. I'm 27 with no motivation and feeling like I can't do anything. I got a job offer for full-time work, but I have yet to send a message back to say I'm interested because I'm scared, I'm scared they'll see me and agree with my thoughts, and I'll feel ashamed even more. And everything cycles. 

I go to counselling for cognitive therapy, but I don't actually feel like it's doing anything for me.

I'm extremely tempted to purchase a flight somewhere random, like Russia for example, so I could just get lost and hopefully be killed. If I did that where I live they might set out alerts and it'd be easy to find me.

I'm stuck in a rut. I'm stuck wanting to die but being too cowardly of pain. I'm stuck wanting to do better in life but not even sure of what to do.",07May2018,2

6,"My roommates and I have been friends for two years, roommates for one. I have never felt especially close or similar to them, but they have always obsessed over our “amazing friend group.” I actually don’t really even like them, and don’t want to be associated with them anymore. They have really hurt my self esteem and happiness, simply because they do not realize they are selfish. So I’m trying to not hang out with them or talk to them anymore.

But my issue is that all our other mutual friends side with them since I am the individual that has stopped making an effort with them. So I’m losing many many mutual friends, basically all the friends I have here at college.

It’s just really hard because no one knows how terrible they are behind closed doors, how mean they have been to me, how uncaring they have been to each other.

8,"I got my cat when I was 8. She was put down when I was 20. 
Her name was Booties. She was very sassy, grumpy and demanding, but very sweet and loving at the same time. She was small, even as an adult, and very soft. She was black, with a white mustache and little white paws, and she was named after [a Beanie Baby that looked like her.](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/3UcAAOxy3JtRfiOv/s-l225.jpg)

Over the two years since her death, I occasionally have very vivid dreams of my cat being alive again. Always the dreams feature her resurrecting, or her never having died. Once I even heard her meow in crystal clearness/likeness. 

I had such a dream recently. In it, I dug my cat out of the pile of dirt that is her grave and I uncovered her alive and breathing. I said to my mom ""ha! I tricked you! I hid her before you could kill her!""
Whenever I wake up from the dreams she's in, my heart hurts all over again.

I honestly can't think about my cat for too long or I start crying. As I type this, tears have come to my eyes. I don't even like looking at cats, because they make me think of her and thus make me sad.

It's terrible to admit, but I cried more for my cat's passing than any human I've known, even my own grandmother.

The thing is, she wasn't put down due to old age or illness. She was put down simply because my parents were annoyed at her peeing in our new house.

-----

She was our sole pet for 10 years, but then we took in a young male cat whose elderly owner had died. Territorial Booties didn't like that at all. She never grew to like him. She'd hiss and growl whenever he came within 5 feet.
On top of that, we moved to a new house, leaving behind the one I was born in. She hated that too. For a while, we kept her all alone at our old house while we transitioned to our new one. It kills me whenever I think of that too. She was so lonely and sad, and she put on so much weight during that time. Eventually we did bring her to our new place, but it never became like home to her. To compensate for these life changes, she'd pee in the basement off and on to mark her territory and feel more secure.

Finally, my parents had enough. My mom said she was going to put Booties down, because there were no other options. No diapers, no putting her up for adoption. No keeping her outside in the garage. It would be too cruel after 12 years with our family. 

My cat was perfectly healthy. At 12 years old, she showed no illness or signs of age. So she died in vain. I think that's the part that kills me the most.
The day she was supposed to be put down, I stayed up with her all night even though I had work. 
The hour leading up to her appointment, I lifted her out of my dresser where she was sleeping on my clothes (one of her favorite spots), and I held her and cried. 

She always hated being held- couldn't stand it for more than 3 seconds. But by some miracle, she let me hold her, and she purred and slept. So trusting and loving. She'd never done it before. 
She depended on me heavily- stuck by my side and slept with in my bed or in my clothes. My room was a safe haven for her, because I never let our other cat in. But I let her be taken to her death without a fight, and I still feel so guilty about it.
 
My mom came down with a cat carrier, and Booties was literally ripped from my arms, stuffed in a cat carrier as she meowed and yowled, and driven off to her death.

I couldn't even be there for it. All while this happened, I had to go to work at my shitty pizza job, because the only coworker who could take my shift let me go to voicemail every time I called. 

Part of the pain is from the guilt. I should have done more to stop my parents from killing her. Whenever I think about it for too long, I feel viciously angry towards my mother. 
I think the other part is that Booties was there for a majority of my life. From my eighth birthday, when she arrived in a wicker basket as a fuzzy little kitten, to my second year of college. 

This still affects me. I was never able to make a headstone because it hurt too much. For a year, I avoided visiting my parents' home as much as possible, because I would always find myself visiting the grove where her grave mound is and ache and cry. I've been in therapy for depression, and one of the only times I ever cried was when I briefly talked about my cat. I haven't touched the drawer I took her out of the hour before her death. Haven't cleaned it, because her fur is still in there, and a whisker that must have fallen off. The week after she died, I'd just open that drawer and touch the place she had slept and the whisker and cry.

I'm embarrassed and ashamed that the loss of my childhood pet has affected me more than losing humans in my life. But to this day it still hurts when I think about. 

Just wanted to get this off my chest. I don't talk about it often.",07May2018,3
9,"My girlfriend and I have been off and on for many years, but have always kept in touch and the relationship has seemed good for the most part. We’ve had our ups and downs like all people whether it be due to physical distance, ""rumors"" of (her) infidelity, jealousy, etc. but now that we’re getting older we talk more about long term plans and our outlooks seem to include one another. At the moment we do not live together so much of our days are relayed via text or when we hangout which is frequently since we live close. 




Recently I’ve began noticing what seems like a distance in our relationship, and may be my own trust issues due to our past*, but I feel like there is something unspoken between us. 
*(though she denies it the story is she hooked up with one of my friends when we were younger and dating but not together)



A few times now when we have planned to hang out she has cancelled because she “has to go to work early” or had some misinterpretation of our plans. Her work is visible from a route I regularly take home so I pass by it all the time. A couple weeks ago I was told she had to go in early but on my way home I noticed her car was not in the parking lot. This concerned me, but I let it go because she can be slow and it was only about 30 minutes after she said she was to be there. This is not a job she is worried about losing so it seemed plausible. 



Fast forward a week or two and I was told again that she would not be able to hang out because she had work that night and was too lazy or tired to do so before going in. She promised we would hang out the next day before work. The following morning we talk and she tells me that she may have to go in a few hours early. She complains about how it is unfair, how she feels bad for me, and says she will come over that night which she does. With my day now wiped I go run errands which take me past her work. Once again the car is not in the parking lot. I drive by again on my way home and her car is there now, at the time which she normally works. That night when she comes over I ask about her day, she laments her job and says she’s happy to see me. I ask what time she ended up having to go in and she tells me a time an hour before I had initially driven by and she was not there. Something is up.



I have seen texts on her phone from other guys but I haven’t gone through her messages or anything like that. In the past she has left social media open on my devices and I have seen things that contradict her stories, but this was years ago. 



She was showing me something on her phone the other day and I noticed the name of one of her coworkers in her texts. I have met many of her coworkers but this guy is one of the ones I have not. 



I’m concerned that something is going on, not necessarily with this guy, but that I am being kept in the dark. I have thought of addressing the situation with her but I don’t want to come off as insecure by asking if everything is ok or lead with accusations because at the moment I have no evidence other than that she’s lied about being somewhere a couple times. I love this woman but I am not afraid to move on if I am being wronged. 


tldr: Think something is up with girlfriend, she appears to be lying and cancelling plans, what do?

10,"I'm feeling anxious, even though things are technically going well for me at the moment. Two years ago I started my own business which got me into alot of debt. I was also dating a girl at the time who drained me and added to my stress. Last year everything came to a head when my debt load became overwhelming, my business was failing, my girlfriend dumped me, one of my best friends overdosed, and I was at my limit. 

Fast forward to today, I am dating a new girl who is wonderful, and I am able to pay down my debt working a decently well paying job in a field I enjoy. The only problem is that I dread going to work everyday, I feel super anxious thinking about getting up in the morning and driving to my office. I feel trapped and I just count down the minutes. Even in my free time I feel so drained and anxious I have a hard time focusing on my hobbies so I just play video games to distract me. 

I hope I will have the strength to make a life change that will help me feel free again, like the days back in college. ",07May2018,2
11,"You know when adults always drone on about how you should be kind because it always pays back in the end? I dunno if that’s true for everyone, but in elementary school they really drilled the idea of kindness into our heads.

So there’s this one kid I know and he’s having a hard time with a girl he likes. He told me a lot of people ignored it when he told them about it and he felt like he had no one to talk to, so I decided to make him feel better. He’s done so much for me, and it was the least I could do. 

So I listened to him and what was going on, and I gave him some advice that went along the lines of “just remember that you are important and you matter.” And “everything has a purpose. If ___ isn’t in your life for lover purposes, then maybe she’s in there to teach you a positive lesson about life.” (I said a lot more than that, that’s just the sum of it.)

He felt a lot better after that, repeatedly said thank you and he was so happy! I was so proud of myself for making him feel better, and I was so glad I could make someone so joyous in such a dark time. So not only did I make my friends day by listening to him and taking him seriously, I also made my own day by making someone in my life feel better. 

Now, I’m a simple person. A lot of people aren’t like me in this respect, and that okay. But in my case just hearing the words ‘thank you’ is enough. It makes me smile when people are grateful of something I did, and I don’t need anything more than that.

But, even if his genuine gratefulness was enough of a thank you for me, my friend thought I deserved more. I told him he didn’t have to, but he insisted on it. After a small bit of back and forth I finally gave in to the idea of him getting me a gift. He told me that he’d get me art supplies because he knows I like art, and he needed to know what I’d want. 

I reluctantly told him I needed a sketchbook, but I reassured him it didn’t need to be fancy/expensive or anything. He agreed, asked me a few more questions about it and now I’m here on this app I just got, squealing from excitement because not only did I make someone’s day, but I’m also getting an item I really desired! 

So maybe the staff was right all those years ago. Kindness does come back in the end. When you do something kind for a person, it always comes back to you. Sometimes it’s tough to realize that, and I sure as hell was very distasteful towards that idea for awhile but now that fantasy the teachers told us about is here! So that’s how my day went. Simple, sure, but exciting nonetheless.",07May2018,1

Who should be responsible for payment? I know we should normally split it but my other friend kept mentioning that he wasn’t a very cautious driver so he should claim all responsibility. I feel bad because I asked him to come along but at the same time the damage fee could amount to almost $2,000 and I don’t feel like I deserve to pay/split that much because I wasn’t at fault.

21,"Hi Redditors,

Throwaway account because friend would feel bad that I posted this here. I need some advice about a friend's situation \- let's call her ""Laura"". Laura lives in Europe. Now Laura had a terrible childhood growing up, where her parents abused each other, fought and finally divorced. And as with most incompetent parents out there \- they made her the victim by abusing her, distinctively, depending upon which parent she was with, to cope up with their own life. To leave out the details she was a bright student but often abused causing her to have behavioral and psychiatric  problems which she would go on to cope for the rest of her adult life including depression, suicidal thoughts and anxiety.

Cut to today, she's practically an orphan at 25 \(mother got Cancer, father got a Porsche and abandoned the family altogether\). She was always a brilliant student so she decided to finish her studies \(high school\) and took \~ 6000 EUR credit. However, before she could finish it, a random mugging \(with physical altercation\) in the streets triggered some past traumas and she had to go back into therapy before she could finish her final exams.

Incidentally, she couldn't finish the studies and moreover acquired an additional debt of EUR 6000 to pay. She thought about escorting but broke down last week knowing that's the only way to fund her education and repay the debt. She can't get a normal job cause she hasn't completed education yet, and to complete education she needs money but credit isn't an option cause she already had a defaulting credit \(which she was supposed to pay back after the 1st year at work\). She's already re\-applying for waiting tables \- which she did earlier to survive \(sometimes in 3 restaurants in a day\) \- however that will take her ages to even complete her studies and it makes her depressed.

I'm out of ideas and in need of some serious advice on how to help a friend get her education, so she can get a normal job and maybe have a shot at leading a normal life. Is there anyone who's got some ideas how I can help a friend in need?

Why post as anonymous a thing yet? There are so many throwaway accounts. Then reddit has to clean those accounts. 

I am sure lets say, I buy reddit gold and can post something without revealing my username.

The way it would work is. You create a post. You see an option ""post  as anonymous"" , now once your post is created a unique username **anonymous\_1234** is used instead of your current username and these usernames are non clickable.    

Even when you reply to any comments of that very thread, you would reply as  anonymous\_1234. 

For every new post a new username is used. 

A user can choose to get notifications i.e the read mail icon for such threads.

Q Why have this ?

1. Despite using reddit for so many years creating and maintaining throwaway/alt accounts is an hassle
2. Because people want privacy
3. Reddit system forces its anti spam system on throwaways which is needed but can be avoided.

Why should this be a reddit gold feature?

1. Gives someone a legit reason to buy reddit gold  for themselves
2. If this was open to all, it can be abusive.

The light the once shined through your face has been replaced by a drained and muted color. I finally see the pain in your face that caused you to leave. I finally see the pain in your heart that made you choose your first true love over me. Your needle can't hold you the way I did for years. Your pills won't listen to you wail through the night the next time someone close to you dies. Your drugs won't fix you, neither could I. But in reality, I didn't want to. I wanted you to fix you, because within you I saw a heart full of fire and passion and I knew you could get past the pain. I always suspected you'd choose the easy way, as you did with all things. Medicating your life away, ignoring it, hiding behind a facade so that no one needed to worry about the strong woman you'd been becoming. But you threw it all away because of your fear.

It's now a year later. I still sometimes pause where I am when I hear your name or see your face through various friends on facebook.

The sad part is that for 40+ years now Han Solo has been the guy who, before he shot greedo, we knew extremely little about, and that added a ton of flavor to the character. He was the cool-hand-luke style space pirate smuggler who was waiting in that smoky cantina to do his bad deeds and that was all we knew about him, we learn a little bit more as time goes on like how much of a badass he is and how skilled he is as a pilot. But a huge part of the intrigue of his character was how we didn’t know where he came from or much of what he’d been through and that’s something we’re going to lose with this new film. His friendship with Lando was also something that is better said than lived through; the consequences of it in Empire are felt and told so well that the details are unnecessary.

Seems like I’m one of very few who actually feel this way but I tend to feel this about a lot of “cinematic universe” movies and media, there’s that desire for “more more more” with our favorite characters that in my opinion ends up diluting some of the magic of the storytelling. Nothing can simply be left to be what it is, we’ve got to get to see the backstory or the reason why or the whole history of House Targaryen or whatever, and it’s not that none of those things have value but that they can dilute what thy meant to clarify.

Maybe I’m the only one though; sure feels like it sometimes.",07May2018,4

To make it worse... Yesterday at night she asked me to cuddle, and we even kissed. I told her that I loved her and she just smiled and didn't say a thing..

I also said ""I shouldn't be doing this"" and she replied with ""maybe""

38,So often in comment threads about criminals and douchebags people comment about how small someone’s dick probably is. Like if someone does a hit and run everyone will go on about how small his dick must be. Isn’t the fact that he just killed someone drunk driving worse than him being less endowed?

39,"I move around a lot, and currently live in a country in which i have limited language skills. This combined with my general depressive mood, and lack of social circle has meant that tomorrow will be the 4th week in succession i've not had a decent conversation with another, face to face.  Beyond that, it's not been much better tbh, but at least when i shared a house i would chat to the others, or when i went to the gym likewise. Even though these were superficial conversations really, just about sport, the weather or whatever, they were at least something. I speak to a few family members on skype a couple of times a week, and the odd friend, but not a great deal. I spend a lot of time on forums chatting with people i've come to know thru that. 

I am concerned this is unhealthy, i mean it's not anything but really, and i do miss having a laugh, joking with friends, meeting for drinks, food etc. Fact is i'm not very social anymore, and dont feel like forcing it. I recently turned 40, and dont have the language skills to really spark interesting convo's in shops, bars etc.

40,"Okay so last time I posted here I was going through some disillusional shit. Anyway, that's all cleared up and after much more searching I finally came to an answer that's solved all of my mental health issues, like anxiety and depression. The answer I came to, when deciding how to live life, what to do to overcome anxiety and depression is ""let go""

Like it's so fucking simple. I can do whatever the fk I want after that, but the way to go forward is to just know that the answer is two words. It doesn't really make sense and I as I discussed with my psychologist, maybe it's that I naturally figured it out and then summed it up with those two words and then trying to figure out more than that was fucking me over because there is no more to it. 

Or maybe those words are literally that psychedelic. I don't know. All I do know is that I'm soaring now, enjoying life a lot. Experiencing every range of emotion and acting spontaneously and organically. Let Go",07May2018,4

43,"Before I start I just want to say **this is not a post asking for advice**

The title is pretty straight forward. However I'm trying to keep this question **as scientific as possible** so please if you only have speculation to add at least provide some articles to read based off of your assumptions.

Before you ask why I didn't ask in r/askscience if I'm looking for a scientific answer is due to them not allowing *anecdotes* or personal wellness/health questions which this question needs in order to understand exactly what it is I'm asking.

Because of the nature of this post I feel it needs an introduction. I'll try to keep it as short and sweet as possible:

3 years ago I accidentally overdosed on synthetic cannabis because I didn't know it was synthetic. I had a very traumatic experience from it and the symptoms included:

Extreme body disassociation(Out of body experience)

Amnesia (forgot where I was and what the people I knew looked like; I could remember the people's names but not their faces.)

Anxiety

Ringing in the ears

Psychedelic Hallucinations (as if time were on repeat)

Rushing sensation in the head

Moving on past the event - I suffered from anxiety both generalized and social. I would have PTSD episodes where it felt I was reliving the experience to some degree. Depression, and walking around in a haze all the time.

Skipping forward to today - I had a severe anxiety attack today after consuming too much alcohol yester-evening. The head rushing sensation came back, the ringing in the ears came back and it took everything in my power to keep from acting illogically.

After drinking, and eating with some intensive physical therapy from a friend (change of scenery, funny videos, etc.) I began feeling much better.

It didn't stop there however. For a short period of time I was what I can only describe as ""manically"" happy. I quoted manically because in comparison to my every day life I was much more positive, grateful I was still alive, and happy. For about.... 20 minutes.

That 20 minutes is *the* most ""normal"" I've felt in 3 years and felt more like myself. My body didn't hurt like it usually does (despite being overweight), my mind was very clear, and I laughed and joked around with my friend like I used to for the first time in 3 years.

I was hoping someone could break down, either psychologically, and/or with neuroscience to help me understand what my brain went through to help me better understand why I felt the way I did. I am asking to **keep it scientific** because I **speculate** that it is a mixture of hormone/chemical imbalance and psychology.

Thank you for any help understanding the inner workings of the brain for the betterment of my own life.",07May2018,2

54,"The following thoughts are presented individually, each capable of being fleshed out and discussed on their own. This post serves no other purpose aside from allowing me to put these thoughts into words, with the ... that I am faced with a realization about myself, or about the external world. Each ellipsis will serve as a placeholder for a word that I cannot find, or do not know.

* I would like to be honest, first and foremost. Honest communication with others feels alleviating, but being honest with others about myself is something I am uncomfortable with. Perhaps silence is a form of self\-expression. Perhaps, it's the fact that I am not the person I *wish* I was that prevents me from communicating from others. 
* Wish. I wish for so much. 
* I believe in the importance of acknowledging yourself. Understanding who you are is key to ... and I don't believe in the notion that you have to *accept* who you are, or *improve* who you are \- you and I are under no obligation to do anything whatsoever, at any point. We never have been. 
* I don't know what I'm going to do with my life. There's nothing I want to do. I don't want to pursue further education after I graduate, I don't want a well paying job, I don't want friends or family.
*  I want to wake up tomorrow and find myself alone, with no one to care about me. I do not want the people around me to care more, I want them to care *less*. To be free from responsibility, to know that I could be wounded or murdered and there wouldn't be a single soul to mourn over my misfortune. 
* I wish the woman who gave birth to me did not care about me. 
* I am placid, fatigued, apathetic, and I do not see these facets as something that I ""must"", or ""should"" change about myself, nor do I want to put in the effort to change these things about myself. So long as effort is required on my part \- I do not believe I will change.

55,"Hey Redditors. 

I need your help. Your suggestions. 

*Anything negative will be removed* 

My little sister, let’s call her Maria has been self harming. She is between 13-17 years of age. Female.

She has been in therapy for years now. She says she absolutely loves her therapist. 

We’ve locked up all pills, knives, and anything else that could be considered dangerous such as cleaning supplies. 

My boyfriend accidently left his pocketknife at my house, and she self harmed. 

I am purchasing a locking door knob that locks from the inside and outside, only with a key, to make sure she has absolutely no access in case he forgets again. 

What do I do? I want her to stop harming herself. She got in trouble at school today and that’s why she is self harming today. Her friend called the police and they went to our house, despite my mom being home. 

My whole family is struggling. My dad had to come home from his business trip. My mom had left work early. I’m at work now, debating if I need to call someone in to take my shift. We aren’t upset with her at all, just stressed out because we don’t know what else to do. 

Do you have any suggestions? Ideas? Literally anything. She knows of resources like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, and Crisis Text Line. I fucking volunteer with Crisis Text Line, and I feel like I cannot help her at all. 

Please. Anything that has maybe helped you or a family member.

Thank you.

You can also use it to keep your headset safe when not in use. It is Expandable so when it is attached it can be flat against your phone or expanded so that it becomes a support to angle your phone when you want to watch a video or when you are making a video, going live or on a video chat. There is a variety of colors and you can purchase designs that you like the [Flamingo](https://mattjdistributors.com/pages/pop-up-expandable-phone-holders) and [Unicorn Design](https://mattjdistributors.com/pages/pop-up-expandable-phone-holders) that is available at [Mattj  Distributors](https://mattjdistributors.com/pages/pop-up-expandable-phone-holders)
