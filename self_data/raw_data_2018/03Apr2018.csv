0,"Throwaway.

College freshman geek here.

I did something incredibly embarrassing last week that I will never live down.

My friend James had this idea to ""ruin"" his 22 year old sister's big party. The only way we could that would be totally most shocking and unexpected.

We would run through her entire backyard party.

Naked.

We are 3 calculus major geeks.

James is about 5'8. Maybe the chubbiest out of all of us, but not ""fat"" or anything. Total nerd, but probably ""most"" outgoing out of all of us. Not that we are outgoing as a group. Only Martin has kissed a girl out of the 3 of us.

Martin is the runt of the group. Only 5'5. The one we always joke on most.

I'm in the middle. About 5'7. Not fat but definitely a ""studies-while-eating-Doritos"" belly on me.

James said ""Hey, we NEVER do anything out of character. This is what college kids do. Besides, nobody will notice us individually. We will be a blur and they will focus on the group. And it will TOTALLY piss off my sister. Now are we pussies or are we going to go out there and be the life of this party?""

Finally, the night came. It was about 10:00 and the weather was about 40 degrees outside. A full 15 degrees lower than we planned, but what can we do?

We were in James' room upstairs and James said ""Alright guys. It's time. Strip.""

I was nervous as can be. I never even take my shirt off at the beach, and we have never even showered at the campus gym, but I figured, hey, he's right it's 3 guys, nobody will focus in on me.

I undressed as fast as I could, like ""ripping off a bandaid"", throwing each item of clothing at the corner of the wall so I couldn't panic and put it back on. My sneakers, my socks, my button-down shirt, my belt, my khaki pants and then my undershirt. 

I took a deep breath and was blushing pink when I removed my boxers and threw them across the room, standing in the room with my bare butt and bare penis feeling exposed as ever. It took everything I could to fight the urge to cover my shame with my hands, but I just let it all hang out, acting like I wasn't mortified to have my bare body exposed. Even though I sort of instantly regretted agreeing to this. But I couldn't back out now.

The worst part was standing there, butt-ass naked, waiting on my friends to much slower remove their clothes as I stood there timidly switching from foot to foot.

Watching them undress was not a great experience either.

Martin had a bigger penis than me. Little runt Martin. Who I always joked about. I mean, he wasn't like porn star big, but his penis and balls were definitely bigger than mine. How humiliating.

There's James' chubby belly and big butt coming into view. At least I'm in better shape there. And wow, is his package THAT small? Okay, at least I'm in the middle.

I could tell my friends were nervous too. Once stripped to his birthday suit, Martin subtly covered his penis with one hand. Maybe it was even subconscious, but he looked like he badly wanted a fig leaf. He looked at me, and quietly laughed a little, obviously realizing the buddy who mocked him for his size was smaller...where it counted. I very subtly moved my waist behind James' desk as he snickered.

James kept his back to us at all times, as comical as it was to see him continuously talking like he was our leader with his big, round bare white ass shaking in front of us whenever he moved an inch.

James said ""Okay guys, let's GO!"" and opened the door.

Martin followed him, and I followed Martin.

My stomach was doing flips.

Wearing nothing but the glasses and a pink blush on my face, I took a deep breath, following the two bare butts in front of me, and ran out of my friend's room.

We all ran out of his room upstairs, down the stairs and out the sliding backdoor into his backyard with nothing on.

""WOOOOO!!!"" hands in the air.

All 3 of us about 5'7, all 3 slightly chubby, lily-white from the neck down, running with our hands up through the yard.

As naked as the day we were born.

We expected his sister's friends to whoop it up and cheer us on as the heroes of the party, and his sister getting so mad that we stole all her attention. Screaming at us to get out as the crowd cheered us on.

Instead, they were standing there, jaws dropped. Sly smirks on their faces. Nervous giggling. A few ""oh my Gods"". And his sister looked PISSED.

Mission accomplished!

Then, once we ran through past everyone and got to the other end of the yard to the fence, it happened.

One of her friends yelled out:

""We got 3 naked virgins, are we having a sacrifice or something tonight?""

That led to the laughter hitting an UPROAR.

To our surprise, now, the group of girls laughed...AT us. They laughed so hard and pointed at us.

We all panicked and went from confident streakers to vulnerable, exposed geeks covering our penises and balls with our hands and ran towards the backdoor to desperately get back in the house, to greater laughter.

It was as if somehow at that moment it dawned on us: ""Holy shit. We are fucking naked surrounded by women laughing at us.""

We desperately ran across the yard back towards the house.

That one line opened the floodgates, and we heard more comments from her hot girlfriends.

""Did you see those little weenies, they are so cute!""

""Oh my God those adorable white round bubble butts on all 3!""

""Nice freshman 15 bellies, boys, skip the gym this semester???""

To my horror, one said ""Hey virgin boy, let me be the first girl ever to TAP DAT ASS!"" and smacked my white butt HARD as I yelped, the girls hollered, and I ran faster.

Then they broke out cell phone cameras.

His sister of course used that opportunity to run inside and lock us out of the house and give us a smile like the cat who ate the canary.

After a few minutes of banging on the glass and apologizing, begging to be let back inside, our bare asses jiggling to the cheering delight of the girls, we realized we weren't getting back inside, and had to actually hop the fences in our birthday suits, leave the yard and run to our other friend's house around the block, at 10:30 pm in 40 degree brisk weather.

It was a humiliating retreat, buck naked and defeated.

I can't think of it at night without tossing and turning.",03Apr2018,0
2,"When I was first hired 16 months ago, we were not Sinclair Media but another Media company. We got bought out last fall. I was aware of their reputation at that time and was hesitant to work for them. I live in a very rural area and don't have a ton of options for the field of work I do (video production) so I decided to give it a try. 
For me, almost nothing changed and I continued my day to day routines. I make commercials for local businesses and it can be a pretty cool gig. 

About a month ago they sent out the script that caused the uproar. None of anchors wanted to read it, I didn't want to shoot it and our Promotion Director tried to fight it's purpose. We were all shot down and forced to produce it. It was a very gloomy shoot.

Today, with the company claiming all the main headlines today, we received a bunch of vulgar and somewhat scary phone calls from people voicing their displeasure with what's taking place. Truth is, I don't blame any of them. They all have a right to voice their opinion. Fellow redditors have expressed their feelings that I should quit and I'm hoping that will come to fruition real soon. I wish folks would understand that while we may look like a bullying jerk media company on the outside, we're actually very frail and not too far from imploding on the inside. It's complicated, but while the company appears to be doing well right now, I have my suspicions that we fall apart in the not too distant future. People know who we are and starting to steer clear of us, resulting in a loss of business.

Today I felt as if I was blamed for the uproar that's been caused. Please understand that with all my heart, I am truly sorry and if I could change anything about it, I would. I hope to be changing jobs soon. While I disagree with Sinclair's conservative stance, they were very nice to me as an employee.

TL;DR Sinclair has done some things that are not ok for our country and journalism but Fox News is way more dangerous.",03Apr2018,1

5,Congratulations. You told yourself you were going to loose weight and have already lost 4 pounds. You told yourself you were going to stop eating fast food and you stopped. You told yourself you would overcome your sadness. Still working on that. You told yourself you would stop talking to the girl that hurt you. You did. You told yourself you want to find a girlfriend. Now your taking to a girl. You told yourself you want your life to be fun and joyful. Now go tackle that.,03Apr2018,19
6,"""When I was in high school I stayed late after school so that I could audition for Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, but I never made it. I was so incredibly nervous about singing in front of people that I couldn't physically get myself to open the drama room door and go inside. The disappointment I felt walking away in the opposite direction is still so intense for me that even today I can remember what the weather was like that day.

In college, I would spend so many lunches sitting on Sproul watching the various a cappella groups perform, in awe of their ability and jealous that they had this outlet to express themselves that looked so fun. I even made it all the way to the student music department to audition for one of the sillier groups but, again, I got so nervous that I just lingered around for a few minutes then turned around to walk all the way back home. 

Recently, someone at work started an a cappella group—which I find to be amazingly nerdy and gratuitous for a company to have but also incredibly charming. A few weeks ago they held their first meeting, and I went upstairs and got all the way to the door of the conference room but somehow ended up back at my desk staring at my work.

In the grand scheme of things, this is not a big deal. But man in my little corner of the world, these experiences collectively are some of my biggest regrets that I have in life. 

All of this to say that I went to my very first voice lesson today and it was amazing! I sang 'Love is an Open Door' for an instructor sitting at a piano instead of in my shower or under my breath while biking or hiding behind the noise of my favorite bar. And while I was hardcore nervous sweating the entire time and I definitely wasn't born to sing the lead in any musical, I made it through, I had fun, and I signed up to go back for more lessons! 

I am so fucking happy and proud of myself for making it through that door that I could honestly cry. So excited! 😁""",03Apr2018,208
7,"Can a redditor please explain to me why every industry in U.S. has had the threshold of sexual harassment towards women lowered. It has been lowered to the point that men must walk on egg shells to keep from saying something offensive toward a woman that would result in termination or a criminal charge. In my mind, this is a great thing as a woman should never be put in that situation.

With that said, my wife is an ER nurse at a trauma hospital that takes on sexual harassment (and borderline abuse) from patients everyday. She doesn’t complain about it, rather she just tells me the stories of it happening. Even with this happening on a daily basis, it is never frowned upon by authorities, and there is definitely never any legal actions taken place. So reddit, why is it socially acceptable to sexually harass nurses?",03Apr2018,10
8,"It just kind of sucks when you do great things and never get into trouble but a parent/parents don’t acknowledge it. 

For instance I went to a state competition last year and placed 3rd but neither of my parents decided to come because they weren’t interested. I convinced my younger sister to join the program I went to state in and we both going to state again this year. Now the competition is this weekend and ever since we’ve qualified for state my dad frequently asks my sister everything about the program and wants to be super involved because she made it to state and he is even going to the state competition. It almost feels like he forgot that i am attending this competition too and that I placed last year. 

My sister went to a party once and it got busted and he had to go get her from the cops. He was not mad at her and in a matter of 2 weeks he encouraged her to keep on partying. 

I am also going to college (the first in my family to ever do so) this fall and certain things would be useful... like a car! He was telling me for the past three years that we would get me a car and I would be set to go back and forth from college to home to work ( I will be 4 hours away from home). But just last month he buys himself a brand new $40,000 vehicle and last week bought my sister a $10,000 used car. Keep in mind she is only a junior and she does not even have her license. She cannot even drive her car!! Now I am very responsible so if he cannot help me with a car I have savings and this summer I plan to make more so hopefully I can get myself something to get me from point a to point b. 

Things just suck because I feel like I am accomplishing so much in life but my parents don’t seem to care. I am in no way jealous of my sister I am just frustrated with how I feel abandoned by my parents. ",03Apr2018,45

14,"I was a moderate smoker from about ages 14-16 and quit cold turkey one day. Didn’t look back for a couple years until i evolved into a social smoker (mostly when drinking, one or two smokes shared with friends at parties now and again.) well fast forward to age 21 where I am now and i’ve progressed over the past 6 months or so back into a full on smoker, between 10 and 20 cigs a day. Ive fallen back into such a shitty habit and I am pretty angry with myself. I deal heavily with depression and anxiety and sitting down for a smoke is an opportunity for me to just sit and think about nothing for a couple minutes at a time.  The worst part is how much i truly enjoy smoking which makes it even harder to be honest with myself about the damage I am doing. I don’t know where I am going with this, Im just fuckin bummed out. Im sure Ill find a way to quit again but right now I feel almost powerless to these shitty things. I hate myself for it, honestly. I am going to sit here for a while thinking and trying to not run to the gas station for another pack. Sorry for my shitty formatting and punctuation, im trying my best while being so upset. Much love everybody... hope your days/nights are swell. ",03Apr2018,2
15,"TLDR; Bad dental hygiene and care leads to advanced periodontal disease and I am having my teeth extracted and getting immediate dentures at age 31. 

To be quite honest, I have no idea where to start, so please be patient with me. Also, be kind. 

I am a 31 year-old mother of three; ages 7, 5, and 2. In my teenage years I struggled with self confidence a great deal and turned to a very specific self-harming eating disorder known as Pica. Very specifically, I ingested soap suds. Every chance I got; when I did the dishes, took a shower, and I had even kept a bottle of soapy water on my bedside. What this did was, clean me out, if you will. The long-term and very negative effects were the damage done to my stomach-lining and my gums. There were times that I could run my finger along my gums and it would just come off in thin layers. But, it was fairly painless. 

Later in life I discovered hard drugs, and while it was ""fun"" at the time, I definitely did irreparable damage to my teeth. My teeth were slowly rotting from the inside out and I didn't even realize it while I unknowingly partied with my boyfriend and friends. 

In my twenties, I paid thousands of dollars and several visits to a local dentist for repair work and attempts to save teeth that began to show signs of decay. And, it was working for a while and my smile was getting better. But, then I had children and my focuses left myself and went to my child, and then children. I only got myself emergency appointments to extract when the pain became unbearable, which wasn't often. 

Over the last year, my smile has gone from okay to disgusting. I fear opening my mouth even to those who love me and would never judge me. I wake up nightly with excruciating pain and it is seemingly never-ending. I simply cannot remember the last time that I felt no pain coming from my mouth, it's just varying levels. Every few days, a chunk of one of my teeth break off while I am eating. I am pretty sure that I have even swallowed pieces of broken teeth. The decline was quite rapid. Within 6 months I look like I have smoked meth all my life, but I have never touched meth. I hate looking in the mirror and feel disgusted with myself for possibly letting it get this horrible. My five year old asks me if my broken teeth hurt. 
Currently, my front teeth are a mixture of holes, black, and brown; just all out disgusting. Every day I make a mixture of off-white clay and dental wax (the kind that you use for braces I believe) and make a tooth-color wax and stuff it in the holes and cover all the imperfections. While it covers holes and icky spots, my smile is noticably off, as the color is not quite perfect.  I have also recently discovered to my horror that I also glow under a blacklight when I smile. 

I have finally decided to make a change in my life and I am beyond terrified. I have an appointment tomorrow morning at 7:45 for immediate dentures. I will actually have two appointments tomorrow. The appointment at 7:45, they will make a mold of my existing teeth in order to make dentures that will fit my mouth. Then at 1:30 pm I will have all of my teeth....remaining teeth extracted. This is the part that I am currently most terrified by. Previous dentists have mentioned that I have ""hot teeth'"" which I do not believe is a proper medical term, but essentially I do not numb well. I remember the last extraction I got twenty shots of novocaine and still felt every bit. I had to be held down by three nurses and screamed during the entire extraction. Couple the fact that my teeth are ""hot"" and the fact that I have exposed nerves on at least 5 teeth; I am in for a VERY painful day tomorrow. 

So, this will be sharing my denture adventure with all those who care to read. From start to finish, which will be approximately 6 months until I receive my final step, the hardliner. Again, please be kind, as I may have the courage to upload pictures (including before) later in the process.

16,"It seems like this one thing is the constant cause to all my negative thoughts or actions. It seems like for such a long time I’ve put so much value on how I look or my appearance, that I now see flaws in myself that might not even be there or are even important. 

My confidence has always been low. I’ve gone to a small school my entire life and haven’t ever been exposed to the whole social/party atmosphere with girls. But a lot of my friends are in relationships with girls that they live by in their neighborhood. So they never had to get out into the social world and look for a girl. I definitely crave a relationship with a women and constantly think about it. I’ve had small relationships with girls but they all ended with me either braking up with them or them braking up with me because I was to clingy. I have developed this almost (obsession) for a relationship that whenever I see a somewhat attractive girl in public, I won’t stop thinking about them until they leave or I leave. Yes, I know it’s creepy, but I want to fix this. Anyways, I know this isn’t true, but I’ve always convinced myself that looks are all that matters when getting a girl. This leads me to become obsessed with my own looks, to the point where I depress myself if I feel like I don’t look good. Even though I’ve gotten many compliments on my looks before, they all fade away within days, and the negative thoughts crowd my head once again. 

Please, somebody give me some advice on being less, narcissistic I guess you could call it. ",03Apr2018,2

Surprisingly, English is my first language despite that I was born out of state.

Sometimes I find myself coming back to these struggles now and then. I try my best and I always read my writing twice.

18,"So I've had this barking dry cough for about 2 years it started during Thanksgiving break. I got sick chills fever and cough. I got better in 3 days but the cough was there I went to 3 different doctors when the cough didn't go away. The final time I went I gave up so I just kept coughing. A month goe was by and one day I started having trouble breathing. It hurt to breathe and cough and laugh or move. My lung was in pain I guess from coughing so much it got inflame. Had shortness of breath when I went to the er that day. And they xrayed me to see if I had phenomia and such I was clear. They gave me stuff for the pain and so more meds for the cough. Cough didn't go away so a few months went by I went again this time they gave me an inhaler albuterol. It seem to somewhat make me cough less idk if it help but I was still coughing a lot but less than normal so I gave up. I kept taking it tho. About 6 months went by and I felt fine just the cough was there and my lung would hurt but not as bad I just assume from the cough so I go to another doctor.

I get check they think maybe acid reflex and asthma so I get more of the same med and then they also give me symbicort.

It didn't seem to help so I go again a few months later and they give me some other type of inhaler with acid reflex pills no help. The cough is annoying but it doesnt hurt if anything just makes my lung on right side hurt from so much but it's not to painful. I've gotten xrays on chest and face for sinus to make sure I was fine. Now I thought I had laryngitis but I never had a horase voice but idk.

I been guessing at what it could ge for a very long time and I've just given up. So maybe someone can maybe help I'll give u everything I've felt or feel.

So number one I notice that I have trouble speaking that I never use to have like my voice softens down or lowers and gets hard to pronounce words like I'm tired or something. My voice gets dried up when I talk and even if I drink water it doesnt help this isnt all the time but sometimes these happen.

I do know that I can't talk for long or like my voice kind of tears I can't explain it I can talk but it doesnt feel normal I've never had a horase voice Tho. My cough is a barking dry cough and sometimes if I can't cough right my cough sounds like my voice is being torn or something like shattered so I have to cough again til it sounds like a dry barking one

I also use to have really bad allergies but ever since I started coughing I haven't had my normal allergies where I get the runny nose red watery eyes. 

Its woken me up From my sleep about 3 times in 2 years so not often but I felt like a choking on hair or dust tingle type feeling in my throat that's as best as i can explain it honestly. 

I also had one of those attacks one day when I was working out the hair or dust tingle in my throat which causes me to cough really fast for like a min till it passes.

There have been days where I don't cough much I wish I could say what I did different I dont know. 

I dont know what it could be I been to the doctors many times and I'm just lost and giving up from frustration. I guess I could live with coughing but it's so annoying. 

I will do more test on myself like maybe leave the house more often maybe it's my construction job there so much it could be but I haven't found answers.

I work in painting I always wear mask and buy new ones when needed with the filters. I cough more at home than I do at work I'm always covered up at work. Anyways I'm probably leaving a lot of things out so I'll try to answer with any questions. But maybe someone has been through something or would no. And sorry for bad grammar.",03Apr2018,4

22,"Golden Rule #1- Never date a bitch that hasn't cum before.
Not your job, not worth the hassle, very in experienced when it comes to sexual cue's and/or sexual situations leading to disappointment on both sides   
 
Golden Rule #2- No drunk chicks 
Never. Not worth the hassle, the risk, or the time. If you're the guy bringing the drunk chicks home (like I was) cut the shit and find a decent girl to get laid. 

Golden Rule #3- Genuineness is the key, bitches smell fake mother fuckers a mile way.
People talk about ""confidence"" ""aggressiveness"" and ""swag"" but it comes down to being genuine to get what you what. In the end your happiness as the man matters more. 
ALWAYS REMEMBER ""A happy man is a happy relationship, a happy woman is a miserable man."" 

Golden Rule #4- Every car has 4 wheels, every bitch has a pussy.
Just because this one girl isn't giving you what you want doesn't mean its the end of the world. The quicker you get rid of her, the faster you can get some somewhere else.   

Golden Rule #5- Always leave her wanting more.
""I always owed my drug dealers money, that way when I called, they picked up."" No good morning or goodnight texts. Ever. Unless you want to be friend zoned instantly, you leave her on read so she answers you the next day.

Golden Rule #6- Don't have girl-friends.
You might think its cool to have 50 girls to talk to but if they ain't 50 girls you're having sex with then you're a loser just like women. Fundamentally men are better so there is no reason for you to have any girl around besides to use the one thing she can offer you.  

Golden Rule #7- Bring up sex as early as possible. 
Similar to rule #3 make your intentions clear. If by the end of the first date she doesn't know you want to fuck her, she's going to move onto the guy that will. 

Golden Rule #8- NEVER TELL A BITCH YOU LIKE HER
I was told this when I was 5 years old and it has stuck with me since. I don't even say I like a girl back I agree I'm attracted to her. The moment you give into this game the faster you end up in the friend zone.  

Golden Rule#9- The only way to win, is not to play.
How many times has a girl asked you a question that seems to have no winning answer? The only way to get a girl to have sex with you is to make it on your terms. Don't let her run things hoping she gives something up a girl will test you every chance she gets. 

I wish someone had given me these rules years ago because it has seriously helped me out. There are more theories, and practices put behind each rule but this is just a brief summary. ",03Apr2018,0
23,"Spurred by the ""Circle of Trust"" happening I made a handful of posts on circles and had a lovely time trading passwords with a few people. I even changed my profile picture to something other than the default for a bit.

Then things took a turn for the worse. 
My phone froze while I was trying to join a circle. When it started working again the circle had been betrayed although I hadn't clicked anything and my flair showed it was my fault.

At that point most everyone had stopped responding to my messages, though not a big deal.

29,"I used to never notice race or ethnicity. Now I do, I hate it, and I wish there was a way to go back. 

I grew up in this small liberal European country feeling like racism was a thing of the past, something that happened before my lifetime. I'd never met a racist and never talked to anybody who had. Then at some point in 2016, I started getting interested in the ""race and gender"" debate online. (I think actually the first bit that started to lure me in was that one of my uni coursebooks had a chapter on ""the metaphysics of race,"" which combined a topic I had zero interest in, race, with a topic I loved, metaphysics.) After listening to a lot of rhetoric from multiple sides, I suddenly found myself being ""race-conscious."" Now instead of just never having any thoughts about people's race, I find myself sometimes needing to actively suppress stereotypes and prejudices.

I find it difficult to even describe what it was like before the change. I mean, I'm not blind, I've obviously always been able to see people's skin color. But I have several memories of my race-obliviousness from my teenage years. I remember when somebody first pointed out to me that the obviously-Korean adopted girl in my class was Asian not European. I don't know why I had never realized. Obviously she looked different from her parents, but everybody looks different from their parents, since everybody looks different from everybody else. It had never struck me that this particular girl looked different from her parents in a way that could be filed under ""race."" I also remember somebody pointing out to me that this other girl was Middle Eastern. They laughed at my confusion and asked if I didn't know that Northern Europeans had blonde hair and light skin. I was so befuddled I protested. She just had a bit darker hair than me and was a bit more tan or something. How was I supposed to know she was a different *race*? Looking back, it's like I didn't even have those categories set up in my mind. I only perceived these gradations of skin color or hair color, without dividing them into discrete sets like, ""This is the European part of the color spectrum, this is the Middle Eastern part, etc."" It's like race and ethnicity just weren't in my vocabulary. And this also impacted my understanding of racism. For the longest time racism was just the most confusing and ridiculous idea to me. Hating some particular race was like hating people who take showers on Wednesdays or something, just the most arbitrary nonsensical thing imaginable.

I feel so strongly that *there's no fucking reason to be race-conscious.* What possible reason could there be to take an interest in people's race, other than this pernicious attitude of ""I wonder what those people are like""? When you're race conscious, you take what a person of some race does and you assimilate it to your understanding of that racial group. And, conversely, you impute the information back and understand a person of some race in light of your understanding of that racial group. It goes in both directions, from particular to general and from general to particular. You use individuals from the group to understand the group, and the group to understand the individuals. As far as I can tell, that's literally what it *is* to be race conscious. That's what it is to have race or ethnicity as an operative concept in your mind. If you're not doing either of those mental operations, the concept just is not operating in your mind. And before I became race-conscious, I think I was simply never doing either of those two operations. 

And that's great because as far as I can tell, doing them is also exactly what gives rise to stereotyping and prejudice. I feel becoming race conscious has involuntarily made me more racist, where before I was basically not even psychologically capable of racism. For example, I saw a video of a Yale lecture Q&amp;A the other day, and I couldn't help noticing how many of the students were Asian. A couple of thoughts crossed my mind like ""That's kinda weird in a majority European country"" and I was off wondering about the academic excellence of Asians. One of the other students was African and I had the thought that this ran against stereotypes. The point is that a couple of years ago I wouldn't have had any of those thoughts. If you'd asked me after the video what the students' ethnicities had been, I'd probably have been unable to answer.

So I feel like getting interested in the political debate about race was a terrible mistake and has made me a worse and dumber person. Now all I want is a ""return to innocence."" This makes it especially irritating to know how extremely negative the prevailing opinion of ""race-blindness"" is. I just googled my title to see if anyone else out there felt the same, and the first result was [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/26/do-not-see-race-ignoring-racism-not-helping) that just completely ridicules the concept and explains how racist it is. If you google the phrase ""race blind"" on its own, you get [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/culturally-speaking/201112/colorblind-ideology-is-form-racism) telling you ""colorblind ideology is a form of racism."" WTF? Okay, so maybe being race-blind can make you less attuned to the struggles of people who suffer from racism. *Maybe.* I'm honestly not even sure if that claim makes any sense, but everybody seems to be saying it, so I guess there must be something to it. Okay, so then let people who officially deal with racial injustices have the race-consciousness. Policy-makers, scientists. And keep it away from the rest of us. It's like [Morgan Freeman says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPnG1hpjvEw). Normal people should not be race-conscious if we want racism to be over. Race-consciousness makes you racist. Race-blindness immunizes you against racism. I just want to be oblivious to race again so it can go back to being an uninteresting non-issue for me, the way it should be. ",03Apr2018,24

33,"Continuing on from my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/89a7oa/tomorrow_i_take_the_plunge/). 

I went to the dentist bright and early this morning to get impressions made for dentures that are made to fit my mouth. I went to the dentist's office and I was the first patient there, which is great for me. I went into the very open room, there wasn't even a door, and sat in the dentist chair. The assistant explained what making the impressions consisted of and how long it might take. I asked a million questions and looked at models of the different tiers and choices of tooth color. 

First, came the putty. This part wasn't bad at all really. It was this blueish green, well, putty and she put it on both sides of my mouth and I just had to bite down for about two minutes and then she pulled it out. 

The next part was the bad part. As I previously explained, a lot of my teeth are broken and also have exposed nerves. The next step involved a paste that is squirted all around the teeth and a metal tray then inserted and the substance hardens and it pulled out. She started with my bottom jaw and it wasn't so bad. Just a little pressure when she pulled it out of my mouth. Next, was the top, as she is squirting the mixture into my mouth, I feel the cold hit the exposed nerve and all I want to do is scream. I wince in pain and she knows it and tells me to ""breathe, just breathe, I know,"" as she spreads the rest of it around my top gums. 

As I sit there with this hardening goo in my mouth, I realize that she is going to have to pull it out just like the bottom one. I am so surprised I didn't pass out. I have one tooth that has been particularly a nuisance the last few days. As the dried stuff pulled from my teeth all I could do was sit there and grip the arms of the chair....and hold my breath, which is never a good idea. 

But, then I was done. That wasn't so bad, now was it! I confirmed the tier that I wanted, I got the premium, which is one step below the best, but still great. And then chose my tooth color. I got the A1, which I was told was the most natural looking color on most patients. It looked really yellowish to me, but she said that it was only because it was right next to the white-white example. I then waited 45 minutes in the waiting room to ensure that my molds were okay. 

I now have 2 hours until I need to be back in office so that I can take my anxiety medication. I find it silly that I have to take the medicine in office and sit there for an entire hour, but whatever. 

Wish me luck that I don't freak out on these people, or that I do not get so scared that I throw up on everyone. ",03Apr2018,2

41,"I've worked 60-80 hour weeks for the last 18 months between college study, extracurricular's, and work while maintaining a social life. I'm the head of my college's Chemistry society/club, I work two jobs within my college (TA for a course + student recruitment), I've established scholarships within my college for disadvantaged students, I have a 3.94 GPA, I'm the highest performing student in my year within my major at one of the best colleges in the country, and yet I've been unsuccessful at so many applications.

Before last week I was 0 for 6 for summer programs / winter programs / internships that I've applied for that are related to my interests. This didn't discourage me, because I figured that they were relatively competitive. The one that sent me over the edge last week was when I was rejected for two summer programs within my college which accept half of the applicants, some of the best odds you can get for these things. I've had my applications proofread by friends who had participated in the same programs in previous years until they were to a high standard.

This has been the case for the last two years, and I really don't see it improving. It's immensely discouraging to put in all this effort, sustain multiple ~100 hour work weeks in a row when times get stressful (ie now), only to be labelled as below average. I don't view myself as below average, but I guess that must be the truth. I feel worthless at the moment and for the past week I've been anxious about my prospects after I graduate next year. I just know that I'm going to experience this when I apply for jobs as well, and I'm going to end up unemployed.

My room is about 13x9 but a lot of space is taken up by my bed, dresser, bookcase, and computer desk.

RC helicopter 

Nerf guns/target practice

48,"Some background: I am 26/F living in the U.S. I have dealt with mouth breathing, sinus pressure, sinus headaches, etc. for my entire life. This post may be lengthy, because I know that I always wanted to read other people's in depth experiences before my surgery!

I went to see an ENT last August 2017, and he stuck a scope up up nose, which confirmed what I thought: I had a deviated septum, enlarged turbinate bones, and enlarged adenoids. All of these things contribute to congestion, mouth breathing, snoring, etc. I literally was never able to breathe through my nose, but I just never did anything about it, aside from using nasal spray and decongestants sporadically. After receiving my diagnosis, I scheduled a procedure for March 2018. 

Here is what I decided to have done: 
1) removal of the adenoids. My doctor said this would be a simple fix, and doesn't usually cause any pain or problems. 
2) the septoplasty to correct my deviated septum. 
3) CONSERVATIVE resection of the turbinates. Yes, I read all about Empty Nose Syndrome, and the horror stories associated with it, and I panicked. I am already an anxious person, and I talked it all through with my doctor. While he said the risks of ENS for me were virtually zero, we compromised. He said he would do a much more conservative resection of the turbinate bones that would include cauterization of the bones, not actual removal. I agreed, asked a few other questions during my pre-op appointment, and felt sufficiently confident to go through with it!

The Day/Night Before Surgery:

The preparation is pretty simple and standard: no food/ drink after midnight the night before the procedure. My surgery was scheduled for 7:30 am, so this was no problem. Also, stop taking any blood thinning medications such as ibuprofen 2 weeks before the surgery.

The Morning of Surgery:

I arrived to the outpatient surgery center around 7:30 am. This surgery center is across from the main hospital. It was very welcoming, almost like a hotel lobby, with big fish tanks, comfy seating, and lamps/other lighting to provide a cozy feel. There were also complimentary drinks for families and friends waiting for patients, which I thought was a nice touch. I got checked in, got my wristbands put on, including one for an allergy to penicillin, and waited about 5-10 minutes before being called back. 

My mom came to the surgery center with me, but they had to get me all settled before she could come back with me. My room was small but had a nice rocking chair in it. I got into bed, got the cuffs placed on my ankles to prevent blood clots, and heart monitors and blood pressure cuff. Then, I was given some pills: some pain meds to help with afterwards, antibiotic, anti-nausea meds, and a Dramamine to get me sleepy. Then, the nurse tried to stick my IV, but was unsuccessful in one arm. I told her I typically get IVs in my other arm, so she switched. Having to be stuck twice was the worst part for me!! But she was super nice. She started my fluids and as I am very anxious in general, I asked for some anxiety medication. She said the anesthesiologist would be in to see me and provide that. My mom was then allowed to come back, and everything happened quick!

The anesthesiologist came to see me, make sure I had nothing in my mouth, and then her assistant provided a sedative. I could tell they were trying to calm me knowing that they were taking me right THEN, and the sedative wouldn't even have time to kick in. But I did start to feel it a little, and they wheeled me to the operating room, put on some warm blankets, and put the mask over my face, all while rubbing my  head and talking to me about my favorite things, like Disney World. I've had 2 other minor surgeries, and I always remember falling asleep, but this time I remember nothing!

The next thing I knew, I woke up in recovery. My glasses were on, and my mom was already there! Apparently I had been awake for a few minutes and repeating myself, but I didn't remember. The most immediate pain was a sore throat from the breathing tube that I kept complaining about! The nurse quickly provided me an icy slushy and a Nutrigrain bar, which I ate with no problem, and then she gave me pain pills. Soon, I was ready to go home!

My arrival at the hospital was 7:30 and I was home relaxing at 10:45. I was truly amazed by the efficiency and kindness of the entire staff! I also got to meet with my surgeon before the procedure, and my mom met with him after. The whole surgery to do all 3 of my procedures took about 25 minutes. 

One thing you will go home with is wearing the gauze mustache! This needs to be changed twice an hour for the first few hours, but eventually, the blood does slow down. Throughout the first day, I kept taking my pain pills as scheduled, but I felt pretty great! I think it was adrenaline. My throat bothered me more than my nose. My nose/eyes felt like a combination of being punched repeatedly and a bad head cold. But it wasn't bad at all. 

My fiancé and parents took care of me for the next couple days. The most annoying part was that the packing in my nose had these little straws sticking out through them to help breathing, but it didn't really help, and I kept waking myself up snoring every few minutes, it seemed. NOT fun! Also, changing the gauze got to be tiresome. 

Finally, 48 hours after the surgery, I got the packing and the straws removed. The doctor said the straws wouldn't really hurt, and they didn't, but the packing would feel like someone was ripping my brains out through my nose. I truly felt like an Egyptian mummy. It was more weird/unpleasant than truly painful. I did take a pain pill before this appointment. 

Once the packing is out, you are supposed to start doing NeilMed sinus rinses, similar to a Neti Pot. These rinses are AMAZING! You do them 3 times a day or more, and they help me a lot.

I am now a week out from surgery. Today I am sneezing a lot, but it is not painful. I took my antibiotics and pain pills the first few days, but lessened the dosage and frequency of the pain pills after 2 days. Then, I switched to regular Tylenol, and now, I really don't need anything at all. I still have congestion and slight pain. Your nose will be sore and dry, so have Vaseline or Aquaphor handy. (The hospital actually put some on me before I left and I've kept it handy ever since). 

I am looking forward to the results as my nose fully heals over the next month or two! I actually have this whole week off work, but I could have gone back after a few days if I didn't already have the time off (I work in education). 

It can be scary, but I am already so happy with how I am recovering, and I plan to update with longterm results. PLEASE feel free to ask any questions!",03Apr2018,2

Me: Haha, I was thinking more along the lines of a date, but if you'd rather go as a group that's fine.


Jenny: Oh! Sorry, I had no idea! But I think it'd be a great place for all of us to visit as a group.


Me: Haha, definitely check it out when you can! It's pretty good.
