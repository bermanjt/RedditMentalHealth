0,"I’m looking at train tickets from London to Edinburgh for next month and I saw the price of a return ticket and I was like “holy shit, I can actually afford that”. I’ve saved a small amount of money from working which is enough to cover my ticket and food while I’m there. The only problem is a place to sleep at the moment, but I’m considering bed hopping using tinder. It’s reckless and dangerous and stupid and I’ve only been to Edinburgh once before but I felt so happy when I was there and this is the first time I’ve felt excited about something in such a long time. If I try to earn enough money I may be able to afford an Airbnb or cheap accommodation for the few days I want to go. I just need to get myself together and work hard at it. ",21Nov2018,1
1,"Hi everyone. So I really struggle with being able to let things go and move on, especially things that I cannot change. I get really mad with myself for not doing things differently in the past, which may have happened years ago. Now I realise I cannot change these things, but yet I get mad and sad about these things. Something (relatively) trivial as when I didn’t put some important documents onto my external hard drive, and my laptop died and I lost those files: on a weekly basis I remember about this and am so annoyed with myself. I regret a lot of things for not pursuing things in the past and wish I could turn back time, but I understand the only way to learn from this is to not make similar mistakes again. But there’s the irrationality in that I am still very annoyed. I do have a history of somewhat punishing myself, especially mentally, in that I do like to make myself sad and depressed.

I’ve never thought about meditation but been reading about it lately and seems to help people, just wondering what people thought? ",21Nov2018,1

3,"I have GAD and work a very stressful job. The work culture here can get pretty toxic. People frequently brag about how much overtime they put in and shut down or get angry when anyone complains about the job. But turnover is extremely high from people quitting due to stress and being unhappy in general.

I'm used to working in food service, where there tends to be a pretty clear line separating customers from employees. Employees are there for each other. You listen to your coworkers vent and they listen to you. It's normal to go out in small groups for drinks and let off steam or meet at someone's home for a game night. It's normal to ask for help and to go out of your way for each other. It's normal for the boss to show appreciation by getting everyone lunch every now and then, sending someone for Starbucks or ice cream and paying for it, or personally putting in more hours to take some things off the communal plate.

Then I got a job in retail (mid-to-high end commissions) and it was the complete opposite. Even your ""friends"" were more like frenemies. Supervisors avoided you at all costs. And even though customers in food service were bad, retail was worse. I got treated like something halfway between a personal assistant and a maid. There was nowhere to go to escape them and no one to ask for help. Coworkers avert their eyes when you smile at them or pretend not to notice you, and this is the norm.

My current job is in an office, and it's most similar to my job in retail. Except that we're expected to be AGGRESSIVELY friendly. Your day is only okay, not AMAZING? You need an attitude adjustment--do you even want to work here? You had a really rough interaction with a client? Why are you complaining, that's what we pay you for. You've worked every holiday this year? Too bad. A client lost their cool and started threatening you? Why didn't you de-escalate the situation?

We have a company messenger program so theoretically you can reach out to anyone at any time. You can even make group chats with all your friends. But everyone is so miserable while pretending to be ecstatic. Blowing off steam isn't a thing. Asking for help isn't a thing. If you ask for help, you're lazy or bad at your job. If you complain, you're a selfish, unhappy person who wants to drag other people down. You know what you need instead? Candy. An expensive dinner. A new purse. Go wild. Just don't tell anyone how you're feeling. Your feelings don't matter. Your performance is what's important. Mandatory overtime. Exceed expectations. You were sick for a week in May? Low meets for the year. No raise. Next year you'll do better, won't you? The only acceptable answer is yes. Leave your personality at the door.",21Nov2018,1

9,"I am a college student who’s 22 years old, I will graduate this year (I hope).

I had terrible relationships that broke me completely, friendships also. I think I will always feel alone. Not that I can’t find anything, but I feel different. Misfitting.

I started using ecstasy last year, I love everything about it. But it lost it’s magic lately. This happens to people who abused it, and I did honestly. Maybe that’s a good thing. I don’t want to use it anymore. 20+ times is enough for a life time.

I want to go abroad and live in Europe next year. It’s the only thing I dream about. I don’t have the money to study in Europe. I can work after studying. That can help. But I have no idea about how can I do that. I have a green visa that allows me to travel all the world ( my father was in special forces). But work allowance? I have to google it.

If you hate stereotypes, sorry. I hate them too but it’s the real truth. People were not friendly, happy or relaxed in where I live. 

Like I said, I “was” an addict. Addict of toxic people more than everything. Fixing people is not my job. I want to open a new page in my life.

I want to get off the work that I love, get a beer with one of my friends midnight, have fun, talk, get home and sleep. I want to send my mom great pictures that I took in Europe. See my sister in weekends(She lives there).

My last 2 years on college is gone with ecstasy and toxic people. I’m not sure if 7 months is enough to make a plan to escape this weird country that I survived for 22 years.

I feel blessed for everything though. It was a mindblowing story. I was lucky enough to be the main character.

10,"Early October, I got out of a 1 year relationship. It was my first real relationship and my ex literally changed my life. I feel like I grew into myself with him, I will forever be grateful for what he did for me. But he broke up with me, saying he didnt love me like I loved him and I was devastated. First two weeks were living hell. 

After that though, I rationalized the whole thing and have moved on. It seems quick, and probably is, but I’m not waiting to be sad, I’m moving on with life. 

I’m talking to about 9ish guys right now. Three ive met in person so far. One there was not a connection, but the other two are lovely. Of those two I hooked up with one multiple times. The sexual chemistry is amazing, and intoxicating. But also when we talk its just so deep and well thought out. I love getting to know people, and its fun. The other guy and I are planning to hook up and be casual. I forgot when meeting him that it was intended to be sexual because he was just such a gentleman, and a sweet genuine person. Then when things turned sexual, I was even more into it. 

I care about both men as people, and I love being able to enrich their mind and body as they do me. Its also nice realizing why we wouldnt work out as a relationship. Before I think I would date people because I could, not because I should and its nice. Also its freeing because I can enjoy being with people, and have genuine connections, without the permanentness of a relationship. Truly happy.",21Nov2018,1

And no ones around to miss me

Do I still exist?

A question

For my little sis

Whos been slitting wrists 

Since she was six

Because our parents refuse

To acknowledge they caused this

Ran from home

Cut the losses

First time i fucked a bitch

I felt flawless

Numb the pain 

Girls, Drugs, &amp; Games

Anything to ignore my last name

I felt

Empty

How do I accept that

They resent me

They left me

A child fallen from the tree

And nobody was there to help me

So please

Stop calling

Stop asking how i'm feeling

You’ll send me bawling

Crawling to the corner of my room

My arms glued to my knees

A cocoon shaken off the family tree

But I will emerge

I’ll flap my wings and scream

“I don’t need you, tree

I can fly bitch

So don’t you weep

About me leaving you behind

Your tree wasn’t my home

So I made the air mine”

And maybe someday 

I’ll find another tree

With friendly branches

And caring leaves

And I’ll want to be with them

As much as they want to be with me",21Nov2018,1
16,"The other night I almost got in a head-on collision. It probably wouldn't have been fatal. And it was scary, but for a different reason. 
I was in the middle turning lane of a 4 lane road, waiting for a gap to turn left, when a car coming from the opposite direction also got into the middle lane. At first I thought he was slowing down, but by the time I realized that he wasn't, there was nothing I could do. At the very last second he swerved out of the lane back into the other lane, almost sideswiping another car, and he was only a few inches from my front bumper. 
It all happened pretty quickly, but for some reason, I wasn't bothered at all. It didn't scare me. As I sat there watching his car come directly at me, I didn't move a muscle. I didn't react; it was almost like I had no fight or flight reaction; almost like my mind has gone numb. After it happened, I made my turn, and pulled into the parking lot, as if nothing had happened.
What scared me the most is that it almost seems like I'm not bothered by the thought of dying. Don't get me wrong, I do not consider myself suicidal. It's just that if I did die, I don't think it would be that bad. I try to stay positive, hang out with friends as often as possible, and keep myself busy, but still, I wouldn't consider myself happy. I go day by day, doing the same thing, going to work, going home, and going to sleep. I have people that care about me, and I care about other people. But still, nothing seems right. I don't think I'm depressed, but maybe I'm in denial. I need something to change up my life and make me truly happy. ",21Nov2018,1
17,"I saw a post on this on /r/seduction and got so hyped up over this topic I made my own post here because it’s my own unsolicited advice/rant.

I (19f) used to go by this rule, religiously, and a lot of people do. It’s amazing that people know their worth. It’s important for people to understand their needs and wants in a relationship. Attention is definitely a priority for most relationships, and if you can’t compromise on it... then don’t.

However, people also have to understand that others just don’t have the luxury to spend their time the way they want to, and this goes for other things such as their money or even how they want to spend their life.

I never realized how much of a blessing it is to be able to do whatever you want, whenever you want, until I met a guy who doesn’t have that. Who uses his time to provide for himself and make sure he’s not homeless or stuck without a phone or food. Who still loves me like no one else ever has, but also has to be given the same type of love.

Sometimes you just can’t be a priority for that person right now because the priority is supporting themselves, trying to feed themselves, trying to do things for themselves so that they can afford next month’s rent. You can still be unbelievably important to that person, but they also have to be unbelievably important to you for you to try and empathize.

It’s up to the individual to realize that, and support and care about the other person enough to just lay off and understand that not everything is about them.

I feel like today’s dating scene is too obsessed with the idea of “What can he do for me?”, “What has she done for me?”. When it should be about “What can I do for this person who I love and cherish?”, “What can we do together to help each other grow?”

Spread the love and share the love before you expect unconditional love.

That being said, don’t be a chump and get punked by empty promises and one-sided love, then continue to feeding this “relationship” with your love and care. However, don’t expect people to be able to drop everything else in their life just for you. It’s an unrealistic and selfish perspective on love.

30,"TLDR at bottom. 

As title says, I’m scared that I might have accidentally ruined Christmas for my family. 
Here’s how. 

A few days ago, our dog cut her foot open on my watch. No idea how it happened, we think she cut it on a tree branch while running around outside. Took her to the vet to get patched up, fairly expensive for sedation/stitches. 

Cut to today - pup hasn’t had her cone off since she got stitched on Saturday and I can tell she’s desperate to give herself a bath, butt scooting on the floor and everything. So I take her cone off for a bit to let her, my bro and dad come home and my bro and I get ready to leave for the evening. As we’re leaving, her cone is still off but I figure “whatever, dads still home so she can have it off a bit longer”. Hadn’t been off that long anyways. BUT I didn’t know that my dad had ALSO left to go to a meeting, so pup was just running free in the house. She managed to chew off one stitch while everyone was out. Mom comes home, and dog still doesn’t have her cone on and has chewn off a stitch. Mom is FURIOUS. She yells at the whole family when me and my bro get home and says “if we have to pay another big vet bill for this, you can forget about Christmas this year bc we won’t be able to afford it”. 
I am so scared that I ruined Christmas for my family because of a miscommunication. If we have to take her to the vet again to get it restitched, I’m going to offer to pay part of it since this whole thing is technically my fault, but then I won’t be able to afford to do anything for my family/friends this Christmas. Which I guess in a way is better than my whole family not being able to afford it. 
Sorry for the ramble. I needed to get that off my chest. 
Any advice on how to handle this would be much appreciated (please don’t tell me how dumb and stupid I was for not putting her cone back on. I know that already. ). 

TLDR; dog got stitches, I took her cone off for a bit and didn’t put it back on when no one was home (bc of a miscommunication) and she chewed off a stitch. Mom gets pissed and says if we have to pay another big vet bill then we won’t be able to afford Christmas, very upset bc I know this is all my fault",21Nov2018,1
31,"Not sure if this would be the correct subreddit, but here's a mini rant. Basically, dated a girl for a few months 4 years ago. Huge party girl, and I just wasn't into that life, so I broke up with her. It did end in an argument, but there was no cheating or anything (except she DID kiss another dude), and no big event that culminated in the breakup. Just different personalities, really. Don't hate her, and don't think she's a bad person.

Anyways, she had a roommate during that period who was a close friend. After we broke up, roommate started like a 10 message argument with me over Facebook, which included her KILLER line, ""at least I don't wear shorts in the winter!"" BURNED... or, er, I guess, FROSTBURNED!

So fast forward until present day, and I need to pick her up in an Uber. She didn't recognize me at first, but I greeted her and explained who I was later in the ride (they were rude from the start, before I even recognized her, so was going to one star them no matter what). 

Once she realized who I was, she immediately mentioned to her friends our argument, and how I wear shorts in the winter. She then started to make passive aggressive comments about how I lived with my mom, how I was a dumb delivery driver, and how she's so much better, none of which are true now (I lived with my mom to get in state tuition, but moved out long ago...but guess it's cooler to pay 15k for room and board). Asked me if I was in a relationship, and said something about how I immediately hopped to another girl. 

Plenty of other much worse comments. I should've kicked her out in the cold for being so rude. I was polite the entire time. Didn't insult her, asked her how she was doing, and said I hope all was going well (and meant it) , but she just wanted to insult because of a stupid, minor online argument she started 4 years ago. 

tl;dr Referring back to my thread title, some people just love to hold grudges. Of course, it irked me a bit, but I'll sleep soundly knowing that she'll continue to hold pointless grudges, while I can forgive and restore friendships, which is a much better outlook on life.

33,"I'm about a half hour away from the end of BlackkKlansman, and want to take a moment.

I occupy a weird space. To be sure, unless the person my mother told me she cheated with was mixed or black, and I'm not actually my father's, I'm not actually black. A large proportion of black people in my life have said things like, “You're darker than my dad,” or, “Nah, you ain't white,” or “I'm so confused by your skin,” or “You know you my nigga” alluding to a kind of empathy with “the struggle.” As such, I've always felt a kind of solidarity and awareness that I've certainly occasioned to ignorantly betray. No less, when I go to the symphony, giant white crowds of very comfortable rich people make me uncomfortable in a way “being the only white guy” at a black friend's Thanksgiving does not.

That baseline reality that seems to permeate black culture is precisely what I gravitate towards in storied depictions of that struggle. There's something deeper about the language, the danger, and nature of the consequences in this movie, just like there's brilliant dialogue and entire worlds to chew on in a show like Dear White People. You can't shy away from things and exist as a “real” black person in this country. People *are* out to kill you for dumb-ass reasons and you *are* disproportionately affected by racist policies and a history where you're considered inhuman.

It's that deep hatred that can't be escaped. It's the pride and perpetual insistence of a damning and degrading narrative. As a purely intellectual question, I'm baffled at how anyone could be so sure and so loud about anything, let alone that degree of hatred of someone because of the color of their skin or how they dressed or talked. As a person who's been at the receiving end of someone's sheer irrational hatred and ignorant pride, perhaps that's the kind of desperate and low place real people connect with across differences.

I understand hate. I understand how much work it takes to fuel flames for people or a world that disappoints you at every turn. I understand the stress and headaches. I understand that there will never be enough words or screaming matches to account for how full a heaving chest feels when you want to obliterate the oppressive force, and yet that force never leaves. I've said I've wanted to kill things or certain people. I felt relieved the day Scalia died, naively enough. There is an immense waterfall of hatred spewing from as many corners as you choose to look.

Here's an example. I recently picked up a washer/dryer combo from Coatsville, IN. The guy was nice, a kind of outdoors man's man. We shoved that thing on the hood of my car, I went to pull out the steal of $100 to give to him. He hands $40 back and says he's a Christian, he's just happy to see it gone, and that “I don't mean to sound faggy, but do you mind letting me know you got back home safe?”

What do you call that? Complicated, to say the least. Is this the kind of Bill Maher “house nigga” comment, but for gays? Do I think this guy's disposition would have changed wildly if I got out of my car with a lisp and said I worked in something he considered perverse as opposed to child welfare? He literally gave me a discount on what was already a steal. He put out to a stranger that he cared that I got back safe. Do we call it a deep abiding hatred for gays, or a confused cultural aversion to something he doesn't understand? Do we react by ridiculing and sanctioning?

I understand hate, but I've never been proud of when it hits. I don't brag about the the relationships in my life that have managed to end terribly. I don't routinely work in to conversation how insane my mom is, how shitty the conversations with ex-friends have went, or persistently espouse some level of violence towards all of the people in power I legitimately think are trying to kill me each day. For me, these are incidental feelings of being mashed up with people we barely ever understand or are given an opportunity to work productively with. But then it seems it's one thing to understand your own capacity for hatred, and another entirely to forgive it. And god forbid you practice apologetics.

One thing I persistently worry about is that “impulsive” decision to break something that feels fragile. I want to get it over with. I hate the anticipation of betrayal. I hate the idea of putting yourself out there and believing in something while someone else was just waiting for their opportunity to flip. Hatred pragmatically addresses that to. It preemptively blames people before they get the chance. You get to emote all over the place and proudly profess cathartic rage for all the “others” and “idiots.” This is about as close as I can figure in describing the thinnest of lines between hate and fear.

Fortunately enough, I've spent enough time writing that I don't walk around like a ball of rage anymore. I still pretty fluidly claim to hate things, but not in an obsessive and deeply painful way. All the tragedies of conversation I've neatly packed into blogs or examples. All the dreams stalled or things stolen occupy intricate webs of justification and pithy perspective. My fragile sentimentality is reserved for brief lucidity during infrequent intoxication.

How do you contend with hate? Is it embodied in the all-encompassing abstractions of identity politics and storied victim-histories? Is it individual instances of poor judgment more or less spurned on by a deep abiding racial or sexual hatred? Is it the general lashing against all that makes you afraid and that's hard to understand? A call for peaceful protest or truth and reconciliation isn't to deny these forces or their consequences. Asking for the conversation and the acknowledgment of pain is not an encroachment on freedom or rights. The effort in life should be towards mellowing of that hate impulse. The dialogue should be calling it out for what it is. And people who are actually filled with hate need to be reminded as often as they can that that's what they're full of. That's the face of their “Christian love” or “purity of intention.”

We’ve also rented a room together- now we’re finally getting out on our own. We’re in our 50’s and things most our age take for granted will be much appreciated. We will be building up from nothing.

38,"So I come from a family with a history of alcoholism. My grandpa was a WW2 vet, he drank heavily because of it, my grandma was an alcoholic, and my mom (who recently quit drinking) has always had one too many at dinner. 

I have no restraints. When I drink, I get fucking smashed. I can’t just be at a bar and stop. I get drunk for absolutely no reason, and often at inappropriate times. 

I’m so sick of waking up hungover embarrassed at what I said. I’m so sick of texting friends and apologizing for having to take care of me. Last time I got drunk (granted my best friend died, and I didn’t know how to cope) I got so drunk, I couldn’t find my apartment. I banged on random people’s apartment doors trying to get help at 3 in the morning. 

And I’ve never admitted this, but for my girlfriends 21st, I don’t even remember driving back to her apartment. And this is in a major metropolitan area. I’m lucky to still be alive, and I’m even more lucky that I didn’t hurt anybody innocent. That was a major asshole move of me, and maybe the most selfish thing I’ve ever done in my life. (Feel free to rip me in the comments, I deserve it for that)

I’m done, I can’t be that asshole anymore. I can’t be this embarrassed anymore. I can’t put my life, and other people’s lives in danger because I can’t handle myself. ",21Nov2018,1

41,"My girl, my oldest child, was so good when she was little, but something broke inside of her when she was a teenager.

My husband and I always accepted, loved, and encouraged her. We pushed her to work hard and treat people with respect. I don’t know where exactly we failed her but as a mother I feel responsible for the thing she’s turned into.

It started when she was 14. She had began to become withdrawn and emotional. We chalked it up to teenaged mood swings. For some reason she was just so angsty and bitter all the time. We were worried about her lack of social life and his over-reliance on her computer. She kind of hid herself in the online world so my husband and I began to limit her computer time, but she simply became more aggressive and confrontational.

Her hygiene was bad, and she was always confrontational when we told her to shower or do laundry. Her room stank horribly and we eventually had a huge fight over it where she physically shoved my husband and called him a bastard, and eventually we got her to at least clean and air out her room regularly on the grounds that it was our house and if she couldn’t maintain her space she wouldn’t be entitled to it - essentially we got to the point where we told her she wouldn’t be allowed her worldly possessions or privacy unless she took care of the space we all shared. the room still smelled and she was still rude about cleaning it but we could tell her to get it clean and she would do it after that.

We ended up getting a call from her school saying that a male student felt harassed by her. We were shown messages where she continually badgered him to have sex with her, threatened to “punish” him for stringing her along, sending him unsolicited nudes, telling him some violent fantasies of hers, and eventually just descending into some horrid rage-filled rant about how he is just another “fuckboy” and other things.

We were shocked. We explained to her why this behaviour was unacceptable, and I explained to her that it was ok to be sexually active but her actions were toxic and abusive.

I tried mentoring her woman-to-woman, taking her on spa days and whatnot and talking to her about men and boys and trying to give her advice. I suggested she try showering, changing up her hair and make-up, trying out different fashion styles, maybe going to the gym.

I told her some hard truths - that she doesn’t want a gross man so she shouldn’t be a gross woman. By gross I mean hygiene and looks. I explained to her that good looks are more hygiene and self care than genetics but she refused to accept what I said to her.

After that I caught her sniffing her brother’s boxers in the laundry room - he was 12 at the time and she was 17. She assured me it had nothing to do with her brother, she said she just had a boxer sniffing fetish and she pretended they belonged to boys from porno videos, but still I gave her hell for it, and she was grounded and lost her computer for 6 months. I went through her computer and I was disgusted by the kinds of hateful, racist, femcel forums she frequented, the horrid things she said about men, and her save file was full of cartoon porn with boys of questionable ages. I wiped the hard drive completely and began strictly monitoring her online activity. I used parental filters to block femcel sites and and porn sites that hosted cartoon porn.

The next big issue was something she did to my son’s friend. My son is 5 years her junior, and one day after a sleepover, my son came to me and said his friend wanted to tell me something but was afraid of what I would say.

My daughter cornered this 13 year old boy and physically blocked his path and touched his hair and face while making very inappropriate comments about his body and asking him if he liked to sleep naked and what kind of underwear he wore.

I tore into my daughter for that, my husband and I both shouted at her, and told her her behaviour was horrible and I told her then that if her actions got her arrested I would not defend her. She accused us of not loving her, but I told her the reason I was so passionately angry in that situation is because I do love her, and I want to help her become a good woman so she can stop being so predatory and bitter and miserable. I told her some hard truths. That she did this all to herself and that she is the only one she can blame for how bitter she is.

I suggested she look to men her own age and she went on a rant about how it was a waste of time because men were already trash (and her definition of a trash is a man who has had sex even just once) by 17. I called her out on her bullshit and expressed clearly that if she harassed young boys anymore I would personally turn her in.

I invited my sons friend over after and I personally apologized to him for his experiences, I cried in shame for my daughter’s behaviour and begged his forgiveness for allowing him to feel unsafe in my home and promised him that if he ever felt uncomfortable he could come to my husband and I and we would always believe and help him. Luckily, my son didn’t lose this friend, but for safety I installed a lock on my son’s door.

We got my daughter therapy but she refused to engage with the therapist, calling her a “sand niggress” and “pajeeta” and “terrorist”. Her next therapist was a “Stacy”, so she didn’t relate to that either.

We fought about her not trying, not getting a job, and she said she couldn’t get one because of the immigrants, to which I pointed out that she was struggling because she got fired from her high school jobs for being lazy.

After those fights, my husband tried to empathize with her and understand what made her so bitter but she flipped out at him, and called her a cunt-licking fuckboy and said that he fucked his way through dozens of women until he found a “trophy-wife” who was willing to settle for him and for missionary sex.

My husband, who works and contributes to the family income, who is an independent, professional man.

Honestly, I lost it more than ever before. I had never been so angry when I heard what she said. That may be his dad, she may be my daughter, but the man she was abusively tearing into is my god damn husband. No one can treat my husband like that.

I am ashamed to say in my anger, she shoved me and I physically retaliated, shoving her back, and pinning her against the wall. I felt ashamed of myself, I have never been an angry or violent person, but I couldn’t control myself. I’ve never put my hands on either of my children in such a way in my life, I hate child abusers... but this girl was no child. She was a grown woman.

She was intimidated and backed down, and for a while she was peaceful.

The last straw was this week.

My son has dated 3 people his whole life. A girl, a boy, and now another girl. We were as open about sex with my son as we were with my daughter. We asked if he would like to have a question-free steady supply of condoms left in his bathroom drawer. He said no to the question with his first girlfriend. He never really brought her home but we met her at one of his recitals. When he had a boyfriend he went over to his house all the time, and didn’t want to bring him to the same house his sister lived in, a sentiment I understood.

But his most recent girlfriend has a lot going on behind the scenes in her family. She’s a nice girl but his dad is a single father of 4 and they struggle.

This girl started coming around a month after they got together. I like her. My son is happy with her. She treats him with respect. She is an intelligent girl. She’s an absolute lady. She’s respectful and polite in our home. She calls me Ma'am, calls my husband sir, she offers to help with the cooking or dishes or cleaning while she’s visiting,s he talks to us, she’s a bit of an amateur cook herself and brings us food all the time to say thank you for taking care of him, when we go out for dinner she always offers to pay for herself and my son (though I know she doesn’t have much money so I always pay). When getting out of the car she opens the door for my husband and offers him her hand (She sits behind him for leg room). She holds the doors, when we leave somewhere she helps my son put his jacket on like those sweet old fashioned couples.

This young woman works hard, and gives what little she has to her dad and siblings. Like I said, I really respect the girl. I offered her money once for groceries for her family but she turns me down and says she would feel guilty accepting my money like that. She’s appreciative of things - in the winter, it was -20 and she had only a hoodie, so I draped my jacket over her arms, and I said “take it daughter, it’s cold.” She had tears in her eyes as she said thank you, and I made some excuse about wanting to get rid of the jacket and told her she could keep it if she brought cookies for us next time she visited.

When Christmas came along, I invited her over for supper, and when I went to pick her up I delivered some presents for her family, and on the ride back to my house we had a moment. She was crying because she didn’t have much to give us - she got everyone in our house a present but she cried anyways because she felt it wasn’t enough to make up for what we gave her. I pulled over, and I just hugged her, and I said to her that it wasn’t the value of what she got, it was that she got us anything at all. I thanked her for treating my son so well, and I told her she would always be welcome in my home.

My own daughter didn’t get us anything for christmas, not even a card bought with the money we give her. This girl got my husband and I matching wine glasses since we like to share a bottle every now and then.

My daughter didn’t eat with us. She pillaged the food table and ran away to her room alone while my son’s girlfriend met my brother and his family and my parents and my aunt. They all told me how charming she was and how polite she was. Meanwhile after dinner my daughter told my 5 year old niece “fuck off Lesbo” for asking to play a game with her. A woman over 20 years old.

Last week, my husband and I went out for an evening to ourselves. We went to dinner, then we went to an upscale bar to play some pool, then we went home.

When I walked in the door, the kids were screaming at each other. I came in to see my daughter and my son’s girlfriend fighting. The girlfriend was just pushing my daughter back and trying to redirect her, my daughter was throwing punches and charging her. My son was crying and sitting against the wall clutching his face. I got between them and pushed them apart, and demanded to know what was happening.

My daughter went on a tirade about how she found birth control pills and heard “whore” sounds from his room, so she kicked open his door and discovered them having sex, she said he couldn’t believe her own brother would “be a whitewashed coon” and called the poor girl a cracker and other things.

My husband got my son and his girlfriend out of there and I yelled at my daughter for how she was acting. Eventually I got nowhere with her so I made her wait in her room. I went to talk to my son. I apologized to his girlfriend, crying as I did, telling her that I hope she could forgive me for letting this happen. She said she was sorry for getting violent but that she only did it because my daughter hit her. My son cried and said she was a psycho and threatened to rape him, and that she admitted to squirting on his toothbrush and hair brush.

I charged into her room, and I said firmly that she should pack her bags and leave. I told her I would pay to have her things sent to her, wherever she went, but that she was leaving tomorrow.

My husband stayed at my brothers, and my son and his girlfriend spent the next few nights at her place.

The next day I practically threw my daughter out of the house kicking and screaming.

I took her key back and changed the alarm codes and garage door code. A day later I had a message requesting some of her things - mostly her gaming stuff - be delivered to some strange apartment block I didn’t recognize a couple of towns over. A college aged woman buzzed me in and I delivered the stuff. I didn’t see my daughter.

My husband and I then went through her room. My son’s girlfriend came over and helped me move her furniture to the garage. We threw out her mattress and some other more gross and smelly things, and we took out the carpet to be replaced.

Hidden in the closet was a treasure trove of my son’s underwear, so saturated with old, moldy vaginal fluids and period blood that they were as hard as bricks. The unnerving part was that there were a few pairs my son was adamant didn’t belong to him. And they were too small for my husband. It was possible he stole them from my nephews.

There was a sketchbook containing graphic drawings of my daughter violently raping different men and keeping little boys chained up in some kind of sex dungeon. I went through her old phone that was still working, and all her photos were screenshots of my nephews and their friends in their swimwear, lots of cartoon porn, lots of pink pill and femcel and Hillary memes. She still had messenger, so I checked her messages, most of them were just her trying to harass men and underaged boys.

I checked her Email and... much to my disgust, she stole private photos of my husband from his phone, and she was selling them.

Today, I went to the police with everything and told them everything.

I gave my baby girl everything... I don’t know why she went down this road. But I’m just so sorry I failed her. I don’t know what the police will do... but I hope they stop her before she hurts someone else.

The sad thing is... yesterday, once it was all over and settled, yesterday we had a wonderful day. One of the happiest we have ever had.",21Nov2018,1
42,"Just turned 30.

Wasted a lot of the 20s, but it felt fun back then. I guess it was, don’t remember a lot of it though. 

But, I got into college before 30. Just an associates degree so far, but it’s not nothing. Got a good career going. I got married, love her, bought a house with her. So, entering this new age stable. Set up to do alright. Talking about having kids soon. Making moves toward owning a business that’s mine, not working for someone else.

Good things to look forward to. Nothing to be feeling sad about. 

I have some form of anxiety, started to have anxiety attacks around 25. I live with it, no medicine. Can suck sometimes, but not all the time.

Then, had a minor heart attack more recently, but they couldn’t find the cause.

On medicine for that, help keep the heart calm. I’m supposed to be on the look out for signs of continuing heart problems, but the lingering panic makes it hard to tell the difference. 

Stresses me out, makes the anxiety worse. I have a lot of worry, when I feel even the smallest sensation in my chest, or a numbness in the hands. Anxiety, anxiety, stress.

So. I don’t know. I’m worried about it. Death is frightening.

But. Other times, I don’t think I’d mind if I went out. Might be easier than living like this. Just worried about how she would find me. It gets hard to maintain motivation, or excitement. Or even have it. I sit around not doing much, and I feel tired all the time.

But I have a good life, all considered. Good enough not to feel sad about it.

I felt like this once before, in high school, but I moved, made friends, and it passed at some point. Don’t quite remember, now.

Not quite as simple to up and move this time. But it could still pass.

I feel like I would prefer to build my own coffin. I want to build it soon so that I have it as a reminder. A reminder that my life is short and to make the most out of it. An object to use to help rationalize my understanding of the world.

I want to carve or attach to it things that mean something to other people. Poems or mementos that those I leave behind know that even planning my own vessel into the afterlife involved considering them and my relationship with them.

That being said I think it would freak out my family and possibly be an emotional burden as it sits in the garage over the years.

I've been experiencing insomnia for almost a year now, with very few and dwindling phases of normal sleep.
 I've had insomnia since I was a teen(am 22 now).. But I also had phases where I slept 12-15 hours a night for weeks and then some normal sleep phases so I always thought my sleep was somewhat balanced?

My actual problem is not falling asleep. In fact I fall asleep fairly easy(takes me like an hour max) My problem is that after 1-4 (4 being the absolute maximum) hours I suddenly jerk awake and can't fall back asleep again.

I've tried changing my diet, cutting coffee and any form of caffeine off, tiring myself out.. .. Nothing really helps :|

So i end up being as boring ass person.

Others dont even value me or respect me.

I try to much to make others laugh or i chase others so they value me i dont know how to talk at all. I hate my self.

59,"One year ago, negativity had grown within my head. I had started to lose faith, and mentally feeling to be under the weather. Words are hard to describe how I felt, things came to a point where I had numb feelings, day after day with so much untold feelings or thoughts of mine,and eventually I started forgetting how to feel. World became so dull, so cold and most importantly, so peaceful. I had lost my soul, and interest of living, even so I don't have much things to keep me entertained in this world. Suicide seems to be the answer I seek for the peace I wanted to have. A friend of mine, found out something was wrong with me, came up to me to have a talk. We came to this point where I talked about suicide was the best solution I had, but, I was called selfish. Is that what is it? I was told that I was not concerned enough about people who care about me, and how would they feel if I was died out of a sudden in a Sunday morning? He was partially right. However, talking about selfishness, is that really what is it? Did they concerned about how I felt? Before looking down on me regarding to things I was not good at? Before taking advantages from me? Before judging me for who I am regardless of what I had been through? ""You won't understand"" I added. This made him had ran out of words. so, he sat down and started to listen. and finally, I felt relief after telling him. He was there for me when I needed companion. But, few weeks back then. I received a call from his family about his suicide news. A person who talked me out of suicide had committed it. He had habits of writing diaries. As a friend, I wanted to seek for the truth so I went through his diaries and only to find out he was in a worse situation than mine. I was so self-centered and only care about myself which made me unaware of that. He was there for me when I needed help, but I wasn't, I became the person I once hated. He was right about the selfish things, I never try to be in someone else shoe. He had been through so much at the point where I could not bear, I would collapse if I was him. In his latest pages, he stated that he was sick of his so-so life where there was no any achievement or sense of value in life. You were wrong, my friend. You are my best friend. I was being selfish and so are you. You gave me a new life but you ended up yours. I tell you what, you might think you are worthless, but you are more precious to someone more than you think you are JERK. You are my best friend, my savior. See you on the other side.

64,"Yeah, sure, CHONK, absolute unit, oh lawd he's coming memes are kinda funny.  But every time I see those posts there's a wall of people gushing about how the morbidly obese cat or dog is SOO CUTE. It's disgusting. Nothing about obesity is cute. 

Obese pets have a high risk of getting horrible diseases and dying young. My brother had two cats that are disgustingly huge. They could barely play or jump. One cat, who was only 4 years old, died after from liver disease (fatty liver) and renal failure. His other cat is only 3 and is similarly not in great condition. 
My SIL has two very obese cats and is convinced they just were ""meant to be bigger,"" like that damned ""I'm just big boned"" argument obese people in denial make all the time. 

I don't care if your pet is ""soooo hungry"" and just a ""hungry boy/girl who loves food."" When I adopted my cat he was underweight and starving. He would steal food and was a challenge. I fed him a weight gain diet and then switched to a maintenance diet. I weigh out his daily food every single day, because it's my priority that he has a healthy diet and is a healthy weight so he lives a long life.

What's pissed me off to this whole meme was my SIL told me about this ""awesome"" Facebook CHONKY Cats group she just joined. She says people can share their pets photos and gush over the chonky cats without ""being shamed for it."" Then she proceeded to scroll through photos of sickenly obese cats that she thought were cute.  

It's your responsibility to manage your pet's diet so they can have a healthy, happy and long life. Overfeeding your pet so they become moribly obese is NOT CUTE. You are killing your pet if you do that. It's a form of animal cruelty. 

I want this meme to die. ",21Nov2018,1
65,"So me and my long time SO of 4 years broke up about a year ago. After not talking to them for about 6 month's we bumped into each other at an event for a mutual friend. I was still trying to keep my distance at the time but they were charming, and the time away made my mind forget why I left. 

We started talking and reconnected. At this point I was still weary but I trusted that what they were saying was the truth since we had history. They professed their love to me still and how much they missed me and how much time they wanted to spend with me and for a couple months things were as they used to be. We didn't live together anymore, but we stayed close enough to be together often, and most days they had off we spent together. 

I got more comfortable with them and started fully expressing how I felt. I didn't feel comfortable saying I love you at first (since I didn't want to hurt them anymore than I might have already). But I eventually couldn't help it. It was how I felt again.

But then suddenly they weren't so available to talk. And they were ""tired from work"" and couldn't hangout. This happened after their living situation changed. They originally stayed with 2 other friends I knew very well. And then, for what was supposed to be a short amount of time until they found a new place, they stayed with someone else I didn't know as well. But I trusted them and I'd tell myself to not be so controlling or emotional. And I'd remind myself that they were faithful (at least to my knowledge) in our previous relationship. 

However, something felt very different. Their were nights I couldn't reach them. They'd come back the next day with a  bogus excuse as to why they couldn't talk, and I'd let it slide in an attempt to control what I thought were irrational fears. But late Monday night/early tuesday morning, they were asleep and I couldn't take these nagging suspicions anymore. I needed answers. So I did something I had never ever done in any relationship and I went through their phone. What I found was my worst nightmare. 

I found ""I love you"" texts to someone else. An argument about their ""relationship"". Photos of them kissing. And plenty more evidence that I quickly air dropped to myself. This was also conveniently the person they were staying with. 

When they woke up I confronted them, and they continued to lie which hurt so much more. Eventually I told them I knew everything. I saw everything. And I asked them to leave. I didn't cry. I didn't yell. I didn't take out any anger or frustration on them. I was just so overwhelmed with thoughts that I couldn't say anything. I didn't want to. Because in some sick twisted way, I didn't want to fucking hurt them with what I said.

What do I do now? If I can't trust someone I spent 4 years telling my deepest darkest secrets to, and 3 years living with who can I trust? I pooped in front of them. They knew every embarrassing birth mark. They knew my parents. They went on vacation with me. They insisted they loved me. And for what? Why do people do these things?

It doesn't hurt that they fucked someone else... It hurts that they said ""I love you"" to them.

71,"i used to be a people pleaser. i was a pretty funny, likeable person, but it took a toll on my mind as i would never let myself express my own opinions because i was scared that people would respond negatively. putting a face on every morning and presenting myself with it was just too much. 

then i matured a little and stopped giving a shit about other peoples opinion. i became much happier and true to myself. however, i started to become very careless and *slightly* nihilistic. initially, my goal was to be free from obsessing over thoughts and opinions other than my own, but it went to the point where im disrespectful and ignorant of others' feelings.

today at school, one of my classes was pretty much done so we were just standing around talking, and the teacher (someone that takes my carelessness and unintentional disrespect personally) was talking about types of people she wouldnt want at a thanksgiving dinner. then she mentions my name and says ""i wouldnt ever want to have him at my dinner"" and i responded with ""well i wouldnt want to have u over either so please"". then she later she gives out homemade pies for us and there were two slices left over so she gave one extra to my friend. i make a joke and say ""i work and pay taxes so im entitled to your pie"", making a reference to a part time job i got recently. he lets me take his pie, but the teacher jumped in and said ""if youre entitled to take his pie, then im entitled to tell you to give back his pie and sit down"". i continue to eat his pie (which my friend couldnt care less about since it was an extra), and i take the pie to my seat and sit down. i stare her down while im munching on it and she goes ""your rudeness never ceases to amaze me"" and i honestly had no idea what to say as a response so i continue eating the pie while staring her down.

i know i was rude and disrespectful, and thats not what im trying to be. i want to be careless and free from guilt, but i guess i took too far. 

or maybe some teachers just cant handle dealing with a student who has the circumstances and/or carelessness to talk back in the first place, since she thinks shes the shit after having yes-men for students her whole career",21Nov2018,1
72,"I'm 28 years now. Back in 2003, when I was 12, they'd run this beer commercial on TV with this happy, uplifting song in the background. The ad was about 45 seconds and had these really happy, good looking people bathing in the blue sea, blue sky above, drinking beer from blue cans. When this ad ran, it was a particularly pleasent summer weather-wise. Of course I was too young to drink and thought beer was the nastiest tasting thing in the world. I most definitely did not think about that ad until a decade and a half later.

Fast forward 13 years later and I'm 26 years old. I happen to remember that happy and uplifting song (triggered by another particularly good summer). After much googling, I find it on YouTube. Listening to it, a flood of memories come rushing back to me. It's as if I can smell that summer's air and feel that sun's warmth from so long ago.

I feel the urge to buy this beer. Now it's one of the worst-tasting beer out there, cheap as can be and marginally better than horse piss. Yet, I smile when I drink it as I reminesce about those earlier days.

Two years later, I still buy this beer more than any other due to some weird sense of loyalty and nostalgia. I have spent a couple thousand dollars over the last two years on this beer brand alone.

Recently it hit me how--when done right--ads are powerful and very effective. This brewery got a kid's attention and loyalty, and they're reaping the benefits many, many years later. They may not have gotten me to buy right there and then, but they secured a customer for life many years after.

74,"I don't even know where to begin. 

I've been in a relationship with a great girl for going on 4 years now. Things have been mostly great, but I think she's starting to become depressed as a result of her job, and it's starting to have an effect on me too. We're both gaining weight, not as active as we used to be, we talk less...I could go on. Not end of the world level stuff, but it's frustrating. 

It's even more frustrating to hear her say she's aware of it, and needs to find a new job, but then watch her not take any action. I've offered to help with her resume, find job postings for her to apply for, tried to be supportive, and so on...it just doesn't seem to make a difference. This has been going on for a few months now, at least. I've lost track of time.

To make problems worse, I recently made a new friend. We met through Pokemon go, and have since hung out a few times just to walk around and play the game. I've not done anything I wouldn't do with any strictly platonic friend, although I can't help but feel guilty. I can't even begin to describe why, but spending time with her is a very distinct reminder of when my SO and I first started dating. I don't think she has any feelings for me, but part of me wants her to. I'm almost 30 and I feel like a damn kid with a crush.

Historically, I've always been great at compartmentalizing my personal life and my professional life. I have a stable, successful career. This has started to impact my work life. I'm catching myself drifting off into thought more and more during my days, hurting my productivity.

I know it's not right to spend time or continue a friendship with someone I'm crushing on. Part of me feels like shit for even developing an attraction in the first place. I've been cheated on in the past, and it was devastating. Part of me wonders if this is what it feels like to fall out of love with someone. Part of me has said ""fuck it, I need some chaos in my life for once, let it all burn down"". 

I'm not really looking for advice, but if you have any I'm happy to listen. If you've made it this far, thanks for reading...I felt like getting a few thoughts out would help. Unfortunately I don't think I'm any closer to figuring this one out yet.

78,"Its no secret that for many, holidays can be a real drag. Even with family, people might not get along with all of their family, want to spend time with their friends, or just have no family in general.

I fall into the latter category, for the first time. I'm 24, an only child,  my step father passed last October, my mother is currently in a mental hospital, and my real father is doing missionary work in Nicaragua for his church for years and we've become estranged. 

Growing up I've always had the best Thanksgivings at my grandmothers house, so I'm very thankful for that. But after she died in 2008, my immediate family pretty much drifted into their own little corners and aren't as connected, as what happens in many families when a strong matriarch passes. To make things harder, I moved out of state for a job after college. I don't have any family in the state I currently live in.

I'm just ending the workday in the office and everyone's asking each other their plans, who they're seeing, sharing previous thanksgiving stories, and I just feel absent for the holiday. People know this, and offer their homes for a plate for me, which I am super appreciative of, but honestly seeing their ENTIRE unit of a family together and laughing and I'm just..there, a stranger to many but my co-worker, just doesn't sit right with me and I just know I'll end up having a somber time. Or maybe I won't , but who the hell knows.

I just want my family back. And knowing I will have to live the rest of my life like this, for every holiday now, has torn me up this past hour with everyone talking of the holiday.

83,"Over the past couple years, I've lowered my anxiety significantly.  I'd estimate by about 80%.  It was something that plagued me for pretty much my entire life, ever since I was a kid, and I wanted to write a bit about how I was able to do it, in hopes that it could help other people.  The techniques I'm writing about are not just made up,  [they are possibly the most successful techniques used to treat anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness-based_cognitive_therapy).   The basics are about using mindfulness meditation, and CBT (Cognitive Behavior Therapy).  

The first step I had in combating my anxiety, was to recognize that the fears I had weren't real.  If I had a meeting planned,  I would spend days or weeks ahead of time completely terrified and worried.  When the event actually happened, it would almost always go well, or at least not terribly.  Even when it went terribly, it was usually forgotten fairly quickly.  Being able to recognize that these fears are almost always wrong is extremely important, as it can gradually allow you to forcefully ignore the intrusive thoughts.

One step I did, was to write down your worries with any future moment that makes you anxious.  Then, after the event happens, write down how it went, and if your worries were right.  With anxiety, it was usually a constant stream of worries,  and I never really spent the time to observe whether or not my worries were justified.  Being able to write things down, and forcefully recognize this, is helpful in adjusting your thought process.  Anxiety is not justified, and that is the entire reason it is a problem.  If every anxious thought turned out to be true, then it would be a valid form of self protection.  Being able to recognize these thoughts as false will not immediately remove the anxiety, but will at least allow you to slowly begin the process of analyzing your intrusive thoughts more thoroughly.  Once you recognize that your thoughts aren't always the truth, or for your best interest, it very slowly becomes easier to push them aside.

Mindfulness, is in regards to meditation, but also explains the way to reform your thought process.  Mindfulness is about living in the present moment.  Anxiety typically lives in the future, meaning that you are so preoccupied with what might happen, that is ruins your present moment.  It allows one potentially bad moment to ruin the days or weeks ahead of it.  With mindfulness, it is important to recognize that the present moment is the most important, as it is the moment we have full control over.

Mindfulness meditation is about forcing yourself to live in the present, by recognizing every sensation that you feel.  I would listen to mindfulness meditations on youtube for a while, and then I would just go though it myself.  It is something that I take outside of meditation as well.  When I'm walking around my neighborhood,  I try to stay off autopilot,  and look around.  Try to notice things I normally wouldnt.  Feel the sensation of my body moving.  Forcing your thoughts to exist in the present feels much more peaceful, since the present moment is almost never actually bad.

When you have an anxious thought, instead of allowing it to consume you, at least attempt to examine it, without bias, and wonder why that worry has come into your mind.  Try to think of it logically, and think of past anxieties like this, and how little they affect you now.  Anxiety is not logical, and you likely wont be able to just immediately convince yourself to cancel out these intrusive thoughts, but forcing yourself to put in this effort to question your own thoughts is extremely important.

I recognize that a lot of this may sound like, ""If you're anxious, just stop thinking of anxious things"", but really it is a legitimate process that has helped me immensely.  It is not fast,  but I noticed a slight change fairly quickly when I began to try to forcefully observe and change my thought patterns.  After a while,  I realized these thoughts were false, but still would have fairly intense anxiety.  Then,  the thoughts came much less, but I would still have the physical symptoms of anxiety, even when I was able to manage the intrusive thoughts.  Then slowly, that subsided as well.
I know this is all fairly general, but I wanted to share since it was the process that helped me significantly.  More info on /r/Mindfulness or /r/CBT ",21Nov2018,1

Not taking things for granted can indeed go far, as far as you take it. I don't like this concept too much though.

89,"It’s difficult to express in words the feeling of powerlessness and frustration that comes from moving to a new country. The isolation you feel becomes most apparent when you are sitting having lunch somewhere out, and you overhear people on the street talking and, for the first time in your life, you can’t understand a word from any of the interactions around you. You tell yourself ‘I should learn the language’ ‘I’m being a bad guest in this country, integrating poorly’ but your schedule is full - and your wallet is empty - so you keep your head down and waste the little free time you have on less meaningful things.

One such thing is the interaction you share with your colleagues and the little bubble of expats you will inevitably surround yourself with. You share a language, your studies, maybe perhaps a hobby but at the end of the day you will never build a real bond with them. 

I feel now more than ever that I will never create a real bond with anyone again, not like before. I shared my life with someone so important, so necessary to my understanding of who I am and what I want to be as a man, and threw it away so carelessly. I try to keep my head down, but the waves come like tsunamis, knocking me off my feet and into a dark place.
It takes so little now to make me shut down. My bicycle stolen, my bed collapsing, onions burned, dropping a pen. I close off to the world. I cry uncontrollably. It doesn't stop or get better.

This time alone has seen me unpicking my reasoning on why this was a good idea, why I left her. Every occasion I found a new flaw, until it became clear to me that this, like many other of the disputes we had had, was down to my own poor mental health. 
This was something that I had neglected for so long, for so long I had been able to justify our arguments on her difficulties but in truth I was the reason for all of it. My own insecurities and paranoia, my own inability to address serious issues. Just like my father I took to running away early. And away I ran across the sea and took it as an opportunity to end something that should never have ended. 

We shared a life together and I made a huge mistake. I have hurt her more than can ever be expressed in words, and the pain of knowing that is overwhelming. Few days go by when I am not consumed with guilt for the lack of respect that I treated her with. I am not somebody who regrets things, and I often lean into the choices I make but god I wish I could undo this so badly. I've burned the bridge without ever meaning to, I just hid when I shouldn't have. I broke up with her on a hair trigger from anxiety with a heavy work load starting and not knowing how to deal with the argument we were having, which she had been so patient with until then. Before I could do anything about it all immediate channels of communication were closed. All of this was my fault.

We exchanged some emails, I tried to justify myself but I was lying to myself and lying to her. Mental gymnastics I was playing in order to make it right. I have since written letters, never sent, trying to apologise for everything but now I daren't. It's selfish, she's moving on and so she should. After what I did I don't deserve a second thought or a moments consideration. It's all too little, too late. 

I wish I could turn back time and speak our love-language again and hold her in my arms. I wish I could see the world like I did with her once more.

94,"But in all honesty, it doesn’t really bother me. 
I don’t really have any emotional connection to any family, and no desire to really spend time with them - not sure if that’s normal, or common. 

My family are just shit people. 

Plus, I get paid time and a half. 
But thank you to the old ladies that feel bad and comfort me lol that makes up for everything. ",21Nov2018,1
