Drinking just one cup of coffee doesn't just improve my mood and energy for the duration of the caffeine, it also fundamentally restructures my mindset to be more positive for the rest of the day without even needing another cup. The best part is it works 100% of the time, I could literally wake up crying and begging for something to put me out of my misery permanently, but as soon as I have just 1 cup its like I'm a completely different person.

7,"Just a thought I want to better organize by writing it down.

Racism lets people create ""the others"". The others are different, scary, and wrong. 

Exploitation wants to take and not give. However, it needs to justify what it's doing. So it leverages otherness and racism. Tells stories about how the people being exploited are not really people. Or maybe they are people, but they're bad people who don't deserve whatever it is they have.

Exploitation creates systems to further its goals. Company towns. Colonies. Churches and tithing systems. Monopolies. Puppet governments. Etc.

Racism creates a safe space for exploitation, and exploiters promote racism. 

Lastly, evil. Which is shorthand for that other dark triad. Evil is people who like to hurt other people. Who like to have power over others and who like to exercise that power. Evil doesn't particularly care about race or if there's profit to be made. But evil is definitely looking out for where it can get away with what it wants to do.

Evil loves the interaction between exploitation and racism. Evil gets hired by the exploiter and gets excused by the racists. Evil uses the willful blindness of racists and the uncaringness of exploiters to do what it really wants to do. Be that murder, or rape, or torture, or mental domination. 

Exploitation decides that slave labor is a great way to make a lot of money. Racism lets people justify slavery. Evil rapes slaves and then enslaves its own children. Exploitation creates a political party. Racism lets that party rise to power by hating the other. Exploitation decides to steal everything the other owns. Racism lets it happen. Evil builds gas chambers.",30Mar2018,3

I went from having an amazing relationship at school and doing well there to losing a longtime best friend and failing a whole semester. I hit rock bottom and definitely had some kind of mental troubles as a result of all this. 

Over summer time with family and friends and working on myself made me get my confidence back and eager to do well this year. Now back at uni I’ve just started talking with someone new which I’m really excited about. I also know that if things don’t go my way with it that I’ll probably take another hit to my mental health. 

I don’t know if I should feel worried about the possibility of things going south for me again but I’m mostly excited about these new possibilities.

12,"I had posted before about this https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/7thoa3/i_really_like_this_guy_but_im_sure_i_messed_it_up/. 

And well things ended terribly between us. I unfortunately fell in love, an emotion I hadnt felt in years. I didnt tell him, but I fell hard for him.

Anyways, he said he only wanted sex and that he wasnt ready for a relationship blah blah blah. 
So I was like thats alright, but I wanted to be friends at the very least. I mean I liked him so much, I couldnt be ok with never seeing him again. He said I was too much, which I found bonkers I wouldnt over text him, I respected his time and, it made me so upset because he cried over like 4 different things in the span of knowing him, and none of them towards me, it was just like this intense sadness he has. 

Anyway he just wanted nothing to do with me. Which of course broke my heart and now i feel just so sad. 

So a little more backstory. On our second date, we were cuddling and he told me he doesnt do long distant relationships, i was like ""uh yea I guess, its good we arent long distance"" its about 30 minute drive between us, but I didnt mind driving down everytime. But he said it was still far, and so i asked if that meant he didnt want to continue seeing me, I mean I dont want to waste my time. So he called me Paranoid, and I was kinda taken back by it? I didnt see my question as paranoid, but he cried. He cried that he doesnt talk much because he says things like that. I told him its alright to talk. Hes cried like two more times after about varying reasons. 

ANY WAYS, fast forward to my last post, I didnt give the ultimatum, but he said he only wanted sex and didnt think he could do a relationship, and I said well thats the point of dating to see if people work together and if it doesnt it doesnt, but thats ok. He then said hes romantically interested in me, but doesnt want to date, which was driving me up the wall. 

On snapchat I had uploaded a snap of a song I was listening to, and it happend to be a song that both he and I really liked, so I had uploaded it twice in the background of me doing things. Once from when we first met and once after this incident, and both times it was just because well, I like the song a lot. When I uploaded the snap, it was because I liked the song so of course I would be doing things to the song, and I have uploaded different snaps with different song before. But he told me I had uploaded those snaps with our favorite song in the background to manipulate him into talking with me. Which I was so hurt. To view me in that way, as something so low, was heartbreaking, i told him he must truely hate me for him to think I would do that to him, I only ever cared about him. He didnt believe me. And honestly it caught me by such surprise because that thought never crossed my head, I just like the song. 

So I had an episode of depression due to other reasons and was put into a psychiatric hospital. I have terrible depression, but I dont take it out on others, I keep to myself and get the help to try and fix it. I told him about it, and not to sound too sad, but he was one of like 3 friends I have so I wanted to talk about it, but im sure he thinks it was just a lie to see him, which hurts. 

So I saw him, it was fine and then it got said because we hugged an he said it couldnt work, he cried etc. Just like really opening up that wound for me, I didnt know what to do. I honest to god thought the best thing to do would be to kiss him, I told him that no matter what, no matter how low you feel, I will always be there for him and hold his hand to better health, as a support for him. He said he liked it and kissed me again before he left.

THEN He messaged me saying how could I kiss him when he was in a vulnerable state and that he cant be with me as Im in the way to him working to his goals. I felt like utter shit, I didnt mean to take advantage of him or anything like that, it was an honest strong feeling of love and want to help him was my reason. I apologized but still couldnt help but feel so bad after him talking to me like i was some sort of disgusting obstacle in his life. I only ever thought about him and his feelings, except for that kiss. I just didnt want to lose him in my life, I wanted his friendship even if he didnt love me. 

But he just dislikes me now, like truly hates me. And I feel just so sad all the time. I opened my heart up and this happened. I dont make friends or try to actively date because i dont like this feeling of utter despair. I just feel like crying all the time. Theres nothing I can do, I have to respect his wishes, but it doesnt help with my heart break.

I just want some nice words, or someone to tell me im wrong for something or im an idiot for feeling like this. Im so confused about it all, and I couldnt do anything to fix it. ",30Mar2018,2

19,"Warning: This turned out to be just a massive rant in which I share an unnecessary level of detail. Not even the juicy, gossipy kind.

I hate this. I just stepped on a scale for the first time in awhile. 112 kilograms, or 246 fucking pounds. Just a few months ago, I stepped on it and saw 108 kg (238 lb) and decided I needed to lose some weight.

Fuck.

I had to weigh myself tonight because my sleep apnea is robbing me of sleep, and having a sore throat ain't helping things. Losing weight will not be fun. It was fairly easy when I lived in Korea, when the money my wife and I made was enough to make healthy food the base (but not full extent) of our diet; when my work schedule was very compatible with intermittent fasting; when we would walk to and from work, taking the long way home for a total of about 45 minutes of walking per day, not including the movement we had as teachers walking to and from various classrooms; when our evenings were free, and we could do anything, go anywhere, because work ended at 4:30, and it was truly ended.

Now I'm a PhD student back in the States. Junk food is so much more readily available. (Okay, Korea has lots of junk food, but the scale of everything here, including food, is just unbelievably huge.) We live on my meager stipend and her meager wages. We try to eat healthy but we also eat cheap. We're not dirt poor, but we balance a few good meals with less nutritionally sound offerings. And we enjoy so many foods we didn't have easy access to in Korea (though I do miss some good ole Korean food sometimes). And all of my work—fucking *all* of it—involves a shit ton of sitting down. I'm not very fast at it either, so I rarely feel I can spare time to gather a bag of stuff, walk all the way to the rec center, change into exercise attire, get in a workout, shower, get dressed back into my day clothes, and head back to the office. Some days I read, grade, lesson plan, or do other homework (except occasional trips to the library, this means ""shit done while sitting down"") until 10 or 11 at night and still feel I haven't gotten enough done.

I had prior success losing a lot of weight by moderate exercise but mostly through intermittent fasting, but not having time (or not feeling like I have enough time) for any consistent exercise doesn't help even if I can maintain intermittent fasting. Which is proving much more difficult with my schedule and circumstances than it was in Korea.

Something has to change. I need to lose about 40-45 pounds to get to where I want to be, and at least 20-25 pounds to get rid of my apnea. (My wife knows when it's a problem because she can hear it. When my weight dips below about 103 kg, or about 227 lb, I apparently sleep without problems. But until then she'll hear my strange, scary breathing if she wakes up in the middle of the night. Tonight, it was bad enough, coupled with the sore throat—which might be partially attributed to the apnea—to wake me and keep me awake.)

Motherfucker.

I might have to start walking to campus. Or home from. (My wife works nearby and usually drops me off on her way to work and picks me up when I'm done with classes for the day, so I could choose just one of the two trips). It's just a six-minute drive, but it's 45 minutes to walk. Rainy days, hot and humid days in spring and late summer, cold and windy days in the winter (damn is it fucking windy here!) would be terrible.

But something has to change. My belt is strained to the first notch. I'm not sleeping well. This is not how I want to be.

No my be do this, fuck shitty fuck fuck.

So what happened, it turns out that all this treadmill running has been completely pointless.  At least to the extent that I have not improved at running.  

Treadmills pull your feet back and what you are doing is keeping up with the belt.  You are not really using any leg muscles since you are not moving yourself forward.

College freshman geek here.

I did something incredibly embarrassing last week that I will never live down.

Myself and my 2 stupid friends had this idea to ""ruin"" his 22 year old sister's big party by streaking through it.

Naked.

We are 3 calculus major geeks. 

During her party, being held outside in their large backyard, we finally decided to pull the trigger.

I was nervous as can be. I never even take my shirt off at the beach, but I figured, hey, it's 3 guys, nobody will focus in on me.

I stripped down as fast can be, like ""ripping off a bandaid"", blushing when I removed my boxers and threw them across the room, standing in the air with my bare butt and bare penis feeling exposed as ever. It took everything I could to fight the urge not to cover my shame with my hands, but I just let it all hang out, acting like I wasn't mortified to have my bare body exposed. Even though I sort of instantly regretted agreeing to this. But I couldn't back out now.

The worst part was standing there, butt-ass naked, waiting on my friends to much slower remove their clothes as I stood there timidly switching from foot to foot.

I could tell my friends were nervous too. Once stripped to his birthday suit, Jason subtly covered his penis with one hand. Maybe it was even subconscious. James kept his back to us at all times, as comical as it was to see him continuously talking like he was our leader with his shaking big, round bare white ass facing us whenever he moved an inch.

Wearing nothing but the glasses and a pink blush on my face, I took a deep breath, following the two bare butts in front of me, and ran out of my friend's room.

We all ran out of his room upstairs, down the stairs and out the sliding backdoor into his backyard with nothing on.

""WOOOOO!!!"" hands in the air.

All 3 of us about 5'7, all 3 slightly chubby, lily-white from the neck down, running with our hands up through the yard.

We expected his sister's friends to whoop it up and cheer us on as the heroes of the party, and his sister getting so mad that we stole all her attention. Screaming at us to get out as the crowd cheered us on.

Instead, to our surprise, as we ran past the 2 dozen or so girls...they laughed...AT us. They laughed so hard and pointed at us.

Once we ran through past everyone and got to the other end of the yard, one of her friends yelled out:

""We got 3 naked virgins, are we having a sacrifice or something tonight?""

That led to the laughter hitting an UPROAR.

We all panicked and went from confident streakers to vulnerable, exposed geeks covering our penises and balls with our hands and ran towards the backdoor to desperately get back in the house, to greater laughter.

It was as if somehow at that moment it dawned on us: ""Holy shit. We are fucking naked surrounded by women laughing at us.""

We desperately ran across the yard back towards the house.

We heard more comments from her hot girlfriends.

""Did you see those little weenies, they are so cute!""

""Oh my God those adorable white round bubble butts on all 3!""

""Nice freshman 15 bellies, boys, skip the gym this semester???""

To my horror, one said ""Hey virgin boy, let me be the first girl ever to TAP DAT ASS!"" and smacked my white butt HARD as I yelped and ran faster.

Then they broke out cell phone cameras.

His sister of course used that opportunity to run inside and lock us out of the house and give us a smile like the cat who ate the canary.

After a few minutes of banging on the glass and apologizing, begging to be let back inside, our bare asses jiggling to the cheering delight of the girls, we realized we weren't getting back inside, and had to actually leave the yard and run to our other friend's house around the block, at 8:00 pm in 40 degree brisk weather.

It was a humiliating retreat, buck naked and defeated.

I can't think of it at night without tossing and turning.

Adverts are just trying to sell you shit you don't want, to make you feel like you need it and that often comes from preying on your emotions, if that was a relationship it would be an unhealthy one.
Never mind gambling adverts which are just essentially promoting addiction.

I try to ignore the obvious negative features of life but I can't.
I can't see the point in anything, I mean I'm not happy, I've no meaningful relationships, I've no desire to do anything, but not because of some chemical imbalance, I just don't see the good in anything, it's not like I'm looking for it either.

I'm 20, 5'7 and going bald, I'm in a degree I can't change and don't like, failing, and everything I try to do snags me like a rusty nail.

I go to get a haircut to try and work around the balding, it's not just a blob of hair around my fringe and too short everywhere else.
That's just before a 21st I've been pushing myself to go to because I need to get out there a bit more.

I've no connection or contact to any girls, last year I had no issues, but when I'm not fuck drunk and living with first years I'm not so smooth.

My parents see me as a waster, someone who had so much potential and just fucked it, royally fucked it.

I try to go abroad and work as a lifeguard for the summer, really push myself to do something productive, but I fail 2 exams which I'll have to repeat during the summer and I subsequently loose the €280 put towards my summer.

Why bother?
Honestly because I can't see reason to.
I just know it's not normal to feel like this, but I've talked to my doctor, I've gone to a psych, and bar telling me I'm interesting it amounts to nothing, so I go home to my parents prying at what the doctor said while I'm still without reason to go on.",30Mar2018,2
