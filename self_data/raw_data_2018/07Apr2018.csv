0,"Reddit I'm at my wits end. I went through the horrible loss at the end of last year and family member going to jail. I ground my teeth so bad I've lost half the bone in my mouth. I had issues before with my mouth but now it's beyond repair. It's horrible to eat and to talk and to do pretty much anything as I can't quit focusing on it. I've tried therapy, meds, went to countless periodontist and no one can help. My husband and I even went to an oral Maxio facial  surgeon. I can't stop feeling the teeth which feel half out of my head, and fighting the urge to pull them 24 hours a day. I finally have the job and home of my dreams but I can't get past this. I'm looking for hope. Is there a miracle I've overlooked, I can't take this any longer. I feel like my life is a horror film, please tell me what I can do. ",07Apr2018,1

3,"Apologies in advance for any mistakes in this post. I get flustered thinking about this girl and it causes me to be... stupid.

So I met this girl at work during Christmas of last year. By pure chance. She works for a company that has contracted the company I work for to help them out with their daily operations. When we first met we hit it off as if we where long time friends. Considering by the time I met her I've been working with the contracted company for a couple weeks, she was the first person I instantly had a connection with since I started working and we would constantly talk to each other during the shift and play a bit with one another in between down time... I enjoyed it. Like a lot. 

Normally I don't like people right off the bat but holy crap this girl put on the charm and I felt like I was walking on Sun shine all day! Once the shift was nearing it's end we said our goodbyes and we wished to see each other again (I work mornings while she works mid) if possible. A couple months go by and I see her every now and then. It's always a good time seeing her. But it only last a few minutes at a time since we are in a ""go go go"" work environment. Usually it's a hello and a... Well I know it as a Spanish greeting kiss. Ya know those types of kisses when 2 people meet and kiss each other's cheek with an air kiss? But oddly enough she does a loud kissing noise and an audible ""mwah"" when she does it. I don't think much about it then but I do now... Now with reason but more on that later. Talk for a few minutes and we say we liked to meet each other again when possible. About the 4th or 5th encounter I had an ""aww fuck me"" thought: I like this girl. Now to find out if she can give me any signs of her liking me back.

Fuck me man... I thought I swore away woman and I have accepted that I am no one of worth and will probably die alone at that. But the more I meet up with this girl the more my heart races and I can't form proper sentences. A little known fact about me: if I'm excited I tend to speak very fast. People think I'm Cuban because of that. Why people think that I have no idea but if anyone knows please let me know.

But back to this girl. When we would meet up it's nothing but good times. No matter how short the interaction was. Soon enough I caught myself checking her out and my fucking ears turned red like beets! Admitly I love what I see and another little known fact: I tend to bite my lower lip when I enjoy looking at something or someone. 

Around the 8th encounter I step my moves up and ask for her number. Rejected. I die a little inside. She asked if I have a Facebook or Instagram. Yes for Facebook but no to Instagram. Scored me her Facebook. I've deactivated my account since that data breach though. So no more Facebook for me. A week after New Years has passed she grabbed my arm out of nowhere when I'm walking and I'm a bit taken back by it at the time. Mainly because I didn't know who it was and it caught me off guard. It's her. I give her a bear hug and tell her good morning and she giggles. Don't think much about it at the time before but that's when I started to truly notice that she giggles when I hug her.

A great while passes and I see her again. Same interactions as previously mentioned but I ask her out for drinks after work. She tells me she's pulling a double. I say ""oh"" and forget about my intentions. Sad as shit but hey I understand. Day goes by and that's that.  Shoulda said more than ""oh"" and I'm still kicking myself over that. 

Saw her a few days ago and like usual the same interaction. But this time I noticed her checking me out from the corner of my eyes and she's smiling. For a brief moment I don't think too much about it as I'm tired as hell from working all day but then something snaps in me... is this my green light to pursue this girl? I place this back in my head for the time being and go about my work. Only reason I noticed her checking me out is because one of her coworkers was eyeing me up in the morning and it made me paranoid. I thought my zipper was open when her coworker was eyeing me up lol.

But with this girl? Nah my dudes I knew my zipper wasn't open and she had her eyes on me what felt like years. The smile? OMG I got a semi from that. The combination her scanning me and smiling? My heart nearly exploded with happiness and a bit of confusion and my ears turned bright red. And my lips? Biting lower lip. But like a deer in the headlights I froze up. I haven't received this much attention from someone in a long time so I tried to play stupid and pretend I didn't see any of that. I think she knew I knew she was looking at me because after that I couldn't look at her because if I did I honestly think my soul with pop out from this body.

I wonder... would her checking me out be the indicator I needed to confirm that she's into me? Or was it something else? I don't want to fuck this up because as we stand together I'm enjoying the hell out of our interactions with one another and I don't wanna destroy that. But if there is more to this... I need to jump on it.

What do y'all think?

TLDR: MY DUDES I GOT A CRUSH ON THIS BEAUTIFUL GIRL I BEFRIENDED AT WORK AND I'M CONFUSED AS HELL AS HOW I SHOULD PROCEED! MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE SOMETHING HERE.

i have recently made passes at several women because i noticed i check them out in public far more than men.  that hasn’t gotten me anywhere either. perhaps i am hitting on exclusive straight women.  


i was feeling sad that this part of my life is over.  but then as i was stoned i had an epiphany and binge-bought several toys online. 

ima try effing myself. and a friend suggested a cuddle group as a goal to make.  

anyone else vow to treat their body with utmost respect and pleasure?  

i feel good about this pledge to myself. stop sleeping with people i don’t respect or admire.... stop wasting time trying to manipulative people into sleeping with me.

Today was a hard day, not as far as pain goes, but mentally, emotionally. It's not easy to see your entire face structure change in a matter of hours. And personally, I am definitely involved in my own self-image. I suffer from poor self-confidence and I struggle with my appearance and today... today was hard. 

The past few days, I spent very little time outside of my home. I went to the pharmacy and to the Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market for a few things. But, tomorrow is my youngest daughter's birthday party and I need decorations and cake and ice cream. 

a little background here, I practically live at Wal-Mart. I am there nearly every day and sometimes more than once a day. My five-year-old daughter is strangers with no one and aspires to be a police officer when she grows up. (Proud Mommy right here). She talks to the officer on duty every time we come and many of the employees know her by name. 

I considered driving the extra ten minutes to the next closest Wal-Mart, but I chose not to. I could feel my anxiety kick in when we pulled in and September, my daughter, and I stayed in the car a few minutes and listened to a few of her favorite songs while I calmed myself. We walked in and I smiled, but not too hard, so that it did not look unnatural. We made our way to the bakery to pick out a cake. My speech is still struggled due to this foreign object in my mouth and the pain, so I am a little rough to understand sometimes. 

As we approach the bakery, there is a familiar face behind the counter, and I smile. She says ""it's been a while,"" and smiles back and then bends down to September and says, ""Hello, beautiful, would you like a cookie?"" After she comes back with September's cookie, I tell her that I have been at home resting after my dental work. She says, ""oh no, dental work, but your teeth are so pretty!"" I smiled, and said, ""they are now."" I told her that I got dentures. We talk for a few minutes and she tells me that her teeth are getting bad and I encourage her that she should go to the dentist before it is too late. 

We pick out our cake and make our way to the party decorations. As I am walking through the store I feel as though eyes are on me. Every time I look at someone, it seems like their eyes are solely focused on my mouth. I can feel myself panicking, so I focus my attention on September and we discuss what kinds of party decorations we think her little sister would enjoy the most and the colors of balloons and ribbons. I look up again, and more people are staring at me... I try to calm myself so that I do not have an anxiety attack in the middle of Wal-Mart. I have done this before, and it is absolutely NO FUN. All that I can think is that my face is so swollen, they know I have fake teeth, all it is going to take is one bully, just one person to laugh at me. Call me names... I felt so... vulnerable. I felt like, maybe my teeth were poking out due to the swelling and I felt like a horse. I have not had this many (the normal amount) of teeth in my mouth in so fucking long. And each familiar face, I explained my absence all over again. 

So, I definitely did not have an anxiety attack in the middle of Wal-Mart, I did however stress myself into starting my period over a week early in the middle of Wal-Mart. And all i can think is tthank goodness that I didn't wear the white pants that I put on and then changed my mind about before throwing on dark denim skinny jeans. 

So, when we got home I put away the ice cream, went into my room and proceeded to cry. Then I put myself together and touched up my makeup and opened up Snap. I am a regular snapper and have taken a two-week hiatus. I usually post lip-syncing videos in my car, selfies, and silly pictures and videos with my kiddos. So, I hopped into my car, put on a song, and took a short video and put ""Still swollen, but aint they pretty doe."" The response from my friends was heart-warming. 

Not all of my friends know the struggle that I have had with my teeth and very few have seen the worst of the issues. My closest friend knew that I was going to be getting the procedure done, but did not know when. She is an absolutely beautiful soul and she said things that made me cry, but this time in a good way. 

I wasn't going to post this evening and make up some bullshit story like I didn't feel well, or maybe I was too busy. I don't know why I felt the need to lie to complete strangers.

19,"(Expecting downvotes)

Probably a flawed/unpopular opinion but I somehow cant feel empathy towards people who lost a loved one. I mean it's not like it's the end of the world just because you lost your mom/dad, right? I really dislike it when people use tragedies as a reason for being extremely gloomy or plain negative. Maybe because I haven't lost anyone close to me that's why I cant feel empathy.

But in all honesty, I dont really feel like I know my own family that well. My parents are more of caretakers than anything. They dont know much of my interests and stuff. In fact, we wouldnt have gotten to know each other if we weren't blood related (even if we lived in the same neighbourhood). I'd probably be shocked about it but not that upset.

My brother even berated me once for not feeling upset when someone died, saying it's wrong not to feel empathy. But thing is, if I'm not actively doing harm to others, whats the big deal? I dont see why having a feeling (or the lack of it) is wrong. I mean emotions can be right or wrong now?

Sometimes I dont get how people can feel upset over the death of someone they barely know. I know a friend who was so upset over a relative dying but he rarely spends time with him tbh. I'd feel more upset over a good friend dying than a relative that barely says anything to me.

Summary: Family is an overrated concept. People shouldnt be too upset when a blood relative dies. Chances are you can easily find someone else with same/similar interests. Sometimes I wonder if people are truly sad when a sibling dies or they just feel sad because it's a societal norm to do so.",07Apr2018,2

I didn't love her, but I was sad. You know how it feels, I can't explain it that well.

Few months later I met another girl. I fell in love with her, and we were in a seemingly happy relationship. Fast forward 6 months later, she turned out to be a manipulative drug user. We broke up, she moved out the town. I was happy I didn't have to see her. 

January, 2018. I met a girl. She's perfect. I love her. I love her more than anything and anyone, but I know I'm nothing more than just a friend. And guess who got in the way? Z.

Dropped out of school in 10th grade, got mad at the world for not ""being fair"" with her. Granted, she's had a pretty tough life. Money was scarce, mom wasn't there for her, dad was a drunkard. 

We were pretty good friends once. Convinced her to get a job, maybe start putting money away for college, or at least _some_ level of education.

I was acting like a dick anyway, wow, what a surprise that no one wanted me around. It’s so incredibly tragic that I blew off my mother for seeing me, causing her to leave. What a shame that I had to walk home in my socks because I told everyone I didn’t need a ride after acting like I was owed something the entire night. It’s really fucking incredible that I don’t have any friends, isn’t it?

I really do want to change. It’s not fair to subject everyone in my life to my dickish behaviour because I want to feel “special” or interesting. But holy shit is it hard to change this mindset. I don’t know what to do but I know I can’t stand to be myself anymore. ",07Apr2018,6
37,"Sorry for appearing here again, but things are getting hard to handle.
I have a group of friends that I like hanging out with, but I have a feeling that everyone is making fun of me. I don't know if this is true or not, but it's not a nice feeling.
Also, I feel like I can't talk to anyone about my problems, and recently I have a few of them...

38,"From the time I parked to the time I was back in my car was just shy of 13 minutes, and I'm rather impressed.  Might have saved another minute if I didn't run into this complete card gridlock where not a single person knew what to do to undo the gridlock.  

My trick was only needing to get two things: toilet paper and hamburger meat.  And not using a cart.  I was able to whip through all the madness pretty quickly without it.  

Not the most exciting thing, I know, but still it was pretty impressive to me at least.  ",07Apr2018,11
40,"I am 21 and I am overwhelmed by my interests and my self doubt. I enjoy poetry, philosophy, film making, writing, reading, pedagogy, psychology, artificial intelligence and music. All of which I would love to be studying. And thats the root of my insecurity. I am starting studying next semester, but I am still unsure of what. It feels like there's so much I should be doing that I don't know what to focus on. I want to do good, but I dont know where and I dont know how. All the while something inside of me is saying ""Who do you think you are? Do you think you're better than everyone else? You are just being pretentious"". 

I have so much energy, but don't know what to do with it. I am afraid its going to turn to nothing and that my mind will be dulled down.

I just wish my future self could tell me ""Hey man, you're doing great and your mind wont be dulled down before you're way old. Stop worrying. Keep working and I'll see you at the top."" 

Hey future self, I am doing this for you

41,"She’s smart, funny, absolutely adorable, checks all my boxes. I’ve been thinking about her every day since meeting her! Well, I haven’t had sex in 6 months so I was very excited when on our third date she said she wanted to come back to my place. She didn’t even let me kiss her on our first! Told me she wanted to take things slow. We went out, played games at an arcade bar, ate tacos, then went back to my place to drink beers in the backyard and listen to music under the full moon.

She expressed that she was nervous to stay the night with me and I told her we didn’t have to have sex, we could just cuddle. She insisted teasingly that I drink a lot so that I couldn’t have sex with her even if I wanted to (I had confessed I get whiskey dick really easily). So, we’re snuggling later in my bed watching Arrested Development, and I’m happy just to be close to her and have a girl in my bed, and then she starts making out with me and tells me she wants me to be inside her! We were both drunk, and I was much more drunk than her, but it had been so long and I’ve been doing the no-fap thing, taking supplements, and whadyaknow, no ED this time around! I was so excited and drunk, and she was so sexy, in the heat of it all I forgot to use a condom. I’ve never done that before! Not that I was worried about STDs since she seemed really conservative and cautious, and it’s been so long for me and I’ve been tested since the last time I’ve had sex.

I bought her Plan B the next day and things seemed okay, we’ve been flirting and texting more than ever, but today she tells me she has a bacterial infection!! Is it possible that I’ve had an STD for six months that the test didn’t find, and had no symptoms?? And she sounded kinda angrier than before about me not using a condom. I don’t want to blame her because I like her so much, but she was the one who was pushing me to get drunk and she didn’t complain the night we had sex... I feel terrible though, I’ve been waiting so long for a girl like this and to have sex again and I fucked it all up on our first night. I don’t even remember the sex all that well since I was so drunk.

I’m going to get tested again on Monday and see if i really do have something. The lesson I’m taking from this is: don’t assume being drunk will prevent you from having sex, and don’t have unprotected sex just because you think you’re both clean. I should’ve had this drilled into my head years ago. I sound like a fucking teenager. Damn, life is never easy.",07Apr2018,1
42,"The feeling of hopelessness set in the moment I became conscious of what they meant when they defined privileged. I was taught during my sophomore year in college what institutionalized racism is, I just never understood what it really meant. I am 30 now, a veteran whom served honorable for 4 years with the Marine Corps. I have also obtained my Degree from an accredited university, were i have learned how to analyze quantitative and qualitative information. I am currently pursuing a para-professional training diploma, yet, I have not had a single interview for almost 2 years now. That said, I may not be the best candidate, but comparatively, the person working these current positions aren't the brightest either. So what am i getting at? Maybe the state in which I live; practices what they defined as institutionalized racism, were for example: you are white and male, one of your dads friend is a director at a well known company, and you, a 22 fresh out of no where needed a job, and got that job that pays you a decent salary because of your father: that notion of what they call, ""NETWORKING."" Fortunately for me, my father is a janitor, my network is comprised of the lower class. 

Just in case you have come up with this idea, ""working hard and earning it,"" this a phrase is, SHIT. Society does not find an asian male suitable for management, or if not that, a position that pays fairly, mainly because it does not fit the narrative of manager or high paying job. Google ""manager"" and look at the pictures that appear."" (Mind blowing isn't it). Also, in case we have thought of the career path of an, Accountant, (because we're good at math), I have learned that too; how to create balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements, but it doesn't matter, because the guy I'll probably work for is that of the former: white kid that got hired through is dad on the non-merit assumption. That said, I have come to rationalize that this life is not worth living because there is no opportunity for me to live and strive. No love life because asian men are not desirable (women are racist). No pursuit of happiness, that clause was meant for those who have the same complexion as the founding fathers.
 Rationalizing to opt out of this life.  ",07Apr2018,1
44,"So one of my boyfriend’s all time favorite animals is a grizzly bear.

This year for his birthday, I’d like to surprise him with the chance to play/pet/feed a bear cub. However, I’ve only found places in the west coast of the US where you could do something like that. We live in Pennsylvania.

Does anyone know of a place that allows people to (safely) play with a bear cub on the east coast? It would be epic if it was a baby grizzly bear but at this point I’m okay with any bear.

Thanks.",07Apr2018,0
45,I have really bad acne and I’ve been moisturizing my face every other day (because every day makes it worse) and I wash it with acne pads. Those help it but it’s still really bad and I wanted to know how to get rid of it and the scars it’s left,07Apr2018,1
