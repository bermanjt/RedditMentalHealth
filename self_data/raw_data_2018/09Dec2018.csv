0,"Hi all,

I'd like to share my thoughts. I've decided to end my life as soon as I'm done with this quarter of grad school. 

Background: I'm a master's student taking three classes and working as a waitress at a busy restaurant. I have depression and anxiety, and I have been taking antidepressant for a decade. I'm currently taking 112.5mg of venlafaxine. I usually run a lot to beat the depression (hence my user name: one winter evening, a funny old man asked me why I was running so hard. I thought that was innocent and funny question. So I made it into my reddit username. Btw, my answer to his question was: ""because I like running a lot!""). But with the workload in grad school AND the physical waitressing job at the restaurant, I just have no time or energy to run. 
I'm also an artist. I had long been in denial that art should have been my path. I didn't believe in myself and I was too afraid to be an artist.
I'm an Asian and my parents are typical Asian parents. My father wanted to be a lawyer, and I thought I wanted to be one. I dropped that idea in Junior year of college. My parents are also hard-core Christian. In fact, my dad is a minister so all my family: mom, my brother, and I had to do a lot of church works for as long as I remember. I hated it and I hated the immature, authoritarian and abusive father. So I ran away when I was 16, went to a high school away from home. Being away from home in that age was a bad idea. I came across with bad adults and peers. But I didn't want to go home. My parents were fighting all the time. I had to do the church work that I hated, including going to early morning prayer at 5am every morning. So I stayed out and my mental health and self-esteem were deteriorated further 

Upon graduating high school, I wanted to go to a 2-year technical college in Korea, that had an IT program emphasizing cyber security. They taught CCNA stuff, C, Java, and basic security theory stuff. I actually enrolled myself in, started going to school for a month. But my parents were ashamed that I ended up in a 2-year school instead of a good 4-year university. They refused to pay the tuition. I was a Korean citizen at that time, and Korea did not have a public nor private student aid program, at least for a private 2-year technical college at that time. I had to drop out. I had to say good bye to the friends I made, and to my vision and hope. 

I did nothing for 2 years.   

I ended up coming to the US. I went to a community college and worked hard. I transferred to a privileged public university and had a great internship. Needless to say, that brought joy to my parents. But I was still depressed and suicidal. I had already attempted one suicide and ended up in ER and mandatory inpatient ward for three days. 

I ran harder. 

I got into a master's program which turned out not interesting to me. This time I was not depressed. I was angry. I was pissed at my parents, the program, and myself. 
I took a leave of absence and went to a community college to learn computer programming and general CS stuff. It was an unfinished business. I just wanted to see if I liked it or hated it. 

I loved it. I wanted to go further. 

The problem was, I have already maxed out FAFSA limit for undergraduate aid. I couldn't transfer to 4yr college for CS major because I did't have money, and many scholarship was applied people without a bachelor's degree.
That's why I'm back in the grad school. One is just to finish off and second, I could have a day job to fund my artistic endeavor. 

But I'm so tired. I'm on the edge of the cliff.

Yesterday, I had a dispute with a manager in the restaurant I worked. The manager and a coworker were insinuating that I was too sensitive, and I just got to suck it up. In fact, I am a sensitive person and I used to hate myself for it. I'm sensitive at words and behavior of others but I don't get upset by it too often. I do know that is my weakness and I had tried to less sensitive at things. The flip side of the coin is, because I'm sensitive I provide a good service to the customers. At any rate, I was upset. I excused myself and went to the car and cried. I called my mom. I cried and said ""sometimes I wonder if I can live life because I'm so sensitive. I really try not to. Sometimes it's so tiring that I wish I were dead.""
My mom's response was: ""I know you hate to hear this, but THAT'S WHY you have to believe in god."" I'm not even surprised that she mentioned religion into it. It had been a very long, seriously dividing subject between my parents and I. I told them I don't believe in god, and they refused to accept it. 
I asked: ""What is believing in god has to do with it?""
Mom: ""You have to believe in him and pray. Pray that he will change you!""
At that moment I was loss at word. There were so many things wrong in that statement and I didn't have energy to debate. 

I just thought that was very cruel of her. 
I'm at my most vulnerable moment. I called her for support. Instead she not only brought up religion, also this time, she showed that she hasn't accepted me as a person.
 
I love my parents despite all the wrong because I know that they love me. I think a lot about taking care of them once I'm settled.
But now, I just want to stop living. Stop all this tiring shit. 

I thought a lot of killing myself. I've already drafted my will, who to be my representative (my ex-husband) to take care of my properties (however little that is); in a case of failed attempt and I end up in brain death, giving him the authority to stop the life sustaining measures; a little note to my parents and the landlord couple/housemates. I'll pack and clean everything so that at least cleaning part is painless for the housemates

In case it was not evident in the writing, it is the pain that drives me to the decision. The pain has been there. I tried to run away from it, across the oceans and across many marathon finish lines.... I just can't shake it off. 

Thanks for reading. ",09Dec2018,1
2,"I just prefer the uncertainty of whether someone has seen my message or not. Being left on read just gives me this uneasy feeling given the context. Now I understand people are busy and what not, but it’s more or less when you know they aren’t really up to much and they leave you hanging mid conversation or question.

3,"I really want to make friends. Make friends with everyone, i want people to care about me and talk about me

But i dont have a personality at all.
I try my most to make people laugh so they value me, when in conversations i force my self what to say next or it will be awkward or i will seem like a compelete brainless empty minded narrow minded guy 

Im weak af. I feel like a petty, worthless, abortive, cheap person and personality.

When i watch movies i compare the characters to my self and the most unimportant or characters no one cares about behaves like me. It makes feel like shit. Or goofy or dumb characters are exactly like me.... 

Im just lost about what a man really is, what does a man do what does a man not do? 

What does make a guy seem stupid or have a stupid personality? Or be brainless?

I'm a big advocate of LGBT rights, and I can see how it could be taken the wrong way -- but I think that a parody of *And Tango Makes Three*, except with the crows would be fucking hilarious!

Something about using bird sexuality as an analog for human sexuality strikes me as odd and funny.  I mean, we don't even have the same kind of genetalia 🤷... So, making a cutesy, kid's-book-style version of the neCROWphelia story just seems like it needs to be done (not for children, of course).

The ad was very very good, and I'd been in the area a few months ago... It seemed all okay.

Then I went to the property today. It's awful. Absolutely terrible. The surrounding homes are terrible. Everything about it is bad. It'll cost at least the value of my offer to redo it, and I don't have that money.

11,"It was HANDS DOWN THE WORST PET EVER. BY FAR. It was so awful!! I dont know why people lie. They HATE people.  They are so messy and loud. On top of hating being picked up or petted. If you dont have food to give them they fucking hate you. Mine learned not to be scared of me. Instead they head butted my hand to be like STOP PETTING ME. And nipped at me to be like STOP HOLDING ME. They are the most goddamn horrific pets and guess what? I own a tarantula. I own a chilean rose hair tarantula and its mindblowing that it never bit me! And I can hold it!! I cant fuckin believe that a goddamn spider (which is a boring but very easy animal to take care of) is more friendly than a mammal. Crazy shit but its true. Worst goddamn pet I've ever owned by far. I only regret not leaving it outside on the porch to trap a better pet. Like a feral cat or rabid coyote. Somehow would probably be a better more useful pet than those useless fucks.




Also....if anyone's wondering. It died of some brain tumor or something. It was rocking its head back and forth and I looked up guinea pig seizures but that wasnt it at all. I saw that at night and found it dead in the morning. ALSO. I know I'm supposed to have two. I had two before that died of old age and figured if I had one maybe it would be desperate for attention/interaction? LOL FUCK NO.

13,"First company Christmas party and it’s mostly good but the CEO and his friend gave speeches and wow. First off who is this guy cuz he doesn’t even work for the company lol. Anyways CEO starts and it sounds good at first, talking about values and such. Then he started comparing himself to the recently deceased President Bush and it all went downhill from there. 

For some reason he went way too in-depth into why he admired Bush, like talking about the Gulf War and how he was surrounded by Democrats in the Senate and such and never really explained the parallels there. He just kept saying how decent Bush was despite opposition and didn’t let himself get taken advantage of, but way more long-winded than how I just put it. 

Then he turned that into him making sure we get fair prices from our clients. And then he had to explain that having the same values as your employer is important because if not “then you’ll want to leave, or they’ll fire you...” (Not a joke) and essentially kept talking about values, patience, and decency, but using examples from Bush’s life rather than the company. 

And what he had to say about patience was funny because he established patience as a value but then said something about even that wont last and patience wears thin, which was apparently supposed to be a joke because a couple people laughed. 

Then his friend came up and the CEO’s speech was great in comparison. His was so long and boring I tuned it out at some point, but he talked about values, then his grandson’s graduation, his grandson’s goal board, and his fool-proof advice on how to achieve your goals. “If you follow my advice you will increase your chances of achieving your goal ten-fold!” And then something about prbly not achieving your big goal? Yeah like I said it was strange.

My parents might read this, they might not. They know my Reddit account but don’t use Reddit at all. I don’t really mind what happens I’m just going to generalise what I’ve been thinking about over the past three hours in my lovely warm sleeping bag.

The first thing you notice when you sleep outside without a roof over your head and clouds blocking the view is the stars. The tiny specks of light so far away it’s inconceivable to think of. In your mind you imagine the journey you’d have to take from earth to get to one of those specks of light. And when you get there you look back at earth and how small it is and you think why does this matter? What is the point of going to school or waking up everyday or caring about things. It doesn’t really change anything. Not as far as this star is concerned. But you realise that’s a stupid question to ask because you’re never going to be that star. You’re a human, trapped on this giant rock with a molten core zooming through space as part of a galaxy that in many years to come will collide with another galaxy but because they’re so big and the gaps between the stars are so big is unlikely there will be many collisions. But enough about space and the surroundings. What about actual life, the one you live.

Well... there a girl you’re interested. Cool. She’s got a boyfriend. Not so cool. But do you really properly like her? No I wouldn’t say properly, I get on better with her than any other girl but I can live without being with her although I would like it. Why would you like it? Because she’s interested in everything I say. She listens and responds and she’s funny and clever and pretty. She’s just amazing. But she’s happy with her boyfriend and it would be a douche move to try and take that happiness away for my own benefit. What’s helped you move on from other “crushes” so to say? A distraction. Like what? Work I guess or someone else that I like even more but she’s also a friend and I’m not going to ignore her because of a distraction or because I like some one more. So it’ll be more difficult. Well how about focusing on your work? Good idea.

My work. I say work but it’s more study. I’m still in school, just started a levels and I’m absolutely loving them. I did pretty well in my GCSEs getting only one 5 (in older terms: C) and all the rest higher. My strongest subject were maths, chemistry and physics so that’s what I chose for a levels. Just with further maths added on as well. I also decided to move schools. Not because I didn’t get on well with my previous school, this one had better teaching and for a guy that did as little revision he could the day before each of his exams, you want good teaching so you remember the content better.

So far chemistry is my favourite. We’ve learnt a lot of new interesting parts of the topic. Such as octane number and mass spectrometry. But I’m still unsure what I want to do after university. I don’t even know what I want to do in university. All the decisions are to be made at a later date.

But I’ve glossed over the effects of moving to a different school. None of my friends came with me. They either stayed in the same school or went somewhere else. I don’t get to see them as much but they invite me to parties to which I accept and go along. The first one I went to was about a month after starting at my new school. I hadn’t seen my best friend for about 4 months at this point and he was going to be at the party.  I got there before him but when he arrived I felt ecstatic. I love him in a best friend kind of way. After we’d met whilst sober I had a lot to drink. The most I’ve ever had without being sick and I don’t remember it very well but I realise I missed him and all the other people at the party a lot and I started crying. We all hugged it out.

I’ve been to 2 other gatherings of watching scooby doo all night which was pretty fun and quite nostalgic. But I still don’t get to see them that often. I’ve made new friends at my new school but I haven’t had as many good times with them at the moment so it hasn’t quite filled the hole.

However, I think I’ve matured greatly since the start of sixth form and a levels. Not only because of more sophisticated subjects but also because of Reddit. I’ve had Reddit for just over a year but only really properly used it for about 100 days or so. I’ve learnt a lot about what it’s like to be in a community that isn’t always informal. I like the information you gather from TIL and the news subreddits and I feel like I am part of an amazing group of people that are fairly similar to me. I’ve never really had that in social media.

But right now i feel all that progress is just sorta gone just in time for my next semester of college. It was all my fault I got fired tho I basically left without askin cause i got pissed after staying 15 minutes  late waiting for someone. By pissed I mean i yelled at my manager sorta I'm quiet so im not sure how loud. He didn't fire me tho someone higher up who saw it on a camera did. In all honest I had wanted to quit for sometime but didnt cause I felt anywhere else i'd hate more than I hated here so I didn't. Now I suppose I get to find out. I think  my biggest issue maybe being positive I can't bullshit positivity and if i'm stuck in customer service crap needing to talk to customers it aint gonna work. Burger KIng didnt force any of that on me tho so it was great. I also met a lot of interesting people and had sort of friends for once I doubt they'll stay to long except one or two prob just more people on my social media page.

34,"I'm a pretty terrible person. I played a part in pushing my best friend to suicide by being self-absorbed and shitty. I fucked with my sister's development into a normal confident person through my self-obsession and bullying behaviour. My last ex almost killed herself because of me.

Even when I try to push to be more confident and balanced I realized I've been fluctuating between two extremes, from extreme egoism and outgoing grandiose confidence to extreme self-deprecating behaviour and introversion (while of course maintaining the same deluded impression that I'm somehow more special or better than other people). So, having become aware of this I'm not exactly sure what to do.

Looking back at my life this behaviour has probably been present since the start of my teenage years. The thing is, while I was super cocky and over-confident in my abilities I found that I was actually pretty successful. I didn't have any problems with relationships, popularity, nor did I have any problem with succeeding in school/getting accepted to high-end universities. It's only when this facade broke that I started going downhill and bounced into my introverted state.

When I became really introverted and self-repressing I convinced myself that my old behaviour was selfish and shitty - which it definitely was. On the other hand, the closer I've gotten to this old way of being, the closer I've gotten to being truly happy. For instance, I've been ""improving"" myself recently and I've noticed that when I'm truly confident and self-assured it basically mimics me at my self-deluded best. 

I realize that this isn't an accurate impression of myself, but what I've definitely noted is that this hyper-confident version of me is much more successful in every respect and that I'm much happier in this state - my constant self-hate goes away, my self-doubt dissipates and all the loathing I feel towards myself just disappears. 

From what I've read online, it doesn't seem that narcissists like myself have much hope of changing. At best I'll be able to clamp down the unconscious instincts I learned from my shitty childhood and act like a reasonably nice person who has the constant feeling of suppressing a core part of themselves.  Frankly, that sounds kind of shitty. 

So my question is twofold, 1) Is it possible for me to recover from my narcissistic tendencies completely and 2) If not, then should I just fully buy into a larger-than-life sense of self-confidence since it'll make me happier and will draw more people towards me in the long run?",09Dec2018,1

I've always chalked this up to being emotionally weak and helplessly delicate, but recently, I discovered what someone I have known for over a year thought of this. She was talking online to someone who was basically a stranger to her, they met in an online group chat. She said a few things here and there that were quite hurtful but not much I did not agree with. But what bothered me most was her talking about my unwillingness to kill creatures that need not die. She said that I had too many fucking morals, so many that I couldn't even kill a bug, and that this was ""Really kind of sad, actually""

I do not think that I have too many morals, I fear I have too few. What she confuses with morals is my patheticness and fragility. When I confronted her with this she admitted her mistake in talking to a stranger about personal matters, and I hold no ill will against her. I would just like to know if she is right.

i woke up today and thought to myself, “ damn, i’m really feeling loose on my shoulders this morning “. it’s true. i feel like i can finally get out and not think about what this person was gonna feel like today. you can’t help someone if they refuse it. people grow apart and that’s exactly what has happened.

Im doing all the things people say to do to have a good and attractive life, Ive gotten complimented on my looks and complimented me on the date. Still Im celebrating my birthday alone and single.

Or I've screwed up timelines unintentionally because when you're suffering from clinical depression and anxiety sometimes thoughts become blurry and I just needed to get them out. But I have kept sort of a reddit journal in which I can remember the omitted or slightly changed details so that I can revisit and read and remind myself of why I keep going even though life has been a little bit of a roller coaster for a long time.

I know that because other people know my nickname they may stumble across these and read them and be slightly confused but overall they would know the big picture, no one has mentioned it but based on the sensitive material of what my life has been for the last decade and a half, I mean maybe no one has but... How do you bring that up to a person anyways?

I'm learning to accept my mental health however. I've been getting help and treatment that has been invaluable. I'm learning to accept that I am a good person despite my flaws. I'm trying to grow and I'm starting to get back to being a human again. I've been blessed to find work with people I enjoy and work that is challenging which is what I love. I don't need to escape or hide anymore. I am damaged but I am gluing the pieces back together bit by bit.

This year (2019) I have the opportunity to turn my life towards a more positive direction. If I can really push myself I can really provide for the kids and my family. I'm finally in a positive place. If I slow down, and really focus, I can do it.

68,"I need some perspective.

It was recently revealed to me that I am not a humble person. I have pride issues and they’ve basically been infecting every aspect of my life.

I try to put up this kind of facade that I'm really smart or intelligent, but deep down I'm insecure and second guessing almost everything I do. In all honesty, I actually want to BE smart, but it feels like I always make the wrong decision, even when I take the time to think it over. It’s like everybody else knows how to make the right decision better, faster, and more efficiently that I do. I have friends who can simply act on things and do them with confidence, and I seriously don’t get how they do it.

I often view simple or straightforward things as “beneath me”, and I look down on others who enjoy them. There are many times where I don’t allow myself to enjoy things intrinsically, and that I require some kind of “mental stimulation” in order for it to be “worthy of my time” (Ugh, this sounds even worse when I read it again).

I overthink and overanalyze all the time, and I’m jealous of people who know how to be in the moment. I have friends who can have fun just “doing” things, and I don’t understand how they do it. I don’t know how to listen to my heart or what it sounds like, and it’s been driving me crazy.

I have issues with perfectionism, and it’s been really holding me back. I’m trying to develop my skills so that I can start a career in the creative industry, but I have problems with allowing myself to make mistakes and put out work even if it’s not super-special-perfect and amazes everybody.

I’m tired of putting myself through all these mental gymnastics. I just want to enjoy life. What can I do to loosen up and let go of my pride?

When books end

And the story fades

When the stage empties

And your props start to fray

When the blue sky gets sad

And turns to gray

When the joy you feel

Turns into dismay

When the light turns dark

When the dog in you

Loses its bark

When the angels you seek

Don’t seem to hark

When there is no more melody

From the lark

When your feet want to stop

Before discovering

The next open door

When the heart can’t heal

From its sore

When your mental train wrecks

And gives your feelings sores

That is when love learns to sigh

That is when love says hi

71,"This was an awesome day for me, I held a good healthy level of flirtation over the phone. To some this might not be a big deal, for me it totally is, because i find myself completely tongue tied and stupid and childish when attempting to actually speak to a girl i like, which is so weird because i have an odd tendency to quickly befriend the girls i am not quite attracted to romantically.

So this was a huge leap forward for me, for the past couple of months i have time and time again been rejected by girls over the phone, (one in person). I never had a gf, and i am in my late twenties, go figure. This isn't a race i have to go with my pace, at least that is what i tell my self.

This one will probably not pan out ( i am seeing some signs) but i made her crack up, which i think is a win situation anyways.

72,"I'm in my first year of college and I met someone through a dating app near towards the beginning of the year. He invited me to his place, which I was hesitant to go to because I didn't know him that well. But when he came to pick me up I had my friends meet him. He was really nice and I enjoyed my time at his place. When he was bringing me back to my place he said he had a great time and would like to spend time together again sometime. 

Fast forward to two weeks later and finally I got to spend time with him again, but i didn't hear from him that much over the two weeks. That night he said that he wanted to hang out the next day and he would let me know when he could. Next day came, heard nothing from him. Then i didn't hear from him for about a month then out of the blue he said he wanted to take me on a date (but that didn't happen either). A month after that he wanted to take me on a date, he talked to me again and I went over to his place. All the times that I spent with him I would feel really comfortable and happy. That night he said that he wanted me to spend the next night with him. The next day came and i said when do you want to hangout and he said that he couldn't because he made plans with his friend. I was pretty mad after that because he said he really wanted to hangout with me. 

Every once in a while he would send me a snap saying nice things about me and that he missed me and liked me. But every time we tried making plans he would flake on me, which would cause me to be disappointed. Also when he would snap me i would respond and sometimes ask a question but then he would leave me on read. But then he would say that he was busy. 

One night he was in a group chat on snap with my friends and I and so my friends added him on snap. But then last night he snapped my roommate saying what's up. That really hurt me, and then I kind of went off on him. Saying I couldn't take this anymore and then I blocked him on everything.

 At times I would get my hopes up when we would hang out but then I learned that I couldn't because I knew overtime that he would not respond or flake on me. I just wished I stopped talking to him months ago but i just couldn't resist for some reason. He was a really nice guy but things just didn't work out and I am kind of glad I ended whatever we had.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been playing poker for years. Always known as the best among my friends.

&amp;#x200B;

This weekend, a cute, very tall senior girl (maybe 5'11? Possibly 6'0?) stumbled into our small party. She heard me brag about how I've won 11 tournaments in a row.

&amp;#x200B;

She challenged me to a heads-up game. I said sure, let's do it.

&amp;#x200B;

Only 30 minutes later, she took every penny I had. $330. Which was my textbook money. I asked for a shot to win it back.

&amp;#x200B;

She said ""Well, I already have all your money. How about your clothes? But when I take those little panties too, you go home without them.""

&amp;#x200B;

That admittedly intimidated me a little, but maybe she liked me and this was a chance to finally get laid.

&amp;#x200B;

30 minutes later, I handed her my boxers, which she swung around her head yelling ""WOOOO!""

&amp;#x200B;

I was as naked as a newborn baby.

&amp;#x200B;

Totally untanned from the neck down as everyone giggled to their ultimate amusement.

&amp;#x200B;

""Finders keepers, losers weepers"" she said as I shuffled to the door wearing nothing but my glasses and a pink blush on my face, pathetically covering my package with my hands.

&amp;#x200B;

Towering over me from behind, she said ""Now RUN HOME, BIRTHDAY SUIT BOYYYY!"" and leaned back and SMACKED my round, plump white bubble butt and I gasped, let out a yelp of pain, and ran through the door, gasping as my bald buttcheeks felt the 35 degree weather, down the steps, across the quad, and across the football field, 2 miles back to my dorm, as naked as the day I was pulled screaming from my mother. Hiding behind dumpsters and trees the whole way. Desperately clutching my little dorm key-card in my hand.

&amp;#x200B;

I was caught on security camera running buck naked into my dorm and kicked out of my dorm. Now I have to commute from home.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't have the heart to tell my parents the real reason, so I pretended it was excessive drinking. Which really pissed them off.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Are you more geeky or outgoing?

76,"I'm not a parent and will never be one. Never wanted to be one, and a surgery causing infertility took care of that anyway. I do, however, adore the hell out of my niece. I used to say the awesome thing about being an aunt is that you get to do the fun things with the kid, spoil them rotten, getting them hyped on sugar, and then return them to their parents when they get annoying. But me and my niece, we have a special bond. We read together, I'm teaching her her animals, some words in my family's native tongue, encouraging creativity whenever I get to watch her by letting her bang around on the cheapest of my instruments and drawing with her, and just covering her with love. If, gosh forbid, anything happened to her parents, me and my partner would take her in a heartbeat. She's my little buddy.

A couple days ago, while her dad wasn't paying attention my niece took a header out of a shopping cart and fractured her skull. She was in the pediatric ICU for a couple days, and was projectile vomiting. This worried us; projectile vomiting, especially for hours the way her mother described, is a sign of intracranial pressure and potentially a more serious head injury. But she thought it was because she was all worked up and sobbing for several hours.

I know accidents happen, and that they're overstressed, overworked, and my SIL has another baby on the way. I just feel so bad for my little girl. If I wasn't removing her from her comfort zone, I would kidnap her and let her stay with Aunt Flinkumps for a few days, just spoiling her rotten and cuddling her.

But I've come to realize I hate my immediate family too. Initially I assumed it was just teen angst and me being a little shit head. In hindsight I was only half right. My parents, my siblings and I are dysfunctional beyond hope. Trauma from the things we've lived through has accumulated and made some seriously fucked up adults. 

I'm the kind of person that likes to talk things through, but my family just won't have that. They want to pretend that everything that's happened to us is in the past and has no bearing on the present. They will through actual tantrums to avoid talking about things. The scarce moments when they open up become shouting matches that rarely have a resolution. I've been labeled as an instigator because I refuse to just leave things be. 

I'm not perfect. This isn't a post about some saint exposing his family. I'm just as dysfunctional as they are. but that's represented in different ways. However, instead of trying to help me improve, they just latch on to my imperfections to turn a discussion into a free-for-all. Every fight gets worse and just seres to build resentment.

Although logistically more difficult due to size, something similar is sorely needed in the US - people are living like slaves and don't even have universal healthcare going into 2019.

How can Americans similarly and effectively throw wrenches into the system of their exploitation until they at the very least get universal healthcare?

Spitballing some ideas here:

What if everyone collectively stopped paying their medical bills altogether?

The system would be somewhat overwhelmed by having to go to collections for everyone. That might not work for people who need ongoing care though.

Boycott Christmas shopping?

Stop giving to charity, which just props up the system, and use the funds saved to primary people opposed to Medicare for All?

87,"I wrote this a few weeks ago when I felt especially moved.  Yes, we knew it was coming.

At the end of every service at my church they say to love Christ, live Christ and share Christ.  My aunt Diane was someone who did this.  For as long as she could she worked as a CNA or home health aide who took care of other peoples’ loved ones.  She worked for a nursing home close to where she lived for many years until she became a home health aide and no longer worked in a facility.  She loved helping people.  She was kind and gentle and full of patience.   When her own parents reached an age where they needed her help, she took care of them too.

I don’t remember her ever swearing, though I suspect at least once in her life she did.  She wasn’t a saint, she got frustrated occasionally she just reacted differently to it than most people do.  She was slow to anger.  She lived the true mission of Christ in word and deed.  She didn’t covet the things most covet.  She was simple and happy most of the time. 

She was raised Catholic and though she tried other religions she found herself back at the Catholic church until both her parents and her brother died all in less than a year.  She was so conflicted about this and the depression that followed that for a while she turned her back on the church.  But in time she did find the need to go back.

She was deeply called to love.  To love God, to love her family, to love those she provided care for.  I came out as bisexual when I was a teenager and though some in our family treated me differently, she never did.  She loved unconditionally. 
 
She would babysit my brother and me so that my single mom could have a break now and then.  We weren’t angels, we pushed her buttons when we could.  There was one time we waited until she was in the shower and put plastic wrap on the toilet under the seat.  She came out of the shower, used the toilet and pee went all over the floor and got her a bit too.  We heard, “DARN YOU KIDS!!!!” and we ran out of the house, down the street faster than anyone ever had.  But she didn’t retaliate in any way.  My mom was very difficult to be around and Diane knew that sometimes we just needed to blow off steam.  She was always kind to us.  I thought that made her weak, but now that I’m older, I truly understand how strong you have to be to be kind to those who are mean to you (in general).

Some of the people she provided care for were not in their right minds because of pain or dementia or any number of reasons and she would get bruises from them occasionally but she never felt any anger towards them.  She understood what most could not. 

She had stage 4 lung cancer by the time she went to the doctor.  Always taking care of others but never making herself important enough.  It turned out of be her fatal flaw.  When she told me, I knew what it meant since I work in cancer research.  She also was looking for someone to give her permission to not fight it.  She was tired.  She coughed so hard she would start vomiting and yet she didn’t want to let her family down by not fighting it.  I told her, she needed to do what was right for her.  She said she didn’t want to fight and I said I would tell my dad.

My dad would be the one most likely to fight her on this.  And as his child I knew how this was going to go so I knew I had to do her fighting for her.  It did not make me popular but sometimes the kindest thing you can do is to respect others’ wishes.  She had suffered a long time from various injuries and illnesses and she was done.  It took a while to get the family on board but eventually they accepted that her time was limited and we had to make the most of it.

Diane was a beautiful human being who lived a simple life that didn’t pay much in money but the love she gave and the love she received was enough for her.  She is an example that I will never be because I don’t have it in me but I am glad there are people out there who can.  Just make sure you are taking care of yourself as you are caring for others.

I love you Diane and I know your mom and dad and the rest of those who went before you were there to welcome you home.  Now at peace, we will miss you.

92,"Okay, so after moving to this high school for like, 3 months, my life has changed. I feel like my classmates started to hate me since the first day. They absolutely hate me. When I say something, even innocent, they start freaking attacking me! I just.. I just don't know what's wrong with me. I can't find a fault on me. Everyday I suffer from this endless pain of being hated, and I'm always afraid of going to school. They also call me weird for no reason! I literally did nothing wrong... ffw to today. Someone asked if we could dress black, on the group chat, to pay respects to those children who died recently, in Italy. I said no, because I don't have any black stuff. They started being freaking mental to me, they attacked me, they insulted me, they called me retarded, and then a group admin got on, and kicked me. For saying no to a ridiculous request. My reputation is falling faster than I thought it would. And I have no fault. Maybe it's my existence?",09Dec2018,1
93,"Im a 17 year old teenager. I just need some advice I have been feeling sad for the longest time i have feelings of not being good enough, low self-esteem, sadness I often feel that I dont have many real friends and that they dont like me. I also have noticed that i often feel pressure in my chest I woudn't call it painfull but I just feel very nervous a lot. I also think a lot about death even sometimes suicide. I never really plan it I just think about it. Im not sure why I feel this way I dont have any real problems in my life. Is this just teenage angst? Will it pass? Does everybody feel this way?

94,"I've been on a binge through the RealLifeLore and Second Thought youtube channels and I have gotten significantly more hyped for space colonies and stuff.

But I feel ridiculous that they're are people on this planet currently trying to determine the habitability of life on Saturn's moon Enceladus, developing plans for floating air colonies in the clouds of Venus, and preparing for the terraformation of Mars, yet I'm laying in bed eating a $4 kids meal from Sprouts with my 20 year old hands.

Do you think they're looking for space janitors or something? I'm no rocket man, but at this current moment I'd be okay with being an astronaut's personal ass-wiper if it meant I was contributing to space exploration and advancing the human species' reach into the universe.",09Dec2018,1
95,"When my parents finally divorced back in 2017, I was happy. They weren’t good together. I knew my dad cheated on my mom. But today, I found letters addressed to my dad from a woman I’ve never heard from before, dating back to 2016 and describing them meeting like 3-4 years previous to that. In one of them, she says something along the lines of “I hope my handsome son will get to know his father”. Talking about my dad. So now I know I have a secret brother, who is god only knows how many years old. I’m just so confused.",09Dec2018,1
96,"last 6 months i have quit porn, social media, smartphones and weed after daily smoking. Now i have decided to be whole month sober for the first time in years too. i feel like shit now because i'm in a bit of trouble with police and life feels worthless without drugs or alcohol.

 I'm 20 years old and i have been drinking almost every weekend since i was 13 so it's not very easy not to drink. Now i will just not do any drugs and wait to get some clarity for my situation (with the police thingie) and after that i can really start working on myself.

 For 2019 my goal is to stay off of weed and hard drugs, drink only once a moth or less, and start respecting myself. I will start talking and thinking positively about myself and stop doing stupid decisions that i know i will later regret. I will take half an hour a day to improve my apartment (cleaning mostly). I will start doing my responsibilities before i start playing video games. I am a fucking sloth but i think i will see results after a while of forcing myself to do all these (easy) tasks and that will motivate me to carry on. I really want to change and i think i can.",09Dec2018,1
98,"To start things off this obviously isn't my main account, anyways. I am a pathological liar, I've always been like that, I am manipulative, and I'm always wearing a 'mask'.

It hit me once when my family decided to tell me a gigantic hidden secret that's been going on for 5 years behind our backs, everyone went apeshit, they couldn't believe it, but I was.. ok with it, I wasn't shocked or moved by it. 

Then it began unfolding, throughout my adult life, I've always 'manipulated' people into liking me, I was social, I had so many friends (I still do, but not as much as I used to), I reacted to people's actions, emotions and dialogues in a very well-thought manner, I've always chose my words to be exactly what I wanted them to, to be exactly what would make other 'fall' for me, I was called so many things, charismatic, theatrical, friendly, funny, lovable, and the list goes on, but I only did what I did for myself, I wanted the satisfaction. 

Then it began getting worse, I started to manipulate in a harmful way, I lied, a lot, I masterfully and utterly formulated entire stories and situations that didn't actually happen, I used to tell certain people that my dad abused me when I was a child, then lying about suicide attempts, formulated an entire story about how my brother passed away.. I never had a brother, I used to cut myself to make my ex girlfriend feel bad for me, and I had a habit of making friends, bond with them, and make them love me, then leave without a trace, or cut them off badly, just for my satisfaction, and the list goes on.

It was so hard for me to know who I really was, and it was even harder to feel bad about what I did, I was devoid of guilt, I had zero empathy, everything that came out of my mouth, every action, was carefully curated and studied, it was hard to keep up with the lies, but I managed, I still do, cutting myself became a habit, because it's the only thing that reminded me that I can feel.

I wasn't like this when I was young, I had a mildly rough childhood, conservative parents, terrible environment, but nothing out of the usual, I don't know exactly when it started, but I'd say it was back when I posted something on Facebook among the lines of ""give me one reason not to kill myself"" because I was depressed as shit at the time, and the replies were.. satisfying, I wasn't actually planning to kill myself, I have no idea why I posted that but afterwards I picked it up as a habit, making people feel bad for me, spoiling me with their intimacy and affection, that was about 2 years ago, and it's still going on.

I don't manipulate harmfully anymore, basically these days I'm just wearing the mask of the funny guy, I crack a lot of jokes, cracking the ice, getting to know someone, occasionally on a deep personal level, and nothing really harmful, except the fact that I'm not enjoying it, I want the thrill, the joy of being the guy who gets love and attention, not a few laughs, a free cop of coffee and a smoke, and I don't wanna go down that road again, just because it's tiring and time consuming, that's honestly the only reason why.

I have no idea why I'm writing this, I am not ok, and I know something is really wrong with me, never went to the therapist again, and I don't want this to stop, I feel powerful, I know it's wrong and it has to stop, but it seems like I have no control over it.

Please understand that I'm not proud of this, I am not bragging, if you see any of these signs, go see a therapist, or talk to a friend about it, I never opened up to someone about this before, because how can they trust me, right? Any suggestions, any experiences you'd love to share, any solutions you wanna propose, I'm all ears, maybe something can flip inside me reading your comments, thanks and sorry for the long read.",09Dec2018,1
100,Basically I have been testing to see how the redesign works with ad block and it's actually quite good the UI flow is pretty simple and reminds me of old style fourms in a way.,09Dec2018,1
101,"And we are laying in bed and the lights are off. Towards the end of some spells where I'm crying into his chest, I'll start to catch my breath again, and a Spongebob character will say something ridiculous and it will make me crack up. It feels so good to laugh after crying. It feels so good to be held by my husband who in that moment is my only link to sanity and listen to him laugh at spongebob while I cry. The sound of his laughter instantly reminds me of why I will never give into my desire to commit suicide. 

And I don't even know how this sort of system came about, or how he has learned me so well that most of my need to communicate is lifted off my shoulder like a heavy burden. He knows what I need somehow. Second by second needs. When I need to be touched and where, when he needs to speak and when to stay silent, what to say and why to say it. And he understands why spongebob is the only show that makes the normal come back.

That's what I call it. Whenever I lose my normal, I can't do what i want to do or need to do, and so I need to get it back so life can move on.

Anyways, that's all. We're eating pizza and watching spongebob. The lights can be on though since we're eating.

Ps. By the way we're adults lol but we both have ASD. :)",09Dec2018,1
102,"I constantly go red, I’m really not bothered about 99% of things in life. I’m pretty laid back, but I feel like my face always tells the wrong story.

I went on a date today with someone I’ve spoke to for a while before hand and I went red when I mispronounced something stupid. Which I really don’t care about because it’s funny and stupid. 

Im not very “ln in touch with my emotions” I don’t really feel much other than whatever and “i don’t care”. Occasionally I’ll realise why I’ve gone red to something. But every other time I don’t know why but I feel it every time happening..",09Dec2018,1
