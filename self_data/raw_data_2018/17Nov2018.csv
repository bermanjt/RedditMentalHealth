Finally the last straw was him being put on house arrest for molesting a child his mother foster cared for. Hes 19 at the moment. All of a sudden she stops talking to me and is posting pics of him again. Then she removes me from instagram and I see on facebook shes engaged to him. She dropped me without a word for him and because what? She knew I would tell her hes bad for her? He cheated on her and did so many bad things and she wants to marry him now and ignore me. She was my only friend. It hurts and I have my mom thankfully but it isnt the same.",17Nov2018,1

2,"I always hoped that I'd meet my dream girl when I was young. And we'd grow up together. Travel the world together. Go through so many different ""firsts"" in life together. Learn from each other and navigate through life together.

I guess it just sucks to realise just how far away from that dream I really am. To realise anyone I've thought could be that girl hasn't felt the same about me. I'm only 24 but it sucks to know each year I slowly believe in that dream a little less. I guess it just sucks to feel alone. ",17Nov2018,1
3,"When I'm at the nail salon getting a pedicure and I see other women making the nail tech hold their whole leg and foot up while they attempt scrub it to get the dead skin off the bottom, because they can't be bothered to use their own energy to hold up their own leg.

If someone is going to be scrubbing the nasty bottoms of your feet the least you could do is hold your leg up for them and not go slack and give them dead weight.

4,"I have OCD which is mostly under control, but I still have obsessive thoughts about some things. Lately this year has been bad, especially with my added FOMO. I am in my last year of college, and also my boyfriend of almost 8 years goes here with me. We became pretty dependent on each other over the summer, because we were living together and it was just us. Now when he goes out (like drinking with friends) without me, I get pretty bad FOMO and have pretty bad and negative obsessive thoughts about it all night (he doesn’t want me there anyways, he doesn’t miss me, I’m not hot anyways so he might as well hang out with other people, etc). 

They’re pretty self deprecating and I hate it. We’ve been going to the gym, and have been trying to eat better. I’ve been taking care of my body better and we’ve made some other healthy changes, but my self confidence is still in the toilet. So my obsessive thoughts that I’m thinking about all night are always negative towards myself, and then I end up getting agitated and angry for no reason and lash out at him even though he’s not doing anything wrong and it’s all in my head. I know he won’t leave me, but I just can’t stop these negative thoughts about myself when I feel left out of what’s happening. We’ve had some stuff happen in the past but at this point in our relationship I have no reason not to trust him. I think it’s just my low self esteem.

I tried doing this thing I read from an article online about “placing negative thoughts into an imaginary ball,” then trying to push the ball out of your mind, and then thinking of positive things that he says about me or that he’s done. It’s supposed to help break the cycle of obsessive thoughts but most of the time they just come back up. It helped when I was trying to stop some of my compulsions from the OCD but the obsessive thoughts related to my FOMO haven’t gotten better.

I feel so stupid. I feel like an idiot for thinking like this and for trying to imagine a stupid ball in my mind. I feel like an idiot for even having to try that. I just feel like I’m not getting anywhere. I’m taking care of myself and my body too and yet I don’t feel any better. I just feel like I’m failing him. Am I just being ridiculous?",17Nov2018,1
5,"I'm 25 and have the worst back pain. At my age I've had at least 30 different jobs, some bad ones, some decent ones and some good ones. I've lot a left of them because I couldn't handle the stress or the extreme back pain I feel. I've seen numerous doctors/chiropractors and I'm simply done spending money on them. I was unemployed for the last 6 months until I just got a job 2 weeks ago as a tire technician. Since winter is here, I'll be working 60-70 hours a week.

6,"Earlier today i was watching tv and and an episode of Live PD came on. I was watching and then it said something about Walton county FL.
I thought it was pretty cool for a second because i used to live there until i realized that the house they were pulling up to,  to my shock, it was my older uncles house.
I kept watching, and heard what sounded like my younger uncle's voice yelling.
And then he took off. 
He didn't make it far before he got down on the ground and started crying about being able to see my cousins while they were pointing the taser and handcuffing him.
After that they put him up against the car and i knew it was him for sure because of the (tapout tattoo on his stomach) and he started yelling for his girlfriend to stay out there.
So yeah, i've just been thinking about it for a while and just decided to post this. Thanks.

9,I have always had a FOMO but recently it has gotten so much worse. My friend has lots of friends and goes out often and comes back with funny stories about how much fun they had.

10,"I went to a show tonight in DC, and it ran a bit longer than I expected. Now I'm stuck at Union Station for over an hour to catch the next ride northbound. Hadn't eaten since lunch, so I figure, I'll grab whatever's still open. Turned out to be one single fast food joint with some arches.

While I was waiting in line, there was a guy asking folks to buy him a chicken sandwich. He definitely looked like he could use it. So I figure what the hell. It's a dollar. I asked if he wanted a pie as well, and he lit up. Two chicken sandwiches and an apple pie later, and a man has a warm meal. Maybe not the healthiest, but it's something.

I don't know why I'm here. I guess I need to tell people about a good deed to validate myself. At least this is still semi-anonymous.

11,"I’ll keep it kind of short but right now I’m about 16 years old. My sister left for College this year and my mom got really sad for a while after she left since they were pretty close. Right after she left my mom got three dogs. Before this the most we had ever had was 1 at a time. At this point it’s just gotten bad she won’t admit it but I know she only got them to fill the gap my sister left. By now it’s bad because although my mom is able to take care of them it’s becoming very time consuming. It feels like everything we do has to be revolves around the dogs and this effects how long we can be out of house for. And if we can go on vacations or where we can go for vacations. I’ve expressed to her many times that i feel like all the stress she’s getting is detrimental to her health. Every time I try to talk to her though she shuts me out or gets very angry or sad. AITA for not understanding and trying to get rid of at-least a couple of the dogs? I just don’t know at this point how to get her to part with them.

12,"I would like to think that I am one of the more patient people out of my own personal experiences, but when I reach the end of my patience I become explosive, incoherent passionate loudness, and I have the bad habit of shutting my mind down to new ideas when I’m angry like that.

I just want to push everything away and have my space to breathe. When I’m able to do that I’m perfectly fine de stressing myself and coming back to the subject. Unfortunately I can’t always back out of every situation that irritates me, and that’s where I start to unravel. I carry myself as pseudo-professional but when my patience runs out I’m an anti-social dick.

It’s affecting my loved ones because they encourage me to be myself, and I have never explored myself this far and let my emotions come out so much before the support group I have now. But they’re toxic emotions and I would like to find a way to mitigate the effects of mental fatigue in situations that demand my genuine interest. When I am at work or dealing with authority I’m very submissive and I behave extra well, keeping all of my issues to myself. 

My support group wants me to be me and flourish and accept myself, but I’ve hit this wall of anger and I know I can get past it, I just need help. My anger also builds up inside of me and finally unleashed when something triggers it. I don’t want to hurt anybody. I feel like a monster when I’m like that.

We were on a charter bus and I saw a bathroom in the back. I gave in covered my mouth and ran towards the back of the bus saying I'm going to be sick.

14,"I'm age 66 and have been disabled most of my adult life.  A few years back I filed a ""concealment of assets"" action in Lorain County (OH) Probate Court against my only sibling, who lives in same Ohio county.  Last yea(2017), I remembered that our late father had investments with a company(Mid-Ohio) which had all accounts assumed by the Equity Trust Company in 2003.  When I notified Equity Trust, they denied knowing anything.  My attorney sent a subpoena to Equity (of Westlake, OH) last October, 2017.  Again, Equity denied knowing my father, even though a South Dakota Banking official told me by phone in October, 2017, that &lt; ""Your Dad did have Mid-Ohio investments.""(South Dakota Banking chartered Equity Trust.)  I had to close my case without prejudice in Feb., 2018 because I could get no ""written evidence"" --not even from South Dakota banking--that my father dealt with Equity Trust through its original, Elyria, OH, company, Mid-Ohio Securities.  To date, I have e-mailed or spoken with the Federal SEC, the Ohio Attorney General, the Ohio Dept. of Taxation, the Ohio Dept. of Commerce, The Cleveland-area Better-Business-Bureau and absolutely NO ONE has jurisdiction over The Equity Trust Company.  Equity is a ""custodial trust,"" which denies that it gives out ""investment advice,"" but which insists it is simply  a ""passive custodian"" of the IRA's which investors ""direct"" themselves. My sibling and her husband have, to date, purchased 10 rental properties in the Elyria-Ohio area, with my brother-in-law as the ""director"" of their Equity IRA.  Equity is the ""passive custodian.""  However, South Dakota Banking's own rules state that Equity was to have demanded my sibling fill out--completely and honestly--a ""beneficiaries statement"" when she composed her Equity IRA.  So, my sibling either forged my name, or Equity did not demand of my sibling this ""beneficiary statement.""  My sibling and I are the only beneficiaries of our late father's will, which read, ""Share and share alike."" ....I know my dad had BIG INVESTMENTS WITH MID-OHIO Securities because in 2013 I was able to get a copy of his bank statements from (now) Chemical Bank covering 2006 to 2010. (Dad died in 2011)...These statements showed dad was getting Direct Deposits (from somewhere?) to the tune of $1,000 every three months.  These were probably dividend amounts.  And, right after I'd notified Equity Trust (in August, 2017) that I'd remembered Dad had done business with Mid-Ohio, sibling and brother-in-law sold off (from Sept. through Nov., 2017) all of the rental properties they'd purchased (save 1 property) through Equity Trust....But since sibling and her husband (and Equity Trust) have had ABSOLUTELY NO CONSEQUENCES for their FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR, they've again begun purchasing Elyria-area properties (2 since July, 2018) through Equity.  This time, however, the Lorain County Auditor's website displays only sibling's IRA # in the property transfers.  And, the tax bills are not mailed to sibling's address.  Sibling has forgotten, it seems, that an earlier property transfer showed the IRA #.  Why all this subterfuge if sibling, brother-in-law and the Equity Trust Company are not GUILTY OF ABSCONDING WITH/MISUSING MY INHERITANCE....CAN ANYONE OUT THERE POINT ME IN ANOTHER 'LEGAL DIRECTION?'  As I've said, I'm 66 and disabled and I have no more money for attorneys.  But, I will act as my own attorney if I can GET A CRUCIAL PIECE OF EVIDENCE IN WRITING.  Thanks for listening?

17,"English isn't my first language, so please excuse any mistakes.

I don't know how to truly explain my situation while mantaining full anonimity, so please bare with me.

I was born in a country in which you had to be incredibly lucky to live what most of us consider a regular life. I had a job that I loved, and worked 12h everyday (paid, of course, and I did it because I truly enjoyed my job) and was earning the same as my peers, even more considering all that extra time... And I still had to live with my parents because I couldn't afford rent, even less a car. You could think that maybe my job was shitty, or that maybe my boss paid really low, but please believe when I tell you that that wasn't the case. The difference was that all my coworkers were a generation older and they already had houses and all the big things, I didn't.

I like computers, and videogames... But I hadn't own a console in 10 years, and my pc was reeeally old too... I felt misserable. I felt like I wouldn't achieve the success to be independent and having the life I wanted. I don't think that I ask for much... Just to be able to live on my own and, if there's extra money, to buy stuff I like.

Last december I decided to go all in. I sold everything I had and decided to embark on the best journey I've had. I've travelled through 3 countries now, working illegaly as I pass just to get where I am now: in a country where some good friends I met online live. It's been hard, but this last couple of months have been amazing, and I feel at home, in family, with my friends.

Right now I'm a week away from going back to my country. A friend's sister convinced her boss to give me an interview, and I convinced him I was worth it. They oficially filed a job offer for me so I can ask for a work visa. I might be desperate, but I'm really afraid of doing things illegaly in a country I want to stay and be a part of.

I'm going back to the place I left months ago. I'm investing all the money I've made in this flight, in covering the visa cost... I have to nail the visa interview... I cannot fail because if I do I will stay stuck forever un the country that was killing me slowly. 

I'm really scared, but I'm going to try until I have nothing else to give.",17Nov2018,1
18,"If this isn’t the right place for this story, please let me know, I will remove it. Also typing this on my phone, please forgive the format!

Tonight I took my 4 yr old boy shopping for new pants. I had 2 coupons and reward points saved up so I spent about half of what I normally would have. After we were done shopping, I took him to the mall play area to let him get his wiggles out. It was pretty busy there. A man was sitting on my right and a woman on my left. After a while, it’s time to go, and I help my son with his shoes and leave. We wander to the toy store and look around a bit, I buy my husband a little Christmas gift and realize when the clerk hands me the bag, that I forgot my child’s new clothes at the play area.

We rush back to the play area and the woman sitting next to me was gone, but the man was still there. He told me that she offered to take my bag to security. He said she should leave it there, in case I come back. She took it anyways. She has a 4 year old boy also, about the same size as mine. 

I leave to walk the mall (it’s not a huge mall and is an oval shape) to find the security guard. I ended up at the mall lost and found and spoke with the security there. They had not received anything, but would look at the cameras to see if they can find the woman. I gave them a description of her and her child, and went back to some of the stores near the play area to see if she turned it in there. No luck. At this point I’m starting to lose hope that the woman would choose to do the right thing, you never really know a person. 

I go back to the security office, and they have found the woman in the mall heading into a store. She walked directly past the security office, so they sent an officer to question her. She did not turn in anything to them, and most likely left the mall. 

I’m frustrated and disappointed in my idiocy, and sad to think that she took my bag of clothes. I go back to the original store that I purchased my items, resolving to re purchase them. I happened to ask the cashiers if anyone turned in a full bag of clothes. Lo and behold, SHE DID!! I am so glad I remained hopeful she made the right choice, and I’m super grateful for her selflessness. 

I quickly returned to security to inform them of the good news, and left the mall with a smile in my heart! 

In such a tumultuous time, it’s hard to have faith and believe that people will choose to do the right thing by others. I’m glad to bear witness to such a situation when it turned out.

So here lies the problem, after a night of broken sleep making sure I’ve not missed any contact from staff or clients, my phone rings ONCE at 5am. I’m now wide awake, stuck feeling like I should have managed to answer it, what if I go back to sleep &amp; they call again, if they do call again I’ve then got to contact the on call staff who will also be sleeping. 

So much pressure (I guess it’s all self imposed pressure really) all because of a phone divert. 

It’s reminded me of a bunch of things I need to sort, all requiring me to speak to other people so I have to wait until a reasonable hour. No one is going to forgive me for waking them before 6am on a Saturday to sort admin or whatever.

It feels like I have been fooled to believe I lost something to find out after all this time, it has always been there. Like losing a locket in grass, and after many rain, wind, and dirt, it becomes harder to reach. So this is why I feel perplexed. 

After solving the problem, I had whiffs of reality, and all I could think about was time. Oh my god how much time has passed. How many things I missed out on, and how much I can do with all this time. But surely, slowly, I slipped back into fugue like sinking into thick liquid that force can only bring up.

The past few weeks have been filled with tease. I would be washing the dishes when suddenly a smell I haven’t thought of would come to me and spring up memories in what felt like a former life. I thought I could live my life this way, but these moments made me feel joy and excitement of being alive. Until it would go away and leave me with these memories and experience I forgot I had. Good moments that would be hard to play far.

For these past few years, I have been chasing a solution to this. What can I do to feel like myself again? What can I do to relive the moments I was born with again? What is the connection here between me and everyone else suffering from the same thing?

31,"Hey!

I’m sure compared to everyone else in this group, my problem seems pretty minimal, but I feel so sick of myself that it hurts.

When I was in high school up until about this summer of 2018, I was pretty confident in my appearance. I wore what I wanted, did my makeup and hair and everything how I wanted. I felt really free, and I think it’s mainly because I didn’t have much contact with my father.

Since I’ve started working more closely with my father at my job, and since I lost a large portion of my friends recently, I’ve been feeling extraordinarily lonely and have begun to hate almost everything about myself. My body, my voice, my art, my everything. I have nobody to help me when I’m feeling down, so I end up feeling pathetic at night and my dad’s constant nagging at me doesn’t help. “Are you going to the gym?” “Have you seen a dermatologist?” In all honesty, my weight isn’t that bad, I just don’t lose weight at the speed my sister does and he mentions a dermatologist whenever I get a singular bad pimple..

I think about how I used to pretend to love myself in high school until it actually worked, but now I find it almost impossible to do that.
I’ve been trying to make less self-deprecating jokes and more jokes about being narcissistic, but it feels like such a trudge to try and even do that. The only people I feel I have for support are my current boyfriend and my best friend who recently moved almost 3,000 miles away.

32,"Background: My mom’s birthday is at the end of July and a couple days before I saw a weird text on her phone from a number without contact info. I thought it was nothing. The day after her birthday I saw another text from the same number saying “Happy Birthday” and “I miss you” and my mom responding stuff like “the only thing missing is you” and “I miss you”,”I love you”. Then I saw a text from the guy saying something about “pounding her” and her saying some other stuff. I wrote down the number (it was at night) to make sure I wasn’t just dreaming. The next morning I checked the place I wrote it down and the number was there. I didn’t tell my mom I knew and called the number asking if they knew my moms name. They asked who it was and I just hung up and blocked the number. I think the guy called my mom cause I heard my mom saying that she didn’t know who someone was or something. She asked my later if I called a number and checked my phone but didn’t find anything. I kept checking her phone when she was asleep and every couple of days she would delete the texts. 
Some background on my mom: My mom smokes a lot and also drinks too much. It’s very annoying. So I have to sort of raid her room to check for cigarettes and vodka. She gets drunk when my dad has to go out of town for work. My dad knows about her drinking problem. 
Anyway one night when she was drunk (that probably wasn’t the best time) I confronted her about it and she said something about her wanting to cheat on my dad but not and knowing the guy because he was from her past and crap. I thought she might remember something from that confrontation because I didn’t see any texts from that number for a while. The last night when I checked her phone I saw another text from him and then her responding. I’m 12 I don’t know what to do and I haven’t told my dad. Can I please get some advice?

She has been going out a lot lately, which is weird cause she usually doesn't go out that much. I once saw her texting app password and when I opened it up, I saw that she has been texting with a dude that also has a family everyday. They meet each other everyday at a coffee shop and sometimes have dinner together. Yesterday afternoon she asked me whether there is any new movies on the cinema so she could go with her best friend. But apparently she went there with this guy ( according to the text I read ). I dont know how long they have been like this or how close they are since I only read a few days of their texting. They talked about how they love each other and how that guy wished she could be with her when she is sad. This really came as a total shock to me since she has always been a loving mom to both my dad and me ( I'm 17 &amp; I'm their only child ).

She also told me that she would never let this get anywhere further and i have to believe in her. I just lost all my respect for her even though I know that my dad has been a little bit old-fashioned and hot temper for the past few years. He sometimes say awful things to her when he is angry but he always apologized and made it up for her later on. I know that my dad could be hard on us sometimes but he has always been a loving and caring father.

Friends are like the guards in the Panopticon prison that lead us to police ourselves for fear of social reprisals. If any friend ever makes you feel this way then fuck them off immediately. If a friend drinks too much or their presence encourages you to drink too much or do anything too much then fuck them off asap.

Iraq War Research Outline
 
I. In March 2003, following the momentum of the War on Terror, President Bush gave the order to invade Iraq. Now in 2008, wide spread controversy over whether or not we should remain in Iraq is being debated.
A. 2003, Bush invades Iraq with bad intel. Once our military over threw Saddam, they were reassigned to rebuilding Iraq. But the Iraqi people didn’t want us there. The Iraqi insurgency began with two groups; the Sunni and the Shai.  American allies began to pull out when the general public disapproved of the war. The Iraqi Army is now taking on responsibilities of policing the country which makes the need for our military there small.
B.  
II. There are four aspects of the Iraq war that make it so controversial; the number of casualties, the oil, the funds we are spending on the war, and why we are there in the first place.
A. The number of casualties right now is just over four thousand.

57,"I’ve recently made my first big job move after having graduated from university studying Software Engineering. Previously I worked at a startup and it was great, however I had been in lead position there and I felt like I wanted to move on and grow in my career as I didn’t have access to senior engineers to learn from and grow.

About 4 months ago I decided it was time to start looking for a new role and see what I could find. I was hit with mails left right and centre with opportunities and I took a few on and went for them. The one I ended up choosing was a fairly large company, with a variety of developers available to learn from, or so I thought. The platform id be working on sounded good, they had an established product and it sounded good and stable. I got to ask a few questions at the interview but it was cut short by the interviewers having another meeting straight after.

The company has a few offices and I was placed in a city centre office away from their head office. I was able to see the office before I joined and it looked nice, although it was quiet, not many people working there actively, I thought it must be a day with people working from home. I was wrong.

After arriving I quickly learned that staff turnover is incredibly high, new people coming in each week. This worried me as a new permanent member of staff, however I stuck with it as I had hopes it would change.

However I’ve been there about 4 months now (still in probation) and I’m not sure that this company is right for me in the long term. I’m quite social and many members of staff at my office are not. The atmosphere in the other office is quiet, and other staff members berate the company none stop. I’ve been thinking about moving on.

However I’ve started to second guess myself as perhaps I should be more vocal with my current company? But I also don’t want to shoot myself in the foot. Can anyone advise? Perhaps I’m being silly but I thought I’d post to get some feedback. ",17Nov2018,1
58,"So I will begin by saying that this absolutely pales in comparison to other stories on here. However, I need to vent somewhere and I cannot think of anywhere else on the internet.


I met this girl through mutual friends at university in late August/early September 2017. I caught feelings for her far sooner than I'd like to admit, I'm not a very confident speaker at all and so the majority of conversations took place online. It had been going very well, she appeared to be just as happy to chat as I was, always contributing to the conversation and driving it forward (not at all like someone who wasn't interested). As she was always extremely polite, friendly and well-spoken I had already fallen very very hard by early October. 


A bit of context before we go any further, I myself am on 'the spectrum' (you know the one), one of the biggest challenges with this, I find, is that I can become extremely clingy and as a result most of my closet friends have been driven away, leaving me feeling very lonely and as it happens continuously I went through a period of time from mid 2016-late 2017 where I had been feeling very depressed- I've seen a counsellor and improved significantly- however I did also decide to confine in this girl (who from now on I'll refer to as K******) who appeared very reassuring and willing to help.


HOWEVER, In January following a standard drunken 'I really appreciate you' message she replies telling me that I'm not and never had been her friend but just an acquaintance. I was hurt and a little shaken but ofc that's cool she doesn't owe me her friendship. However, I did want to ask basic questions we'd all have like ""how come you've referred to yourself as my friend on more than one occasion then?"", which only made her extremely angry. Then a mutual friend messages me and says that I need to really back off and the only time I'm ALLOWED to message k****** is on a Monday evening to ask her if she'd be going to Tuesday's lecture, she is still my friend though, apparently, more on her later. 


I felt extremely dehumanised and very humiliated, I'd shared SO MUCH personal information with K***** but I decided for the most part to just go with it, I don't want to lose our mutual friends (there are 3 of them- one I've described already). I did on occasion message her at other times, nothing heavy just asking how she was etc and every time she got very angry often telling me in all caps that acquaintances only make ""pleasant chit chat"" in person and that those were just the rules of social interaction, for some reason it made sense to me and I thought I was acting out of line, y'know when you put someone on a pedastool. 

Very end of March I messaged her on a ""Friday night"", it was 8pm at the latest,  to ask a question about an assessment due on Monday. And boy did she lose it, now I'm forbidden from talking to her in person too. I spent most of Saturday trying to convince her this isn't fair not so much about her anymore but it's gonna be really awkward and I don't want to be ostracised. She eventually agreed to me messaging her on Monday evening about Tuesdays lecture which was the last day of term (thank god) although when I did mutual friend messaged me telling me to leave k***** the hell alone, apparently she's had a really rough year, I didn't know this, mutual friend acknowledged that k***** had kept it to herself but accused me of intentionally making it worse for her by STARTING CONVERSATIONS WITH HER. Then telling me that my problems don't matter at all (very bold of her to assume she knows the half of them). 

My initial response was guilt, I wrote k***** a letter of apology and a few days later reached out to mutual friend to apologise, she told me she accepted my apology then changed her mind for no reason. I spent summer (April-September) feeling soo bad about myself, guilty, and extremely terrified about returning to uni having been ostracised- I had baaad social anxiety as it was and we were moving into a new building.

I have now however met an incredible group of new friends who highlighted that I'm objectively not in the wrong. However, I just can't stop thinking about it, all of the cruel things she said about my person, she fact she must have thought she was being extremely kind in allowing me to speak to her, not only did she never apologise but told me she isn't sorry, mutual friend didn't ever once consider my perspective. Worst of all, I thought these people were my friends but it turns out they don't see me as a person equal to them at all. 

Do you think I am in the wrong? Please tell me what you think. 
And thank you all so much for reading. :)

Family gatherings in particular make me want to die, especially when it's with the in-laws.

Every day I wake up and pump myself up for the day. Today's a new day, I'll tell myself, and I will face the world head-on and own myself and everything that comes with being me, including the weirdness and the wrongness. I will make it mine. And then I come home defeated at the end of the day and lie in bed and stare at the wall, thinking of all the countless things I've done that nobody will ever forget. I think about running off to a new place to start over, but that would mean abandoning everyone I love. I think about sitting everyone I know down and falling to my knees in front of them to apologize for everything I've done wrong, but I'm pushing thirty now and I need to make up for my mistakes in actions, not words. Honestly, I entertain anything I could do that would give me a clean slate. (I don't have the courage to do anything rash, please don't worry.)

&amp;#x200B;

year is coming to an end, and I have 18 days of holiday left. I want to go somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: 39m, low self esteem, terrified of women (abuse from mentally ill mom..).

Never dated, but not for the lack of candidates. Being in a relationship has always felt so foreign, who on Earth would want me.

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, I would like to go to California (or almost anywhere in the US), and be a part of a multinational group.

Could be just travelling around, but preferably working on a project or attending a course. The goal is to be a part of a group, get the feel for the american way of life, see how I like it, and whether I might start a new life there.

What is holding me back: my experience with travelling hasn't been that great so far.

When I was travelling solo, I would predominantly wander around alone. Sometimes I would connect with others, but those connections broke as I left the place.

When traveling in a group, I was the odd man out. Couldn't be relaxed, seeing how ""normal"" everyone else is (read: they have a history of dating, and I don't).

75,"I (21F) am afraid of getting into relationships for a few reasons. Once someone shows interest in wanting to date me, regardless of how much I do as well I will self sabotage and ghost which is for the better as I’m not a suitable partner.

- I’m afraid of falling into a mundane routine. My previous relationship which I really enjoyed where all very spontaneous, usually with erratic personalities like me. I’m afraid if I pursue someone who is stable, I will interpret their stability as dull and end the relationship (which is not fair on them).

- I’m not stable. I’m a really creative and impulsive person. I move cities and countries, start new jobs as much as I leave others, always working on different side projects. I’m afraid if I get a partner either I will hurt them with this behaviour, or I will suppress my want to do these things (which I have done before) and become very depressed.

- I make drastic decisions over coffee. I will wake up one morning and decide to move overseas, or change my degree, or rearrange my whole living space. This has put strain on previous relationships, because I can be unpredictable.

 - I feel as if I haven’t achieved enough to be a worthy partner. Regardless of what my partner (or potential partner) does, wether they’re a uni student like me or a business owner, I never feel like I am “good enough”. I feel like all aspects of my life need to be 100% perfect as no one could be attracted to me if it wasn’t.

TL;DR: I’m afraid of getting into relationships because I am afraid of being boring, that my personality is erratic, I make drastic decisions, and haven’t achieved enough.

77,"First of all, let me lay out precisely what I mean by the term. A person suffering from age dysphoria is NOT simply immature, or one of those cliche people that has an ""inner child."" I think ALL adults feel that way from time to time. The term also doesn't pertain to younger people who happen to be exceptionally mature for their age, or, for whatever reason, want to be granted adult privileges. No, a person with age dysphoria literally feels a disconnect between their chronological/physical age and their true inner age. A person who has lived 16 years for instance, may feel disgust at her womanly body, because inside, she knows she hasn't progressed beyond, say, 10 years old. Of course, as a 10-year-old, she can't clearly articulate to herself, let alone others, that something is off, but she knows, instinctually, that she is not meant to look like a grownup. She hates the fact that people around her, especially boys, look at her as a sex object. Some guy on the street catcalls to her and she wonders, huh? Why is he looking at me that way? As a 10-year-old, she doesn't understand much if anything about sexuality, so although she doesn't know why she is being approached by others in this way, it makes her extremely uncomfortable and she starts to hate herself. She feels like a freak. As a 10-year-old, she desperately longs for and needs the emotional support and treatment that other 10-year-olds are given. However, because she has lived 16 years and has the body of a 16-year-old woman, that is what people see her as. She can't fit in with other 16-year-olds, but finds herself relating much more to other 10-year-olds. Her life is one of confusion and hurt.

Then, one day, she is given the opportunity for a surgery that would revert her body back to its prepubescent state. After this is done, as well as some other modifications to make her look and sound more like a 10-year-old, she finds herself much happier with life; things improve dramatically for her. Not only do people understand who she truly is, now that she's come out, but her outward appearance finally matches her inner identity. This girl had been suffering from age dysphoria, meaning that her biological age did not run parallel to her inner/emotional age. As a result, she had been living in an unbearable amount of distress prior to the surgery.

As a society, we now understand this sort of thing when it comes to gender. I think it's about time we opened our minds to the possibility that for some people, it could be a similar thing, instead of being with gender, it's with age. I've listened to the stories of a lot of transgender people, researched what gender dysphoria is, and I have to say, it sounds VERY similar to what I'm going through with age. I can't imagine I'm the only person in the world experiencing such feelings. I know this isn't hard-backed science...yet. That's probably just because the issue is so rare, so obscure it hasn't really been studied in depth as of now.

People like me need to make our voices heard. The more we speak up, the more society will have to start listening. Just because something isn't acknowledged by the scientific community right now doesn't mean it won't ever be; remember, science is constantly changing and gaining new insights. Please don't dismiss our identities just because you don't understand them.",17Nov2018,1
78,"Long Post (TL;DR at the bottom)

I am a 27M and I started smoking 4 years ago because of a stressful event. 

I never really liked smoking but it somehow helped me relax and stop being anxious and stressed. Previously I was quite a ""control freak"" person but after I started smoking I calmed down. 

It's now about a week that I am realizing that smoking is not for me but as you may imagine I am addicted. But I have concluded to some facts for me regarding smoking and I think that it may would be helpful for some other people so I am going to present you the results: 

1) Contrary to the general belief that smoking leads to weight loss it is proven that it may have the opposite results. To this day, I have gained almost more than 20Kgs since I started smoking. (75Kgs &gt; 95+, Height 1.8m).I didn't change nothing else in my lifestyle. Only smoking is added. I really didn't change my food habits but I suppose that smoking had a negative impact on my metabolism. 

2) Against  also to the general belief smoking made me less productive by far. A take smoking breaks too often and I procrastinate a lot more and when anxiety (reasonable) kicks in it gets burried under a cigarette. 

3) Sex drive has reached the lowest ever level for me. My SO has accepted that intercourse sessions are lasting way less than before I had started smoking and the times it happens have diminished significantly. (from almost everyday to once a week at best)

4) Smoking for me causes some strange effects for me also: When I smoke I get very sensitive to the refresh rate of all screens surrounding me. I am a composer and I compose in front of my computer. Especially in the morning when the impact of the first cigarette is strong I barely can look at the screen because it is causing me nausea symptoms and dizziness. 

5) I feel that everything is less meaningfull. I see the world around me through ""literally"" fog. My emotions are weaker, my excitement, my sadness, my happiness, everything. It is like the whole world has lost its vibrant colors and everything has turned into gray scale. I can prove it for my self based on the fact that since the few days that I have reduced significantly my intake the ""colors"" are coming back. 

So those are some main points regarding smoking for me. 

Now, I have some days that I am trying to quit and I have realized the following: 

1) I believe that gradual quitting is a more natural way of stopping smoking. It is like the reverse process. You start gradually, you stop gradually. 

2) Scents are essential. I mean, I find that at least for me it is very helpful to be surrounded by nice smells, colognes, aromatic sticks air freshners, freshly washed clothes and everything with a pleasing smell in general. I am sure that it is somehow related to  the brain stimulation process. I feel that if I smoke I will destroy this sensation of cleanliness and coziness. 

3) The first cigarette of the day is the most important to eliminate. I am doing this for at least 5 days and I smoke about  3-5 cigarettes (hand rolled) total from ~10 previously.

In general, I am in a race to win my life back and everyone deserves it. 

Finally, 

If you don't smoke, for God's sake don't even think to start it. It will ruin you. 

If you are smoking, please consider quitting. We are all here trying the same thing. 

TL;DR
I started smoking when 24yo and finally I want to quit this disgusting behavior. ",17Nov2018,1
79,"I feel like my default emotion is sad. I don't really like to do anything, especially alone. When I'm with friends I will play video games and do whatever and might have some fun if I do well, but when I do poorly I feel worse. Through trying new things, failing to do them well, and giving up I've convinced myself not to try anything anymore. All it will do is lead to disappointment in myself not being good enough, and more disappointment when I quit. I constantly question if my friends really want to talk to me or if they just put up with me. I'm 23, cant drive, never been in any sort of relationship or even a date or dance, I go to an online college, I work at a local pizza place but don't really like it because its work, no one likes work they just put up with it to be able to buy stuff, but i dont want anything buyable, and I feel like i don't fit in anywhere. I dont know how to talk to people, I clearly by this post have negative thoughts about myself, I go as far to believe things that I know arent true eg. no one cares, i dont deserve to live etc. I have thoughts about some sort of self inflected injury, normally breaking my own wrists, and have a mini-anxiety attack from it. Thinking stuff like: thats not ok to think, why would i think that, what if that happens, along with sometimes believing it happened.

I feel like I can't get help. I've been to a counselor and a doctor for feeling like this. The counselor i couldn't tell them what was wrong/why i was there because i was too nervous. Similar happened with the doctor visit and i was told to try harder in school. So that gives me cases of trying to get help not working and its just not worth to try to get help because nothing will help.

I'm sorry this is a mess of a post. It's late and I cant think well enough so I just wrote what came to my head. idk what to do. Can i get help?",17Nov2018,1
