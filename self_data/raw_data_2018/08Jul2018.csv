Well today he took my vehicle without permission and ended up damaging it. I knew he had warrants, when I got to the scene he was laughing. So I called the cops on him.

Before he got arrested he gave me his wallet, I looked in it and he had what appears to be crack. I gave the cop his wallet and the crack.  The cop was asking for the wallet anyway.

I called the cops and he's in jail now. ",08Jul2018,46

Over the past year I lost almost all of my friends, my highschool friend group all got partners and became very spiteful towards myself and another single guy in our group and don't talk to us anymore, my university friend group split apart because the /alpha male/ of the group's new girlfriend decided she didn't like me even though we had never met (someone said she was a homophobe (I'm gay)). I've got 3 friends left; one from the highschool group and two from uni but none of them are very social and hate going out. I used to be quite introverted however I still went out every weekend/other weekend or so once I turned 18 for about a year. But over the past year I've wanted to go out more and more and meet new people and expand my circles and I feel better for it when I do interact with people even if it's only ever just a cashier or a doctor. My problem is that no one has ever approached me male or female while I'm on a night out, not once, not in a romantic/sexual context or in a friendly context. It's driving me insane seeing everyone able to go out and always talk to a bunch of people and have people approach them and make friends so easily. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, I think I dress nicely and I try to put out a friendly atmosphere but I don't know how or what it is I need to change to just get someone to talk to me. I think it's because I'm unattractive but people always tell me I'm ""very pretty"" and I can't tell if they're just being polite, I've attached a photo of myself as a reference. I tried going out alone last night and getting very drunk to still have not one person talk to me until I offered two girls a cigarette and we spoke for about 3mins before her very disinterested friend finished hers and they went back inside, if I can muster up the courage to approach someone it always feels like they're being forced to talk to me. I feel so isolated and unwanted to come out and expect to be accepted by the gay community after a lifetime of confusion and rejection only to be rejected by them also for not being a hypermasculine sex machine. I've always struggled with this even before coming out when myself and a group of about 5 friends would go clubbing all the time I just don't know what to do anymore, I just want someone to talk to me and give me a chance everyone says I'm very friendly once they start talking to me I just don't know what I'm doing wrong.

13,"So basically here’s what happened in a nutshell. Back on November 29th of 2017 I had just left work, got on the interstate like any other day. Riding in the carpool lane, moderate traffic, when out of no where a truck merges into my lane about 10 ft in front of me. I grab brakes and hit him. Can’t remember if I blacked out or not, just remember laying on my back not being able to breathe like the wind got knocked out of me. Struggle to take my helmet off because my shoulder got dislocated. People run up and ask if I’m okay, yada yada. Cops, ambulance show up, they tell me my leg is broken. I Immediately get mad, still not in any real pain yet. Get loaded up into the ambulance and get to the hospital in minutes. Find out a few days later after being drugged up, Femur snapped, knee broke in half and my ankle got mangled up. 

Anyways 4 surgeries later and 8 months pass and here I am today finding out I’m getting a settlement for just under a million dollars take home. Even after lawyer fees and medical BS. Still not able to walk at this point, doc said maybe sometime next year. 

I haven’t really elaborated how much not being able to walk sucks, but trust me it does. It’s given me an entirely different outlook in life. Granted it could have been so much worse, and many have paid the ultimate price. 

But I ask, has anyone been in a similar position in their life? What do I do now? I’m getting all this money, but it doesn’t really seem to mean that much to me. Going from barely scraping by to no longer financially struggling, as long as I play my cards right. 

Please leave me some insight if you wish, or ask me to clarify anything because I did leave out a lot for the sake of this not being too boring to read. 

Thank You. ",08Jul2018,6

I feel as if at times I can enjoy every little thing so much, it really is like I can be high on life at times, everything is so peaceful and happy and the smallest things are incredible. I can be content with life with only the air I breathe and everything else is truly a blessing. 

And then things can just be going ok, just one out of a billion living life. 

And then things can be shitty, everything I have once loved holds no interest, boredom and depression are too common in these times. Nothing seems good and happiness is no where to be found. Energy can be so low getting off the couch is like running a marathon, my body even feels physically weak at times.

I’m on a constant journey of self improvement, I’ve even taken out everything negative in my life and implementing positive habits to take its place. I wish I could be happy and content 24/7 but I have learned to realize you must see the dark days to appreciate the good ones. 

Does anyone else feel like this, and have any tips to combat it. I may or may not have bipolar, but in my opinion even if I do it’s just merely a title, everyone’s brain is wired differently after all.

28,"I would like to share with you a Hadith we have in our religion (words spoken by the Prophet) that discusses an extreme case of sin and how this sinner sought repentance after all he has done. I think it applies to anything; religious or personal. It’s never too late to start again.

“There was a man from among a nation before you who killed ninety-nine people and then made an inquiry about the most learned person on the earth. He was directed to a monk. He came to him and told him that he had killed ninety-nine people and asked him if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted. He replied in the negative and the man killed him also completing one hundred.

He then asked about the most learned man in the earth. He was directed to a scholar. He told him that he had killed one hundred people and asked him if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted. He replied in the affirmative and asked, `Who stands between you and repentance? Go to such and such land; there (you will find) people devoted to prayer and worship of Allah, join them in worship, and do not come back to your land because it is an evil place.’

So he went away and hardly had he covered half the distance when death overtook him; and there was a dispute between the angels of mercy and the angels of torment. The angels of mercy pleaded, ‘This man has come with a repenting heart to Allah,’ and the angels of punishment argued, ‘He never did a virtuous deed in his life.’ Then there appeared another angel in the form of a human being and the contending angels agreed to make him arbiter between them. He said, `Measure the distance between the two lands. He will be considered belonging to the land to which he is nearer.’ They measured and found him closer to the land (land of piety) where he intended to go, and so the angels of mercy collected his soul”",08Jul2018,2
30,"The suicide of Anthony Bourdain has really set me thinking. I can’t stop thinking about it, I keep on trying to put myself in his position, trying to understand what pushed him over the edge.

As a person who struggles with similar issues myself, who regularly has suicidal thoughts (but doesn’t ever discuss them or how real they are), a couple of comments he made in two separate episodes of his shows struck me - both jokingly referenced hanging himself in the shower.

I think most hearing these at the time would have thought of them as just another part of his dark sense of humour.

When I’m not feeling acutely suicidal, I try to make light of the absurdity of my situation by making jokes just likes this. Making it funny it normalises it, taking away some of the cognitive dissonance that comes with feeling suicidal at a deep level while continuing to live.

Anyway I just wanted to post this to say this to everyone. If someone you know jokes about their own suicide, pay very close attention to them, there’s a good chance they are seriously not OK.

39,"Before him, I would have never uttered the words ""one day I'll be in an abusive relationship. I won't realize it. I'll make excuses, I'll deny, I'll rationalize, I'll ignore. I'll do everything I said I'd never do"".

Hell, before him I thought I had a good lens on avoiding abuse. I escaped a difficult home life. I thought I knew the signs and triggers. I knew not to let anyone punch me. That was enough right?

But it was more subtle than that. It started out with love bombing. I was so starved for affection that this initial phase completely flew over my head. Hours on the phone. Constant words of admiration and praise. Being doted on and tended to near constantly, sentiments of my beauty and divinity and a worth equal to diamonds ringing in my ears. Being told I was things and could do things that no one had ever encouraged me to do before.

He fawned over me, rarely separate from my voice and touch. Always building me up in some way, always there as a shoulder of affirmation. I was awestruck at the way he seemed obsessed over my simple presence, almost as though I were a lifeline to him. If I was there, his world was perfect. He never seemed to need anything else.

If we couldn't be together, he checked in every day. Sent love notes. Sent fond texts. Lamented over missing me. Gushed over the time spent together being akin to 'heaven', constantly making plans to see me again.

You would have thought I'd become his world, there for him in body, mind, and soul.

So whatever he needed, he got. I jumped to his aid the minute he shed a tear. I stayed up with him for hours when he was scared. Drove across state lines just to see him for an afternoon, leaving my job, spending money I didn't have, and jeopardizing my health just because he asked.

I tried to be everything for him, because I thought I owed him that. Advice, comfort, affirmation. I thought this was transactional. He saturated me in care, so the least I could do was give him everything I had in return.

This was the first act.

I had been sick and throwing up the first time we were to meet. This was after night after night up on the phone with him (first he was scared of some party he went to, then he was tripping, then his friends were bullying him, etc.) He didn't have a job or bills and I noticed his behavior/lifestyle was very reckless, but brushed it off. I had been slacking at work due to lack of sleep and cut down my paychecks in the process of allotting time to see him.

But I told myself none of this mattered, just so long as I could hear one more 'you're beautiful, you're worth diamonds, you make my heart sing, I want to be with you forever'.

That morning I threw up and ignored my account being in overdraft after booking a shuttle bus to his place. He seemed slightly annoyed and implied I was faking illness to get out of seeing him. I was determined to prove him wrong, and left my job after securing a sub.

In the process of catching the shuttle, I had become sun burned and passed out from heat exhaustion. He seemed equally annoyed, finally just telling me to let him know when I would be there and that 'he'd wait'.

Four hours later I met him. He kind of smelled and was very eager to take me to the bedroom. I could barely walk because my feet had blisters but I didn't say anything. He mock sympathized with my sunburns as he took my dress off. He didn't go down on me but I went down on him, multiple times, then we had sex for about 30 seconds and I went down on him 2 or 3 more times. He stunk, and hadn't shaved. It was awful, but I endured it.

The next morning I got to hear about how wonderful I was, my amazing sexual prowess, my goddess-like body, etc. He showered me in compliments and asked me for more sexual favors which I obliged. I hadn't particularly enjoyed myself, as it had hurt a lot and he complained about lube and foreplay, but again I just shut up about my feelings. I was this beautiful queen, after all.

He took me to a movie which I paid for, not having the guts to tell him I had no more money between booking the shuttle bus and cutting my work hours. He was very insistent, and still on a body worship tangent so how could I say no? That wasn't my place. He was good to me, he was.

Afterward I threw up again because I hadn't had anything to eat in roughly two days. I managed to squeak out that I was hungry, he brought me a bowl of cereal, then recoiled when it came back up. Of course he would, indigestion is gross. I apologized profusely and we occupied ourselves with his movies and TV shows for a while. Then I went down on him again.

When it was time to go, he launched into another lovey dovey rant about how much fun he had and how much he loved being with me, eagerly making plans to meet again. He lauded me profusely, my appearance, my body, my sexual appetite. I could barely get him to let me go as the bus pulled up.

When I got back, I wolfed down a whole pizza, two bags of popcorn, a burger, and six lunchables. I promptly broke out into some full body rash afterwards. Never did find out the cause. 

I met up with him again several weeks later, and the dynamic was similar. Doing anything he said at the drop of a hat, going anywhere he wanted to go, and staying up as late as he wanted. Every time, I would just ignore my responsibilities at home. I wouldn't think about skipping out on my job or the next overdraft fee. As long as he was happy, I was happy. I basked in the warmth of his compliments and praise, basked in the attention, basked in his showers of love.

But slowly, the first signs of unhappiness began to creep in. I didn't even recognize them at the time. 

We began to have very occasional spats. In hindsight, I was the one instigating most of them because I didn't know how to voice that I was unhappy because I didn't know anything was wrong. He was still calling me every night gushing over my beauty, he was still fawning over our time together, we were still up on video chat for hours giggling like school kids. He made me cutesy little videos and bought me stuffed animals. He deferred to me for life advice concerning work and school, he would comfort me when I was upset and had to make up a bullshit reason why because I couldn't articulate that I was frustrated with him.

I was his goddess, his queen, his life partner. He'd go off on tangents concerning everything we'd do once we graduated. He'd make movies with me, buy a house with me, adopt dogs and set us up a perfect existence by a lake. I was spellbound, enraptured, and afraid all at once.

I thought I was afraid of him loving me. I thought some natural fear at the notion of being cared for to this degree was to be expected. He *was* good to me. At that point, he hadn't laid a finger on me. He didn't call me names or raise his voice. He held me close and kissed me when I said I was ugly. That was love. That was all I needed.

Yet we continued our spats. By a year in, we had fought a considerable amount, mostly insignificant squabbles. We met up for our ""anniversary"", despite not taking the plunge into a serious relationship. That was the only day I can say I felt content with him. His presence was neutral, but for the first time I got to explore his city. I had been wanting to move there for years, and figured this was the next step. Since, after all, he was 'so in love with me'.

By this point, there were a considerable amount of red flags I was purposely ignoring. He didn't want me to meet anyone in his life, or take me anywhere in public around people he knew. I became concerned because if I was his 'soulmate', I should be involved in his life right? In fact, he kept me such a secret that even his close friends weren't aware of me.

In private, everything was rainbows and roses. He gushed over me nonstop. But for some reason, he had to keep me hidden.

Another red flag was his tendency to get physical when angry. I was grabbed, blocked from leaving, yanked, pulled, scratched, and squeezed to the point of bruises multiple times by him. However, he would apologise afterwards and spin it in a way to where I believed it was my fault, i.e. 'well you scared me', or 'well you shouldn't have been arguing with me'.

A third major red flag was his lack of knowledge concerning responsibility. In almost 24 years, he had never paid a single bill. His parents wiped his ass for him. He stayed up obscenely late, partied hard, spent money like it was candy. That lifestyle was afforded to him because all his expenses were funded by his family, but it irked me. He was embarrassed of this, too, and would lie to his friends about living at home which was just pathetic.

A fourth red flag that slowly began to surface was his habit of pathologically lying. If I didn't catch him lying to me, I would catch him lying to others. He would lie in almost any way and about nearly anything he felt he could get away with. Little lies such as where he'd be a particular night and big lies such as his financial situation, his job, his sexual history. Half the time he'd admit it, half the time he'd stick to his guns even when I had solid proof.

So, I learned later that he lied to everyone about who I was, lied to me about what I meant to him, lied about what he wanted concerning our relationship, lied about why he kept me a secret, lied about cheating on me, lied about loving me, lied to others when he was with me so they wouldn't suspect anything, lied to the girls he cheated with that he was single, lied about how he treated me, lied about making fun of me to his friends, lied about what our relationship was, and lied about protecting me.

He trashed me online and denied it. His friends bullied me and he denied it. He hooked up with multiple people and denied it. He lied so much he would confuse himself and that's when I'd catch him. Still he'd lie.

But in private, I was still 'the one'. He was still going to spend 'the rest of his life' with me.

I learned later that the pattern of behavior he used on me, manipulating someone younger into thinking all their dreams had come true, was/is a consistent tactic with him. I watched him use it on giggly airheaded high schoolers after me, once I had become wise. Which is why justice will never be truly served.

He's with someone else now, and of course that girl will eventually wise up like I did, but at the point he'll just swoop to another 18 year old. He could do this until he's 90. There will always be some dumb high school senior, and he likes that. So I'm left to lament on my own while he never truly learns his lesson.

After I moved to his city, we fought near constantly because I was sick of being led on. It was already over by this point.

But when I would try to break up with him, he would convince me not to, or otherwise guilt me. He'd cry, or we'd go a few days without contact and then he'd want to hook up again so I'd oblige. After all this time, I still couldn't say no to him. He'd bawl out 'Don't leave me' and 'you're the only one who loves me' and 'I'm nothing without you' until I was sobbing and took everything back.

Even the night I found him discussing getting a new girlfriend with his best friend (who was obsessed with him, different story), I broke up with him on the spot, he sobbed and tried to stop me from leaving, then texted and called me incessantly until I agreed to give him another chance. I found him and his friends mocking me a couple weeks later, tried to break it off, he physically restrained me. I caught him cheating and he chased me in his car, wouldn't let me leave, and convinced me to go to bed with him to make up for it.

I was so fucking miserable all of the time. I hated him by that point. As a minor note, by the last few months he had gotten a fairly well paying job, started moving out, and his skin had cleared up. This was all it took for him to start thinking he was God's gift to women. He became cocky, puffed up, arrogant, snide, and more abrasive than before. I instantly lost all attraction for him, but still stayed.

I still stayed. I hated myself, him, and life, and still stayed.

He only unlatched from me when another girl expressed wanting to be involved with him, which he also kept under wraps. At that point, he deleted his social media so she couldn't read what he wrote about me or see what I had supposedly meant to him. He wiped his life, and she has no idea. Only at that point did he start leaving me alone. At that point, I was an inconvenience to *him*.

The lovey dovey sentiments stopped overnight, and shifted to cold, irritated regard. He still thinks I don't know. He thinks I'm that dense, and that after knowing him 2.5 years I still can't tell when he's lying through his teeth. As if at this point I don't know him better than anyone else.

Who can say how this relationship will turn out. I suspect it will crash and burn, but that will take years, just like he kept me reeled in for years.

As for myself, I'm taking things very very slowly with a co-worker of mine I've known since last year. It's already completely different, but I'm cautious. 

I told myself I would never be involved with a man who didn't treat me right. But that's how they get you. They tout themselves as 'not like other guys'. My ex is a proud feminist online and champions women's rights. No one knows what he did to me and he'll be sure to keep it that way. The only other person who might know is his first ex, who I'm still tempted to contact. She might have a few stories to tell.",08Jul2018,57
40,"I turned 18 last month. I haven’t lived with my parents since I was 13, (a story for another day...) but when I turned 18 I had to move out of the family members house who I had been living with since 13. Not because of anything I did, just a crappy situation involving income. 

So I’ve been staying with a friend, but in two months I’m moving in with two of my other friends. We just signed a lease, we got our place. So in just a couple months I’m going to be paying rent and utilities and living in a place of my own for the first time. 

I’m 95% on my own. I’m not close with my family- I have really great friend tho. They’re all 4-7 years older than me too, which is good for me, especially because I’ve always been mature.  So any advice about staying away from partying and being wild isn’t needed (LOL) I’m pretty mild. 

I do have one family member who helps me out with a few bills when they can, like college textbooks (I recently finished my first year!) and my insurance. 

But I still get stressed out about “adulting” or whatever. Even though I’ve been taking care of myself to a pretty big extent for years now, something about these past few months terrifies me. 

College is hard, duh, but I work two jobs, where I don’t make enough money, and balancing classes and work and time for myself seems impossible sometimes. This weekend I missed about 3 assignments simply because I was just so exhausted. 

And I’m worried about paying rent. I’ve got a fake amount  of money saved up (1,700) but lately saving past that has been difficult. I don’t have health insurance and I’m trying to figure out how to get it and what I can qualify for and that’s all very confusing.  I struggle with self esteem issues,  I worry how that will be when I’m living with my two friends who are insanely beautiful.  Lastly, I love my soon to be roommates very much, and I don’t want us to fight after moving in. 

TL;DR:   I’m 18, I’m recently on my own. I’m looking for tips on how to be a good adult. How to stay motivated at college. How to manage my time. How to get along with my friends once we move in together. What I should know now that I’m officially out there in... the world.  I’m more scared than I like to let on.

42,"Hello,

I'm Rosie, and I'm a Research Assistant working on this project at the University of Chester. We are aiming to develop and validate a measure of the sense of self. In the long-term, we hope this research helps us to develop useful interventions targeting loss of sense of self, and accurately assessing their effectiveness and efficacy.

The survey takes approx 20 minutes to complete, and any information you give is completely anonymous and confidential. The information you give will be used for the above aims, and we hope to publish our findings in academic journals. Anyone over 16 and who can speak fluent English can take part. We have full ethical approval from the University of Chester's Department of Psychology's Ethics committee, and all stages of the study follow the British Psychological Society's guidelines. There are no conflicts of interest - this is funded internally by the University of Chester.

43,"I'm 18. He's never hit me. He maybe spanked me once or twice as a kid or grabbed me a bit hard, but that's it. Yet I get so scared of him hitting me to the point of crying.

Sometimes he's happy and making jokes and it's okay and I feel stupid for every wanting to run away. Then sometimes he gets angry over a joke I made that he didn't like or because I didn't remind him to buy flour yet I dared ask him if he bought it. He yells at me at tells me to remember where my place is and that I'm not allowed to talk back. Today he threatened me with the classic 'shut up or else' so I asked him if he was going to hit me and he said I 'deserved it' but denied wanting to hit me. After the shouting he ignores me for hours and has a very intimidating atmosphere around him. He won't even talk to me if I ask him a question.

Mum says my worries don't make sense. But when she's there he never gets as angry as when we're alone. She says I'm being dramatic and she has no idea why I'm scared. She says he's just moody from old age or the medication he's taking. He never talks about his feelings. He tried to hide having a heart attack. He would have never gone to a hospital if mum didn't see him clutching his chest outside.

I know what I feel but I don't know what I should think. I have mental health issues so I don't know if I should trust my gut and move out or stay and trust my parents. I can't afford to move out anyway.",08Jul2018,1
46,"Me and my husband went to seek help for our autistic son on Starcraft reddit and we were promptly banned for ""trolling"". Not long before that they called us names and threw offenses at us. 

Having very little experience on this ""Reddit"" we searched on the internet and found out that ""trolling"" is a form of virtual bullying that bad intentioned users employ to harm others. 

All we wanted was to help our son play his game.

Before we ventured on this website my brother warned us that it does have very active hate communities made of alt-right wingers. As liberals and peace-seekers we thought that good manners would be enough to deal with this kind of threat. We were wrong.

Is the world so full of hate that even children are targets of hate and anger?

47,So I decided that I wanted to go on a bike ride with a couple of my friends through the trail I've gone through before. I told my parents that morning and they said sure. I told them that I was going out and I would be back at around 4 o'clock. My mom and dad stopped me and started to argue because I didn't fully explain the them where I was going. My dad then starts to get really angry and said somethings that really hurt. I'm just sitting here at my computer not knowing what to do. I didn't know a slip up on my end could lead to something this bad. I just kinda want to run away and never come back.,08Jul2018,1

49,"I've had several opportunities for casual sex since then but I can't help but be so cynical. Why would I go through the effort of bringing someone home if I still have no idea what I'm doing and will just disappoint myself and them?

If I had a relationship with someone I trust and could take my time with, that'd be the greatest. I suppose I'm just one of those people who needs that emotional connection. I'd choose cuddling over pumping away, if I had a choice.

I don't know, should I be passing up opportunities out of fear (and realistic expectations, honestly) of just disappointing eachother? I wish I just had someone to explore it with naturally and patiently instead of random drunk stuff I can't prepare myself for. Maybe I'm just old fashioned. Still very very glad I did lose it though, that's a weight off my shoulders already.",08Jul2018,2
50,"An old lady fell on the subway and seemed hurt, she very much looked crazy and was cursing out people trying to help her up. I believe she was haitian, because she was speaking a strange sounding french and looked of african descent. 2 people who tried to help her ended up giving up when she started getting really nasty to them, and a homeless guy stepped in and berated the 2 people saying that just because she was cursing at you doesn't mean that you shouldn't help someone who could very much be hurt. A group of teenage girls witnessing this started clapping as he helped the old lady up. To be fair, they were mostly joke clapping, but still. Then after some guy gave the guy money. Idk how much money, but I saw it. The guy was asking for money before on the subway, so it wasn't weird. 

Idk if you have ever been on the /r/thathappened subreddit, there is a stereotype joke about how obviously fake stories always have 'people on the bus started clapping' and then 'someone came out of nowhere and gave the person 100 dollars' as sort of an add on to the obvious fakeness of the story.

51,"I used to live with just my boyfriend, so would often wear shorts and a cami with no bra. Now I'm living with my older brother too, and as much as he's a great brother, he's also a guy that I don't want seeing my nipples and ass. It sucks so bad because it's really hot this season, but I have to wear at least a sports bra all the time and either long pants or spandex under my shorts. So sweaty =(  

As much as I know he is respectful, I know he would see me (or at least my parts) as sexual if I dressed like I want to. And I REALLY REALLY REALLY don't want him to think of me that way.

56,"Three years ago I told my best friend to finally get over her FWB breaking it off. I didn’t feel like a heartless person because she’d been wallowing in self-pity for several months by then and I couldn’t see her do this to herself anymore. But I’ve never truly liked anyone. 

Last week I put on my big girl pants and asked out a good friend of mine. We were both quite drunk but he was ecstatic, so we made out and went home to make out some more, discussed a relationship, and suddenly he broke down and said that he can’t do it because after more than a decade, he’s still not over the girl who messed him up. I rubbed his back and told him it’s alright. Maybe I was even a little glad in that moment, because honestly, I’m terrified of relationships.
The next day he texted me that about not remembering anything but the rejection. 

Well, joke’s on me! I guess I hadn’t realized how much I liked him. 
It’s been eight days and I can’t get over it. During the day I have migraines and I can’t sleep at night because my heart is racing and it literally feels like it’s falling, like wtf?

I’m on holidays right now and had to cut back the daily crying because I’m here with a friend and don’t want to be a party pooper, but every couple I see makes me feel nauseous. I think of the guy basically 24/7.

I don’t want to bother my friends with this shit because I feel like my behavior is ridiculous considering that I only made out with him for about an hour, but I’ve never felt so crappy in my life.

I don’t know what to do with myself. I can’t sleep, so I’m writing this post. I apologized to my best friend for being insensitive back then and I apologize to everyone who’s been lovesick for ever thinking you weak.

58,"Star Wars is now the Sonic the Hedgehog of movie franchises and here's why:

* Both Star Wars and Sonic have been around for like a billion years.
* There are Star Wars fans and there are Sonic fans, with a lot of fiery fans supporting their franchises no matter what, to the point of insanity and delusion.
* Whilst Star Wars fans can be split into prequel fans and prequel haters, Sonic fans can be split into 3D and 2D fans. The split is mostly determined by age and when the fans were introduced to the franchise and generally the two groups of fans generally regard each other as lesser beings for their choice.
* Similarly, both franchises have fans that exclusively only like the earliest incarnations of the series and nothing else.
* Both Star Wars and Sonic have had spin-off titles that the studios would rather audiences forget ever happened.",08Jul2018,0
59,"Hi all! I’m not sure where to post this so I guess I’ll post it here and hope for some replies 😐 

So I have an issue.. not sure where to start. I’m Mexican. I was born from a family with a very tanned/ dark skin complexion but unlike them.. I was born white as fuck. 

Ever since I was born I could notice that my family/ extended family would envy me for my skin color which ultimately caused me to become the black sheep of the family. I kinda just got hated on by them for something I couldn’t control. 

Anyway, my skin tone played a huge part in my upbringing and how I am today due to the experiences attached to it. At first I hated that I was this white since I didn’t “belong” but over time I started liking it. Fuck my asshole family but.. I started liking it too much. 

At around 16ish I started seeing myself as darker than I actually was. People would often tell me how pale I was but I saw myself as really dark skinned.. sometimes I’d compare myself to someone who I thought was whiter than me but when I looked at the mirror side by side most of the time I’d be paler.. 

I’m not sure why but when I look in the mirror I see how things really are but when I look at myself things are like idk it’s like what I’m seeing isn’t there. For example, when I first started wearing shorts i thought my legs were dark af but when I looked in the mirror I saw (my true skin color) that they were in fact pale.. 

I think I have a problem.. 

Suggestions?

60,"-Why do you buy them knowing it’s fake?,
-Why do you get angry when someone else points out it’s fake?
-Why did you start doing so?
-Do you feel the Items are as good as the original?
-Have you ever stopped doing it?, Why?

I genuinely don’t understand the mentality of buying something fake while knowing it is. Personally i’d rather save for the item or buy from a brand that’s not as good as the high end one if it’s necessary (example, instead of a pair of Levi’s i’d buy a pair of jeans at ZARA), it won’t ever be as good as the high end one, but at least i know i’m rewarding and supporting a brand i like. But my preference is saving up for the item i want. I really don’t mean to judge people based on their choices, but I’m curious as to why people would rather buy a fake rather than saving up for the original or buying something on sale, being that there are many legitimate ways of getting original items at a much lower price than normal (Costco sells high end brand items at low prices, for example).",08Jul2018,1
