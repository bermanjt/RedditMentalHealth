2,"I don't know how else to describe my mood lately. I have crying fits randomly throughout the day and feel choked up all the time. 

I started a new job in August and it's nothing like any job I've ever had before. I went from making smoothies to being yelled at over the phone for things that aren't my fault and that I can't at all fix. I'm not even upset at the people who are yelling, I'm just sad that there's nothing I can do about it and that every time I answer the phone I might have to go through it all again. 

It's the best paying job I've ever had and I finally have health and dental insurance, I'm not struggling to pay bills every week, and I don't think I'll ever have an opportunity like this again. Even the friend who got me the job has said it isn't worth the toll on my mental health but the thought of going back to how things were financially before getting this job makes me feel sick to my stomach. 

I'm just really sad tonight and needed to get it off my chest. I can't talk about it in real life without sobbing so I'm shouting it to the void instead.",15Dec2018,1
3,"I’m 80/90% sure I’m pregnant. I have the test right next to me and I keep putting off taking it because I think I’ll have a panic attack if I see it confirmed. If I am pregnant I’m having an abortion no questions asked. But it’s still super scary. My boyfriend is 4 hours away and can’t come see me because of work. I don’t have any close friends I’d be comfortable having with me for emotional support. I don’t want to tell my parents because I don’t want them to judge me and I don’t trust my mom not to tell her sisters.

I want to take it though so I can known for sure. I don’t want to wait for my boyfriend to be able to come see me in over a week.

Does anyone have any suggestions for how I can distract myself after? If it is positive? I don’t know how I’m going to react but if it’s a panic attack I want to be prepared if possible.

If this should be posted in a different subreddit please let me know.

I know everyone goes through this but I wanna get it off my chest. I just ended my first semester of college and I truly feel so lost. I know I’m young and have time to figure things out but I have no clue what I want to do with my life and it’s eating away at me. I feel like all I do is school work school work and I still have no money and it’s only gonna get worse once I have more bills to pay and my loans to pay off. I feel like I haven’t made anything of myself so far and I am afraid I am not motivated enough to become successful in life.  I just feel really low and confused all the time and little hope for my future",15Dec2018,1

We got a result for a test yesterday and my friend got more than me (like 3% better) and when I told him my mark he said ""thats good"" and I got so annoyed at that. It was a something nice but it annoyed me and idk why. Another friend got me a good present for Chrisrmas but it wasn't anything personal so I thought she hated me and was sending me a message.

9," I haven't really written anything like this before but just needed to get my feelings out of my head.  for context I left school this year and had one term at uni. Any thoughts lol? Can you relate?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I worry that I’m never ever going to meet people again like the friends I had at school. And I probably won’t, I know I won’t. There are little subtle things about them like their humour, and other things that I can’t really pinpoint, which seem as though they can’t be replicated with anyone else or any other relationship I’m going to form. My friends are so unique and interesting to me. The back and forth we had when talking, to me just felt immaculate. of course they’re my friends so I think they are the funniest people in the world, but I miss the people who could make me laugh so much until it hurt, with just a few words and some sideways glances.There’s never going to be a time in my life again where they are the people I see day in and day out. There were endless days spent laughing at the dumbest shit. And deep chats about the things we were feeling and thinking about the world and our friends and our crushes and school and teachers and our lives. Those days are dead now, and that’s been making me feel lonely, and now its as if I don’t really know how not to feel lonely anymore. 

There’s going to be more talking and good times like that in the future, with them, and with other people, but it’s never going to be the same. At that time, we shared so much of our lives, there was so much time we had in common but now we’ve all taken different routes as we move on to the next stage of our lives which we thought about so much during that time, our adulthood. I can never go back to that time again, the times I spent at school. Because I’ve moved on, and I’m at uni now. we’ve all moved on, and I’m an adult, having been launched into adulthood so immediately. And when I’m doing my own weekly shopping for food, or taking really late walks alone at night to clear my head, It’s difficult to know whether the hundreds of hours I spent with them ever real. I know that sounds dumb, but it’s because my memories aren’t a physical place I can go back to. If I tried to go back to school now, it would just be the same school a few months after I left, I couldn’t return to the place I want to go back to in my memories.

I saw some of them today, I’m back home for the christmas holidays and one of them had a birthday party. And I had good times with them again. The same banter. Of course at uni I’ve made new friends and had good times and good laughs with them but everything at uni feels so new still, even though at the moment it is my whole life and my whole time and I’m in that bubble now, I feel so odd and I have for a few months since the summer, like me but not quite me anymore, a new me, to meet all the new people, and I can still laugh with the new people but it’s not quite the same because there’s not quite the same level of connectedness (yet.) It felt really really nice being with these people again who I’ve known for years, and shared time with whilst being a teenager, because I love them so much. When I saw them again the dead memories seemed to become real somehow, because they were something that we all share. But although it was a nice time, It was mixed with sadness, because this was not only one day out of many consecutive days we’ll see each other, but one of the few times a year we’ll all be together.",15Dec2018,1
10,"because theyre definitely talking about you when youre not around.

i found myself in situation where i would hangout with my friend and *their* friends who would seem awkward or standoffish. i thought they were just nervous but after several times of us all hanging out and that energy was *still* in the air i knew something was up. i noticed this friend of mine would neglect our friendship until their friends upset them. then they run back to me and rant about how shitty, fake, and inconsiderate their friend is and so on. then when my friend is bored of me or upset with me, they run back to the so called ""shitty"" friends and sabotage my name. once we all hangout again, that awkward energy remains in the air.

I can’t really explain the whole situation because it’s too complex but my dad made a mistake, didn’t cheat or commit a crime but he texted someone behind our back. I personally didn’t think it was “divorce worthy” per say, but it was still a horrible decision. When my mom read his phone when he was taking our dog on a walk she threw it across the room twice. When he got home they got into a huge shouting match. Telling my dad he needs to leave right now and that he would get divorce papers on Monday. My dad was crying, he didn’t want to leave. I tried to negotiate with her but when he came back into the room. My mom said she would call the cops. I went to a different room to watch tv.

14,"I went through a bit of trauma this past summer. My bf at the time (of 6 years) was an alcoholic and attempted to kill himself through a fairly violent method while I was with him. The whole ordeal was pretty dramatic and I only recently stopped constantly replaying the events in my head. He was in the hospital for a little under a month and I was by his side constantly, sleeping in the chair next to his bed and only going home to shower once a day at most. After he was discharged, he couldn't come back to live in our apartment straight away because he wasn't mobile, so he went to stay with family about an hour away. We're college students in our senior year, and I got my first job since high school while he was away. I felt really good being independent, working and living alone. I made friends at work, when I didn't have any friends at all besides him up until then. I decided to break up with him because I didn't feel like I needed him and I had some resentment toward him because of his addiction and attention seeking behavior. Throughout all of this, I felt extremely calm and level headed. I didn't feel sad leaving him, I just felt content and free. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was with my ex, he was constantly drinking, but I never had more than a glass or two at a time because I didn't feel the need to. I just had no desire to get drunk, I was content with myself. I was disgusted by him when he was drunk. Very quickly after I ended things, I started seeing another guy. I like him a lot and he pushes me to go out and have a good time and meet people-- things that were never in my comfort zone before. I think he is helping me to become a better person and grow, and I make an effort to go along with it for this reason (and I always end up having fun). 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, although everything seems to be going ok for me, I am so deeply unhappy with everything. I can't put my finger on a specific thing that is causing me distress, but I am always on edge. I feel so emotionally fragile. I feel codependent because I hate being alone now. When I'm alone, I don't do anything because nothing seems appealing. I don't even like listening to music anymore because I get so frustrated by it. I get mad because my boyfriend can usually only see me about once a week due to our work schedules, I get mad just from thinking about my job, I get mad at my cats when they make sounds, I get mad when I'm driving, I get mad because of the weather, I get mad about my financial issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to drink all the time now. I don't drink a lot, just having a glass of wine in my hand is enough to make me feel a little better. I don't get drunk, but I am always drinking when I'm home alone. It's like a pavlovian response; i've conditioned myself to feel relief just from pouring a glass of wine. Last month, I had suicidal thoughts for about 2 weeks straight, so I went to see a therapist at my university. I've met with her 3 times, but I pretty much just tell her how I've been doing and then the session is over so it hasn't helped at all. I still have suicidal thoughts every once in a while, but they pass quickly. I feel hopeless, like there's no point to anything. Why am I working 40 hours a week and doing coursework when I'm still going further and further into debt every month because my rent is more than I make, let alone food and gas? Why do I always want my boyfriend to come over and hang out with me when I am always so disappointed when he leaves? Why do I feel such a deep hatred or at least apathy toward almost everything? I just want to go back to how I was before all of this. I felt so level-headed and clear. Now everything is fuzzy and all I feel is anger or despair or fear.

16,"Today I found out my sister got married after knowing someone for four months. From
Facebook. She didn’t even have the tact to tell me. We text every other day and I thought we were super close. But I suppose I don’t matter to her as much as I thought.

This girl is 21 and a sophomore in college and doesn’t even know how to do her taxes. I had to teach her how to do her own FAFSA last week and helped her open her own credit card two months ago. She didn’t know what a credit score was until a few months ago.

She just got an apartment with this person and they’ve only lived with each other for a week. This person she married is newly out as trans, has no support group or friends except my sister, and a terrible upbringing with abusive parents which leads me to believe that if anything happens in the relationship she will have a mental break as they are still in the honeymoon stage of this relationship. My sister was also an RA but now she’s giving up that job to live with this person because she thinks they’re in love.

Am I wrong for thinking this is the stupidest thing my sister could do with herself? And for feeling slightly betrayed that I got this news from fucking Facebook? It would be a lie to say I want to be supportive because right now I’m just angry that she wouldn’t tell me. Like—if you think your relationship is so strong, let me tell you what I think before you sign the papers. ",15Dec2018,1

19,"It’s not that I just hate them and want them to die, I love people, I just sort of clickbaited this so people read up. But one thing I noticed is whenever someone who had some kind of retardation talks to me I always freeze up and act weird because I don’t understand how to talk to them.

Also I feel weird touching them, maybe I subconsciously think it’s because they might pick their nose more and stuff. Because when I wrestle and I’m in “I don’t care what gross stuff happens” mode. Once I wrestled someone with high functional down syndrome (or some other form of retardation) immediately after I saw him wipe a fat load of snot from his nose with his hand the ref blew the whistle and had us shake hands. Snot and all, and I didn’t care at that time.

So maybe it’s not that I hate them I just think they do disgusting things because they don’t know better, but sometimes it’s just irrational for me to avoid them and it makes me feel really really bad.

Sometimes I got into  the special ed halls because the wing of the building was built just this year and they have those cool fountains where they fill up your water bottle if you put it under the sensor. Anyway, I’m fine drinking my water after filling a water bottle with the special sensor but a couple days ago I lost my water bottle, I dug in my bag looking for it, it wasn’t there and I was thirsty. So I put my mouth to the actual fountain part and when I pressed the button I felt terribly uncomfortable and dirty and sad with myself, then even worse realizing that I felt that way probably just because the people who are in those halls have mental retardation.

How do I get over that, it makes me feel bad that I don’t necessarily like them",15Dec2018,1

I feel like we have an amazing connection, one that I’ve never felt with any previous relationship. There is days where marriage has even crossed my mind. We live in a place where we both get to do what we love most, skiing and snowboarding. Currently I’m living a really awesome life, living in a mountain town, with the man I love. 

The thing is, I met him in a town that I was living in, thousands of kms away from my family. Lately I just can’t seem to shake off the idea that if I spent my life with him, I would never be anywhere near my family. He has told me doesn’t have any desire whatsoever to live in my home city. My family is so incredibly important to me. If I were to ever have kids of my own, it’s so important that they have grandparents in their life. My grandparents are also aging, and since I’ve been away for the last 5 years on the other side of the country, I’ve seen very little of them and it makes me very sad. I found out my grandpa had a stroke the other day and it was so scary to hear because I’m not anywhere close to him. He’s ok but for all I know, he could have another and it could be fatal. I also miss my cottage SO much. It is truly the happiest place on earth. I hate to say it but this has caused my to fantasize about other men but in my home city. 

I’m at such a crossroads because the idea of us breaking up makes me so sad and I don’t know if I’d ever get over him. I also feel like if I stay with him, I will constantly have the idea of moving back home in the back if my mind. When I look at my future, I can’t see him being in it. I’m also scared that if I leave him and move back to my home city, I’ll regret it from setting my expectations too high. Long distance wouldn’t really work, because he would never want to move to my home city, and if I want this future in my life, then obviously I wouldn’t go back out to where he is.

Every day that goes by I feel even more mentally drained and hopeless. I don’t have any idea what I’m living for anymore besides the fact that I’m to scared to hang myself already and to sad thinking about how much it would hurt my mom if I did that to her. Although at the same time it seems unfair that I have to massively struggle through every day barely holding it together just to finally lay down for a few hours until I can fall asleep then wake up and repeat my soul crushing pattern of school and sleep. I can hardly eat more than a meal per day and no matter how much I’m actually able to sleep it’s useless because I’m drained all day anyways. I was able to drain out a decent amount of my depression with weed and substances for the first half of this year until my mom caught me smoking and grounded me completely giving me no freedom and not even allowing me to posses my own money anymore since she’s afraid I’ll use it to buy drugs. 


I’m just so lost. The more I ponder life the more I realize how useless it is and the more I struggle to survive day to day the more I just want it to be over.

29,"I have periodontal gum disease caused by an epilepsy medication I had to take for quite a few years. To put it shortly the medication ate my teeth from the inside out and they are at the point  to where I can't brush them because of exposed nerves. 

One tooth crumbled and broke off in mid April of this year and about the beginning of November I started to get a nauseating throbbing pain from it to the point where I had no choice but to make a dentist appointment to have it pulled. 

Now to my knowledge Medicaid didn't pay for any kind of dental work except for a cleaning twice a year. But as I sat in the chair the assistant told me that Medicaid would pay for whatever I needed to have done except for root canals and caps they even cover dentures. 

After she told me I sat in that chair and was trying so hard to hold back tears of joy (I think the assistant knew I was trying not to cry) I finally will be able to smile and show my teeth again without being embarrassed. I used to have beautiful white teeth and that medication ruined my teeth I've dealt with not being able to eat too much sweet stuff or drinking too hot or cold things. 

I told the assistant that was the best Christmas present I have ever gotten. My state just recently passed dental coverage in my state on Medicaid in July and I had no idea so after dealing with  throbbing pain for 3 months I found out I could've gotten it taken care of sooner.

35,"I recall the day well, I remember feeling like my brain felt like it could never be the same. I was never the happiest kid, grew up the weird kid who stayed quiet on the school bus hoping the bullies would forget I was there. I spoke to nobody, not that I didnt try. They just didnt really want to speak to me. Then it happened, the day I finally connected with somebody. Not just in meeting, but connected as in met somebody my soul bonded to. An instant friendship leading to a best friendship. 
We remained inseparable for 3 years, spending nearly every day together. I had another home, another family, another half.
When I lost that half it broke me
I wasnt perfect before this, maybe even predestined for depression to develop later in life. However, I remember the feelings that occurred on that day, they were different than any sadness I had ever experienced. 
 Looking back, I doubt me smoking weed was what the fight really was about. But it's all the explanation I had. Not that arguments was something unusual for us but we never had a chance to have another.
I sure tried. Kinda.
I wanted the confrontation, I even wrote three pages of things I was going to say.
""Sorry, I didnt know I was going to hurt you."" 
""We had talked about trying it so much, I thought you would be excited!""
""I'll never do it again."" 
Three pages of begging, pleading, her to let me back into her life. I was ready to present it to her, finally after getting her boyfriend to agree to let us speak. Again, looking back, I think he was always the reason for this. We agreed to meet after school.
My pages were never heard.
Upon seeing me, I watched them turn and walk out the door.
I cried the whole way home, knowing that was my only chance. Defeated without a fight, I crawled into bed and cried the rest of the day and all through the night. 
My tears were finally dry when I woke, yet my head pounded with a force I had never felt up until that point. Everything hurt. I missed school that day. 
From that point, I began harming myself showing back up to school in bandages because my dad didnt want my self inflicted burns visable.
My bandaged arm dropped the notes I had planned to read on her desk. I watched her tuck them away, watched her till the bell rang, watched her throw my apology away without a glance. 
There was a toxin growing inside of me, one that spewed out when I spoke. One that effected me and eventually everyone around me. The pain I felt I inflicted onto others. I started hanging out with people she looked up to and then talking bad about her. I wanted her to be hated, her to be the crazy one. 
The toxin has settled into the cracks left in my brain from the day it snapped. Healed inside of the wounds. I don't know what to do to get it out, I just know the shame I feel when it leaks. I'm still a bad person, I still hurt people because it's become my first instinct. 
But honestly, I don't know if that toxic nature was there all along and I just didnt notice. Maybe there was a reason more than me trying weed, and it was just a scape.

I can smile when life wants me to frown

I can get back up when life pushes me down

I love life even though life does not always love me

I must continue on for this is reality

Life handles me, but I handle it right back

I am not the type to seek vengeance

and give your heart a whack

I aim high when I reach for the sky

I reach for a lifeline

when the grains of sand hurt at life's beach

I savor the rain

when the sun burns and causes pain

I press play in life and continue

even when I am dealt strife

Life and I are connected like husband and wife",15Dec2018,1
37,"So I have had a really long relationship with my ex(f) for more than 3 years and we broke up about a month ago. I found out through my ex that my longtime friend(m) and she were going to fuck just to fuck which they did a couple of times. I found out a week into that happening. She confessed and I was devasted and disgusted about it. I honestly got shattered by this, I am fucking hurt about it. They even planned to fuck for a while but she stopped it because she felt guilty that she was fucking my friend behind my back.  They both agreed to fuck for a while so it was mutual I guess. My ex said that she was sorry and felt shitty about it, her consciousness got to her. She stopped talking to my friend and now she talks to me. Which I try to comfort her but it still hurts. I honestly don't know if I can live with this fact and if in the future we get back together, I really do not know.  I can't believe that they both did it. My heart felt like it shattered and the whole world crashed down onto me that day. My friend does not care about my ex's feelings at all after they fucked, he basically fucked her over. She got scarred from this and does not want to be touch by any guy for a long time. I want her to heal and overcome this and I do want to help her.

I want to be there for her but at the same time, I want to get to some payback. I was even planning to fuck his ex that he had a relationship with for 3 years too and recently broke up with. But I honestly do not know if I should. This whole event gave me the worst pain I received in my whole life emotionally. It's not fair at all to me. Even some of my closest friends know that they did that and are trying to keep it a secret from me. I want to overcome this and get over it but it just fucking hard you know. ",15Dec2018,1
38,"so it’s my first semester in college, and it has been the absolute worst! i don’t really have any friends and i only live an hour away from home, so i come home a lot and i kept dating my boyfriend from high school, my parents are upset and they don’t understand why i would do such a thing. my boyfriend and i text throughout the day, but not a whole ton, and we call a few times a week. they think that i am too attached, one weekend i came up and i told them that i was going to head back to my apartment early, when in reality i was going to my boyfriends house, my mom found out a way to track me and sent my dad to come pick me up and bring me home so that we could talk. that night they said that we had to take a break from seeing each other, and that when i wanted to see him again we would have to have another conversation. it’s been two weeks since i’ve seen him, and i wanted to see him tonight. i asked my parents, and they didn’t seem to think we had really taken a break, so they didn’t think it was a good idea to see him. but they said that i was an adult and that i could make my own decisions.

so i come home tonight, and they are waiting up for me. they ask me how my night was, and i told them. and my mom goes ballistic and starts crying and getting upset saying, “do you really think we want to know how your night was?” i’ve had a terrible night sitting here knowing that you don’t care about your father’s and i opinion.” she then continued to say how disrespectful and deceiving i was, and that she is so hurt by me, and she kept saying that i chose my boyfriend over them.

40,"When I was little I noticed my mom got herself into a lot of bad situations. She attracted guys who were not good for her. She accepted them to keep them from hurting others. She lost all her kids because she put bad men before us. I promised myself for years I'd never do what she did I'd never settle for anything less than I deserved, and I never have intentionally, I just always ended up in the wrong places at the right time and often trapped with bad ppl who would hurt me in many ways. I've felt so cursed I blamed my mother for many years until recently that is, I feel stronger now than I ever have before because I survived so many horrible situations. I know now that their are bad people out there who twist and manipulate others weaker than themselves and put fear into us to shut us up and isolate us from the outside world. I know that it wasn't moms fault all those horrible people hurt her over the years they were the worst types of people who tricked her on so many levels she felt powerless. People do victimize others people do push others around and just because someone's friendly people assume things about them that just aren't true. For example people thought my mom was easy so they assumed I was easy too. Also people thought I was dumb because they thought mom was dumb. And many more stupid things that doesn't make any sense. Abuse is real and more people need to open their eyes and recognize what's going on in this world. It's not just as simple as blocking a phone number or deleting a text! Locking your door or avoiding certain types of individuals. Some people don't even know their abusers first or last names or even know what they look like, I've been called by strangers who got my number from acquaintances who stole my number from my mothers phone. Who would call me in the middle of the night threatening to kill me! I told one of them to go ahead do it and make it quick they'd be doing me a darn favor! I'd at least be away from psychos like him or her. They backed off instantly because they never expected my response! They thought they could break me but I broke them. I EMPOWERED myself to beat the bully. I wish I could say I was always so lucky. Most of my abusers were pretty sneaky and always knew how to brainwash me. I keep to myself mostly now because I've started to realize I like being alone more than I like being bothered by others. I can make myself happy. I don't need others, we all deserve love and someone to grow old with but not if they're only their to cause us misery. ",15Dec2018,1

He's intelligent. He's charismatic. He's a good dad.  I feel connected to him in a way that I never have been with anyone else. He loves me. We want to be a family.

 He is also irresponsible and can be immature. He's not good with money. He rarely cleans. He has big ideas that he never follows through. 

He's a dreamer... And I love that about him. I believe in him. He's my best friend, I am his.

...But we're not getting back together. We've been going to counseling. It's good to express our feelings in a controlled environment. 

I've come to realize he has issues that only he can resolve on his own. I pulled out of our relationship because I could no longer follow him down a road to nowhere.

A road with no goals, no real direction, no planning. Living each day spontaneously. Wondering why bills aren't getting paid. Talking about how great it would be to own our own house... Or Take a trip overseas. Fantasizing about a lifestyle that's obtainable, but never taking the necessary steps to achieve it.

I don't think he'll change. I have changed. I'm more responsible, healthier, wiser. I want a good life for our daughter.

It can make you feel as if you are at the top of the world,

And that finally, you are making sense.

You see those people who say that you should not bother about approval,

They might not know what it means to have been ignored,

They don't know when that person you have been admiring secretly, congratulate and acknowledge what you just did.

After a long while.

After feeling useless and invisible, all of a sudden, things are different.

You are being recognised for doing something. They might have even added some claps to it...

Now you are excited, and could literally burst out of the universe into another planet...

And even though you know that they are not loving you but your mask, you are satisfied in a sense.

Let me roll the dice here.

There are treasures that were masqueraded when you were told not to seek approval,

It is hidden but I am going to unveil such today.

See my family 😊,

You are scared of being authentic because you do not like yourself,

And the reason you do not like yourself is that you were shamed for having flaws,

For making a mistake here, and there. Even the one you did not do, is accredited to you.

Hence they have succeeded in painting the illusion that perfection is the gate key.

What even the gatekeepers do not possess in their belonging.

It was an intense struggle I had with this perception until I realized a great truth...

🙄That we grow with flaws,
🙄We expand because we make mistakes,
🙄That we are strengthened and solidified by those missteps...

Moreover, it is the pathway to our expressing all that we truly are, which others are looking with great expectancy to savour.

51,"Hi, 

At my college the men's apartments get paired together with a women's apartments to promote dating I think. It's a Mormon owned college which probably explains a lot.

Sometimes the women's apartment you get paired with sucks. Other times it's awesome. Currently I have some awesome roommates and the women's apartment were paired with are awesome. I've been at college 4 semesters and I haven't had so much fun with a FHE group. (FHE stands for Family Home Evening. It's something Mormons do and each male and female apartment is called this. One male and female is there ""dad"" and ""mom"" just so there's some sort of leadership and we can figure it what we do for activities.)


Anyways, one of the girls (from my point of view) has been hinting pretty strongly that she would like to get to know/date one of my roommates. I'm not an expert in dating, I've only been on like 3 dates in my entire life ( I'm 19) and I'm not sure if 2 of those even count so I could be wrong but it seemed like that to me.

Tonight myself, and 2 of my roommates (One of which she had been hitting on.) went over to there apartment to watch Nacho Libre. She had a date over who was getting pretty cozy which was one of the reasons we went over, plus our apartment smelled (and still does) like a dead goat.

Fast forward to 20 minutes after we got back to our apartment I got a text from her asking if I was still up. (It was 1:30 AM) I said yeah and asked what's up. She replied that she was in love with my roommate and I said ""I know, It's kinda obvious"" and she's if she was planning on telling him. 

Turns out she sent that text to 3 of my roommates but each with a different roommates name.


Here's where you may be confused. I am.

I really like to help people. Like, I really, really, really like to help people in any way I can. I thought she wanted advice or something and I was going to help her. But instead it's just a prank. I feel hurt even though this doesn't really affect me.

I agreed and suggested my dorm room because I had a lot of the supplies we would need. We worked pretty late on it and both ended up falling asleep next to each other on my bed. 

I woke up in the middle of the night to his hand in my shirt touching my breasts. I froze and had no idea what to do so I just pretended I was sleeping - after a bit I rolled onto my stomach so he would stop and I figured that would give him the hint.

I dozed off again and this time when I woke up there was something brushing against my hand and it took me a bit to realize this was his penis. Again, I was dumb and I froze. I was just in shock and really had no idea what to say or do. I kept pretending to be asleep while he moved my hand to touch him.

I wasnt able to actually go back to sleep after he did that. He continued to keep trying to touch me throughout the night but I started moving around a lot more to get him to stop. When he got up this morning he didnt act like anything was wrong - he just thanked me for letting him stay the night.

I dont know if I'm overreacting but I feel so violated and gross. I wish I would have called him out for it in the moment and kicked him out of my room - but I didnt and I feel really ashamed about it.

Im not sure what I should do now. I dont know if I should message him to call him out on what he did to me, or tell the RAs in my building, or maybe even campus security. We've only been friends for a short time but he has always been a good one to me, Im just still in shock that he did this.

Any advice would be appreciated.

58,"Fair warning, longer post. Suicide is a main topic so trigger warning there. 

For years,6-8, I've been suicidal. It grew, from what I believe, from seeking attention to actually wanting and trying to die. 

To me it wasn't a big deal. Once I'm dead I won't have to worry about anything anymore. There won't be any pain; any suffering. 

I never really thought about how it would affect my family and the few friends that I have. Maybe it's because it's hard to think about the pain I'd cause them. Maybe I just don't care about what'll happen after I'm gone. 

Regardless I never truly contemplated the implications my death would have on the people in my life. 

Well I didn't until today. 

I met my best friend in EMT school and we've been close ever since. We're both similar people on similar life paths. We hit it off almost instantaneously and have helped each other through a lot. 

But earlier today she texted me she tried to kill herself. She tried ODing but luckily took herself to the hospital before it kicked in. 

And to hear that, yes she is alive but almost wasn't destroyed my world. To think my best friend in the world almost wasn't here. I still struggle with the thought of it. 

But I'm amazingly grateful. She's alive. I still have my best friend. But I almost didn't. I almost had to go to a funeral and say goodbye to the one good person in my life. And that is terrifying. 

I don't believe that I mean too much to too many people and that doesn't really bother me. But to think about the pain I just went through, including having her survive, I wouldn't want that on my worst enemy. 

To wrap this up, I'd just like to say for people who have SI, who deal with depression, anxiety. You're fucking strong for going through it. For you to wake up everyday and power through is amazing. 

As I tell my patients, if you're wanting to get better and you're trying to seek help; that's half the battle.

We we're supposed to have decades worth of our annual golf trips, sitting at the pool, and giving each other shit. He was supposed to walk his daughter down the isle and help his son become as good of a man as he was.   His marriage was the example we all held up as the ideal.  

He was the anchor of our social circle. He was the one that got us together. His house was ground zero for all of us. He's going to leave a huge hole in so many lives. 

I'm numb.  I couldn't even get the three hours back to see him between when they stopped treatment and he was gone.  

He was like our third brother.  At least my brother was with him when he left.  I promised him that his wife and children would never be without family since his parents are gone too and hers are useless. So, they'll be with us for every holiday from now on. 

Shortly after college I had a painful divorce. He would drive four hours to my apartment, let himself in, and go to sleep on my couch. I would wake up to find him, ask him how long he was staying, and he'd answer with however long it takes, usually a couple of weeks at a time. He'd book tee times for us so I would have to get out of the house and start living again. We'd sit on my crappy deck and grill spicy brats and drink Guinness. He was just there, demanding I keep going.  He drug me to a bar crawl and introduced me to my current wife.  We played video games and ate a million tacos and putted in the hallway with the neighbors for shots of Captain.  He never asked me for anything in return.  He just wanted everyone around him to be happy. 

There is nothing you can say and nothing you can do to ease the hurt. You can just be present and share the loss.  Sometimes horrible things happen for no reason, and it sucks.  I do so miss him already.

He ended up deleting me off of all forms of social media once he got engaged to this woman (we stopped hanging out and talking once he got an actual girlfriend. I was genuinely happy for him). He got her pregnant and it seemed like they were beginning to start a family.

This morning he requested me on snap, and I added him. Tbh, I was hoping he was going to invite me to the wedding. But no. He started venting to me about how she cheated on him multiple times and started accusing him for cheating. 

I honestly felt for the guy; he always told me that getting married and having a genuine family was his dream.

Up until he said, “Sorry for being so upfront, but I need a girl to help me forget about her.”

Like. BITCH. Wtf? 

He literally asked me about my relationship just a few minutes ago, and then he asks me for my coochie? No, dude. I was like, “Sorry, but I don’t play like that. I love him. I’ll talk to you later bye.”

Then he deleted me.

LIKE. WTF? What kind of person does something like that? Who asks someone to cheat on their significant other?

I’m so glad that I’m in a relationship where my bf and I can trust each other, and I’m glad that I have someone to love me and I love him. Because something like that seems so rare nowadays. And it’s not even about me wanting to be with him out of fear of having to date again. It’s about me being grateful to have someone worth loving.

It just boggles my mind to have someone ask me for a hook up when they know that I’m in a committed relationship. Do people not understand loyalty anymore? ",15Dec2018,1
78,"Throwaway accnt.

So, I've had anxiety since I was a kid, hearing impaired being reckless, out of a permanent job for a few years, and slowly burning through my savings. 

I finally fessed up to my doctor about my mental state and she started to prescribe me clonazapam and paxil for my ""ocd"" (I have been pulling my eyebrows for a good year now). I feel more relaxed and the paxil will take about a month to take effect. So far though, I am feeling more relaxed, though I do get depressed at night thinking of my ex.

I also went and got hear aids ordered. I have been getting tested, but never had the $$ to do so. Was about $4k, but I went to costco and got it for $2500. I do not have this money, due to job problems, but I charged it on my credit card. They come in next week and I'm thrilled for them!

I just hope my check is good enough because I'm training and the training pay ""sucks"".

Doesn't matter though, I finally did something about my depressed ass!

Just wanted to brag, sorry if I have offended you in anyway.",15Dec2018,1
81,"So a month ago I stumbled across a post where someone was talking about weight loss.

They recommended an app called ‘Lose It’ and, as a curious person, I went on the App Store and looked it up. 

I am proud to say that I have lost 12 pounds, and I’m feeling better than I have in years.

Thank you stranger.",15Dec2018,1
83,"## Last year, I was severely depressed for a few months. I don't know if I was suicidal, but I genuinely believed that I would never be happy and was only staying alive for my family. Recently, I made a few discoveries about myself and made some major changes, and thankfully I think I can say my depression is practically gone. It's been an incredibly hard journey but I truly believe that I have recovered.

I felt so broken when I heard why my friend was in the hospital, because I know what he's feeling and how isolating it is. I'm not very close with him, which is why I'm iffy about visiting him. I don't want him to think that I'm doing it just to be polite, because I genuinely care. Also, I feel like I can offer advice having gotten out of a deep depression. Would I be stepping out of place if I reached out to him in that way?",15Dec2018,1
84,"I've been trying to meet people for 6 or 7 weeks now (i.e. dating) and it's become a soul crushing shit show. I've sent dozens if not a hundred messages on Match to basically no replies. I've talked to redditors from /r/r4r only to be ghosted over and over. I just don't think I'm ever going to meet someone, there's just too many things wrong with me and I'm tired of bothering. ",15Dec2018,1
85,"I'm honestly considering skipping 6th period which is Spanish class. We were assigned to do a project using the verbs Tener and Ser. We could either work by ourselves and make a poster (which is the easiest way to do it) or we could work with a partner,  record a video,  then post it on YouTube! So,  me not wanting to work by myself,  decided to get a partner and make a cringey interview video. 
Let's get to the point why I want to skip class,  my side of the video was a total disaster. 1) I was pissed off when I was recording it.  2) I messed up so much (we had to speak in Spanish). 3) the crap was blurry asf
If I only had to share the video with my teacher,  I would be totally okay with it. But it's in front of my whole Spanish class (28 people).  I can't redo my part because the girl I'm working with already edited the video and it's amazing, and I would feel so bad if she had to do it again. 
Should I skip school,  skip class,  or go to Spanish class and suck it up. 

(P.s) we're going to be the first one up due to my last name. Thanks dad! ",15Dec2018,1
86,"I'm not sure why. A couple weeks ago I was an absolute mess. Nothing in my life changed/improved since then but I'm feeling at least a little better. Probably my nihilism taking over temporarily but fuck it, I'm enjoying not feeling absolutely shitty and suicidal every minute. 

I hope it lasts. ",15Dec2018,1
87,"For the longest time I thought I knew what I wanted to do with my life and what would make me content. I thought that I wanted to get my bachelors in nursing, meet a girl, get married, get hired on at a large hospital in a city and live out my days as a nurse, but as I continue through college I don’t know if that’s what I want anymore. 

I’m 19 year old guy and I don’t know what to do. 

There’s always been the craving in the back of my mind to pursue a career in animation. I have always loved the idea of working for Disney/Pixar, their work is always so wholesome and it has been a big part of my life and development.  The idea of getting enveloped in the process of making an animation for all and being able to call it your own is almost enough to make me want to run away to California almost immediately, but there’s always the uncertainty. I’ve been reassured of my skills in visual art since I was able to pick up a pencil, and I have always had the support of my parents in whatever I’ve pursued, but what if I’m not good enough to make it?  

Nursing offers the security and stability that I want in a career, and I’m definitely interested in healthcare, but dreams of other possibilities won’t leave me alone anymore. 

I definitely don’t want to settle for mediocrity, any career in the medical field is much greater than that, don’t get me wrong, but I know there is more out there waiting to be revealed. 

Any advice helps. Thanks. ",15Dec2018,1
88,"I make just enough not to qualify for anything on the marketplace under $500 for me and my wife, but the insurance through my job would take half my paycheck every week to get semi-decent coverage that would cover my prescription. 

I just can’t afford it. Once my current prescription runs out I’m done. 

I’m forced to go off of medication I need because I can’t pay the outrageous costs. I can’t afford a trip to the doctor out of pocket and I can’t get I refilled over the phone because the prescriptions over a year old. 

Sorry, just needed to vent. It really sucks. ",15Dec2018,1

93,"mostly since 2012, i avoided pain as much as possible, with brief exceptions. i avoided schedule. i avoided responsibilities. i avoided work. i avoided physical effort of exercise and socializing. i avoided dealing with uncomfortable situations. i avoided getting grants and starting my own thing and dealing with its procedures. i avoided making my own decisions. i wanted to be independent in my business but i avoided its responsibility so i settled by staying with a partner i resent. i quit a huge chunk of my responsibilities by quitting to believe god in 2013. in my entire life, with several years of exceptions, i avoided responsibility, pain, struggle, effort, suffering as much as possible, as often as possible, in every way possible. 

for the last two years, almost every day i order food using apps. but i don't appreciate it because i'm so used to it. i don't struggle to eat. all i do is click a few buttons. a lot of people consider ordering food a treat. someone i knew was jealous of me ordering stuff even though we were close. i thought of that person lowly but i guess they just wanted it quite a lot and felt bad about themselves because they couldn't do that. if i suffered because of not ordering, i'd enjoy ordering a lot more. because i'm not suffering related to food i don't really appreciate it. i don't really feel joy related to food. lack of joy and constant emptiness lead to suffering again after a while. it's like you can't escape suffering. you have to go suffer by your own choice, so you become able to feel joy more in your life. if you don't do that and if you avoid suffering, you would succeed in the short term, but in the long term, you lose ability to feel joy, so you suffer again. a portion of life that's spent without joy or feeling of justification of your existence translates to suffering as you are constantly getting closer to death/not existing which goes against your strong urge to survive. my experience with food indicates i need to voluntarily suffer to feel joy and to make my life closer to great.

my experience with social life indicates the same. i just avoided going to gatherings and rejected invites because i felt anxious or i didn't like the part i need to make effort, stand up or walk a lot. i avoid the pain of socializing. i didn't want to dress and go out and face small instances of rejection or fear of it. i didn't want to face my fears. this led me to have a very horrible social life or lack there of. i'm surprised i'm still sane. my experience with people indicates i absolutely need to voluntarily suffer related to people to actually have a life. it's not even for joy. it's literally to live. it's quite painful to be alone too much. 

every pain i avoided resulted in lack of living. ever pain i avoided resulted in pain, again. i couldn't escape pain. the reason is i'm dying and losing my life slowly, as i explained two paragraph above. i guess it's impossible to avoid pain. i doubt someone could avoid pain better than me. i went to extreme lengths to avoid pain. aand i have found myself fantasizing about killing myself many times as a result of an extremely empty life and extreme pain. extreme pain made me want to end my life. the only way to make sense of my failures is just being lazy, not working hard enough. in other words, not voluntarily accepting pain/struggle/suffering/work/responsibility. this is what keeps me sane and not go crazy thinking about how much i wasted my life and how empty it is, comparing to other people who achieved a lot less than me in their lives in terms of competency/work/money/extent of achievement. i know if i work hard, accept pain with my own choice, i can make the rest of my life good, i can feel like i'm alive, i can feel life, i can feel a lot more joy and that's a fact for me. my decades of suffering as a result of avoiding suffering, and rationality confirm that that's it's a fact. there is no way to refute it. 

so yeah, i could have expand more and maybe i will but in short, i find that the way to live a great life is through a lot of suffering you voluntarily accept. trying to avoid pain/responsibility/struggle/suffering eventually makes me suffer so much that i want to die. i didn't kms probably because 1. i knew i had an option instinctively and 2. i thought i could eat some more food before i run out of resources so i delayed it the date. 

i went through extreme lengths to live a life with comfort. i explored this way of living in every way possible and i made sure it is the WRONG way to live. i'm also assuming false of false is true, because there is no other possible option, so the right way to live is the opposite of how i've been living, aka by voluntarily accepting suffering (obviously choose your suffering with logic)",15Dec2018,1
