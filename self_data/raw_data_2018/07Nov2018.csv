0,"Hey there reddit,

I'm a 20 y/o guy from The Netherlands and I study to become an English Teacher. I'm a first years and I had my first exam today. It was a CAE test for reading and listening and it didn't go to that well. I'm just really, really afraid at the moment that I might not pass my first year eventhough it is only my first exam. 

My father passed away a year and a half ago and I feel like it's taking its toll now. My father had been sick since I was 4 years old. 4 times a brain tumor and he also had a new hip because of his job. Basically my mom had to take care for him, my sister and me. 

As I said, the first time he was in surgery was when I was four years old. I didn't think too much of it a the time but I obviously knew something was up. I mentally grew up very fast because of what I had seen at such an early age. 

I'll skip ahead to a few years later, to when I was 13. The tumor in my fathers head grew back. He went back into surgery but there we're some complications. He had to stay in the hospital for a month or so because of these complications. 

Basically what happened to me was that I got depressed. That's how I felt at least but I did not go to a doctor for it or anything. I lost all my friends back then except for a few, these guys are still my friends and I thank them for that.

My dad had to go into surgery again when I was 16 years of age. Another brain tumor. The complications afterwards were much more severe. His bloodpressure got so high up to the point where he went blind temporarily. He almost died because of this. He also had meningitis at a point which didn't help either. 

He never really made it through any revalidation, another year and a half later, when I was at my internship for vet-assistant, I got a call from my mom that my father had to go to the hospital because he had been having stomaches. I made a prediction that it was stomach cancer. I have a thing for knowing whatsup and I was right. However, it could not be treated and my father had only a mere 6 months to live. This really took its toll on me.

The cancer spread out through his body making him unable to eat. He was weighing about 90 kilos in pure muscle in his prime and passed away with 54 kilos. He chose to be euthanized in the end to end his pain. Which I thought was a wise choice and I immediately accepted that. 

After 2 years, it is finally taking its toll on me. I don't really want to go to a psychologist or anything. I just do not feel like that even though it might be better for me. Idk if this adds any information but I am an extremely empathatic extrovert that always does his best to help as many people as possible. I also have a condition that is called dysphasia, basically my motor skills work a little bit different than others but also my understanding of the emotions of people is enhanced by a lot. I don't know why but it is whatever.

My mother is depressed, we are financially unstable since my mom works as just a secretary for a company. My sister is studying phsychology and does not live at home anymore so I don't see her that much. I just genuinely do not know how to feel at the moment and also just wanted to get all this bullshit of my chest for some reason. I always try to stay possitive, maybe it is because it is 1AM right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I want to thank you all for reading this if you do. I probably left out a shit ton of information sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you,

&amp;#x200B;

11,"Me and my partner live in North Carolina. That's our home state, and that's where we are registered to vote. We're staying in California right now, so we registered to vote and ordered an absentee ballet. We played all the rules, we did everything we were supposed to do. 

We never got an absentee ballot. Neither of us. 

I called my state board of elections for my county in NC, and the lady on the phone (who was super nice, btw) told me that my request for an absentee ballet was never received. My partners, however, was, and his ballot had been delivered on the 30th of last month. We mailed our requests at the same time, why was mine never delivered? We went to the post office yesterday and today, NOTHING had arrived for either of us. Well, to be honest, my partner did get something: a letter from a candidate urging us to vote. So clearly our address for delivery is in the system and is accessible, whatever system that may be. I asked if there was anything we can do to get our votes in, and she said there really wasn't anything we could do.

We did everything we were supposed to do, and because of some sort of error (clearly not on our part) and the restrictive manner of our voting system (only one day? No way to do this online? Unclear/confusing instructions?) our opinion is going unheard and unaccounted for. I feel cheated and disappointed.

I hope everyone else got out to vote for us, I don't care what your stance on politics is.",07Nov2018,1

20,"Take this analogy into consideration. One person has a roof over their head, a hot shower, a cozy bed, but they feel left out, alone, sad, depressed. Another person could be in a much worse situation, whether it‚Äôs financially, not having a home, whatever. They both however are still living and breathing, and while they may not be happy, they are both still alive and have chosen not to end their lives because the level of stress/anxiety/sadness they feel is the same. With that example (though there are many more), it goes without saying that we are an adaptive species. It‚Äôs why when someone is in a much worse situation than you, they are handling the same way if not better than you because they‚Äôve adapted to their situation.

As humans we go on and learn through experience. Sometimes we experience constant pain over and over again. Take harsh breakups for example. That is something that no matter how many times we‚Äôve been through it, it will kill part of us inside and make us depressed every time it happens. (Again, that is just one of many examples I could use.)

So why is it that if we‚Äôre faced with a challenging experience and learn from it, when we‚Äôre faced with another challenging experience, our tolerance to it  is 0 and we feel defeated once again (which in turn is what leads to depressive and anxious symptoms and disorders)? How come for some if not most of us our brains aren‚Äôt saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôve dealt with this before, I know how to handle this, I‚Äôve got this on lock‚Äù, but rather ‚Äúfuck, no, not again...idk what to do and now I‚Äôm sad.

My main avenue is twitter ‚Äî I followed dozens of state and federal reporters, and followed just about every event that happened in government.

32,"Not that long ago I went to meet with my dad and my step mom to talk about some important stuff. 

Basically I had been in an abusive relationship, got out on my own and ended up getting assaulted at some party I shouldn‚Äôt have been at. 

I had a lot of stress than manifested in some weird ways. I got treatment for depression and ended up even worse off. Turns out I have bipolar II and a bad reaction to ambien. The anti depressants I was put on sent me into an exaggerated mania and I quit my job, cut out my family and otherwise just imploded. I went off the meds quickly and that helped but it took a while after (~1 year) that for me to get properly diagnosed and back on my feet. 

This was the point when I was coming to try and talk and make amends for all my avoidance. But while I was there my dad just sort of turned down the volume on the tv baseball game and seemed rushed. My step mom said all the supportive things and used ‚Äúwe‚Äù - were here for you, we just want you to be happy, etc.

I've had crushes before, but all of them happened after I knew the guy for a while as a friend. Interested in him after 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, etc. With this guy though, my interest in him was pretty much instantaneous. We're graduate students at the same university and met at an improv show. We, along with some other students, all went out to dinner together. I really loved talking to him and I loved his smile, and we talked the whole time and it just _felt_ right. And we hung out as a group some more times after that.

Of course, unlike movies and books, I asked him out and he turned me down. So obviously _he_ didn't feel it. Time to move on. But at least I know that the ""spark"" does exist and it _is_ possible for me to feel that level of attraction to someone.",07Nov2018,1

52,"Ok, I'll try not to ramble too much. I moved away from my home town and all my friends almost 10 years ago(hour and a half away), followed my then boyfriend to college. I felt like I made a few really close friends, usually from work, where I moved to, but I've always felt a low/no priority to them, even though I did/do whatever I could for them. I would give rides to or from work whenever they needed it, I would try to make plans with them, either long planned or spontaneous, but ended up with them bailing about 85% of the time. They would hang out together as a group, but I was almost never invited. Most of them moved back home, since they were only out here for college. 

There were a few that continued to live in the same area, but the same thing happened. And I've tried making plans with them, tried to stay close with them, but I always end up feeling like they don't care about me. Most recently I texted a friend who had come into my work (we caught up for a bit when they were there) and asked if they had time in a few days to get together. I got no response for days, but the same day I had asked to hang out, they posted something on Facebook about how their door was always open and they had coffee/tea/something stronger for anyone that needed to talk. Then proceeded to text me back in the early evening (days after I had first sent the text) saying they were having people over that night and it wasn't a good time. I tried again this week, and still haven't heard anything back.

I know people have life shit going on, and I try not to hold it against them when it happens now and again. But to have it happen on a continuous basis, with multiple people. I can't help think maybe there's something wrong with me. Maybe they just don't want to see me, but I come off as too desperate to say no outright to.

The other thing that bothers me is that my best friend who moved back to our home town (have known each other for 17 years) has always been there for me, and has no problem what so ever driving the hour and a half, usually with her kid in tow, to come see me whenever she can or when I let her know I have a day off, will make an effort to move things around so she can see me. And I love her to death for that. Because other than her, I would only ever see my husband. 

I guess it just goes to show the different kinds of people. But when people that live within 10 minutes of me can't be bothered to even text me back, it still makes me feel like shit. ",07Nov2018,1

I have no tangible consequences at work, but I would like to improve my image/appearance as a leader. I'm thinking maybe pay a few bucks every time I'm late. But I'm afraid I'll see that as savings towards a reward instead.  Thoughts?  I find that I respond better to punishment than reward.  And to be honest, I'm at a loss on what would be an effective enough reward!

&amp;#x200B;

Alternatively, maybe I can prepare everything ahead of time from breakfast to clothing, etc?  I'm open to try different ideas!  Let me know what has worked for you to be on time!  Having an hourly job, a class at a specific time, or a boss that cared about hours used to be really helpful!

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

\- Each day I think I'll care more about not being tardy, but each morning I just don't care enough... and dilly dally with an amazing breakfast, looking pulled together, etc. I even choose to lay in my warm bed over getting to work on time.  I already wake up before most of my on-time coworkers, but get in last

\- Maybe I'm just not really excited about getting to work, or to most social obligations?  I tried delaying breakfast thinking I'd be motivated by food to get in earlier, but nope that failed as well.

\- I'm also incredibly irrational in the morning... oh a few minutes reading this article is fine.  I'll just get ready faster... but when I get to the get ready fast part, I don't speed it up because I just don't care as much if I'm late. I'd rather have all my ducks in a row before a I leave the house than arrive harried but on time.  I tend to be a perfectionist, but think that somehow I'd be able to reason over perfectionism and arrive on time just this time around!  Perfectionism wins... each time.

I wake up at 4am for usual to get ready for work. My husband wakes up at 5am. Around 5:45 we are about to leave for me to take him to work at 6am and then I drive 45 mins to arrive at work before 7am. Just as he grabs his glasses he realized that fucking somehow they're broken. And he has no idea what kind of glasses they are. My heart broke for him as he taped the handle back on his only pair of glasses, and reassured him that we will get it paid for (even though we don't exactly have the money, we will find a way). 

I pull into work earlier than expected and pulled out my phone to see a text from my mom saying she and her dog need a place to stay until ""she can figure things out"". No context whatsoever. My immediate thought was that my step dad and her had a fight and he kicked her out. NOPE. She's just being insecure because she's tired of upsetting him over her dog pooping in the house during the day. But this is nothing to threaten divorce over. And I doubt he even mentioned divorce. I don't know the whole context, but I do know that every single time something lime this happens (and it had happened many times before with different circumstances) they eventually make up and everything is fine. 

And as much as I'd be willing to take her in, I can't over something that I know will blow over by the evening. If she was kicked out, then yes. But my husband and I live in a 1 bed apartment so... it won't work unless it had to. Plus we can't have animals here without paying a 200 dollar deposit. 

Then I get to work and.... both physicians are double booked. And I'm starting my period tomorrow so the depression is thick so I've gotta push through that, triage patients and get paperwork done.

77,"I am 25 years old and currently doing a Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science. I am at a point where I like my program and my supervisor (most days), however, sometimes I feel an overwhelming sense of guilt, shame, and a feeling that I don‚Äôt belong here and messed up my life by choosing to study in another city.  

About 8 months before moving, I fell in love with my current boyfriend in my hometown. I was clear about my plans to move and we had decided to try long distance. We have now been dating for 2 years. So far, we are great at long distance. We make time for regular visits and we skype lots. We talk a lot about getting married in the future. 

The original plan was for him to move to be with me after one year. But that didn‚Äôt happen. One night, we were lying in bed, and he told me that he couldn‚Äôt picture his life not living close to his grandparents and parents, because family is the most important thing in the world to him. I told him it was okay and that he didn‚Äôt have to move if he wasn‚Äôt ready, besides, he didn‚Äôt have a job lined up in my city or anything. I don‚Äôt want to make him do something he doesn‚Äôt want to do. And I don‚Äôt think he genuinely wants to move.  

To make him happy I would basically have to move back to my home city. And my hometown isn‚Äôt a bad place, but it doesn‚Äôt have nearly the career opportunities that I have in my current city. No where close. And my career is important to me.  

Sometimes I feel like my decision to go back to school put me ‚Äòbehind‚Äô in life. My baby brother recently got engaged and my sister, who is only a year older, bought a house and has been married for 2 years. Most of my friends are financially successful. Meanwhile, I can barely make rent. I‚Äôve been in 2 serious relationships but have never lived with a significant other, and even though I feel like I‚Äôm ready and it‚Äôs time, circumstances as they are, it‚Äôs not a possibility.

Anther issue is that there are a lot of stressed out, angry, isolated and depressed students in my program and I feel like somehow I have become the person they talk to about their problems. Most times it‚Äôs fine, I was always the person to listen to others problems in my own friend group, but nowadays I find myself staying home from the uni so that I can avoid being supportive to my peers. I just can‚Äôt deal with their problems alongside my own feelings. Staying home makes me feel guilty, like I‚Äôm not working hard enough, even when I AM actually doing research work at home. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle.  

This stuff has been eating me alive for about a year and a half now. I can‚Äôt seem to work out a life plan on my own where I can get what I want, which is to live with my boyfriend and pursue my career dreams. I really, reallly don‚Äôt want to have to choose between them...if I do that, I lose either way.   ",07Nov2018,1

And the other thing happened 3 days ago. I was with my friend and his friend (who is a boy) and this girl kept saying ""oohh boyfriend and boyfriend"". I imagine she was saying this for attention as well as the fact she was jealous because he was talking to him and not her. 

He told me once that him mum told him that he hasn't been happy since they've got together. They ""argue"" constantly even though this girl is the only one that argues because my friend is too scared to say anything.

As said earlier, their relationship is toxic and my friend would be a lot better off without her. I don't like her, my girlfriend doesn't, and I don't think my friend likes her either even though they date.

I wanna find a way to get them split up. I know it's mean but I think it's for the better. I want to help my friend because he is so kind to others, and he's got a great personality. I just want to help but I don't know how.

Yet something clicked and I feel for it...I which I hadn't honestly. I went that whole week when I first really saw her,just to find her in the end...Sent friend request on FB and follow request on insta,cause why nt..
Well,I ended up trying to talk to her, but never could, in 3 weeks all I could do was watch, hoping that one day something would happen...And it did, but not what I wanted

After 3 or 4 weeks of seeing her and trying to talk to her she finnaly responds to the request... After weeks of trying to ignore that she is actively trying to ignore me, I'm hit with the final stab...She had since followed and accepted the follow of some one else, and rejected mine...
You might say freaking out this much for a stranger is weird, but this s already long enough so I won't even try to discuss how much of an amazing girl she seemed to be. Also, and if you actually made it this far, I feel especially bad cause she could have rejected from day one,but instead waits to add some one else to them rejected me.
