0,"Just had a conversation with someone close to me, who as a very little girl, was repeatedly molested for years by her father. She kept this to herself for years, until she was an adult, and worked up the courage to tell her family the truth. 

Her family refuses to even acknowledge what happened to her. Her mother chooses to sleep next to a man who performs sex acts on 3-year-olds, rather than face reality and be a real mom. 

Today, her entire family is ignoring her so that they can spend their day with a pedophile, and she’s alone with no family. 

Frankly, I have never been more disappointed and sickened by a group of people. I wanted to post this to Facebook so her family would see, but I could never violate her privacy/trust. So this is my rant to a bunch of kind strangers. ",18Jun2018,4
2,"I really care about and really like my girlfriend and I think I might love her but I’m not sure. I’m afraid to say it because I know when I do I can’t take it back. Not sure there’s really anything you guys can do to help me, but any advice would be much appreciated. 
Thanks!",18Jun2018,2
4,"I was watching a video on Youtube through my headphones (not that spiders make much sound anyway) when I see something moving in the corner of my eye. I have long hair so I thought it was just a wispy strand of hair... 

I turned my head just to check though, and directly in front of me, at perfect eye level, less than a centimetre from my left eye was a huge spider, hanging down from the ceiling. 

I immediately freaked out and batted it somewhere - not sure where but I am alright with spiders just so long as it doesn't try sneaking up on me like that again. I can still feel my heart pounding in my ears.",18Jun2018,1
6,"Dude I am so screwed up. Let me just start by saying I'm just a wee lad at 14 years old (male). I live in the US of A and I am growing up in an extremely privileged town, with loving parents and a big house. I'm really grateful for the life I have, as I learned from when my dad took me to go volunteer at a homeless shelter. But I don't know what's happening to me man. Last year, when I was in eighth, I was doing so well. I flew past school like it was nothing and got straight As with no problem. This year, I'm failing so bad, with 3 C grades and 5 B-. I've been having mental breakdowns all throughout the year where I hid in my bedroom closet and cried like a huge pussy. I know that that's just a misconception males have, that they have to be ""strong"" and ""stone-cold"". But it's true. I can't let any of my friends see my cry. And I don't even know why I'm crying. I know I put too much pressure on myself for grades, but I can't stop. I'm not even sure this has to do completely with grades. My head just hurts 24/7 and it wont stop. I'm losing so much sleep even though I go to bed at 10:30 and wake up at 6, which is way better than what most kids get. I'm so tired all the time. I told my mom and dad and we got a blood test, and it turns out I had a couple of deficiencies, and we got prescriptions for them. I take them as prescribed, but its not helping. I still hide and cry for no reason. To top all of that off, my brother is going to college, which means I'll be all alone without the person I've leaned on my entire life. And I don't want to tell my friends about it because I'm the person THEY lean on. I'm the stupid ""life of the party"", the charming boyish boy who's reckless and brave, the one who cracks jokes and lightens the mood when needed, then one people confide in with their secrets. I'm glad I can help out my bois, but that means that I can't falter. If I give out, that means their net is gone and their standing on a thin wire. So here I am, the secretly depressed girl-whisperer, the one who no one would expect to be sad, and the one who cries in his closet every night. Someone help me please. I'm so fucking powerless.",18Jun2018,3
7,"I see all these people doing something worthwhile and every time I just think to myself: “Where am I going with this life?” I’m just a grade 9 student, I get pretty good grades, but then I look around and see my classmates doing something better in their life and because of this I seem to constantly call myself a lazy fuck who’s wasting his life just scrolling through his phone. I just get worried so much about the future and how I’m gonna handle everything once I get to senior high school/college. 

I don’t have that much IRL friends and I tend to feel lonely whenever I remember that I have no one really to talk to. I also feel that I’m hated by a lot of people IRL (previous classmates to be exact. I changed sections when I got to grade 9) and it just kinda makes me feel that I don’t fit in and I will have a hard time trying to connect with new people. It’s probably just me thinking that these people hate me, that’s why I’m distancing myself from them too much idk ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. It came to the point that I’m just so socially awkward that I rarely talk irl unless it’s a close friend. 

I need help. I don’t want to just keep thinking about all this but it just happens. ",18Jun2018,2
8,"I go to a college in another state. I have a group of friends that all just stayed in the same town for college. Even so, they've all been slowly drifting apart. Of course, it's easy for me, because I live somewhere else, but it's weird for them. It's different things really; some have girlfriends they live with now, some have full-time jobs, some stick with school, some have just made new friend groups. 

Whenever I come back to town (for example, last night), we all meet up. However, it's been getting progressively more and more awkward. It's like we've exhausted everything there is to talk about, since most of our conversations revolved around high school shit. Now, we just dont connect anymore. We each live different lives. 

And so the night just revolved around Fortnite and drinking/smoking for no real reasons other than just to get fucked up. Most of the guys left early. We didnt really talk about anything significant. a lot of awkward pauses in conversation. gaps. even when we were fucked up, the night never really resulted in anything. 

I dont know. times are changing, it seems. I dont mind, personally. this group of guys i've considered my ""best friends"" all of high school, but it occurred to me a few weeks ago they're just kinda guys I get fucked up with. it's like we just hang out with each other to drink and smoke together. we dont care for each other sober, or we dont care about each other on personal levels. personally i feel like i need new friends, people i can actually relate to and talk to and act myself around. To be honest, I hate myself when i'm drunk or high; it's not me. and maybe all my friends just like to hang out with the fucked up version of me, not the real me. 

man. this post is kind of all over the place. sorry. i'm living alone for the next few days here in my hometown, and i'm pretty sure these ""friends"" are gunna keep inviting me to get fucked up. I dont really want to anymore.... a part of me wishes we'd all just collectively move on and stop trying to force shit that isnt there anymore.

9,"So, I did that thing where I got drunk and called someone. 

Backstory is in a previous self-indulgent post. 

But really, fuck all these various lines of communication. 

Remember when you could just call a person's home. And if they didn't answer, you could call back. And they had no idea you had called because it was just a phone without any record of missed calls... People weren't creepy then, just persistent. 

I don't want to be creepy, or stalkerie. ... Well fuck. 

How many months is an appropriate amount of time to wait, forget that there wasn't a call back last time, and try again? ... Fuck.

10,"Let's say I **sincerely** hold the beliefs I list below  - would you describe me as a ""nazi""?  Or would be okay for someone to use violence against me?

* I believe all human beings should be treated peacefully and with common courtesy as long as they treat others the same way. I don't wish harm on any racial or ethnic group and I wish all people could live peaceful, happy lives according to their own values.
* I would prefer to live in a sovereign community made up of people mostly from my own ethnic/racial group who share the same values that I do. I don't believe homogeneous communities like this are absolutely better than diverse communities, but I think they offer some advantages (and some disadvantages, too). To me, the advantages are more appealing than the disadvantages. But if other people prefer diverse communities then they should be free to live in them.
* I don't believe it would be acceptable to violently remove anyone or harass anyone in order to set up such a community. I think it would be best to set up such a community in a place that is already homogeneous and to legally and peacefully secede from the surrounding society. The area chosen should not deprive other groups of ""prime"" resources.
* Once the community was set up, I believe it should generally (but not exclusively) restrict new members to those who are part of the same ethnic and cultural group so it can keep its homogeneous character.
* I would want this community to have adequate means of self defense, but I would never support aggressive wars against others. I would want the community to trade peacefully with the rest of the world and to not involve itself in the internal affairs of other communities.
* I believe I should be free to publicly advocate for forming such a society and to join with others who share these beliefs.  

If you think I'm a nazi, or that it would be okay to use violence to stop me, I'd like to know why.",18Jun2018,1
11,"I dreamed of Mom last night,
And of our old home.
I was not how I used to be.
I was as I am now,
Much older than I ever had been there.
But she was not as she is.
Her dark hair shining, her face young,
Her smile warm. 

""Where have you been?"" 
She asked. 
""I've been right here."" I said.
""I'm glad you're back.""
Back from where?
""I've been right here, Mom.
Right with you.""
She did not understand me.
""Will you stay with me this time?""
""I can't.""

Here, I was the one who had left.
But I knew that when I woke, 
She would be the one who was gone.

13,"To say that first night was a nightmare was a massive understatement.  I was still very nauseous.  At times it was so bad I would force myself to throw up to make it stop.  Since I hadn't eaten that day, all I could do is dry heave.
The diarrhea was literally a pain in my ass.  At one point I was tempted just to stay on the toilet and try to sleep there.  Muscle spasms and restless leg syndrome was driving me crazy. 

That wasn't all.  I still had anxiety of being in a new place with people I didn't know.  I was scared, in pain, angry and alone. I couldn't get comfortable.  The sheets were that low thread count so there were bubbles irritating my skin. 

Racing thoughts bombarded my brain. Again, I tried to repeat my Our Fathers, but I couldn't focus long enough to finish a sentence.  
I laid there.  Staring at the ceiling.  I kept some small movement to my legs to help ease the restless legs.  Everyone was asleep.  I could hear the traffic outside.  The music and the base of cars passing.  The deep breathing and frequent soft snore from one of the girls.  Someone was talking in their sleep.  I think it was Amy, but all I could make out was when she shouted, ""yey!!"" 

A cough, a sneeze...someone pooted.  Skittering of rodents near our pantry picking out their dinner.  I heard every single sound that my new home had to offer.  I got to know her very well that night. Focusing on the sounds helped my anxiety.
I might have fallen asleep.  If I did it was on the delicate outer fringes of sleep.  I was brought to by a very loud and high-pitched squeaking. Skittering followed.  I knew what was going on. I had lived in the country my entire life and I was all too familiar with this sound, and I knew what it meant. 

I sat there for a couple of minutes.  Trying to ignore this mouse in distress.  Trying to get back to sleep.  How could all these girls sleep through all this loud ass squeaking?  I had had enough.  I do not like to see animals suffer.  I do not believe in these traps that take hours and hours to kill.  I got up and followed the squeaking.  I already knew what I had to do.  I had to put him out of his misery. I grabbed a broom and turned it over so the handle was facing down.  

I followed the noise till I came upon the source of it.  Before me, an adult mouse and a baby mouse were trapped in the glue trap.  The adult mouse had already chewed one paw off and was already working on another.  The baby mouse was already dead.  

I stood up, hardened my heart, took aim.  I asked God and the mouse for forgiveness.  I jammed the handle into his neck.  I wanted a clean, quick death.  No more suffering for this little dude who already chewed off one of his own paws.  I stood there and watched him jerk until the jerking stopped.  

Yes, I cried.  Yes, my heart hurt for this daddy/mommy mouse and baby mouse.  I quietly cried and asked God to forgive me for what I had just did.  I went back to bed and cried myself to sleep.
I only slept for maybe an hour and a half.  I was ripped awake by a bright light being thrown on and voices of the other girls rising.  It wasn't 6am.  I was thankful I got the few hours of sleep. 

The girls could tell that I had been crying.  They could also tell that I was still very sick.  I shouldn't have told them what I did.  

Amy told me, “Well looks like we know who’s going to be catching and killing all the mice from here on out, huh?”  When she found out what I had done.

I felt like my life was falling apart. I knew it was going to get worse before it was going to get better but I wasn’t expecting it to be this bad. 
My heart was beating too fast.  The strain of being overweight,  detoxing, and my past drug abuse was almost too much.  I needed my medication to regulate my heartbeat.  They already made me stop taking my antidepressant.  The medication that I had been on for over 8 years since my brother died. 

This was too much.  The emotional roller coaster of not having my regular medication and detoxing was making me look like a complete lunatic.  I literally begged God to kill me.  I can not do this.  I couldn't.  It was too much.  I'm too big of a coward to kill myself. I told God he had to do it.  I begged and begged and begged Him to end my misery.
Alas...He said, ""Girl...the world hasn't seen enough of you.""",18Jun2018,2

15,"It was Saturday and we were going to comic con today and after getting to get ready i see my cat Jake on the floor which was odd i went to the bathroom came back to wake him up, but after i touch him he didn't jump up in surprise. After that my heart sunk deepest it could go, after that i knew i  had to tell my parents my mom was the most devastated we put him a box for transport to the vet they left me alone with him for 30min or so while they got ready because the family knew that he was my cat that followed every i go but it was time to go to comic con i got ready trying hide the urges to cry dad carried his to the car to take to the vet. Mom and I went inside mom told them we don't his age all we know we have for 9 years which hurt knowing that he was at my side for that long,  we gave them the box giving them a warning that he was heavy, that was my last goodbye to jake we walk out of the building mom put her arm lean on to me and cry knowing that our catter loaf is gone. 

Jake was a orange tabby he was a fat, hairy, lazy, cat that i called my own waking up every day just to meow at for waking him up or he tells me good morning and while i getting ready for work. When i come back home from work i see him at the top of the stairs to greet me and follows me to my room gets on my bed next to the desk I sit on my chair jake is on my left on the top of my bed where the head goes he lay down on a mlp blanket that he only lays in.

A day after his death has not been easy every my phone vibrates i always think that hes purring but i look to my left all i see is the blanket, a habit for me is to reach out with my left and the feel of emptiness that my big furball is not there. really hurts me knowing that i don't have my friend who has been with me for 9 years

16,"I am a male &amp; expecting my first child to be born in around 4 weeks. (Yay!)

I work for a huge corporate company &amp; started last June. When we first got pregnant, I checked out all the policy on leave, and found out that maternity leave was 16 weeks &amp; paternity leave (mine) was 4 weeks.

Sweet! I get a whole month off with pay to spend time with my wife &amp; son. 

In January, the policy was changed (supposedly to be more inclusive of same sex couples). There is no longer maternity leave &amp; paternity leave. Only PARENTAL leave. 

The new policy states that a primary caregiver of the child is allowed 16 weeks, while the secondary caregiver is allowed 4 weeks. The policy states that the primary caregiver designation is at the parents’ discretion. 

I have recently been planning to take the 16 weeks by designating as primary caregiver. However, this policy change is not widely known in my local office, as I am the only father to be and no one has a reason to be aware of it. 

If I take the 16 weeks as policy allows, I know I am going to receive backlash from my coworkers &amp; manager because I am a male. However, it is not up to them nor can they do anything about it. I have already spoken with HR. 

A few family members of mine have also implied that I will be taking a wrongful advantage of this policy, mainly because I work full time while my wife works part time &amp; will be staying home the majority of the time throughout our baby’s life. 

Am I doing something “wrong”? 

I will genuinely be spending the majority of my time off with my child. My wife will have just delivered &amp; be exhausted &amp; recovering. This would allow me to take on the brunt of the work while she tests &amp; prepares to return to her PT job in two weeks. 

I feel like if the company now allows people to choose who will be primary caregiver for the “length of the leave”, then I should take advantage of this potentially once in a lifetime opportunity. 

Advice please. Thank you.

17,"I had a much needed conversation with one of my very best friends a couple of days ago. 

Very rarely do I ever look back and realize, “hey, ally. you’re doing something.” I never give myself credit for accomplishments. I didn’t even realize that I’ve picked up two new hobbies - ukulele and writing (again. my long lost love). I’ve spent so much of my life meshing myself into all of these different characters - I adopt the traits of those who surround me. 

I guess I’m just becoming more of myself and who I’m supposed to be... fuck it, who I *want* to be. I know I need to leave some people behind. I know this is part of growing up. I think I’m okay with that. ",18Jun2018,3
18,"Last night I was sitting in the lounge room and heard my housemate having sex over the sound of the TV. I could hear them both moaning and the bed kept hitting the wall. I hate hearing other people have sex. I just don’t want to listen to it. 

I thought I should let her know about it. Firstly, I don’t wanna listen to that shit. Secondly, if it were me I’d be embarrassed but I think I’d want to know. 

Anyway, basically she didn’t give a shit. But now I feel embarrassed for bringing it up. I was all like “I don’t wanna embarrass you but...” and she was just like “oh I’m not embarrassed about it at all, I don’t care who hears it, but if it bothers you I guess I can be more careful”.

Evan isn’t his real name, but it’s what I’ll call him here.

When I’m not where I’m supposed to be at school, Evan will check my usual crying spots. He’ll sit with me, listen to me, and help me get back to normal. 

My siblings and Evan are the only reason I’m not bullied mercilessly, and probably why I’m not dead yet. 

I have a major self consciousness issue regarding how I’m “babyfaced”. I wear makeup and have piercings to combat looking so babyfaced, and I do it to a somewhat unhealthy level. Evans helped me get to feel better about myself.

20,"I made a post a while back when I had an overwhelming first day at my first job, Wendy’s. I messed up a lot but looking back it was a pretty typical first day for much people. The next few days I got *slightly* better and I still had the excuse of being new when I messed up.

But now its been a month working there and I honestly believe that most of my coworkers think that I’m a fucking moron. I do great in school, and I consider myself a pretty smart person, but for some reason I struggle *so much* when it comes to focusing and listening to people. 

This fucks me over when it comes to this job because of how I’m always being asked to do things, and if I’m not certain I know what I’m doing I’ll ask a ton of questions. It takes me a lot longer to learn how things compared to others.

On top of that I make absolutely boneheaded mistakes that make people think there’s something wrong with me. Like when a coworker went on break for 20 minutes and he ordered something and I literally asked him if he was “staying or going”, which lead to my manager burst out laughing. It wasn’t that bad but in total it was the one of the many times I’ve come across as a retard to her. He then asked for a small cup and I gave him a fucking senior sized one and he just awkwardly looked at me until I realized what I did. 

Of course what amplifies this problem is my anxiety and awkwardness around people. I was hoping that this job would help my SA like I’ve heard it does for people but I feel no different. I’m still my same awkward self who is always crushed when I have pressure on me. It’s like my mind turns off and I’ll make the worst mistake socially or while working.

I know what all these people think about me doesn’t matter in the slightest but it just *kills* me to see how hard it is to feel normal. Working there depresses me but I need this money badly.

I shouldn't have to clarify that acting on pedophilia is a horrendous act, but the support shown in those comments for such a barbaric act of vigilantism is getting to me at the moment. 

It's extremely disturbing to me that so many (seemingly) average people could praise something so terrible. I read another comment within the thread calling someone (with a reaction similar to mine) a 'pedophile apologist' for disagreeing with the act of setting fire to another human being. 

Putting aside the fact that the 'subject' of the headline had not faced any sort of trial, and that the story could be a complete hoax, the amount of cheering and celebration is terrifying to me. Even if someone *were* undeniably guilty of abusing a child in such a way, is burning them alive really an act of a civilised people?

29,"I have been talking with several students and watched many commentaries from youtube and other platforms.

I want to share to you other's students perspectives.

This time i will present to you 3 commentaries. I ran over 1000+ commentaries and i really liked these, so i will share them to you. They are from this youtube video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqTTojTija8&amp;t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqTTojTija8&amp;t=3s)

Starting with a user called ""Fluttershy Flower"", he said:

&gt;This speaks to my heart. I was in an awful public school that didn’t give me the **extra** help I required (504 Plan) and that caused me to constantly **fail**. I was **anxious** in class depending on where they sat me, and I **couldn’t focus**. I felt **dumb and hurt** that I wasn’t understanding the lesson **like other people**. And then, my best friend committed suicide. It was devastating. I then come to find out the school **KNEW** about my friends issues and they **did nothing** to help. They always made our needs as individuals **unimportant and pressured** us to work harder at the things we struggled at. I ended up failing almost all my classes because of the **stress** of my lost friend and people **harassing**me, telling me I should join my friend. I became homeschooled and graduated at only 16 years old and I’m already looking at colleges. Public school wasn’t for me.  
Thank you for this message, it spoke more then I could have hoped for about how I feel when it comes to school. I hope to maybe one day **fix** the American school system, because ironically, I’ve always wanted to be a teacher.

This is one more example that shows the lack of support on schools and the amount of preassure they put on students.

School must be at least accommodating for students (it's totally the contrary, it should give them the power to know who they truly are (guess what... they even alienate people and make students feel like they are dumb and defected).

Another comment i liked by someone called Luaq said:

&gt;I agree with EVERYTHING that was said. It is time to **change** school because like said, ""school is **supposed** to prepare students for the **future**,"" but it absolutely isn't doing so. If I look at people in my class today, I do not see future careers in them (no offense). But, it isn't their **fault** they're just doing what they're **told**. It's funny because I was told in school that there would be at least 20,000 development jobs unfilled in about 10-20 years due to lack of education or interest in doing the job.

I agree with him, that seems really unfair, and instead of fulfilling students with happiness and fellowship, it's making students subject themselves as factory machines, to addictions and to consumerism society, without questioning why they are doing this.

The last comment from someone called Lillian Gilchrist

&gt;This is why I got suspended... I **argued** to much about **why** I should do my work and why they want every student to be **average**, I never did do my work at school. You know why? Because **I don't see the point** in it. They say it is so I **get a good job**. Now I have been put in a special needs class because I argue with the school system. I want to be a motivational speaker when I leave school. I think the world needs more of it. School is a load of **crap**.

The system punish students who wonder ""why"". Once again it shows the mentality of teaching that is faced towards creating robots. ""you will get a good job"", you will have a great future"", they promise as a lie that only sucks students, waste their energy, takes them from what they love to do.

Seeing these students passing though what i did disgusts me...

I will continue posting more about the perspective of other students i come in the way.

31,"Back only like 10 years ago it seemed like the internet was just so much more of its own thing, whereas now its just an integrated part of modern society. 

I miss when the internet felt like a community. 

I mean so many of the things that seemed quintessentially internetty, are gone.  ",18Jun2018,1
33,"Because of being abandoned by the people I was supposed to trust, when new authoritive people came into my life, I would not trust, or even listen to them. Why would I, when the people that were supposed to always be there for me, left me alone in the world? I wouldn't, and neither would most people. So?

I am telling my story. I have made every mistake you can make. Because I did not trust anyone, I chose to experience every terrible thing that a person could experience. I don't want anyone to have to feel the pain that I myself have. 

The web series is about to start. It is going to be intense, even insane at times, and hopefully, before you try to beat me down for the things I have done, you remember that I am a disabled person.

I just want to help. I hope that I CAN help. Even only one person. 

To being bold.

34,"And I was running late (Couldnt find the heeled shoes I wanted to wear, then had to change my shirt, then had to make my hair look presentable), and then I couldn't find the place. I was going to say that I got lost, but fuck that- the place was a fucking hole in the wall. I walked back and forth around the same few blocks in black clothes in 90F weather, asked for directions 3 times, and had to walk in and out of multiple buildings. Im irritated af, but I'm really trying not to take it out in any one and just calm tf down (by making this post). If i can't make a good impression after banging on these nondescript doors and looking angry for a few minutes then oh fucking well. I already have one job, and a second (summer) one lined up. I wanted this to be my longterm second job, but- hell. If I dont get this after this trouble then that just means that Im not meant to have this job (this is my second time trying to interview with them- I didnt even make it to the building the first time.)

36,"There's a girl I dated for about 5 months a few years ago, my first girlfriend really. Our relationship started because she was in another bad one. We both were going through a lot of change at the time it didn't work out to make an uninteresting long story short. We're still good friends and hang out a few times a week. Shes moved on and has a new boyfriend and seems to be content. I haven't and I'm not.

I've had depression and some anxiety since my father died when I was a kid, but the last 6 months have been absolutely incredible. A lot of change has started happening again recently that could've ended up sending down a dark path if I didn't handle it correctly. I moved to a new apartment with a new roommate, I'm going back to school in the fall, and I have an absolutely amazing job with an absolutely amazing boss (he's paying for some of the school.) So everything should be great. I should be happy or at the very least content with my life as it stands. But there are often times throughout the say that I get sad for lack of a better word. I'm still lonely. I feel like I don't have anyone to relate to, that really understands me. That's what's been missing.

That's what I miss most. I miss a lot about that girl, but when I was with her I finally felt like I belonged. I knew my place in the universe. Sometimes I can still catch glimpses of those emotions when I'm with her, sometimes romantically sometimes not. But I'm never truly with her.

I still love this girl.

I don't want to. She doesn't want me to. But  I still love this girl.",18Jun2018,1
37,"This happened to me. A Trump supporter was stalking me. They followed me to at _least_ 3 different subreddits making comments about me. I reported this to the admins, because it's a bannable offense. U/gaazda suspended _me_ for reporting it, and left that user completely untouched.

I had had zero history with the admins to that point; no reports, and I had never reported anything. I don't think I'd ever even been banned from a subreddit. 

I'm not the only person U/gaazda has done this to. They seem to have come to power sometime last summer, and immediately turned Reddit's customer service in that direction. He will simply turn a blind eye to a user's harassment if they're a Trump supporter, and he will ban you simply for reporting something if you're not.

I'm looking for other people who have had experiences with him, because I know he's done it to many people before me.",18Jun2018,458

43,"These past few weeks I’ve finally managed to teach myself how to just get up and leave when something isn’t enjoyable. I’ve finally learned to put my comfort first instead of social interactions. I’ve left a club early cause it wasn’t fun (whereas I would’ve stayed till the end if it was me a couple of weeks ago) and I just left a concert 2 mins after getting cause there wasn’t a spot for me and my friend was obviously saving the spot next to him for some girl he’s hitting and did no effort to give me the chair. I just got up and left, didn’t waste any energy on this and honestly it feels amazing.

44,"So I know that when people stand up too quickly , they can get light headed and their vision goes dark. But in my case , it has gotten really weird. 

Sometimes when this happens , I’ll start seeing weird flashes of light that looks like electrical currents , or see faces of people I know. I’ll start to hear a loud buzzing noice. Sometimes I’ll see tracers of my body moving downwards and I’ll think “I know the future.” Idk why. Keep in mind this is all happens in the period of about 5 seconds. 

And occasionally I’ll start to have a seizure type episode. Sometimes i remember them and others I don’t. When i do , I’m just laying on the ground or bed shaking uncontrollably and I have no control. When I don’t , it feels like I just passed out for a brief second. However my roommate told me that I was having a hardcore seizure and it lasted for like 10 seconds. It’s weird because I had thought i was only gone for a brief second and don’t remember any of that. 
 
So wtf is wrong with me ? ",18Jun2018,1
45,"My good friend and next door neighbour of 5 years hung himself last week. 

My husband and I knew he had been having a hard time, but had distanced ourselves a bit over the past 6 months because his self destructive behaviour and issues with drugs and alcohol were affecting our family, and I particularly didn't want our 9 year old daughter to see him like that. 

We still checked in on him, kept in contact with his on/off girlfriend, and tried to be there for him when we could. Obviously we didn't do enough. When I was giving the police my statement, all I could hear was all the red flags coming out of my mouth. How the fuck did I not see this coming.

The last time I spoke to him was June 6. He stumbled around the corner, slurring and rambling on; he was finally going to be evicted after numerous chances, his girlfriend was apparently out doing drugs with other guys, and he wanted to talk about a fight we had had way back during our St. Patrick's Day party, when I had asked him to leave after he wouldn't stop aggressively hitting on my married friend in front of her husband. I was irritated, it was a school night and I was trying to cook dinner and get my shit together for the next day. I listened for a bit but then told him to go home and sleep it off, we'll talk it over when you're sober. I just can't have you here when you're like this, my kid can hear you. He told me that my husband and I were good friends, that we were good people and he was just shit, dirt. I said he was being ridiculous, he's seen us at our worst and to not be so hard on himself. He gave me a hug and nearly fell down the stairs leaving. I called out, take care of yourself, and he put up his middle finger, said fuck you and laughed as he went around the corner. I watched through the window until he went back in his house and shut the door.

I can't even remember if I saw him after that. I think I did, sitting on his deck having a smoke, but I'm not sure. Its almost the end of the school year, my daughter has a ton of end of year activities and events. I got distracted. I thought about him, and did plan on talking to him, but I put it off. I figured we'd be getting together soon anyway, my birthday is this week and we always all spent it together, at an annual backyard BBQ. 

He was trying to reach out. I see that now, but at the time I didn't. He's always been a bit of a mess, but I never thought this would happen. I texted my best friend that last night I talked to him, and was telling her about seeing him. Rereading those messages, it's clear as day how much more fucked up he was than usual. Everything I hear and read is about not blaming yourself, but it's super fucking obvious to me that we had an opportunity to try and make a difference, but I was too stupid and blind to see it. He had mentioned getting together soon, we agreed to make a plan for the near future. He hadn't decided yet, there was an opportunity to change his mind, maybe this wouldn't have happened. 

This past Saturday (the 16th) my husband and I were having our morning coffee out on the deck. Our daughter was still sleeping. It was such a beautiful day, the first day in a predicted heat wave. We talked about our plans; my husband wanted to mow our gigantic shared lawn before it got too hot, and then we planned to run some errands and I was going to prep for Father's Day dinner Sunday. It was a really nice morning. 

One of us said, maybe we should check in on our neighbour, and let him know the lawn was going to be mowed so he didn't wake up to it. My husband asked if he should call or just bang on the door. I said go knock. He went ahead of me, I hung back in the yard to watch, waiting to go say hello. No answer, he started banging, calling out. He said, hey buddy wake up... everything alright? ...hey just answer me and let me know you're ok and I'll leave you alone. I walked over, my husband is getting more frantic. He asked me, should I stand on the chair and look over the curtains? I said yes. We weren't even sure if he was home, he didn't usually go out much, was really quite a hermit, but since we hadn't spent much time together recently we didn't really know his day to day life. 

An important note, a few years ago he was buying drugs and got into an argument with a dealer, and the guy kicked him out of his truck so hard he landed on his head and sustained a pretty significant head injury. He suffered from occasional seizures after that, and all around was never quite the same. This is one of the main reasons we always tried to regularly check in on him. He was estranged from most of his family due to his past actions, and he didn't have many friends anymore, at least none that visited. He went to doctors and specialists, but from what he told me there wasn't much they could do for him. I don't know all the details. I do know we were forever telling him to find another doctor, try someone else, be honest with them about your symptoms. He acted like it was all a big hassle for him, or laughed it off.

My husband stood on the chair and looked in the window. He didn't say anything at first, and I was asking, what, what, is he there? He told me after that he was just about to call out, I can see you hiding there! But the room was dark, and when he realized what he was seeing he jumped back and ran back saying over and over, call 911. It didn't even occur to me that he'd be dead. I thought maybe he had been wasted, fell, hurt himself accidentally. Help would come. My husband told the dispatcher, come immediately, check on my neighbour, and they asked him if he could get in. They told him to go try the door. He handed me the phone and I don't even remember what I said. It was actually the first time I've ever spoken to a 911 dispatcher, which is the only thing I remember thinking. The door was locked and the operator said police are coming to kick the door in and the ambulance is right behind it.  

I hung up and looked at my husband and knew immediately. He came and grabbed onto me and he was shaking and crying and then he said that he saw him there, hanging from the beam in the kitchen entrance. That's why he had thought he was hiding, because he was tucked just slightly around the corner. 

The rest of the morning was hell. The sirens woke up my daughter and I heard her screaming for me so I ran inside, hysterically and unsuccessfully trying to calm her down. Told her dad and I are fine, it's the neighbour. She knew. Right away she knew he had died. The police were asking for me and I had to leave her, crying, yelling as I left, don't look out the window. It was pure hell. I live in the center of a small town and everyone was staring as they drove and walked by. I kept telling every cop I spoke to, someone contact his girlfriend before she finds out from someone else. I didn't want to be the one to tell her either. The 4 of us were once so close, but the distance we put between us had extended to her too. Heavy drug use affects your relationships, friendships. It's not my thing. And now, we'll never be able to go back to the way things were. 

They didn't know how long he'd been there. His last known activity was on his phone on Sunday, the 10th. We were out all that day on a family hike, and I wonder if he came by when we weren't home. We've been 30 feet away this whole time and had no idea. I feel like I've been punched in the chest every time I think about it.

I miss my friend. He was so flawed, he was rude, he never knew when to drop a subject, he didn't pick up on social cues well. He walked with a ridiculous swagger that showed a confidence that he didn't actually have. He teased me for being uptight and called me Boss since the day we met, on the day he moved in. Always showed up at random and inopportune times with at least 2 Extra Old Stock beers in hand. Said, ""It is what it is,"" and I hate that saying. He used to have one of those little taco bell dogs, he loved her so much and I remember how broken he was and how he cried when she was hit by a car on our way home from the beach and the fucking insensitive taxi driver we got a ride from tried to bill him for the blood and I yelled at that cabbie like I've never yelled at anyone. We spent every holiday with him at least once, and when my husband's grandmother passed 2 years ago, he was the first one to bring us a card and flowers. He left behind his girlfriend and her 5 year old daughter, who was so close to him and viewed him as the only father figure in her life. I could keep going. He drove me fucking crazy, annoyed the shit out of me, but we all loved him anyway and I wish more than anything this wouldn't have happened. 

This is incredibly long and I apologize for taking up such a chunk of your day if you bothered to read this far. Today is my first day alone at home and I'm having a hard time and needed to get all this out of my head. 

Hug your loved ones. RIP Shawn.",18Jun2018,11

47,"I should preface this by saying that incels fucking disgust me. There is absolutely no excuse for promoting violence of any kind towards women, and the misogynistic and entitled bullshit that underlies their thought processes are absolutely terrifying. Effectively seeking to dehumanise half the population cause you can’t get laid is repulsive and nothing makes me happier than to see these people called out on their bullshit.

But what scares me is how much I understand them, and how similar I can be. Not finding any girl who finds you attractive and seeing a large percentage of the world having no problem getting with each other is insanely frustrating. I’m 20 and I’m the only virgin out of all my friends, and people act like I’m some kind of leper for never having had sex. There’s nothing more disheartening than the world reminding you in some way everyday how lonely you are, and having to watch most people be happier than you and more personally fulfilled because they weren’t fucked over by the genetic lottery. It makes you feel sun-human, like there’s some deep flaw about you that will never get fixed and that nobody is able to look past to connect with you.

When you’re faced with this shit all your life, I think it can be a struggle not to succumb to anger. I’ve been there when I was a bit younger, getting angry that no girls take notice of me, as if it’s everyone else’s fault I’m so lonely. It’s a horrible place to be i, and I think it’s where incels stay in; it’s like everyone is telling you somehow that you’re not good enough, and for a lot of people it’s easier to blame some other problem (i.e. a whole other gender) than be able to accept you may be flawed.

As I left school I thankfully got out of that head space, and as I made meaningful friendships with a few girls in my life I began to realise that they’re human too, which sounds blatantly obvious but is easy to forget when you’re an awkward teen and girls are this otherworldly concept you’ve been putting on a pedestals for your formative years. I’d consider one girl I know one of my very best friends, and I know she feels the same to me and she’s constantly going on about how ‘she can’t understand how nothing’s happened for me yet’. In fact most girls I know express something similar, even while none of them like me like that. I’ve focused on improving myself, instead of blaming the rest of the world for some personal problem. I think I come across now as a lot more confident, I’m not that intensely afraid to just talk to a girl, and I’m definitely a bit more relaxed. I try to be kind to everyone I meet and not let my own lack of confidence get in the way of trying to form meaningful relationships with people. 

But despite all this still no girl has ever found me attractive, and as my social life improved I still see all my friends find girls, wheresas I’m completely passed over and never looked at twice. It still hurts my confidence a lot. It’s like the whole idea of ever having sex with me is a joke to most people I meet. A lot of other people just have these connections happen for them naturally, but for me it’s like I’ve had to put all this work in to being a fundamentally better person, and even after that nobody ever seems to want to get to know me in that way. 

I see some of my more attractive friends just walk up to girls and dance with them in clubs, or even more wildly actually get approached by girls themselves (this has never happened to me once in my life) and you can see the attraction and warmth there, whereas if I even dance in the vicinity of some girls I get weary looks as if the idea of me talking to them is just horrifying. The same friends will ask me why I’d never approach some random girl, and it’s cause I know for a fact they’d think I’m some kind of weirdo, and that I’d never get away with the behaviour of some of my friends. Hell, one time I bumped into a girl I knew from work, and her friend walked away from us, and she explained to me ‘I’m so sorry about her, she thinks you’re a creep or something’. I never even do much as glanced at her, she’d just laid eyes on me and judged me cause I’m not physically attractive. That is downright shitty and can destroy someone’s confidence. 

I dunno, it really does seem to me sometimes that it’s a whole different set of rules for attractive people and unattractive people. I’m constantly terrified of approaching any girl I find attractive for fear of getting labelled a creep and being told to fuck off, whereas it’s like if you’re sufficiently attractive it’s fair game and people will give you a chance to get to know them. I don’t feel any hatred over it, and I’ve accepted for some people it’s just the way it is, but it still really gets me down that things have just never worked out for me. I really do value all the women in my life, and they do give me a confidence boost when I’m told repeatedly that there’s nothing wrong with me, that I’m a funny and intelligent dude and that I’ll find someone eventually, but after so long it starts to feel hollow when not even one girl I’ve met actually turns around and wants to get with me. I feel a sort of pity for incels because the same loneliness I feel a lot has completely taken over their life to the point that they’ve become hateful, spiteful and incapable of any kind of meaningful human connection.  But it’s hard to ignore that loneliness completely, it’s in your face almost everyday telling you you’re somehow fundamentally flawed and undeserving of love. Its easy to say the confidence needs to come from within you, but it’s hard to muster it up when nobody has ever given you reason to believe otherwise. It’s hard to rise above all that and not get angry at it all, and it’s fucking horrible watching how it twists people into the pathetic and sad little angry men that a lot of incels become. It terrifies me that it could have been me if I’d given in to my own loneliness and lack of self worth.",18Jun2018,1
48,"So I work for a company that does a lot of webinars during the month. Usually there's two different kinds of webinars we do for people and the one I happened to do today was the first different one by myself (usually my boss is in the room with me watching the webinar and she has told me I've done a good job so far but).

These webinars are supposed to be recorded so for this one today, I forgot to record not only parts of it, but I spoke too soon on one part, showed slides too early that I wasn't supposed to, and I was on mute and I had to unmute myself at times when the presenter called out to me to switch slides/etc.

Not only that but apparently I screwed up so bad that attendees were emailing my boss telling me how rude I was to the presenter and how unprofessional I was because apparently I had my FB notifications on the desktop (I'm still trying to figure that out because I didn't connect Facebook to my work computer and I didn't share my screen). She was very blunt in telling me what people emailed her and she told me to just redo the webinar-- I apologized to her and she said it is all good but I still can't help but feel like I disappointed her a lot

I spent the whole morning crying bc not only my boss but everyone probably thinks I'm incompetent and can't run a webinar to save her life I guess. I still feel super bad about messing up a lot of stuff today and it's ruined my day that I'm still hung up over it I guess.",18Jun2018,0

52,"I’m 33f and have numerous physical and mental problems. The main ones being chronic fatigue syndrome, depersonalisation disorder, personality disorder, plus stomach problems. I haven’t been able to work for about five years now or form normal relationships. My dad (and my brother) believe it’s all in my head and that I’m a hypochondriac and just lazy, and when I even mention anything about my health in passing I get a very quick subject change or completely ignored. I tried to explain two or three times via email to no avail. They were ignored completely. I don’t make a drama about it or talk about it all the time, but if he asks me how I am on the phone I’ll occasionally pluck up the courage to say ‘I’m actually not very well just now’ he’ll ignore it and change the subject. So I’ve learned to mostly say ‘I’m fine’. He often asks me to travel to visit him despite trying to explain in the least dramatic way possible that I can’t because I’m not well enough but it just doesn’t register. He won’t come to see me because he doesn’t want to come back here since he separated from my mum. So I’m kind of backed into a corner. My brother is with my dad on this and they both emailed me once to say ‘me and dad discussed your hypochondria and think you should get help for it’. That was the height of their involvement in my issues and that was three or four years ago. I don’t get it because my brothers ex gf had fibromyalgia and he talked about her condition and how badly she suffered. Anyway, I can go a year or two being nice to them and then I just get tired and angry and I don’t email them for months on end. My friends and other family members are baffled by their behaviour because they see me struggle on a daily basis. Well, I guess what I want to know is, should I keep pretending and keep talking nice to my dad and brother so I don’t lose them completely and regret anything down the line? Or should I just say fuck it and let them think what they want and not bother with them anymore? My feeling about them change so much from one month to the next.

54,"I am unhappy. I am particularly unhappy this very moment. Everything is repulsive to me, and I mean that in both the usual sense and in the sense that I feel ""repelled"" like a magnet. Not games nor television nor sleep is the least bit appealing to me right now. It's a horrible feeling. I suppose writing isn't too bad, but more likely than not, I'll make it another paragraph or two and give up in frustration.

Normally, I'm not too unhappy, just a little. I can still do things I think I ought to do. But I often wonder if I really ought to do them. I think to myself, ""Is this really going to get me to where I want to be?"" and, ""Where exactly *do* I want to be?"" Those two questions together do a lot to undermine my motivation, and though I said I can still do things I think I ought to do, I probably need a ""sometimes"" somewhere in that phrase.

In fact, day-to-day, I get very little done—frustratingly little. I spend a moment drawing, a moment practicing piano, a moment studying a foreign language, a moment reading a book. Somehow, all those moments add up to a lot of time but very little productivity, and then the day is done. And then the day restarts.

Things that used to take me an hour or two to learn now take me days or even a whole week, and even then, I worry that it won’t stay in my memory.

The moment I see a question I don’t instantly get, my confidence collapses, and my subconscious sees its as further confirmation that I’m turning irreversibly dumber and dumber.

I don’t know what’s going on - my grades, my mental agility, the things I used to value the most about myself, are failing. Everything I do now is riddled with self-doubt, and hard as I’ve tried, I can’t shake off the thoughts. They just keep getting worse and worse, and it’s making my anxiety skyrocket, especially as I’m in the middle of some pretty important exams right now. 

I have a maths exam tomorrow, which normally I wouldn’t even bother revising for, but I’ve done dozens of past papers and I’m still panicking.

Financial (and parental) difficulties means I won’t be able to get therapy - if I even need it at all.

It’s a vicious cycle I can’t break - I feel unconfident and I panic, which makes me perform badly, and that kills my confidence and makes me panic again.

I would really appreciate any advice or thoughts on this. Thank you for reading.",18Jun2018,44
60,"My weight is my biggest worry, I literally stress over it constantly. My summer bucket list for school, seriously said, ""Lose weight.""

I've done my research and I'm developing an eating disorder. I eat one meal a day (usually breakfast), and drink water the rest of the day and go to sleep weighing less at night then i did when I wake up. This has only been going on a few days, because I usually crave and binge food, but not this week. My appetite is almost completely gone, I have a pool party to go to tomorrow and I really wanted a flat stomach, but that isn't the case.

I am 5'4 and I weigh 137lbs, which is the most I've ever weighed. I know I don't look fat, but I'm just unhappy with my weight, I want to be a size 4 in clothing, but I'm a size 6.

Is it unhealthy to try to lose 30lbs in over the summer (3 months)?",18Jun2018,165
