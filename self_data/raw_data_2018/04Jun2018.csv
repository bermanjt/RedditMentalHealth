0,"So this is my first and most likely only post on this website. I’d like advice about self love and esteem. I am a woman, and do struggle with severe anxiety and depression. That said, like a ton of mental illnesses I don’t constantly struggle. 

Now onto the issue at hand, lately my anxiety has been getting worse and I feel as though I’m sinking. I credit myself on generally being a secure and loving person and have pretty good self esteem majority of the time however recently I’ve been struggling. I’ve been feeling ugly and worthless and I beat myself up about it even more as I’m someone who loves answers. Sadly, this is a huge issue as I am young. Despite being young I generally have good knowledge about my mind and how to control my anxiety but I’ve been struggling to use my usual techniques. All I’m looking for is some advice from a likeminded individual who can shed some light on how to cope. Thank you! ",04Jun2018,2

5,"About 4 months ago I took a new job that required me to spend 5 months a few states over with a monthly visit back home and afterwards I would be working back at home with a short commute.


I thought everything was okay at home and I we talked through it and decided that we were in a good enough place that I could leave and we would be okay. 


I went home last weekend to celebrate my daughter's birthday and my wife told me she wants a divorce. I'm devastated. I already hate this new job, I hate staying in tiny hotel room every night and I hate that I can't be home to try and fix things. 


I was already depressed that this new job isn't what I had expected and already longing to be back home, but after the news I'm not sure if have anything to even look forward to. 


I love my family, every decision I've made for the last 7 years has been to benefit our lives. We both grew up poor and in shitty situations. I've worked very hard to give us a quiet life in the suburbs with a nice house in a good area for our daughter to go to school. 


She said she's not happy and hasn't been for a long time. Our sex life was suffering but within the past year we've started having regular nights together and I thought things were back on track. Last week she told me she was only doing it to try to make things better and was slowly building resentment towards me. 

I'd do anything to fix this and here I am stuck 600 miles away as she drifts further away everyday. I feel so shitty. I hate these feelings, I hate that I have to spend another month in this hotel and I hate how far we've got from each other. 

I just want it to end. ",04Jun2018,1
6,"This post is created in order to hear the opinions of other people, since I myself can't come to the right conclusion and I'm too young.

I’m 21. I stand in the way of choosing two directions in life. Be an entrepreneur or be an artist (music producer). I'm have potential in both directions.

I am convinced that in order to become top 1 in a certain direction, it is necessary to invest in it completely (maybe 80%+ time). I can also combine them, but I will quickly get tired.

At the moment, I make good money on my job. Every month I spend 10% of that money so I have enough to have a good life and do whatever I want (hobbies).

What I want from life?
1. Financial freedom
2. Interesting life
3. People around me (not to be lonely)

Here is the pros and cons of both directions:
Why music?
1. You are a creative person, you are something magical for the rest
2. Girls (because lack of them now and in childhood)
3. Working with creative and interesting people
4. Interesting life
5. Travels.

Cons of music:
1. You can’t do it whole life if you not top tier artist, always it’s just you make 1 music hit and than artist «die»
2. Money (after 3-5 years of course there will be more, but it's too much time)
3. The schedule of life (tours).

Why business?
1. Financial Freedom
2. Money, it’s like a game, scores = money
3. My brain works like «I’m an entrepreneur»
4. Travels (because money)

Cons
1. Boring
2. New friends, meeting with interesting people (I think they will be very few)
3. Girls.

Now I am  21 years old, my brain works like I'am 30+ years old (thought about everything (""life"")), but I want to have fun like a 18 year old. It's strange.

On one hand, if I choose to become an entrepreneur, maybe! I'll regret that I did not try to become the top 1 music producer. On the other hand if I choose music, then I'll actually come to the same money as entrepreneur (in 3-5 years), but it's a long way and I think I'll get bored of being on tour and travel to other countries only for 1 night to play my music here and so when I'm become top 1 music producer do I really gonna need these tours and popularity, will not I get tired of it in the process of 3-5 years ?

I think the right decision will be to make a good passive income and make music. But then I will be top 1 not in 3-5 years, but much longer. And do I need it at 30+ years? I don't think no. Maybe I wrong.  

So I decided to write my thoughts here, maybe someone came across a similar choice in life and regrets something ... I would be interested to hear you, thanks!

10,"She died in 2014, at the age of 36, to metastic cancer. She was the closest person to me in life, we were chosen sisters. We met when we were kids, and both having very rough childhoods with crazy ass parents, we bonded. We made each other family. Throughout life's twists and turns, we remained close until her moment of death.


We had so many plans. We were going to travel the world together once my kiddos were grown. We wanted to volunteer with Doctors Without Borders. We wanted to be 2 crazy old ladies embarrassing our grandkids together, rockin' purple hair and telling the kids stories about when we were young. 


She was such a beautiful soul. She was truly kind to everyone.  She took her rough childhood and translated it into a level of understanding for and kindness to other people's struggles that  was beyond anyone I have known. For example, if a server was being horrible, she would double tip, because she wanted to make their day better if she could. I was the opposite of that...but in her memory I have focused on improving. 


I will never forget the look on her face when I arrived at the hospital when she was admitted the last time. We cried together, of course, but we also laughed together as we navigated the story of our lives and all the memories we shared...and then cried more knowing that story was ending.
She asked me to scatter her ashes around the world, places like Ireland, France, Greece, Italy. The places we were supposed to go together. This month, I am taking her to Paris and London. 


I think of my beautiful friend, my spirit sister, every day. While the pain of losing her has dulled, it has never left. It never will. My life will never be the same without her in it, but I will try to do my best to honor her memory. ",04Jun2018,9
11,"Definitely the biggest mistake of my life (so far).

We were pretty great together, honestly. I'm 21. We instantly hit it off and started living together right off the bat. It went pretty great for a whole year. She started working nights and it the honeymoon phase finally ended. I don't know what I was thinking. I guess I thought I could do better; I guess I wanted to 'find myself.'

She took it really hard. I had my doubts but I guess I figured change is good. Moving out was really tough, but I stayed stoic and assumed it had to be done. She took it really hard. That was a month ago.

Since then I've realized it was a huge mistake. I miss her more than anything, and I hate being single. That wasn't a bad relationship, I'm absolutely certain of it. I threw something wonderful away because I was too full of myself to even try to fix it. It could've been improved so easily.

I texted her two days ago. I told I regretted it. She said she still loves me. I told her I still love her too.

I texted her today. I said I wanted to see her. She said she doesn't want to see me and she told me to stop texting her.

I told her I've made a huge mistake and I'm just so sorry to put her through all this. I told her I'd leave her alone now.

She was my best friend for so long, and I was hers. I don't blame her for anything.

I very much struggle staying focused. A lot of this has to do with my phone but I find that even if I remove my phone from my surroundings I still find my mind wandering. It takes me exorbitant amounts of time to accomplish small things.

19,"Didn't do it for this purpose, but turned out that way.

Found a local arcade and went.  Was playing Mario Kart.  This will seem like obvious stuff but I just found it interesting because I haven't been in an arcade in a while.

I mostly only played adults, when I saw kids waiting I would get up and let them play, then sit back down when all seats were vacant or adults were playing against each other.  When playing against adults:

\- most people who sat down to play, when I beat them once or twice, they would get up and leave, even if they had put in more play credits than they used.  Sometimes they gave me dirty looks, but usually they would just get up and leave.

\- very rarely, after losing, they would lean over to shake my hand and say ""good game""

I only played against a kid twice, and in both cases it was just me and the kid with their parent\(s\) watching, so two player not four player.

\- the first time I played against a kid I did it with the intent of letting him win, because I saw he had lost the last two games he had played and was getting upset.  So I let him get in first, then I sat behind him and intentionally didn't pass him.  Whenever I saw an AI opponent that would end up passing him, I would attack them or ram their kart, whatever, to slow them down to let the kid maintain the lead.  When he won he threw his arms up and went ""Yay!"", then his mom said to him ""That man let you win"", and then the kid shot me a really dirty looked, got up and stomped away in a fit.

\- the second time I was like OK, I will just play normally.  His parents were watching him play.  I sat down and plugged in.  I picked the hardest stage possible, the dad made a comment about it \(basically letting me know he thought I was being a jerk\), and then I ended up getting first place.  Didn't hold back, whenever the kid did something to try and pass me or whatever, I would ram him, fire an item at him, whatever.  Despite the stage's difficulty, the game is designed to have a handicap effect \(or maybe it's something the owner can toggle on or off\), so the kid still ended up getting second place, but he was still really unhappy about it because I treated him like a regular opponent, and this was due to my prior experience where I got a negative social response for helping a kid get a win.  Then the mom says to me ""You're a real jerk."", the kid gets up and they walk away.

There was a lesson in this for me in the form of a chemical sensation that was one of these neutral ""nobody wins in life no matter what it is they think they're getting"".  A small level and obviously a small sample pool \(though again my intent wasn't to do something scientific, I just went to have fun and it ended up becoming this other thing\), but still a solid reminder of this fact of life.  At least for me, having been there.",04Jun2018,3

Also I need a days worth of drinking to deal with the come down, so we’re looking at Wednesday now... but then these thoughts are coming into my mind like if I keep on doing this I must deep down inside not want to quit.

25,"I have recently begun blogging to save my own ass.  This is mostly because I went through a lot of health stuff and in conjunction with being a stay at home mom, it has been rough. Blogging gives me an outlet that is just for me \(not for husband or toddler\) to share the vulnerable or hysterical parts of my life. I have rarely \(if at all\) participated in social media for the last few years. I digress, because of this I have been more active on social media and more accepting of friend invites etc. For some background, I have also been married for the last few years and with health issues, I wasn't doing a ton in public \(and especially not without Hubby\) so unwanted advances have not been an issue as of late. Fast\-forward to a few days of opening up my Facebook and I am getting catfished and a ridiculous amount of friend requests and messages.

Let's start with the catfishing, shall we? You might be a catfish if.......you have twenty friends, six pictures and you opened your facebook account in 2018. You might be a catfish if you look like the Alcide from True Blood and your six pack has six packs. No one is buying what you are selling. Also: So. Many. Men. Pretending. To. Be. Hot. Military. Men. Just stop. It is disgraceful to steal someone's pictures who is a model pretending to be serving our country.

Enter into the picture a Middle Eastern man who sends me a series of messages while I am working on my laptop. I only mention his ethnicity because it becomes significant in a little while. So, I get a picture of........myself. Why? WTF. Why would a picture of me, from my own facebook make me want to talk to you. Next comes......another picture of me. Great, I'm being inundated with pictures of myself which I don't even really like in general let alone resent to my by a strange dumbass. Then......wait for it......a picture of my daughter. My baby daughter who is nearly 3, but from when she was around 1. Because it just wasn't creepy enough before now. The last picture was really the pièce de ré·sis·tance. It was an East Asian couple fucking with the man sucking on her breasts and her on top. I am not East Asian. Neither is he. Why the fuck out of all the porn in the universe did he pick that? And why pictures of my daughter and I before it? So. Many. Questions. Apparently this is what happens when you become slightly naive about the interwebs.

In conclusion, I opened up my facebook and some jackhole sent me pictures of myself and my daughter to seduce me, and then some East Asian porn \(note\- he was not East Asian and neither am I\). I cannot un\-see this shit or the weirdo implications. Feel free to cue the ""dueling banjo"" music from *Deliverance*

Update: While I was creating an imgur I noticed a spectacular thing.....He said one thing to me in all the messages he sent.  ""V. Nice""  I can't say it in my head without hearing Borat say it.  Then I looked carefully at the pictures of him and realized he looked a little bit like Borat.  Is it possible that this fictitious character has become real??",04Jun2018,1

I know my worth and that I won't have too much trouble finding someone who likes me. But I worry that he set the bar too high and that everyone else will seem unimpressive.

27,"In my junior year of high school, I met this guy who I low\-key fell for. Nothing ever really happened between us aside from a very brief kiss after I drove him home once. We messaged all the time throughout high school, even when he moved to a neighboring school in the middle of senior year. We never really got together, but he always strongly implied that he had very strong feelings for me. He called me pet names and would say things like how he should have kissed me when we last hung out or how nobody deserved me or blah blah blah. We had a weird sort of passionate relationship \(that never actually was\) in the way that we would be very strong in each emotion we felt \(AKA really strong feelings but also really bad fights sometimes\-\-which is why I never actually dated him\) . We didn't talk as much last year when I went to college in another state, but when we did talk, it was pretty much what I have already explained. He had led me to believe that he was in love with me and I will admit that I have never really gotten rid of all of my feelings for him. That kinda passion doesn't just die I guess?

So ANYWAY, flash forward to about a month ago when he suddenly messages me to tell me that he has decided to go off the grid and just follow where ""the sea takes him"". He says that I mean a lot to him and that he hopes he sees me again at some point. He then sends me \(this is no joke\) a book he has been working on that is just pages and pages of love poems. He sends a heart emoji alongside that and then disappears. What would YOU think if you got that message???

TODAY I decided to snapchat him and ask where he is, only to discover that I am blocked. I did some social media digging and found out that he has been dating this girl for almost a year and his life is not at all what he told me it was. He's still in the town I live in, even though he told me he was leaving and has since blocked me from his snapchat.

I'm not really sure how to feel right now. Not totally sure why I came to reddit to rant about it..but I'm just pretty confused and hurt and angry. He's definitely a part of the past and nothing ever actually happened between us so I'm not mad that he has been dating someone. I'm happy for him, if he's happy. I'm mad that he lied and kept me thinking that he had feelings for me that he clearly doesn't.

I think i really need help, advice or anything that can help me at this point.

I'm a regular dude, 5,9' , 132 pounds, pretty skinny and a little bit of belly fat.

I've been always hard on myself specially about how i look, however, it has always been my view and not others, i get girls and people look at me nicely and say that im handsome, however i have a problem with strong guys.

My girlfriend is pretty, she has a great body, she is fit and i cannot stop thinking about that she wants somebody stronger, fitter, or with more muscles than me. \(Which i know is not true because she is always saying that she likes how i look a lot, but my fucking mind is always torturing me\).

So, saturday night, we went out with her friends, we were having fun and everything, however there was a group of guys next to us, we were singing, they knew she was my girlfriend and started to look at me like, you know the look ""why is she with this guy? he is skinny"" and i instantly get pretiffeid, anxious, night is over for me.

So i start thinking that im not good enough,

that she wants something else,

that any guy who is in better shape than me is instantly more than me and can fuck her better or make here happier.

but not only that,

i also need to deal with my low self esteem \+ other guys looking at her \+ guys looking at me in a weird way.

So, are they jealous? or are they surprised because they see me as nothing?

Im obsess with muscles, im always saying that i need to start the gym but not in a natural way or because i want to improve my health but with anxiety because my mind is always telling me that even though im good, honest, funny and i make her happy, she will eventually leave me for someone ""better"".

My brain is always telling me that people only see what you look like and not the inside. I left instagram and facebook a while ago because i was getting frustrated. 

Also, i dont have an alpha mentality, i am sensitive so talking about this things, its like you are less of a man or something...

i dont know...hope you can help me

They’ve become my family, and the community is something greater than I could have ever imagined. But today was the last day all of us will ever be in the same place again, and that’s a weird feeling. 

I know I will keep connections with my closest friends, so I have that to look forward to. I’m also the first person in my immediate family to be going to college, and I have so much lying ahead for me in my future. Though it will never be the same, I can finally say I made it. ",04Jun2018,2

36,"I'm eating a bagel by myself after an all-nighter doing homework.

 Prom was two days ago and I went with my eighth-grade crush and it was pretty underwhelming tbh. But I'm still thinking about how shocked my middle school self would have been if I told her I'd be wearing ten pounds of makeup, a pretty dress (blue! like I'd always wanted) and sharing an ice cream with him even though we're not dating. 

I'm thinking about the blood, sweat, and tears I put in to my GPA and extracurriculars only to be rejected from 14 of the 15 colleges I applied to. The one college I'm going to isn't my favorite but I ended up winning a bunch of awards so I'm going on nearly full ride. I'm also graduating in a higher rank than the bullies that I'd compared myself to so much in middle school. Kind of bad, but I feel quite smug about it.

My (formerly?) emotionally abusive parents split up and my mom got a therapist. My relationship with her has never been better ever since and it's weirding me out. Also I got a dog and I love him to death. 

The two friends I thought I'd be with until forever have since left me for boyfriends and drugs respectively, but even though I miss them I'm actually okay and have come to accept that relationships and people change. 

There's still so much to worry about. My terrible grades, the week's worth of homework I'm supposed to be doing right now, the impending doom of still not knowing if my dream to be a doctor belongs to my parents or myself, my mother's unknown tumor, my month-long fight with my brother, the necessity to get both a job and a driver's license, and stuff...

I guess though, right now, even after all of the changes I've gone through and the crazy fact that I'm graduating in a place at school, family, and friends that I don't think anyone really expected to foresee, I am in one of the highs that life has given me and I really like my damn bagel and it's just nice. I have school in an hour though and then it'll go downhill form there. I see why people like mornings. It's really peaceful. Have a good day, everyone.

37,"I've been binge watching *13 Reasons* and yet again I'm struck by just how little that school resembles the high school I attended in terms of demographics and experience. It does, however, resemble a school that I'd unfortunately expect a shooting at (no school in particular, just looks the type because of drama). I was reading a child development textbook that described a *Mean Girls* level of clique control as normal, which, again blew my mind; I'd thought ""we wear purple on Tuesdays and jeans only on Fridays"" was something purely made up for entertainment.

So, on to this informal poll: 

On a scale of 1-5, how much did/does the high school you attended resemble a school out of film or television in terms of experience (1=not at all; 5=completely)? 

Which film or show?

What year did you graduate (can be a range of 5 years to protect anonymity)?

Where were you living (can be a general area to protect anonymity)?

Did you *ever* feel unsafe at your school, for *any* reason?

I have a fair few interests, these include:
Studying maps, flags, demographics, space and finance.

I only have a few hobbies, these include video gaming, photography and listening to music.
However, I can’t do photography as I barely leave the house and gaming and listening to music are really passive as all I do is sit still.

Also, for those wondering why I can’t leave the house, it’s because I live in a house that is really isolated away.
All my friends live in a town that is miles away from my house.
I only ever leave the house for school, and on Saturdays I go out with my family for the day and in Sundays I go out with my friends for the day.

So essentially, from Monday-Friday I have tens of hours free, but all I do during those hours are either A. Reading about my interests on my phone, B. Listening to music and watching music videos on my phone, or C. Playing video games.

40,"I’ll try to keep this short. 

I graduated 12th grade this year, and now I am looking into colleges/unis for higher education. I have two options in hand

1) Pick a college in my own country (India). The term starts in 3 weeks’ time, and I move to a different part of the country from where I live in, to attend college. They do have great placement opportunities, and is one of the better colleges in the country

2) Move to Australia, where I can stay in with my Uncle’s family (which takes away living expenses from the equation), pursue my Bachelors Degree there, and then work there/move to Germany for masters (I am still not decided about the Germany thingy)

Now,  my dilemma is that in Australia, the universities have a July intake, and a Jan intake. I am too late to apply for the July intake, so I’ll probably have to wait till January. And in here (India) , my admission is already secured. I just have to pack my stuff, and move to the hostel. 

I am confused whetherI should take a risk, cancel my admission in the college in India, and move to Aus, or should I stay here.

41,"The following is a bunch of symbols I wroted about what the meaning of life is to me.  
  
I don't know if God exists or not or why I'm alive. I just am. And there's really no point in asking because I'll never get an answer. And even if I knew God existed it wouldn't explain why even he exists. He just would. I am that I am and there is no way to comprehend why.  
  
Why things are the way they are and not another way is too hard to comprehend. Maybe there are many alternate realities each with their own rules? And what if we are in a simulation? Can you really tell the difference between the real world and the virtual one? It's pointless to question the nature of reality because what reality is in your mind is the only reality you know and interact with.  
  
So what is reality to me? What are my motivations and conclusions? How should I relate to pleasure and pain, living and death, awake and sleeping, full and empty, sex, male and female, survival, fighting, fleeing, freezing, killing and helping, morality, love and hate, good and evil, right and wrong, justice and mercy, punishment and rehabilitation, law and freedom, free will and determinism, internal and external, me and you... (Why does life have so many dichotomies? What's so special about the number 2?)  
  
Maybe if reality is fake and when we die in this world we wake up and there was nothing to worry about? I'm not scared of dying. How can I be afraid of the unknown if I don't know. But I am scared. Life is full of pain. I know pain is there to protect us but it's also here to punish us. But why are we being punished? What did we do wrong to deserve suffering? I never asked to be born, I just am. But now that I am alive I have this motivation to figure out what my motivations are and if there's even any point in living or if I should just kill myself?  
  
I know I almost did kill myself. This loneliness in my heart consumed me. Yearning for my companion. It felt like my self worth was denied by my inability to satisfy my partner and keep her by my side. So I guess I had to ask if I was worthy. I know I have flaws but everyone has flaws. You won't find a perfect person. But darling you're perfect. I just hate falling up those Penrose steps.  
  
I don't know if I could prove evolution, but its assumptions and consequences(?) hold true to me. The weak die and the strong survive. Natural selection. But I guess you have to ask what is weakness and what is strength? The worldly view of weakness is being small, fragile, not powerful. But that is a simple man's idea of weakness. Evolution definitely favours some degree of simple strength but there are other kinds of strength… have you ever studied your own body and thought how it works? We are the pinnacle of evolution, and for a good reason. Each part of our body works together. Unity, strength in numbers - if we all work together we have the ability to become much stronger than we are alone. And with the way the body works, sometimes if one part of the body dies the whole body dies. Heavily integrated systems can be strong but that also makes them vulnerable. If you can identify the weakness of an entity and attack it then you can bring the whole entity down. So I guess we have to protect our weaknesses don't we?   
  
I think Goku was onto something. If the weak die and the strong survive then isn't the point of life to get stronger? To improve yourself, to grow, to learn, to train, to surpass your limits... Or at least to live your life in order to lead the way to something that will become stronger than what there was before. We aren't getting dumber like some people are saying. Each new generation will surpass their predecessors. But what exactly are we headed to? What does the future hold for us years from now? Does it end here or are there really no limits in life? Is ""artificial"" intelligence the entity that will surpass us?  
  
What even is love? Attraction? Sex is a natural, strong urge. To reproduce is to survive. So is it really wrong to have lots of sex, even with multiple partners? Monogamy vs polygamy. I've tried polygamy before and I felt jealous but maybe I need to learn to be humble and accept the fact that I am not perfect and that there will always be someone better than me that is better suited to be with the one I love? There are so many fish in the sea. Why do I have to stop at just catching one fish? I want to prove my worth to the world and pass on my heritage. Survival isn't just about improving my own strength but to also lead the way to the surpassing generations. I understand that I also have to think logistically. I can't reproduce with just anyone, and each life I create I have to support. I have to consider what may or may not happen in the future. Weigh the pros and cons. Choose what's best with what I've got.  
  
Reality is what our minds make of it. We live in a deterministic world. Sometimes you can't help the way things are. You cannot control your fate. You are simply a robot doing what you were always meant to do. You may think you have free will but it's just an illusion. You are predictable and programmable. I predict some of you may be angry and disagree with me for saying that, but do you really need any proof? What even is choice? If free will really existed then our choices would be random. But if everyone made random choices then there would be chaos. Structure and order and rules describe the nature of reality and thus we must live in a deterministic world. Science, predictability, reproducability, observation are the only tools we have to assess reality with. You cannot use your emotions. We need to be objective. It's the only way to understand the external world and remove the feeling of confusion and purposelessness.  
  
Since the world is deterministic then justice is also an illusion. There is no such thing as moral responsibility. You cannot judge people for what they do because they are only doing what they were destined/programmed to do. But this doesn't mean we should let people do what they want. The internal and external world interact in inextricable ways. We react to it as it also reacts to us. Everything affects everything. When someone hurts us we might fight or we might flee. It's only natural to avoid that negative feeling, pain. Again, we are destined to survive. The pain protects us, it always protects us. But unfortunately this survival mechanism can be used against us. It really does more harm than good.  
  
I'll liken it to being in pain, like you are going to die. That terrible feeling. There is no reasoning with someone when they are feeling that terrible feeling. You can't have small talk with them because they are consumed by their torments. You can do nothing to help someone who is ""dying"". They just have to go through it themselves and afterwards, if the pain goes away, they will be of a sounder mind. But now that they have a sound mind, there is no concern for worry. But still, the one experiencing the pain will have to reconcile whether they want to keep living, despite the fact that they will keep suffering many more times. Whether one wants to keep living, there is nothing you can do to convince someone sometimes. They just aren't able to listen.

42,"A few months ago, I went through a number of events which led me to finally confront some of my demons, and consequently to seek professional therapy. 

I won’t dwell on the details of the personal issues I’m faced with, but seeking therapy was important as I vowed to get better. A few weeks ago, after admittedly not doing as much research as I should have, I went for my first session. 

Most of the first session was spent discussing what it is specifically I wanted help with and the reason I was there. However that has pretty much been the case for the subsequent two sessions as well. It feels as if 90% of the session is me talking about what happened and how I feel about it, however at present I feel there is very little practical advice I’m receiving in order to get better.

I understand that this might be the course that needs to take place, and perhaps that the first few or several sessions might be spent digging into the root of the issues before the healing and recovery can begin. I mentioned this to my therapist at the conclusion of the second session, to which their response was similar in that it will initially be largely self reflective and filled with further exploration. 

I wanted to know if this is the usual approach - as mentioned before I have vowed to get better, however I don’t want to end up wasting large amounts of money to no avail, especially since these sessions are severely mentally (and surprisingly physically) draining and are often followed with a day or two of renewed anxiety and feeling low.

I wanted to know if I’m overthinking/expecting too much too quick, or whether I should trust the process and stick with this particular therapist? Should I try out different therapists before settling on one?

I’d appreciate any help - thank you. ",04Jun2018,11

I found a really good picture of his product on a website that sells photos for business use. I showed the picture to my customer and said ""Hey what do you think about this?"" My customer said ""Man thats looks really great, can we put that on my ad?"" I said ""You know we have to buy this photo, but because your an awesome customer I'm going go ahead and buy this photo for you and put it on your advertisement""

Customer was happy. Customer agreed to it, what not.

I submit the picture to my art department, art department asks ""Do you have permission to use this?"" I send over the licensed I purchased which clearly stated I'm allowed to print this on 500,000 pieces and distribute for personal OR business purposes.

48,"Throughout my adult life (which admittedly hasn’t been long, but still), I have found myself completely mentally (and physically soon following) exhausted of the main things I’m doing with my life. During college, I really needed a break. I felt overworked and fried, and I was constantly exhausted in every sense and wanted nothing more than a year off (didn’t allow myself that).

With the regular full time jobs I’ve had, I find myself always exhausted. I’ll start a position, and be into it for the first while, but then I feel the same: like I need at *least* 3 months off to actually rest and collect myself. Going to work every day feels like abuse (which no other  people also feel, apparently) and I’m so so tired and feeling overworked. 

In college, I never took a huge course load during any semester. It was always just the average amount. 

Now that I’m working in the real world, I have never had more than a 35-40 hour workweek, they’re all desk jobs, and I have had good benefits and pretty decent pay considering the current job market. 

I’m happy, I think. I’m just on the brink of breaking into mid-level in my career rather than entry-level. I like the work I do.

I don’t get why I always feel this way no matter what. I’m always addressing and working on mental health stuff. I’ve lost the majority of the weight I gained senior year of college. I just moved into a dope apartment in the city of my dreams, and I got a job right on par with what I do. But yet here I am, needing more and more sleep no matter how much I sleep. I feel sluggish and dragging and angsty. I don’t feel I have any right to feel this way but I do. Wtf. Damn. It’s exhausting and I’m so sick of it.

Some time ago I come across this girl on Tinder, she works at my place (as do 300 other people in that building). I remember her because she's on the opposite wing of the building, so I saw her sometimes from the window. Anyway, its not a match. Yes, I liked.

56,"Born into a household, disfigured in face and hair, raised by a manipulative narcissist of a dad and a stubborn yet dying mother. I remember all the beatings, I remember all the times he would yell at me, I remember the way he would look at me after all of them. Of disgust, of contempt. I remember the day I became the way I am: paranoid, shy, and mentally unstable. He beat me because I covered my ears, I tried to protect myself and he got mad at me for it. Paranoid was always in the younger me, because of it, I didn't have friends and I didn't my days playing video games. 

Time passed and people were nice to me because I was smart and kind in middle school, but none were interested in me because of what I looked like. I thought I had friends but they used me for my stuff, so I stopped them from coming over. They moved on. 

High school came and it was the best years of my life. I had friends though they soon left me, I saw funny things everyday, I did well in school. I joked even. One always stood out though: a girl named Rain. We never shared classes but we met only at ceremonies. Very sweet and bursting with positive energy, quiet when she had to, but around me, she could get very loud, and I loved it. Her eye contact and the way she treated me was unlike any girl had ever treated me: she looked at me with unbiased eyes, and I remember years ago she said I looked cute in my driver's license. Sonething my parents haven't ever told me. I will never forget that, and no amount of gaslighting or manipulation will change what I heard that day. Because I had never heard those words come out of a girl's mouth before.

We graduated and I said goodbye to her. I saw her once that summer but after that, I thought I would never see her again. I hadn't confessed that I liked her, and I honestly that somewhere in my heart, she felt the same way. I missed her because I honestly thought I wouldn't find anyone like her.

And I was right.

The inclusiveness at my college turned out to be a major stretch of the truth. The eyes of my dad were in everyone I passed on campus: of disgust, of ""WTF?"", of ""Ew, get the fuck away from me"". My roommate was polite to me but I was excluded just like I had thought. Everyone I met through my roommate was polite to me but they wanted nothing to do with me. No one wanted me around, and I could tell. No one talked ne unless I started a conversation, no one asked me to go to parties with them, no one even texted me or just wanted to check up on me. The thing that broke me and put me in a dark depression was when I went to a club to just have fun, and when the president did attendance and when he called my name, he just looked up at me and his face went from content to disgust. Just like what my father did.

I cried, I began to self-harm, and I began to idiolze suicide. No one even cared, and it only brought me further down into the rabbit hole. I wanted to die and I had dreams of murdering myself. The only dreams I had that actually brought me joy was the fantasies I had with the one person I had positive memories with: Rain. Cuddling, and hearing her voice. Her kissing me, and telling me that she missed me. Us going to museums, us holding hands, us just hugging. I missed her. 

When that summer hit, I did everything in my power to find her number: phone books, Facebook, and nothing came up. Then one day, I literally bumped into her brother. I asked him for her number and he gave it to me. I texted her and what started was a year of texting each other. I didn't want to come off as clingy so I texted her every three days, and the conversations we had made me happy. 

But I ruined everything, absolutely every chance I had with her. Within the first month of texting her, I told her that I liked her. And she didn't say much to it. We kept talking like it didn't happen but it did happen. My dad came back into my life around this time and made me my life the hell it used to be. My depression went from dark to absymal in a few days, and I opened up to her about my depression. She was supportive and helpful but I told her more than I should have. A month passed and I asked her about why she rejected me. I told her I was over it because I was now ashamed of the feelings I had for her though they were the only feelings I had to begin with for anyone. She told it wasn't me but she didn't feel that way for anyone. She said it wasn't me but she's never been interested in anyone ever. 

I was heartbroken, I begged God that this must be a joke, that what I heard didn't actually just happen. I remember screaming in a pillow, I remember crying to that pillow, I remember whispering blasphemy into that pillow. I remember yelling, ""Can I just win once?!"" In my life, I've been beaten, used, told I was ugly by countless people, ridiculed and started in disgusted at, I go to a place for 10 months only to spend my days in isolation, I don't have any friends there and probably won't, I've been molested by a school official when I was young, I've been bullied (school, day camp, even church). The rejection took a major toll on me just because I thought for the first time, I would be happy, that finally the dreams I dreamt at night would finally become a reality, that God actually heard my prayers at night and my pleas. But nope, that day convinced me God doesn't love me nor does He think of me.

But I didn't want to give up. Because I didn't want to let a deity to rob of the one thing that made me happy in this pathetic life of mine. I didn't care if she was asexual, I didn't care if she rejected me, I wanted her because I know no woman on this planet ws going to give me the same treatment as her. So I kept talking to her and we grew more and more closer. She became open with me, about her life and her personal ordeals. She was ridiculed at times for being very bad at sports and gym class. She has insecurities just like me. She has a very troubling family life and the turmoil is bad though I don't know if it exceeds my own.

Like I said I texted her for a year, and one day, we hang out with her friends. I knew all of them from high school and all of them were in that friend group. Seeing her made me beyond happy: we laughed and chatted, and she was always smiling at me like I was a trophy. Something she was proud of. Like I was someone worthy of being her friend. That feeling almsot brought tears to my eyes, because I felt like I was finally feeling the love I lacked in life. She told the group all about the funny things we talked about, and when we were eating, I caught her staring at me. After it was all said and done, she hugged the friends and I drove her home. The sunset was beautiful and knowing that I had the most beautiful and caring girl in the world at my side felt amazing. I dropped her off and I ask for a hug, and the way she hugged me almost actual made me break down. Though it was a side hug, it was more of a cuddle. She fell into my torso like she was going to sleep there, on me. For the first time in my life, I felt like I had a beautiful girlfriend, someone who loves me and cares for me more than anything in this world. It was only for a few seconds but it felt amazing. 

To this day, Rain and I are good friends and after the last conversation I had with her, I know she cares about me and that she cares about if I'm okay or if my feelings were hurt. Funny enough, I still haven't been able to hang out with her one-on-one because she's out of town. I'm still waiting for when we can hang out and binge a series, or what I was hoping for was going to a museum together. I want to keep it slow but I want to see if she's comfortable with certain things (trying to hold her hand). I want to show that I can be that guy for her and after taking with the folks at r/asexuality, they say she's trying to figure herself out. She's hinted at preferring men so I just need to be cool and make her feel comfortable. 

I want this bad. Because I know no one else will for me.

57," Sorry for the long post in advance. I tried posting this on r/fitness but it got removed because I guess it has nothing to do with fitness?

It's gotten to the point where I almost felt like crying in between sets during  Bench Press because I just wanted to go home and do nothing instead.

Background:  I graduated highschool weighing 110lbs, weak as can be. I proceeded to  do a 2 year Diploma in Kinesiology, during this I worked out very  seriously, 3 full body workouts a week at 6am for 2 years. I went from  110lbs to 150lbs. 

After  I graduated, I became a Personal Trainer and Group Exercise Instructor  and worked in the industry for 3 years. During this time, I essentially  maintained my weight and would work out twice a week, full body  workouts. Mainly because working in a gym made me want to be in a gym  not as much.

Working  in the industry started my first burn out. Even though I had made so  much progress from where I started, I was still relatively small. People  would make comments, or judge me because of my size assuming I knew  nothing. I had people come up and try to give contradicting advice to my  clients while I worked with them. I got so sick of the shallowness of  the industry, I left it.

Since  leaving it I can only mentally handle going to the gym twice a week,  doing full body workouts. Anymore is just too much for me to handle it  mentally.

It’s  been a year and a bit since I’ve been out of the industry and it’s at  the point where I can’t even bring myself to push myself to workout  anymore. I don’t have the energy to do strength and power training,  which is what I love doing and which is what I need to do for the sport I  play. But I’m too lazy now to do high rep/endurance based workouts.

I’ve  tried taking breaks, multiple times. In the past three months I’ve  taken a two week break, and two one week breaks to try to remedy my  complete lack of motivation to go to the gym. But then after, I start  panicking about how I’m going to lose my progress so I eventually go  back to the gym.

I’ve  tried at home workouts, and I can’t find the motivation to do anything  at home, I need to be outside the house to workout. I can’t focus enough  to even run outside.

I’m  just really worried now because I can’t just not workout. Mainly  because I noticed how much differently people treated me before I worked  out vs after I worked out.

My current workout consists of:

Cleans,  Push Presses, Squat, Deadlifts, Bench, some arm stuff and core. Each  thing is 3 sets of 3\-5 reps for the big lifts and 8 reps for smaller  lifts. Since I only workout twice a week I worry too much about cutting  this down because I feel like I wouldn’t be hitting each body part  enough and I’ll lose progress.

I  just don’t know what to do anymore, I’m at a complete loss. I despise  being in the gym, but it’s the only thing that makes me feel good and  satisfied when I’m done. 

I’m  so burnt out by gym culture and everything about the gym. Working out  for 5 years and I’ve never had a gym friend, and the times I’ve had  worked out with people they get upset with me because I don’t go 100&amp;#37;  every time I’m there. I spent all of college going 100&amp;#37;, I’ve done my  work, now I just want to casually work out to maintain.

I stated in my previous post that I was going to update it if I needed to and sadly I do.

It came to that dreadful moment that everything came to an end, the part where the relationship is over. Now let me say something because no matter how long you have been in a relationship, that person can still mean the absolute world to you, regardless if you have been together for a month or even ten years; it is all depending on how much emotion you have for the other person and how connected you are together. This was not just a short relationship, it was more to me than that. This was a big turning point for me in my life, this was the first person who I had let in for a very long time, the first person I pushed everything aside for and tried my absolute hardest to make work with. Since I posted my original post I have done some stupid things, things that I am not going to mention here but please for the love of god, if you are struggling with anything similar or even a problem that makes you feel the same, do not suffer alone. Speak to someone you know, somebody who is there to listen; fuck sakes even message me if you want to. I don't know you and I'm not here to judge. Do not suffer in silence. I would not like anyone to go through and feel how I feel or do the things I have done.

I probably won't post anymore on this account, I will go back to my actual account; but I will still receive notifications for this account, so if anyone wants to chat; feel free to send me a message and I will be all ears.",04Jun2018,2

61,"I could tell after trying to understand your intentions that you just used me. Today I left you a note at work:

“You have no idea how worthless you made me feel. I’m over it now. Thank you for the lessons”

I spoke up for myself, which is really hard for me to do sometimes, especially if I’m falling in love with someone who doesn’t really care about me. I fall so hard, it’s just the way that I’m programmed. Today I was strong. It hurt like hell, but I’m too old for games. Too old for this shit. You either want me or not, if not, don’t waste my fucking time. ",04Jun2018,1
63,"I’m 16 years old (F) 
The past 3 months I have been finding myself becoming extremely angry over the smallest of things. I know that ways to cope with anger is to think positively or to go seek therapy. I have gone to therapy before a year ago but it didn’t help me at all and I ended up canceling the sessions after the 2nd one. And thinking positively just doesn’t work for me because my anger completely overpowers my sense of logical thinking and I start spouting out things that I don’t mean and eventually end up regretting later. I know that I’m the only one in control of the way I act and feel but for some reason I just get out of control. It is so hard for me to keep my cool and I don’t know what is triggering it.. 

I don’t know why I’m so angry all of the time and I don’t know how to cope with it. I haven’t been getting along with my parents the past month and they constantly ask me why I’m so angry all of the time and what is causing me to be full of so much hate, which I’m also wondering too! I don’t know why I constantly overreact, is it a hormonal thing? Is it because my period is supposed to be coming soon? Even though that could be the reason it’s no excuse and doesn’t justify the fact that I’ve been so out of control lately. 

My mom constantly asks me what’s making me become this way and that I’m only getting worse. I honestly don’t know what I’m trying to accomplish by posting this here and I don’t even think I’ll get a response back but if anyone could give some insight or opinion any feedback would be a great help!!! I appreciate it ",04Jun2018,3
64,"There are days when I feel somewhat confident. I look in the mirror and I tell myself that I look pretty today or I go outside to hang out with my bestfriend without feeling bad about it, I just enjoy my time those days and I couldn’t ask for more. 
Other days though I feel anxious, I’m afraid to even go to the grocery store to buy a pack of gum. It seems to me that everyone who looks at me while walking down the street judges me, thinks bad of me, not to mention that I hate when I have to walk by a group of boys who might make bad jokes about every girl they see. When I’m at home, I start to hear strange noises because of my anxiety level and I get paranoid, that I hardly get any sleep at night. 

I don’t know why I have to wake up in the morning trying to guess whether today it’s a good day for my mind or not, regardless of what happens throughout the day. This seems to be just a lottery for me and it’s incredibly frustrating and tiring. ",04Jun2018,10
65,"i don’t know if it’s my depression creeping up on me again but i just don’t feel like emoting at all recently. even at work, a place where i’m normally extremely friendly, i’m having a hard time holding conversations. people are starting to notice. i don’t know if i’m looking for advice i guess i’m just annoyed with my chemically unbalanced brain at the moment.

66,"At my girlfriend when she doesn’t clean up after herself, at my dog when she shits on the floor, at my in-laws for being stupid imposing pains in my ass, all of it. I’m just in a permanent state of furious anger or defeated melancholy. If I’m mad enough I’ll sit there and pick and pick and pick until I realize that I fucking hate whatever it is that I’m fixated on even if it’s something that I otherwise love. I have no reason to be this way aside from a fundamental flaw in my programming that inhibits me from chilling the fuck out. My girlfriend takes great care of me, my dog is 13 weeks old so I can’t expect much from her, my in-laws are imposing but they’re simple and there’s an education divide which makes it hard for me to take what they say seriously, which isn’t their fault and makes me feel like an arrogant asshole. 

Nothing makes it better but getting high and that feels like it’s affixed itself as a real nice crutch that I need to get through my day without beating the daylights out of a passerby for no reason aside from the fact that I’m a flawed human being who shouldn’t be around socialized, civilized people.

I have issues but I have no idea how to fix them. My anger scares me, and scares the people around me. It makes me want to go somewhere by myself but I know that is the least healthy thing for me. 

P.S. No, a stress ball will not work. I will destroy the stress ball. ",04Jun2018,1
67,"Hey everyone. So, every once in a while I'll get the random urge to spill my guts to internet strangers. I've made a couple posts like this in the past, and deleted them swiftly. I end up feeling silly about the whole thing and weirdly self conscious. I don't know.

The reason I'm writing today is because I've been feeling very overwhelmed for a very long time. I'll try to be brief with my life story but there's a lot to explain. I was gonna be sparse with any identifying details but fuck it. I don't really care anymore. 

I had a really nice young childhood, a supportive family and normal school life. My dad was kinda distant and when I was around 12 years old he went to the police and confessed to a crime he had committed many years ago. He repeatedly^(?) molested my then nineish year old cousin, my mum's niece. She was much older when he confessed and she didn't press any charges. (Details on this are really fuzzy/repressed) He spent several years in prison, with my mother sister and I making almost bi-weekly trips about two hours out of the city to visit him. Years went by and the case progressed and my mother couldn't look at him the same way after some of the things she heard. So they unofficially split and my mum got a boyfriend... her late sister's common law husband. Who enabled said sister to drink herself to death. ^(At least that's how it looked from the outside.) So he moves in (with his son, my cousin) as mum's boyfriend and my sister hates it. She was 16 at the time and was legally able to move away from her guardian, so she moves to a town 45 minutes away with rich family friends. Mum starts drinking again when I'm around 14 and our relationship degraded. We fought a lot during those times, she said a lot of horrible things to me, and me to her. Eventually dad got out. There was parole and all that but my mum and him arranged for him to buy here out of the mortgage so he could live there. She moved into her boyfriend's condo. And they're actually legally divorced now. My sister moved back home too. It all worked out for them. 

In the middle of all this when I was in high school, my attendance slowly but surely went to shit. In ninth grade when things were relatively stable I was easily getting 80's and 90's. Steadily decreased and I eventually dropped out. I blame it on the depression but there was a lot of anxiety and I didn't feel I had support at all. I got a job when I turned 16 and kept that, though. It wasn't until around I had turned 18 (late 2016) that I really really stopped caring about myself. I had stopped self harming but let myself go in other ways. Was with this guy who encouraged my awful behavior, lots and lots of drinking, and even encouraged me to do blow. I stopped showing up to work. Didn't even tell them I quit or anything. Started staying over at his (parents') place a lot and partying with him and his friends. Our relationship degraded. Things ended abruptly on new year's 2017 when I went to one of his friend's house for to a party and got too fucked up and sexually assaulted. It was incredibly traumatic and I'm still not sure I've worked though it all.

I used to have a child psychiatrist until slightly after I turned 18. She was amazing and helped me so much. The guy she referred me to, not so much. He had such a thick accent I had to strain so hard to understand him and he just sat across from me at his desk scribbling in his notepad the entire time like I'm some kind of fucking science experiment. I asked them to refer me to another doctor several moths ago and still haven't heard anything. I used to have a counselor that I fell out of touch with because she thought I was doing really well. Guess I backslid. (I've been trying these past couple weeks to get a new one but I can't seem to get the coordinator to call me back, I've left several voicemails.)

After new year's I obviously stayed home a lot more, like 99% of the time. My dad must have gotten sick of me or something. He started charging me rent. I was enrolled in classes trying to get some credits at the time and he talked to me so much that he had no fucking clue. So I made getting a job a priority over school because he was so serious, and I thought he knew and was just being a dick. But he didn't even know. He took my employment insurance money from the government before I was able to get a job. Which I got at fucking Wal-Mart because that was the only place hiring in this damn city and I had relevant pharmacy work experience. I paid his piddly $200 per month to shut him up but then he wanted $300 and then he decided I was too depressed I guess because he wrote me an eviction notice. Saying stuff like, doing what's right is never easy, that it's not right I spend *ALL* my off time drinking alone in my room. I will totally admit to doing that a few times, I was newly nineteen and pretty depressed living with a fucking child molester. I think I had every right to do what I wanted, not like I fucking wrecked the place I kept to myself as usual. I hated every moment being in that house being forced to face what he had done to our family. So I let him kick me out. 

I had been seeing this old coworker from my first job, and he was friends with an elementary school friend. Things were pretty steady between us but I don't think he expected me to ask to-no, *need to* move in with him so quick. But he took me in, he had a roommate in an apartment but we made it work. And we moved into our own basement suite in April, things have been amazing. I can honestly say he's probably the only reason I'm still alive.

So here we are. I'm stuck in a dead end low paying job I fucking hate. I was promised growth when the opportunity arises but I've worked there for over a year and don't know how much longer I can take it. I was promised a raise in December, which was supposed to actually go through in the middle of April, was promised it (and backpay) would be on my paycheque last Friday and it was not. Left today without resolution.

Don't even get me started on the shifts I work. I honestly believe that is the most detrimental thing to me right now, I can't get into a solid daily routine at all. Ever. I work anywhere from 7am-11pm, full time hours. Some weekends too because fuck my social life right?

But yeah. Shit job, no diploma. I really want to go back to school in the fall but I have no idea how I'm going to make any of this work. My anxiety is creeping back up on me and I'm lashing out on my boyfriend. It's so completely unfair to him he's been nothing but supportive to me I don't know why I can't control it anymore. I'm so scared I'll hurt him, and our relationship, I've already strained it so much. I'm always so fucking broke, I had to borrow $200 from my boyfriend just to pay all my bills this week.

I just don't know what to do. I need a better way to live, I'm so sick of this unfulfilling job. I want to write more and enjoy the time I have. I'm so sick of being stuck.",04Jun2018,7

69,"Here’s a little bit of context:
We’re both in our early teen years, and I moved away about a year ago so I can’t help her in person. To my knowledge, she has only told close friends about her depression. She talks to me about it a lot and I try to help but I feel like I can do better. She’s bisexual, and I knew that for a while. She told this guy she thought she could trust and he told a bunch of people, which is really fucked up. She gets treated like a slut and is going through a lot. I’m scared something is going to happen to her.

I don’t know if this is a good place to post this but I just need to know how I can help her. Thank you.",04Jun2018,1
