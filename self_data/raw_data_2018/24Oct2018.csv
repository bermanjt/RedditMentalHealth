I was diagnosed with late stage Lyme disease 2 weeks ago, but have had degenerative symptoms for over 2 years.

Right now, I can’t go outside of the house without sunglasses on a cloudy day. My joints ache and I constantly feel like I’m fighting to stay awake when I can never really nap. Sleeping doesn’t refresh me, and it’s really hard to follow a conversation for more than 10 seconds.

It feels like there’s someone still in here, a soul that is fighting against the machine that harbors it, who’s battery life is running low and who’s parts are starting to malfunction. 

Talking to people living normal lives makes you feel like a ghost. Nobody is really listening. Nobody really sees you for who you are because you don’t really exist. Most of what you once were has become about you battling illness, and now you’re just a shell of a person waiting to become whole again. You’re not quite close to living, but you’re definitely not dead. It becomes an in-between, a wait for a revival or to finally be put to rest. And it’s incredibly isolating. 

When you’re chronically ill eventually the though of death becomes an escape, and you think “I could slip away so peacefully, it would be just like falling asleep for a very long time.” Death occasionally feels like it would bring relief. Not much different from the world you’re in now - colorless, just with far less suffering and effort. Because when you’re ill, staying alive is one of the hardest things to do, and dying feels like it might just be easier. But then you realize that you’ve been around for so long, existing day to day because you’re too afraid to die.

I have isolated myself from friends and family not because I don’t care about them, but because I can’t even remember to take a shower, let alone text them back. And when I do reach out, I don’t want to tell them about my day because all I did was linger in a resentful state about my disease and struggle to get anything productive done. 

I want to talk to someone that won’t tell me to just “try harder”, but here I am, with few options because the wait for therapy is too long and a sooner session is too expensive.

I’ve decided to remain alive though. Primarily because I’m far too afraid to take my own life, and also, because the memories of how vibrant I used to be fuel me to do whatever I can to go back there. To when things were normal. Hope is humanity’s best survival instinct. 

Have a good day people. I hope you get lots of things done and have a nice dinner with your family or friends.

2,"First: 

When I was 17 I spent a summer in Yellowstone NP as a housekeeper. A friend I had met there and I were discussing life “back home,” and he shared with me the hectic and violent culture he'd grown up in. After a few other stories, he told me of an uncle who shot a man with a crossbow for a reason which I cannot specifically remember at this time, but it was something akin to trespassing. 

I had not meant to be patronizing or rude, but I said, “Wow, we don't really have people like that where I'm from...” (My hometown is a fairly conservative “destination town” in the Pacific Northwest populated mainly by the elderly and athletes.)

He replied, “What do you mean 'people like that?'”

I instantly saw the ignorance in my words and felt ashamed. At the time, I didn't know how to admit that my world view was *highly* skewed and that what I'd said was wrong. So I tried “covering” for it with a joke.

For years I didn't stop feeling the shame well up from the pit of my stomach whenever I looked back at that moment. How could I have been such an insensitive fool? But finally, it became a lesson—as all things can.

At least I could *see* the error of my ways, and I allowed my shame to turn my heart inside out, to be vulnerable and really see those who are different from me without making judgments. I know I still have a lot of progress to make in practice, but I do my best to meet people where they are at and just love them to the best of my ability. People “like that” are just people like me, and I am grateful for each person I meet—another piece of the great creation that I am honored to experience.

I still wish I had had the courage to face my shame then and there, but I am happy that I can now see that moment for all of the beauty it holds, and give thanks for a friend so great as to offer me a true reflection of myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second:

When I was 19 I worked at a frozen yogurt shop, and one day two men came in who appeared to me to be father and son. They purchased their cups of yogurt and sat down to eat.

One other customer was in the store when they had finished and got two of our largest cups (buckets, essentially) and started filling them to go. Preoccupied with the other customer, I hadn't really noticed what they were doing. 

They came up to the register to pay while the other customer was getting toppings, and one bucket was placed on the scale. I ran the card and just as I was handing it back to the younger man, I noticed the other was holding a second bucket.

I said, “Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see that one,” and waited for him to place it up on the scale next. 

Instead he repeated, “It's okay, it's okay,” smiling and lifting the bucket slightly in one of those “I got this” gestures, and they started to walk away. 

I was too shocked to do anything. I felt like I had done something wrong that warranted his reassurance that it was okay, I hadn't offended them too badly. As I was trying to decipher what exactly he was excusing me for, I didn't call after him, “Sir, you need to pay for that,” or even ask him to wait, to come back. I even looked to the son, I guess to plead for his intervention, but away they walked. I was utterly stunned and felt the heat rise in my face from the shame before I turned to the next customer to ring her out. I think she tipped me a little bit more out of pity.

I have yet to make peace with this experience in shame, to find the lesson within... I still believe that I should be ashamed... it was cowardly and weak to just stand there and do nothing. 

I know that I should have stood up for myself, and for my boss who trusted me to properly run his store. And I even felt like I had let woman-kind down in not standing up to this selfish and arrogant man. I even wondered if the other customer in the store had instead been a man, would he have said anything? The woman had pretended, just as I had, that nothing unusual had just happened, but it is beyond a customer's responsibility to step in. I wonder, too, how she felt after having witnessed this?

I wonder what it is about this experience, and about myself, that I am denying. Why does thinking of this still bring me to shame? Why cannot I not provide myself with the compassion of forgiveness?

Almost immediately, the loud music started. We tried to put up with it for a while, then talked to them, then talked to the landlord, and eventually called bi-law enforcement for our city, every time it stops for a random length of time, then starts back up again. So we just keep calling, they keep getting written tickets for excessive noise, but these idiots keep going with the loud music.

The newest problem, has to do with parking. The driveway is split in half between the two units, plenty of space for two cars on each side in length. Well their daughter's boyfriend recently moved in, and they now have two cars. Except my neighbour doesn't want to have the cars parked properly, he wants the two sedans (Small cars, admittedly, but the driveway isn't very wide.) parked side by side at the top of the driveway, right next to my car. They take up more than half of the width of the driveway, to the point that I can barely open the door to my car to get in. 

I've tried to avoid confrontation with this guy for the most part this whole time, but with winter coming, there's going to be snowbanks on either side of the driveway, making it more narrow, so I'm going to start parking my car farther over, almost at the halfway point of the driveway, giving him no room to park two cars side by side anymore.

19,"In spite of so many lies, it's necessary to tell the truth about the revolution of 7 November 1917. It was the greatest victory in history for the working class, poor and oppressed strata, showing the way to end capitalist man-eat-man society.

In 1914, the German rich and Russian rich started World War I, where they told German poor and Russian poor to kill each other only for the profit of the rich.

The ""socialist"" parties around the world, which were very large and established as the working-class party, that up to then had claimed to be revolutionary and anti-capitalist, then faced a split. The traitors supported the war, whereas the true revolutionaries renamed themselves ""communists"".

The German ""socialist"" traitors supported the war, whereas the Russian Bolsheviks opposed the war.

In Russia there was a division, between the ""Mensheviks"", i.e. fake socialists, and Bolsheviks, the true communists who were actually serious.

At the start of 1917 the working class of Russia was not aware of who was who, so 90% of the working class supported the Mensheviks and 10% supported the Bolsheviks. Support for other parties among the working class was minimal.

The heroic working class and oppressed strata, hoping for an end to the war and peace with the German poor, gloriously defeated the Tsarist tyranny on March 1917, and put a ""Provisional Government"" which the Mensheviks supported in power.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the Provisional Government continued the war and only aimed to manage capitalism, this time as a so-called ""democracy"" instead of the monarchist system. And thus the Mensheviks were exposed as supporting mass-murdering capitalism.

Over the next month, the Russian working class reversed their position. 90% came to support the Bolsheviks, and 10% the Mensheviks.

The fact is that the working class had organized themselves in councils, where they debated and voted on things. These councils emerged as a governmental power after the March revolution, but the Provisional Government had power side-by-side. The Bolsheviks argued that the working class should be the only power, and overthrow the Provisional Government capitalist power.

&amp;#x200B;

On 7 November 1917, the working class gloriously seized power away from the Provisional Government, and gave ALL power to the councils, and elected the Bolshevik party to be the leading party.

The Bolsheviks implemented what they had been promoting: a dictatorship of the working class where only the working class ruled and the rich were restrained. Democracy was to be allowed, but only for the working class -- the capitalist parties and power structures were not to be allowed.

The Bolsheviks put an end to mass-murdering World War I and made peace with Germany. They used the rich's houses to feed the poor.

&amp;#x200B;

Only 10 people died in the Russian Revolution. At first, the Bolsheviks had intended to allow maximal free speech and political rights, and were intended in a governing coalition with some other parties.

However, the other parties -- which still had minimal support among the working class -- turned to be pro-capitalist traitors, ready to murder to restore the capitalist power.

It was necessary for the Bolsheviks to repress these parties, and censor their rights of speech, while still maintaining the working-class free speech.

Yet the rich launched a ""Russian Civil War"" to take back power, and killed millions. Thankfully, they were unsuccessful.

&amp;#x200B;

So what ended up happening?

&amp;#x200B;

While the Bolsheviks cared for the poor as much as they could, it was not possible to build communism in Russia alone. Economies rely on each other. Communism could only exist as a global system. The capitalist system had to remain in Russia, and the Bolsheviks only aimed to manage it, and at most walk the earliest steps in building socialism-communism.

&amp;#x200B;

Lenin said: ""If the revolution does not occur in Germany, we will be doomed.""

&amp;#x200B;

And the revolution did occur in Germany, yet was crushed in blood by the capitalist tyranny, at that time headed by the fake socialist, unmatched in their zeal for bloody suppression of the poor and oppressed.

&amp;#x200B;

Indeed Russia was isolated.

&amp;#x200B;

A decade later, the Stalinist traitors seized power, and gutted the Bolshevik revolutionary program, instructing the communist parties abroad to support modifying capitalism instead of international revolution.

&amp;#x200B;

The world revolution then, to establish world communism, was then doomed, and any progress made in Russia was bound to die out with time...

&amp;#x200B;

That's how we reached the current situation today in October 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

But as Karl Marx explained, the capitalist system is based on the contending working class and capitalist classes, which are permanently in conflict. Just like it is a scientific certainty that capitalism will go on exploiting the poor, so it is a scientific certainty that the poor will try to rise once again. And this time they may be successful.",24Oct2018,1

It didn't use to be this way.  I grew up in a cold winter state but we were always warm.  I'd go outside and play and know that I could go inside and get warm.

As an adult, things were ""alright"" for the most part.  I've never been all that stable but I lived in the south where it didn't get cold often.  Even after I moved to the northwest I could keep warm.

Lately, for maybe 6 years I was living in a place with paper thin walls and seemingly no insulation.  I'd touch the wall and almost get frostbite.  I was poor so I had to be creative about trying to get warm.  I tried it all.  curtains, plastic, more plastic, living in blankets, still freezing.

29,"In the spirit of remaining anonymous this account is a burner.

So some background, I'm a 20 (21 in less than two months) male in Queensland and I've recently been thinking back alot on my childhood. I was born 3 months early with no heartbeat and as you can imagine spent most of my early life in the hospital more often than not. I was a very sick child who'm the doctors regularly gave little to no change of surviving (I even have needle scars on my hands and scarring through my lungs and nasal cavaties due to pulling the tubes out so often), this combined with the fact that I have high functioning autism and have never exactly been a normal kid probably put alot of strain on my parents. Even with that however i'm beginning to think that what my parents did to me over my life is not ok.

My parents have never been the most loving parent to myself or my 3 sisters, mother is a neuroscientist and father is a network engineer so very grounded unemotional people, this doesn't mean they didn't love us, I think in their own way they did, but my sisters and I where forced to grow up very fast due to this. At 5 we each made our own breakfast, lunch for school, started doing our own laundry, cleaning around the house and learning to cook dinner. By 7 or so we where doing all the dishes and regularly cooking dinner for the family, this seems fine to me as we never had any issues with this and my mother was studying at the time with my father working 3 jobs to support us (we never had alot of money growing up). At 4 years old my parents where told I was a ""child prodigy"" after I built a remote control car out of a kit and some spare parts in the shed, they where also told I probably had autism and would struggle in life, my parents chose not to tell me or anyone else as they never wanted me to use it as an excuse, they wanted me to live a normal life, however they still made decisions based on that ""diagnosis"".

As I recently found out my parents sent me to a normal school rather than an accelerated one for two reasons, the money (as mentioned earlier we didn't have alot), and because they wanted me to get bullied so I would be forced to adapt rather than everyone coddling me (I got beaten up in school, they didn't care too much). While my sisters believe i'm the smartest out of all of us (albeit certainly the most eccentric), I was never the one to do great at school, it was too slow and boring for me, so generally I was a B grade student, as you can imagine my parents where not a fan, often praising my sisters over me since they where more academic focuses whereas I preferred my little projects, building robots and computers, reading books and figuring out how things work by taking them apart. Over time I just gave up on school never trying as I started to believe nothing would be good enough for my parents (turns out I was right). As every child does, I thought my parents where harder on me than my sisters, I spent probably 70-80% of my school life grounded off computers and book for doing something wrong (people at school would even say, ""oh what did you do this time""). Normally it was things like spilling a bucket of water while cleaning the kitchen, building a brick house at the back and not realising that you need to stack the bricks differently so it fell on me, and so many more tiny things, honestly I can't remember most of them as they became pretty routine, do something dumb because I wasn't paying attention, get a lecture from my father, get grounded, go to room, rinse and repeat. (I was a clumsy absent minded kid, the kind who rides his bike while holding onto the rail near a storm drain, forgets to let go and falls into the storm drain).

It wasn't until I hit my teens that things started to get worse, at this point I started wondering if my parents weren't harder on me, I thought that every kid must think that so I assumed I must just be fucking up far more than my sisters (around this time my little sister had started stealing money from the family, chocolates from the fridge and other things, she eventually got over it i'm happy to say). At 14 my parents institute a rule, pocket money stops being paid (we got paid a few dollars a week for chores, though into a bank account as we weren't allowed to spend it on food), and you have to find a job, if you don't have a job you're out handing out resumes looking for a job. After months of being yelled at and grounded because I couldn't find work I finally got a my first job, I made pizzas at dominos. My parents said finally and moved on, unfortunately the dominos shut down a few months after I joined and so began a long repeating process of me finding work, losing work, being yelled at for my parents, being forced to spent all my time looking for work, rinse and repeat. I will admit, due to my obsessive tendencies, clumsiness and being incredibly bad at repetitive tasks and sales, I lost quite a few jobs over the course of high school, some of them my fault, other ones due to me starting to get too old, not that my parents cared.

I graduated from high school and went to university where I was top of my class, I had found something I loved and something I had been teaching myself since I was very young, In my first trimester I got high distinctions in every single assignment bar one. My parents said good, keep trying (my mother was top of her class and graduated with honours at a prestiges university). At this point I was the only one who went to uni, my two older sisters who graduated before me weren't interested (which causes issues between them and my parents), eventually I lost one of my jobs and as normal my parents made me go out there in the 40 degree whether applying for work, they even set a curfue and started tracking how long it would take for me to get home and if I arrived 5 minutes late I was scolded, I was cooking dinner every night for the family and doing all the chores, all the while getting yelled at from my class mates because I never had time to do any of my group projects. It causes my grades to take a pretty hard hit. Shortly after I managed to find work and also met the woman who would become my first girlfriend, unfortunately that ended pretty badly after a month which sent me into an emotional spiral downwards, my parents just told me to ""get over it"" and ""grow up,"" after a while they wanted to send me to a psychologist so I could get ""drugged up and stop being annoying"" I never accepted and forced myself to get over it. That period was one of my lowest moments in life, seeing myself as a failiure for ""letting something as simple as a girl affect me this much,"" due to my parents insistence on emotional strength and being yelled at every time I cried as a child I saw it as a weakness which simply made me more down.

Finally I graduted uni, in which my father said words I will never forget, ""It's just an arts degree""...  
He doesn't have a degree, (my degree was also 3D animation, I wanted to go into the film industry).  
Shorly after I was given a month to find work, now for those of you who work in the creative arts industry, you'd know that's insane, but my parents where convinced I could do it, 9 months (an incredibly short time for the arts world, it's very hard to find work), went by before i found work, some of the worst 9 months of my life.

My parents did not believe me that it was hard to find work, and so I had my phone taken off me, my computer taken off me, forced to sleep near my parents bedroom so they could make sure I went to bed at a certain time and woke up at a certain time, they took the clothes I liked away from me, I couldn't talk to my friends, wasn't allowed outside the house unless I was handing out resumes which they eventually stopped and got me to apply online using an old laptop ( I was also reeling because I had just found out my two older sisters are my half sisters). My father wanted a report each night of what jobs I had applied for, how I applied for them, the progress on the application, and what time I applied. I applied for over 250 jobs in that time...  
After some time of not finding work my parents would lock me out of the house during the day, I was forced to renovate the house, painting, sanding, filing on holes (my parents where going to sell), then during nights I would cook, clean, do the dishes, then sit on the couch, no music, no books, and spend the next 5 hours or so applying for jobs, go to sleep, woken up at 7 in the morning to repeat it all over again, 7 days a week for roughly 6 months straight. The punishments didn't stop there.  
I love my hair, I spend 15 minutes each morning styling it with a blow dryer then hairproduct getting the perfect quiff, so as a punishment for not finding work, my parents shaved my head, then scolded me when I cried, it was one of the most painful memories of my life, the last thing I had that I loved, the thing I thought they couldn't take away from me, they did.  
Shortly after I finally found work at a local studio where I discovered as it turns out, I'm a whorkaholic. I was doing 12-15 hours a day and loving it, I was also away from my parents, but I didn't escape them entirely. I still had no phone or computer, and my parents forced me to put their bank account down as the account my pay went into, my first full time job and all my pay went into my parents account (I was 19). After working there for two months I changed my account, and moved out, my parents didn't help, I hired a truck, loaded my stuff, and moved into the city. Unfortunately shortly afterwards I lost the job at the studio as I was casual and they had run low on clients (as I learnt is normal), I eventually ran out of money to pay rent while I looked for work and had to break lease, my sister let me live with her while I tried to find work as my parents refused to help me at all. Eventually I found work, and for some reason I just kept chatting to my parents like nothing happened, still with the lectures from my father and being ignored by my mother, I thought it was perfectly normal.

Then my sister said something that made me start to think, she said that our parents where always harder on me, I asked my other sisters and they all agreed, meaning that I wasn't imagining it like I thought, and maybe I wasn't the issue. Since then I started to think more about what my parents did to me growing up, some honourable mentions being my father calling me broken when I found out I was considered high functioning autism and claiming they had to be harder on me to make sure I could function, refusing to admit I had moved out since I was ""living with my sister"" (I pay rent myself and have payed back all debts), claiming I tried to sabotage my sisters relationship because I was ""jelous"" (mentioned a friend of hers that had come over to her ex, thought it was a mate from work looking for him, turned out to be my sisters ex), claiming I was an ungrateful shit for negotiating for higher percentages in a business deal (he wasn't involved), and so much more. The final one finally made me block his number, that was a few weeks ago and I haven't unblocked it.

All in all i've started looking back and realising that maybe I wasn't the problem, that maybe i'm not broken, and that maybe I shouldn't be constantly looking for my fathers approval (something I don't think I'll ever get). I still don't know why, could be the autism, could be because i'm the only son or my fathers first biological child, could be that my father was beaten by his father (who he hasn't talked to in over 15 years) and so he doesn't know how to have a son, I don't know and to be entirely honest I don't think I care. I wanted to know what you guys think, get some views from people who don't know me, now I know you're only seeing one side, so the argument could be quite biased, don't get me wrong my parents certainly did alot of good stuff too, they generally where supportive, bought me bionicals and magentics when I asked with my pocket money, let me use parts from the shed to build cool stuff and other than wacking me on the head or smacking me they didn't beat me, plus i'm mature and that's something, but is it worth it?

*Note, my family is not religious, we're all athiest, usually they're very reasonable and logical people, but I'm beginning to question that, also sorry for the stupidly long post, had this on my mind for a while.*

tldr: Had what I think is a tough life, thought it was perfectly normal, parents shaved my head because I couldn't find work and never supported me, father blames me for everything and mother doesn't care much, thinking about dropping them from my life.",24Oct2018,1

Hey Reddit 👋

I'm always aspiring to improve myself, whether it is in my career or my private life. Retrospectives are a proofed tool in agile software development, but why don't we do retros in other parts of our life? During a retrospective, you ask yourself:

 • What went well in the past iteration? 

• What could be improved? 

• What will I commit to improve in the next interation?

 That's why I built a convenient tool to track and improve your personal development and personal evolution.

[https://www.producthunt.com/posts/self-retrospective](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/self-retrospective)

 Here is how it works: 

❇️Choose between different parts of life you would like to improve (i.e. work, self, family, money, possessions, …)

❇️ Choose after how many month you would like to do the retrospective

❇️ Ask yourself for each part of your life: What did you do good? What could you improve?

❇️ Add your email address That’s it! You will receive an email after the chosen time period to do a retrospective with yourself.

Let me know what you think!

Cheers, Adrian",24Oct2018,1
33,"Several years ago my mom made a comment in passing that called my father's paternity into question. I didn't mention it to him for a few years because I was really uncertain about how he would respond and I wasn't sure I even wanted to know. He and I have a great relationship; we're very close. So eventually, I got up the nerve and asked him about it. He told me he was aware but he never felt bothered to find out because it didn't matter to him. I was his. And so we left it at that. Over the years, I've thought about it on and off, because I'm a curious person. I kind of just want to know. I've been thinking about using 23 and Me to explore but haven't quite decided to take the leap yet. I've heard all kinds of interesting stories come out of those ancestry/DNA discovery search sites and I'm curious about what mine might be. ",24Oct2018,1

36,"My best friend and roommate introduced me to a girl earlier this year and we hit it off. To cut a long story very short we dated for 6 months but in the end she wasn't happy anymore. Before, during, and after our relationship I knew she had a crush on my roommate but I over looked it. I was in love and If she was willing to be with me then she was willing to get over it right? I was very wrong. Throughout our relationship i compared myself to him very negatively and she would always tell me I shouldn't do that, she picked me, etc etc.

After we broke up she confessed she was in love with him. I trust that nothing happened while we were together and after a lot of turmoil my best friend concluded that nothing would ever happen, he's my best friend and brother and he couldn't hurt me like that.

I found out this morning that they made out a few times and he'd stopped talking to her to try and distance himself. He never mentioned it and I practically had to make her confess after a very long conversation where I pretty much guessed what was going on anyway. She came over and we talked. I cried a lot. I talked with him and eventually he said it would never happen again. 

As I laid there thinking I realized only I could fix this. Neither of them wanted to get over each other and it's not like I can erase my feelings either. In my opinion, if they wanted to be adults (we're all in our mid 20's), they'd stop seeing each other and try to get over each other. She said she didn't want to and I got the same feeling out of him. So I get to be the adult. Yay. I don't want to lose either of them as my friends, honestly I can't. It's been a really bad year, 6 months with her not withstanding, and I don't know what I would do without their support.

Anyway, I told them they could be together. I had to do something for their benefit that would hurt me immensely because they wouldn't do the same for me. They know how much it hurts me and either they don't care or they're willing to ignore it. I feel betrayed and alone and stupid and a million other things that are so negative. She's sleeping in his room right now and I had to get my thoughts out somehow. Thanks for reading.",24Oct2018,1
37,"I am three months out of a 2 year relationship.  he was very emotionally and physically abusive to me. He has a pattern of doing this to multiple women, being physically abusive only  to the ones that he cohabits with but treating all the women in his life like crap. I KNOW all of this, I have all this information, and yet I still find a way to blame myself. I keep on saying, ""If only I was prettier and smarter and knew how to bike well and cook well and wasn't insecure about this this and this, he wouldn't have abused me. He wouldn't have cheated. He wouldn't have been able to kick me aside so easily. If I only I had been stronger, I would have stood up to him and the abuse wouldve stopped."" I give him excuses like, ""Oh well of course he treated all of these women poorly. They weren't good enough for him so he is looking for the right person to be good for."" which is a completely fucked up thing to think. Or I now think, ""Oh he is probably changed now and is going to treat his new girlfriend really great and I was the one that refused to see how awesome he was. If only I didn't break up with him, we would be happy, Why did I break up with him? Im so stupid."" I know these thoughts aren't healthy but they cross my mind a lot and they hurt me a lot.

41,"I feel like typing and sharing a part of my status for no reason. I was going to post this last night, but I put my phone down for a moment, then I fell asleep.  I also had a couple really stiff drinks while writing most of this.  The information below is uneventful, boring. You’ve been warned!  Feel free to read. Be nice if you comment.  

I’m buying a house. Closing is in five days.  Don’t congratulate me. I don’t understand why people congratulate some one for buying a house. “Congrats for spending money!”... on a place to live. Something I need any way?  It’s kinda neat that it’s mine with no shared walls, but still, *now* I have to move EVERYTHING I OWN.  What a nuisance. I have some things already ordered for my backyard. Oh, and I have a lawn mower, too. I’m looking forward to giving my 9 year old wiener dog a backyard, and a doggie door.  I’m also looking forward to not having carpet any more. Oh man that’ll be nice.  The house is two blocks from my SO, too. That’s a nice bonus. 
I’ve started boxing up my things. It’s almost overwhelming. Not because I have a lot of stuff (I don’t) but.. it’s still all of my stuff that I have to prep to move.  

My knee is fucked up. About three days ago my MCL decided to not be my friend any more. It hurts like fuck. This *exact* thing happened about five weeks ago and it inexplicably went away, completely, after four days. Didn’t hurt at all. So I’m expecting the same this time! 🤞🏼After all, I have to move all my shit to a house pretty soon. I don’t want my two friends helping me to have to pick up my slack. I already feel bad enough having to ask for help. I should be able to do it on my own. I’ll only ask for help with my furniture. 

I haven’t seen my SO since Saturday night. I hate it. I won’t see her for a least another couple days. I hate it, and I’m becoming used to not seeing her. That’s the worst part. I miss sitting next to her, her smell, how silly she is. I don’t miss texting her every day!  &lt;- That’s sarcastic -I don’t see her sometimes, but texting is of course always there. I’m kind of tired of texting. One day without her, eh, ya that’s normal life. Two days.. that’s an “ugh this has to stop.”  More than that, I just feel like saying “whatever. Come around whenever. I don’t care.”  I don’t know exactly why I get like that. I think I just get used to not seeing her. 

My dog’s allergy is flaring up. He responds quite well to Apoquel. But I ran out some time ago and figured I’d try to eliminate things in my control. I changed laundry detergent and dog food. I tried Benadryl. I tried Zyrtec. Nope. None of it worked. So I’m doing to get more Apoquel tomorrow. He’s so itchy. I’m ready for that little dude to have some relief. 

My son is going to have to start driving himself soon. Oh man. Fiiiiinally. That’ll be nice. His last lesson is Friday, then he’s eligible for the final license test. Having a mobile kid? I can’t wait. It’ll be grand!

50,"Went for a swim and nobody was following the lane indicators on the floor (where you swim up one side and down the other), they were just going straight to end and pushing right back other way which is common, so I followed suit so as not to create an issue.

I'm swimming backwards and feel a body hit me from behind.  I turn and it's this lady who recently got in, I saw her watching everyone before getting i  and knew exactly what was going on, so said ""I saw you watching all of us before getting in, you know what was happening with the swimflow.""  And she goes ""It doesn't matter, you're going the wrong way and crashing into people, read the sign.""

All I can think to do at this point is call her a ***** which obviously won't fly in a public pool, so I finish going the way I was, then at the end get ready to resume going the way this woman crashed into me to indicate she wanted to do to avoid crashes, because I'm not in the mood to argue and she's right anyway, the rest of the pool was wrong and she collided being the only one wanting to against the flow and be right.

Before I take off the older guy in a lane next to me asks what she said.  I wave it off trying to indicate I'm letting it go/it's petty and not worth the time.  So he yells for a lifeguard who saw it to explain it to him, he starts yelling at her about how it's a big pool and shouldn't matter, the lady who collided hears him and starts yelling at him but he's yelling at her about how it's a big pool and she could have gone anywhere and there was no need to collide with anyone.

Yes I got the impression she collided with me when she knew she didn't have to, but it wasn't a huge deal just a ""really people? come on"" moment that I often have watching traffic or people at a mall anyway.

In a post made a bit ago, the administration of Reddit claimed that [70% of Reddit users were ""on"" the Redesign](https://imgur.com/miygBwi). 

This seemed like a lot. We've all seen lots of circlejerking about how much people prefer the old design, so I wanted to set out and look for myself.

**If you have more traffic stats, specifically any that run counter to those I've located, please share!**

I sent messages to the moderators of several subreddits and took a look at the subs I moderate myself. While many opted not to share traffic stats, I was able to get the numbers on some pretty big subreddits.

In the last month I have almost ruined multiple friendships, I lost my grandmother, I have made attempts at quitting drinking any kind of alcoholic beverage, and I have confessed very deep and personal things that I have never talked about. This past month has nearly destroyed me. From the advice of some people that are very concerned about me, I have decided to set out on a journey to find myself. And what better way to do that than to study religion and possibly find what I need to find in it.


Over the course of six weeks I will be studying and practicing the six main religions of the world. Week one will be Christianity. Week two will be Islam. Week three will be Hinduism. Week four will be Buddhism. Week five will be Sikhism. Week six will be Judaism.

I have never been a very religious person. Currently I do not practice any religion. When I was in high school I very loosely followed Christianity, but I was always skeptical. Going into the study of all of these religions I am going to go in a blank slate with no preconceived notions. I will give myself entirely up to the religion to get the full experience and hopefully find myself in all of it. I have never been the best grammatically so you will have to bear with me.

I will be starting this journey on Sunday, October 28. There will be small updates posted after each week is up to give an update on my thoughts and feelings. I am going to take roughly one to two weeks after the entire study is done to compile my thoughts, feelings, and opinions into a paper/blog/post. I will spend the next few days preparing for everything. Wish me luck with this journey. Thank you.",24Oct2018,1

I guess I could stop, but for some reason I just keep on eating even though I really don't want to and it makes me feel bad. It's been like this almost every day during these weeks. Today this is what I've eaten (excluding lunch and dinner)

.Corn Flakes with milk, several portions (maybe 4 small to medium-sized)

.A piece of chocolate cake with strawberries

.Two glasses of hot chocolate with marshmallows

On the weekends I eat even more... different kinds of snacks, candy, bread, ice cream... 

It's like I have cravings so strong that they're almost controlling me?

71,"So I (22F) met this guy I’ll call him John (31M) through friends a year ago. We hit if off and hung out everyday for six months.He would talk to me about my emotional issues and always have a sympathetic ear. We have the same mutual friends here and they all like him.


He has a very cynical world view though. His parents were both doctors. In high school he had a 4.0 gpa and got nearly perfect scores on the SATs. He want to Colorado state because that’s where most of his friends were going. His plans were to become a high up political figure or a lawyer. Everyone in his life was saying that’s where he was going. He hated all his general education classes.


He flunked out his second year and worked retail jobs. He met a girl named Rebecca(30F) who his friend used to date. She was his only crazy ex, the rest he has not much bad to say. She would throw things at him, get mad if he was looking at celebrities in movies to long, accused him of using her for sex ,and would break his things. They dated for five years.


During this time he had periods of depression that started when he was in college and made him fail out. Where he would spend months not working and having suicidal thoughts. He has nihilistic views about the world, he thinks things are meaningless and random. He was never bullied, never had any abuse, and came from an affluent family.


A years before I met him he was doing therapy for depression. At 28 he went to a residential treatment center but said it was a scam and took his money. He spent five months there, it’s an expensive reputable treatment center. He saw no change.



After five months he started to become depressed. He started complaining that rent was too high, that his job had become mundane. He quit his and we planned to stay together but he “had to leave because he was being screwed over for rent money”.


So he went home to live with his parents. He’s had no job for a year. He doesn’t pay rent, he does SOME chores, he takes care of the dogs, and most days watches movies, reads the news, and reads books. He says his depression has made him feel so negative he can’t function.


After eight weeks of leaving he told me he was suicidal and I said talk to a professional and stopped talking to him. He says he can’t open up to me now because of that. I talk to him a lot about my insecurities because when he left I felt very alone. I’ve tried bringing up that maybe something happened in his childhood he doesn’t remember. He said that was stupid.



(The ex who harasses me is a different ex)
I’ve lost my temper with him. Since we met I have an ex I’ve know since I was 16 for six years. Even though I haven’t seen him in 2 years, he keeps sexual photos of me and contacts me every so often. It’s to the point if I ignore him he sends the photos to me saying “remember these:)”. I feel like I can’t block this ex because he’s been aggressive in the past and knows where I live and my family. John always rolls his eyes when I tell him about it now.

He says there’s an easy solution block him. I try to explain that if I make a hard choice and piss him off I have a got feeling he’ll do something. I’ve blocked him in the past but he’ll find ways to contact. I compare johns and his relationship with Rebecca and how he stayed so long. He said I try to compare two situations that aren’t similar and that I’m bad at arguing.


He says that I’m shallow because I was bullied in high school badly and now really critical of my looks. He says I’m emotionally immature and a liar . Ive never been called that really before but he says it comes from things like me lying about taking the last cookie. I’m an anxious person and working on it but I tell white lies sometimes.


I’m in Chicago for my birthday with all my friends. He’s in a grumpy mood. I try to call him and he doesn’t want to talk. This is a common theme throughout the past year I just want to talk how normal friends would. Like a couple times a week or once a week. But he won’t do that sometimes and if I try to keep trying to talk to him because I worry he says I’m annoying and needy.I try couple days later and he says we aren’t dating ,we don’t live in the same state, I don’t have a future for myself or you. I am upset. I say he’s never cared about me , that he’s a constant pity party, he’s a loser and that he’s selfish.


We don’t talk for two weeks and he send me like a text that was like 700 words. Saying how I’ll find someone, all my good qualities and talking about his own issues. I felt a simple sorry could of been enough or phone call. I felt patronized. I told him I didn’t read the whole thing and deleted it. He was pissed that I couldn’t be bothered to read it. And ignored me for awhile. 



He’s very unemotional and acts like I’m hysterical. I apologized a couple weeks later he says he doesn’t see what he could of done differently in either situations. He said that I was mean and just throwing things in his face when I was criticizing him. He said he thinks the things I say but ten times worse.That he was being objective and logical. I said I know I need to work on my anger issues.


Am I a mean person? Am I acting crazy? Should I cut contact with John?

I adore plaid and find a lot of the styles &amp; fabrics to be very comfortable! AND it's autumn!! Come on!!

Plus, I cut my hair rather short a few weeks ago..

Probably not the greatest vibe to give off when I'm trying to get back into dating.

79," Hi there - long time reader, first time poster.I decided, with my wife, that after 8 years of working at a big/well-known consulting firm, to quit and head in a new direction. To create something of my own or join something where I could really be a part of something.

My wife saw how unhappy / bored / stressed I was at my job and over the summer said: why don't you quit, I'll hold down the fort. You take the time and really figure out what you want to do. We don't have kids yet, likely in a couple years. And we're financially doing okay that I can take 3-6 months off without any financial pain, given my wife's job as an attorney and plenty of savings. So: (1) my wife is amazing :) and (2) I'm trying to figure out what to do with all my time!

Right now I'm spending my days working out/ running, cooking (a hobby) , reading, and wondering what type of business to maybe start or other things in general to do (hobbies / activities etc.) to capitalize on having this free time which I'll never get back.

All suggestions welcome!",24Oct2018,1
80,"(WARNING LONG READ) Before I start this, I'd like to say that I try to be a very optimistic person. I know that no matter what is happening to me right now, everything will somehow work and connect in the end. This being said, let me try and explain what I've been feeling lately. It might come off as disorganized as my headspace been a mess. 

So to begin, I don't live in the best household. My family (specifically my dad) is very emotionally abusive. He's really aggressive and over all, an asshole. I could go into depth with this but to keep it short I have 0 connection/relationship with my dad. Because of this I have a big hatred towards him. To the point where I feel like it holds me back, and I tend to release all the shit I've bottled up from him towards my girlfriend. (I sometimes get really short tempered and say mean shit without realizing)

I'm also 17 years old and a senior in highschool. I think I found my passion and that's content creation/film. I love it. I've been making videos since I was kid and made many YouTube channels along the way. Recently though (7 months ago) I decided I'm gonna do my best to make this passion into a living. It was a rough start but I think my vision is pretty in line. Since then I've now been trying to work with local artists to make small 5 min documentaries on them, making weird very short experimental films, taking photos of my friends/artists, and things along that nature. I'm nowhere near the level I'd like to be at but it's gonna take some time to get there and I'm willing to put in the work. 

My family has told me in the past that my passion for camera work is just a hobby and I'd like the prove them wrong. I have this dream of inspiring people through my films and changing the world. (I could go into depth with HOW &amp; WHAT but again to keep it short) 

This is all great but it's my senior year of high school and usually what's next is college. Now I'm not Anti-college but I feel like college isn't right for me. My whole life I felt as if school didn't really let me fully express my creativity. I also haven't really connected with many people at school unless they're also into the more creative side of work. Over the summer I went to a blue print program for a prestigious state university and that's when I really realized college wasn't for me, I felt like I was wasting my time. 

A lot of people would recommend a local college but I have a friend in a good name local college currently taking film classes and he says it's a waste of time as everything they've taught in the curriculum he's already known and can be found online. 

Based on my own interpretations &amp; on what other people told me (not just that 1 friend) the best way to go down this route I'm going is experience. 

I view this whole idea as a business. The only way to grow and gain attention is to network, sell yourself well, and of course have a good product (my work). 

Now when trying to say this to my parents they instantly shut me down. I've been told I'll never amount to anything, I'm a failure, stupid etc. I try not to attach myself to their opinions since I'm used to their negativity. 

Here's the big problem though, I have my college prepaid for. My grandma a very long time ago, before I was born. Paid for a 4 year tuition to any state/local school. I feel guilty not using it but I think I would feel worse if I was using it and wasting this money on school if I feel like it's a waste of time. 

So I have this dream I want to achieve that I know can be possible. But I have family/societal pressure to goto school. I also feel like my home situation takes a toll on my mental health. Lately I been in a weird mind state over everything and haven't really been too productive. 

I'd also like to mention that I constructed a plan to pursue my dream if I'm still not at the level I'd like to be at by graduation. First off I need to leave my house as this environment is shitty. So I'm gonna be saving money along with my girlfriend in hopes to move out once we graduate. If we don't have enough by that time to move out comfortably, I'm gonna be living with her for a short period right after graduation to save more money and to finally get away from my home. If me and my girlfriend don't last till out of highschool (shit happens and I have to prepare for the worst) I have a few friends who would let me live on their floors for a short while till I get my own place. (Keep in mind I don't mind working jobs in order to survive, I was planning on working jobs till my vision starts making enough money and I don't need to have a job anymore) 

I just need some guidance/ advice. I know it's not the common route but I feel like I have to do this. I also don't mind listening to people against it. I'm open to both views.

81,"I’m not quite sure if this is the right place to post this but here we go. 

My cat passed away a month ago, a week ago my sister got a new dog, she named it the same as my deceased cat. I know this is such a trivial issue but it has really annoyed me, my cat meant a lot to me and I feel like she’s kind of shoving it in my face with her new (living) puppy, it’s also made it harder for me to deal with getting over the death of my cat, when I found out what she had called her dog I started to tear up before I had even process what was said. I can’t get her to change the name but this just sucks. ",24Oct2018,1

So, it has been almost 2 months since I made the first post, and I wanted to give an update on it.

We have been emailing each other back and forth, and we have been learning more about each other in small amounts because she doesn't always get too much free time while on the ship. Everything has been going really well. I just confirmed this past week that she is still wanting to go out to eat with with me once she gets back.

I don't know what it is that is different about this woman, but something about her just makes me really want to stop and take it easy with her, work through things slowly, so on and so forth.

While I wish this month would go by faster, I am anxiously awaiting the day that she returns.",24Oct2018,1
86,"For the past week I’ve been getting increasingly depressed and anxious. Today, after grabbing some food for my plan of emotional eating, hoping that would help (it didn’t lol), I was in search of somewhere to pull up and eat my grub. I ended up by a cemetery, and as soon as I saw it for some reason I was very drawn to it. 
So i parked up, ate my food and then went in. 
It was so beautiful and peaceful. I was there for about a half hour and since leaving I feel like I’m in a better head space and more at ease. 
The energy there is very calming. I could feel the people resting below my feet in complete solace. It was also so quiet compared to the city around me. Being here reminded me of my own mortality and I want to choose happiness and fulfillment, and I will. I really am feeling less stressed and more joyful since the visit. 
I plan on going back soon, I wish it wasn’t so cold. I don’t think I’ve ever been somewhere so peaceful before.
