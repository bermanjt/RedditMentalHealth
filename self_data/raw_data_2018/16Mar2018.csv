Spent 3 months in the hospital afterwards and heavy suicidal ideations. Posted a comment on a certain video, people reached out and talked to me, allowing me to vent. After shutting my self out from the outside and bottling my problems up, it was a major release to be able to vent to you guys. Mentally and physically. Being at the lowest point I’ve ever been in my life, it’s incredibly appreciated that people I don’t know offer a listening ear, where as my ex-girlfriend (who wanted to remain friends) ignores me and doesn’t talk to me. Thank you all. ",16Mar2018,1

4,"Hello,

I write here in r/Relationships [had to change subreddit though] because I think my problem still lies in relationships. The problem with depression comes and goes and will make another post for that.

I couldn't have a single romantic relationship in all my life.

I had a male friend, back when I was 14, and I thought we were close friends. Between being 14-15, don't remember exactly, someone rumoured jokes that we were gay because we were always together. Nobody told that joke to me directly, so I couldn't care less. But they did tell that joke to him at a couple times.

One day, we were going to meet our friends as usual in the early afternoon after high-school, and before arriving there, he asks me: ""Are you gay by any chance?""

Needless to say, at this point I think, I was not gay at all; and I've never thought of the word ""gay"" not even remotely during our first one/one-and-a-half/two year(s) of friendship.

I was deluded that day. I don't know why, but it felt wrong that he asked. Still, I can't remember today, 10-11 years later, but I can only imagine that I was deluded for how could have he listened to what his other friends joked about.

So, I progressively had more and more doubts about our friendship: I was also envious, or jealous, or both, that I didn't have all the possibilities that the other friends of ours in the group had. On an economical and on a ""cultural"" level (I was the only one coming from southern part of our state, with the classic social differences that any state has between north and south).

Also, it was too much for me seeing that he could and would be able to replace a ""hole"" in case I missed the opportunity to join him and the group for any occasion. In other words, that he could have a life without me! Or at least, without worries about me!

Ridicolously enough, at 15 we had the peak of our friendship, and at 16 I had my hardest time with depression and totally hating him.

After quite some time becoming friends at 14, at 15 I started to feel like I was replaceable. So I started putting on an act of being sad. I also started wearing clothes that would make me look miserable and ugly. But the ""transformation"" was not complete by that time. I was still open to other people in my classroom, and had fun with them, even being a shy guy. And somehow I could feel that nothing had changed for others, even though I was putting that act up, and anybody had a good consideration of me nonetheless, for what I had been at 14 (i.e. first year high-school and metting the mates in the classroom).

What was the goal of the act, was to see the reactions of other people, especially my friends, and especially this best friend of mine. I had convinced myself that he was better in anything I did. I told him.

The more and more that the act was on, the more and more I was being replaced. At 15 I wanted to commit suicide and wrote a text to him to tell him my intentions. He didn't reply until the end of the afternoon, saying that ""he hadn't seen the message and that anyway he thought I wouldn't have done it."" I don't remember what came before, if this episode (I think so) or the ""Are you gay?"" question, by this also left me very much deluded of him. And made me feel genuinely bad. So bad, that not even a suicide could have caught the attention of anybody in the world, if not even my best friend's was.

(now I feel extremely dizzy remembering all of this, like I am sitting somewhere at 100 meters high and looking down, instead of on my chair)

From there, I can only skip to my 16 and remember how my hate for him and any activity we shared grew. I stopped doing the activity I loved the most, that I had even taught him, because everything reminded me so much of all that there was before.

As a young person, at 16, I wasn't reasonable at all. How could a reasonable person put up such an act of being sad to be spotted. [While now I understood how we are attracted much more to people who seem successful (whether they are or not really, but just show and appear as such).] I even so much desired that I could have been made to repeat my third year at high-school to start up anew, with another classroom and new people, and to replace him and our relationship.
Same goes for when I was 17, it was just deeper and deeper with anger and frustration, and getting as far as possible from them all; all the while at times I was going out with them, confused on what was happening: ""I hate them all, and still I miss them and want to be in their company?"" [But I now think I was drawn to them all because they looked or acted more successful.]
All the while, since when I was 16, my parents had started breaking up extremely bad at home, so that that home had no longer been a happy place thereafter.

At 18, during the last year of high-school, something matured in me and I was able to be with people and keep an emotional distance. I took the occasion and tried ending the act of being sad, and perhaps I tried to recreate what was before. 

But of course, with no success: we had already become two completely different people than who we were at 14-15. I didn't even know the people he met with after school or at weekends. I only knew that I was left behind, by him, but also by myself. If I couldn't have kept up with him, I couldn't do anything, anything, to help myself.

I won't go into what happened next, since our roads remained parallel but separated. I would like to talk about the side effects, about the things that weren't a priority for me in that time.

I had tried approaching girls during high-school, and even in previous schools. I always felt under pressure with my feelings. I would hate openly saying to the girl I liked, that I liked her. [Even though I now think it's just the way that ensures the message is spoken/sent/received the most clearly as possible, with less misunderstanding as possible.]

The first two year of high-school, I made use of the chat apps in use at the time on desktops, and failed both times. The first girl (at 14) didn't like me (we were in the same classroom by the way) and the second one, one year after, (at 15) just happened to be very shy and couldn't bear being into relationships/she was just starting with another boy older than the two of us, and relied on chats a bit like me (and she was amazing to talk with, and I still think good of her).

The third year, I tried to get to know a girl I liked and who was at the fifth year. I only managed to run away from her right after giving her a present, and exchange a brief comment some days after that, but that was it. She were into other kinds of people, probably.

Before high-school, I was a fan of putting anonymous paper-messages near the girls I liked, hoping that something good would come out of it. Even if some of those girls realized it, and mentioned it briefly, I always denied I had anything to do with it, again the pressure was too hard to face with somebody what I felt for them.

About this, I can only recall that when I was a child, my brother wanted to share ""in secret"" her crush in primary school to our father and asked him for advices. I didn't get the reason why it should have been a ""secret"", even more given that I was able to get to know it. But whatever...

I got so depressed during university, for not keeping up with my ""best"" and hated friend, and it started making me think that I wasn't good with girls because I was gay. Only because of that episode that didn't matter before then.

I entered a psychotherapy when I was about to turn 21. I always wanted to, since before high-school, and now was the time that I could seek the opportunity. With my psychotherapist, I have been able to resize depression and make it a smaller part of me. I mostly realized that I completely stopped thinking in terms of my mind and was always, always, thinking in what terms I thought the mind of that ""best"" friend were.

When I started this life-exercise of thinking things on my own, I started seeing more colors in my life again. But as the transformation wasn't instantaneous at the time I put up the act of being sad, neither was sweeping offside the bad I felt.

I had to use the colors I was able to see to make things that had those colors. In other words, building my life out of my previous one. [Now I am in both palettes of colors: the previous and bad ones, and the newer and better ones. I think that it might be inevitable, huh?]

I think this is enough of a background.

Now, I am unable to get out to seek new people. For who knows what reason or luckiest odd, I am still so lucky to have a job. I took a risk in chasing it, of course, and I'm still even studying in the free, spare time, when possible. But my social life is what I'd call broken...

It's like my colleagues need to be the replacement for my parents, and someone needs to be a replacement for my ""best"" and hated friend. And I can't see myself going out on my own and meet people. It's like I've built my social skills into having a family and one, ""elected"" best friend, and waiting for the right girl to cross my path one day.

Also because, not having this very experience, I believe that people just meet each other by going out on fridays and on weekends after a week busy working/studying, and starting talking with one another as strangers at first.

I don't know that ""world"", of socializing on fridays after the busy weekdays, and searching for the ""right one"". I'm always told [that's what I read the most on the internet, too] that one needs to stop searching for it to happen.


And now the part that all of you were waiting the most for.

TL;DR: I don't know that ""world"" of socializing going out on fridays, after the usually busy weekdays. I have no drive to go out and meet people at a bar or club, at random. But I don't want to be alone all my life. How do people start meeting new people? Do they go out and meet random people on fridays?

Also: all the depression made me uniquely focused on the ""me"", and what ""I"" was thinking and feeling. Before that, before high-school, I was much more curious and open about what feelings others could have. As if depression reset my curiosity completely. I thought you could tell me ""And who do you think would be interested in meeting a random dude, on a friday night, at some random place?""",16Mar2018,2

	Somewhere between all of me laughing at your horrible jokes or desperate grabs for attention, your pushes and shoves, calling me names, lip bites, ignoring me, blocking me on snapchat, you talking to other girls not even a day after we were with each other, the endless flirting, the “bullying” you and your friend do to me (which my parents join in on too), the friendship we had, the friendship we have now, your big brown eyes, your tall body that towers over me, the way my head feels resting in your chest, the way you squeeze my hand when I rub your back, and that one night; I fell for you. You flirt with me so much that even our friends’ parents tell us to date. I flirt back too, don’t get me wrong, but it’s always real… always. Sometimes I can’t tell if you’re kidding or not. 
	I always hope you aren’t. Because I want you. I want to lay in your arms again. I want to see you every day. I want to kiss your big, soft, pink lips. I want you to call me yours. I want to call you mine. I want you to say my name, but not to get my attention. I want you to talk about me to your friends the way I think about you. I want you to tell me I’m the one. I want your hands that are two times the size of mine to grab my ass again. I want to see your smile. Your real one, not the one you use in pictures. The one that comes from pure joy. The one that I saw when you went to state in basketball. The one I saw when you got your braces off. The one I saw when your grandma beat cancer. The one I saw when you saw me. The one that looks so fake, but is so real. I can always tell. The one that you use less and less. 
	Why do you use it less and less? Because you’re with the wrong people. You’re around those girls you just use for sex. The ones that fall in love with you after a week. The ones that are using you to get back at me. Those girls who aren’t me. Are YOU using them to get back at me? For telling my so called friends what you sent me, and what I sent back. And those so called friends telling other people, which eventually got back to you. You denied it. I would’ve too. It’s embarrassing for someone like you to be with someone like me. I’m too immature for you, but you’re the one acting to young for his age. That’s why you blocked me on snapchat, starting ignoring me, and avoided me in the hallways. I finally cornered you after one of your basketball games, outside in the parking lot after everyone had gone home. You were happy to talk to me. You asked me if I wanted to know why we were no longer friends. It didn’t leave me in tears for a week before, wondering what I did wrong. Wondering why I wasn’t good enough for you. Wondering if you hated me. Wondering if I had scared you away. Sure I made a mistake telling these “friends” something I shouldn’t’ve done, but I also made a mistake with you. I thought you cared. I thought you were the one for me. I thought we would be good together. I thought… I thought. That’s where I went wrong. I was creating scenarios in my head that could never happen. Like us being official. Us talking. You coming over to see me, and not my siblings. You wanting me. You could never want me. I’m the one who has been longing after you since New Years. Yes, I remember the day. 
	You came to my friend’s house, where I was, to see her. You wanted her. You were high. You came in smelling like your Polo cologne, but like… lots more. You sat next to me on the couch, because there was no room near her. You thought I wanted our other friend. I didn’t. I never did. You and I laughed all night. You asked her if she had any lotion. You wanted her to go into her room and kiss you. I couldn’t let that happen, so I got up and got it for you. You were mad at me,  but I didn’t care. I didn’t know I wanted you yet. I just thought you were being your weird self. We were in the room a while, so they sent someone to come in and check on us. We weren’t doing anything but arguing about how I ruined your shot, and you were going to fuck my friend in 2018. For sure. We went back in the living room. It wasn’t even midnight, but her parents were already hammered. You wanted her to be your kiss when the clock struck 12. She wasn’t. I wasn’t either. You didn’t get one that night. No one did. I put my hand on your leg, and you freaked out, but later you put yours on mine. That right there, is when I realized I wanted you. I wasn’t in love yet. Just a little crush. But my heart shattered for the first time when you snapped me later, when you sobered up. You said, “I’m forreal fucking {my friend} in 2018. Mark my words.” 
	You’ve broken our snap streak more than once. The first time, you walked by my lunch table, and said,  ""I don’t mind snapping you, but you can’t be annoying,” and boy, let me tell you, I felt that. I promised right then and there that I wouldn’t be annoying. I wouldn’t double snap. I wouldn’t ask the questions you didn’t want answered. You didn’t care. You went on your way. I finally convinced you to bring our streak back on the way to on of your basketball games. You had been asking everyone if they would rub your shoulders. Everyone said no, including me, even though I wanted to… like really bad. We got on the bus, and we sat two rows away from each other. Some girl I really don’t care for sat in front of you, but you scared her away, so I sat in her spot. You asked everyone once more if they would rub your shoulders. Another no from everyone. I put my headphones on and tried to sleep, but I couldn’t. I reached around the seat and asked you if you really wanted me to. You slid into my seat and I sat low so the coaches wouldn’t see us. I rubbed your shoulders. I got a snapchat, from you; it said “hey this is actually really good. rub my back too.” You might not think so, but it meant a lot to me. One, you snapped me, and two, you liked it. You were talking to me again. You wanted me to rub your back. You liked me rubbing your back. I couldn’t believe it. I snapped you later, and told you that you played well and that I was ready to quit being weird and wanted to talk to you again. You agreed. That night, we snapped and talked about EVERYTHING for hours.
	My heart shattered again on Valentine’s Day. That’s the day you stopped all contact. The day you blocked me. I don’t want to talk about that though. Nine days later, I made up an excuse to text you. You answered, but reluctantly. I tried again the next day, but got no where, so I gave up. I gave up on trying. I gave up on you. I gave up on myself. I stopped caring what I looked like. I stopped eating as much. I stopped being myself, all because of you. All because you wouldn’t talk to me. All because I wasn’t able to see that one face you make, that gives me butterflies. All because I wasn’t able to hear your voice, that sometimes is deep… sometimes. All because I wasn’t able to hear your loud, obnoxious laugh. All because I wasn’t able to see that smile. The one that kills.
	 But then, you started talking to me in the hallways some. You started flirting with me again. You and your friend started “bullying” me again. Our friends’ parents noticed that it was more than usual. They asked if we had finally started dating. Although I wanted to scream “YES"" from the rooftops, I had to reply an elementary response, “ew! me and him? gross!” And of course, you replied the same way, but were you kidding? I hope so. I realllllly hope so. You never unblocked me, but I was still happy for the attention.
	The day you came over, and my sister asked you to stay the weekend with us, I was ecstatic. I was getting to spend my entire weekend with you (or at least one day). You came and spent the night with us in our hotel. My sister and her friend took the bed, and you and I slept in a connected living room on a couch and rollaway bed. You went downstairs to meet a girl. I was sad. I had finally gotten to be alone with you since that night I cornered you in the parking lot, and you were going to meet a fucking girl. I decided to wait on you to get back, and talk about it with you (with a little help from some of my girl friends who were encouraging this). You came back, slightly drunk (I have no idea where you got any alcohol), but you said you didn’t do anything with the girl. I was relieved. Okay, I don’t want to get into the juicy details, but let’s say this; a back rub led to something more. I went to bed. You went to bed. We went our separate ways in the morning. I told my friends everything. They were happy for me. I had wanted this for forever. I finally had gotten the courage to text you that night around 9. I asked you when you were going to unblock me, and you said “idk but literally since 5 I’m talking to a girl from _______.” 
	I felt used. I felt worthless. I felt things i’d never felt before. I couldn’t believe you. I still can’t. You made me feel all of these things. I should’ve never fallen for you. You are awful to me. But you also treat me well. I feel so good when I’m with you. My parents like you. My friends like you. I want you. I want you. i want you. But you don’t want me. No. You do want me, but only when it’s convenient for you. My friend told me you were no good, and I didn’t believe her. I still don’t. there’s good in you. I see the good, but you have to show it to me. I don’t know if you want to. You told me you’ll call when you’re done with this girl, or if you’re ever done. But if you’d be done a  little quicker, I would be able to tell you this and not have to type it all on reddit.

11,"I really let the dumb cultural bullshit regarding ""success"" get to me. You know, like you have to do well in school and then go to a college and get a job which pays you six figures by the time you're 25 or whatever. And if you work in a job like fast food or as a janitor or some other ""low status"" job, you have failed completely as a person and should probably die.

Logically I know all this is nonsense but it still gets to me and makes me not want to have a ""failure"" job even though I'm essentially a ""failure"" person since I'm 25 and still live at home and haven't worked a real adult job yet.

It just feels bad because people always pulled the ""you'll grow up to be worthless"" card on me (I was an annoying kid) and well what do you know, it happened. I don't want anyone I grew up with to feel like they were right or know anything about my life since they are basically irrelevant in comparison to the rest of my life, and probably wouldn't give a shit anyway. I also hate when people make fun of me for things I don't care about, because it just shows how little people think of me that they can feel it's okay to do that.

So today, my mom was planning on going out to the hospital and said she won't be back for 5 hours. So after she went, I locked the front door and went to take my regular Communism influenced shit, and go to the bathroom, gently close the bathroom door without locking it, as I was alone. Usually I listen at a lower volume, but today I decided 'screw it' and set a bluetooth speaker at max volume and began my ritual.

To my horror, apparently my mom was still at home, in the other bathroom and as she heard noises from my toilet, she rushes in to make sure that I was okay, only to find me yelling along 'Partiya Lenina' as I drop a giant log of shit with an audible splash, after which I just looked at her for a few seconds, and she closes the door quietly looking at me with disappointment, and goes out to the hospital.

20,"And I don't mean only the crack down on ""hate speech"" subs specifically, but anything that would deter an advertiser from placing ads on reddit. This reminds of me the adpocalypse that hit youtube last year after the Pewdiepie controversy, and the continous pandering of youtube to advertisers on the back of the youtubers and content creators. Is this future of reddit?   

The recent extreme censoring of comments, the crack down on r/watchpeopledie, the ban of multiple ""controversial"" subreddits like r/uncensorednews, that doesn't have any directly harmful effect (like previously banned subreddits focusing on revenge porn or doxing).  

Few years ago, [reddit CEO famously stated](https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/16/3514232/reddit-ceo-yishan-wong-leak-memo-violentacrez-doxxing-ban):   
&gt; We stand for free speech. This means **we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits**. We will **not ban legal content** even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse (cat pictures are a form of discourse).

I guess since then reddit has taken a huge step back in this direction, and as the world is becoming more polarized, and divided, especially the west, where more right-wing sentiments are rising, more social media platforms think that the best solution would be to exclude the ""wrong"" voices from the conversation.

22,"I lay in my bed every night wondering who am I? What is my purpose? What is wrong with me? 
So, I search the depths of my mind trying to figure these things out alone but I know that I cannot do it alone. Then I read the Bible and search for my answers there. 
A little back story about my life: as a kid, I was terribly sensitive but yet I had a mouth that was often unfiltered. That unfiltered mouth got me a lot of beatings but kept me safe from getting sexually abused as much as my sister did. I grew up not knowing what it felt like to be safe, to feel safe. The safest place for me back then was sleeping in a box with my dog behind the bowling alley bc I wasn’t as likely to be found and abused by my dad. Childhood memories are filled with beatings, drugs, sex, a lot of tears and a lot of me praying. I knew God well back then, not through reading or being taught of who he was but I felt him with me always. 
During childhood, the single digits of life, we learn from our parents. Our mothers teach us to be strong, tender and kind and our fathers teach us love, safety and courage. I only had what my mother taught us and that was everything. I can understand now that I get my strength and fighting heart from her. I also know that I get my sensitive heart from her as well. She is the only woman that I know who could have been beaten and raped from childhood and still have the amount of love and care for others as she does now. 
However, my father taught me nothing more than how to be afraid. I never understood how it felt to be completely safe in the presence of a man until I was blessed with my step father. He was a great man to say the least. My mom met him on a night that was supposed to be the last for her on earth and the last for him on earth. They had individually decided to commit suicide the night that God intervened and brought them together. He was a provider, protector, a teacher and a father always.  Most men would have run as quickly as they met me and my sisters but this was a challenge that created little fear for him. I learned what it felt like to feel safe in the presence of a man and I have not felt that feeling since my stepdad until October of 2016. That’s a whole different saga of my life that is still playing out as the seconds tick.... 
and so I sit here and think, write, read the Bible and try to figure out what is wrong with me for a moment more.

23,"We didn't have the perfect ending but it's us and given the situation, I would say it was apt. But we never even had a beginning. 

I miss you, so much. God, I miss you. You smelt like cigarettes and well, you. I love how you smell. I could get drunk on that smell. It smells like home and all the joy in the world. Ugh. I thank the universe everyday for your return. I do. You came back and I couldn't believe it. I wish things were different with us. I wish you weren't so fucked and I wish I wasn't a fucking empath who felt everything too much. It isn't romantic or brave or nice or special to be an empath who feels everything too much, it honestly isn't fucking special. It just fucking hurts most of the time. It isn't even like those sappy novels where things are mega fucked and it all turns out okay. It fucking isn't. I wish you could have trusted me because I would have never sold you out. Ever. Although I understand why you couldn't. You are my happy memory. My happiest. I love you and I have never ever said that to a person and meant it. I loved smoking with you, walking with you, I loved holding you, I loved kissing you, I loved your arm around me, I loved it when we kissed in my spot in the library, I loved it when we kissed for the first time, I loved the way you looked at me, I loved the way you wiped the shake stains off my mouth and kissed me, I loved waking up on your chest, I loved watching you sleep, you looked so peaceful, I could watch forever but I woke you up because I had to leave and I wanted to have you wrapped around me again, ugh, I love you. I wish I was a writer so that I could at least do justice in describing how beautiful you are but I'm not but I'll try. 

I miss you so much already. I want to know how you're doing, I hope you're studying for your exam, I hope everything is going well. I hope life is treating you kind, if not, I hope you're treating yourself kindly. I'm home and I wish I could tell you about Sam Sam and Rocky. You would have liked them. They're beautiful as always. C is coming over in May. I'm looking forward to that. I wish you could've met him. He's the best. I wish I could have been there for your birthday. I had the perfect gift planned. I know you hate your birthday but it's not about you, it's about people who are grateful for your birth and I am very much grateful for your birth so you should just let us celebrate it. I was going to get you The Phantom of the Toll Booth and Because of Winn Dixie. I thought I'll bake you a raspberry cheesecake too and maybe mac and cheese. 

I keep imagining an alternative ending to us - there was no us and I'm crying like a 13 year old but whatever, I have always been a cliché anyway. In that ending, I ask you to walk with me instead, we hug, I hold you for the last time, I kiss you before I let you go. But that's not what happened but I feel like what happened was more us than anything else. 

I almost want to start cutting again so that the universe will accept my offering and give you back to me but I feel like that's fucking crazy but it fucking worked last time, didn't it? Maybe if I cut myself enough, if I sacrifice enough blood, the universe will be happy with my sacrifice and let me have you again? But that sounds fucking crazy but ugh, I want you. I miss you, love. I wish you were here. I love you, A. 

Wish I was yours, 
Kryptonite.

25,"""Thyroid cancer which has metastasized to your lung""

Hopefully the oncologist I'm seeing today will have a different opinion about the treatability of it. Fingers crossed. 

On a lighter note, I'm guessing when the average person gets a diagnosis like this, they start worrying about death and family. In contrast, my thinking is ""what can I use this to get away with?""",16Mar2018,392
28,"Every Thursday night this church hosts volleyball in a carpeted gym. The courts are short by like a foot and the ceiling is really low and has basketball hoops that retract up directly above the volleyball nets. The games aren't very competitive because there are player of all ages and skill levels. Some players try really hard and some dont, its all fine, we just want to have fun. Im one of the players that try hard.

I(male, 26) was playing left side hitter and she(female, 16-20) was playing setter. Our team had a really good serve and the opposing team had a not so good pass to their setter. The ball ended up very tight to the net and their setter gave it a little boop to try to get it over the net. They hit it just so that it bounced off the top of the net and came down just to the side of our setter. Well she managed to hit the ball up above her head but was thrown slightly off balance and ended up looking down(away from the ball). I saw where the ball was going and immediately started moving towards it (and her). She, not knowing where the ball was, tried to move out of the way but inadvertently moved directly under it and we collided. At this point she was still bent over forwards and i bumped into her kind of like this but not nearly as severely. I could tell by the impact that i would have knocked her down so instinctively I reached around her to keep her from falling. Well my hand landed directly on her boob but i did manage to keep her standing. The moment i realized where my hand was i moved it but it was to late. She knew i got a handful, i knew i got a handful, and i think most of the other team saw it as well. I didn't manage to keep the ball in play so it was all wasted effort.

Before this happened her and I were on good teammate terms, congratulating each other on good plays, supporting each other on not so good plays. After the incident we didn't say anything about it and just continued playing. We definitely didn't congratulate/support each other as much as we did before.

Anyways I guess im just hoping to get reassurances that not bringing up the fact that i basically groped her was the right call. Should i have apologized?

29,"This might sound like a good thing but it's extremely debilitating. I can't play a game with a friend and lose due to things I feel are not fair like imagine an online game like DotA 2. If I feel, honestly, that a character is too powerful, and we lose due to it, I get really frustrated and it ruins everything and I lash out.

This goes for any part of my life, when I entered the adult life and started working I noticed that things really aren't always fair and companies often treat you unfairly and like crap. This still makes me sleep anxiously and I always walk around with a pit in my stomach because of it. 

It doesn't matter what aspect of life, if things are unfair I just can't handle it. I've tried to challenge myself but I always end up losing to my frustration.

An example of me not getting frustrated even though I lose is a game called Counter Strike. Not sure how familiar everyone here is with gaming but it's a first person shooter where there are no characters, and everything is 100% equal. I never get frustrated or angry from solely losing here because it's just down to me playing worse than my opponent. 

However at the same time, if we get dominated early I get extremely frustrated that I now have to waste 45 minutes of my night in a game that is an inevitable loss and no fun because I can't leave it or I get banned.

I just get frustrated so easily and I just want to be a happy person, I don't think others enjoy being with me when I act like this. I know people who are really calm and relaxed and really fun to be with and I just want to be like that, I want people to enjoy being with me and not see me as a douchebag.

But I'm almost 30 and this has been my entire life, regardless of how much I try to work on it.",16Mar2018,1

33,"So earlier today an old friend hit me up and asked me to go out to the bar and catch up. I'm not big on bars, only been once on my 21st birthday.    
Anyways, I hesitated and he finally convinced me by saying he'd buy the first two beers. Now where I live, it's a very small town. It's not uncommon for people drive home after they've been at the bar... I'm not big on the idea but my choices are limited. I can't carpool, I'm actually meeting him at the bar. There's no Uber or even taxis here. I heard you're usually good to drive after about an hour but I still don't like the idea of driving home later.     
       
I made this alternate account because it's embarrassing to me not knowing how to get home later after a night of drinking. Be nice please and if anyone has any tips, lay em on me please. Thanks. ",16Mar2018,2
34,"I can't really discuss the details as it's fairly specific to me and anything I say makes it obvious to the parties involved should they find this.. it's barely been a day after some stuff happened.

I am having a fairly low point, not to any dangerous to myself points.. just.. struggling with life as it is right now... what happened is my fault and these are the consequences for my actions.

I never meant to do what I did, or to hurt anyone. I don't know what's wrong with me that makes me do something so unreasonable. I sometimes wonder if I can even be human, I just don't don't know how to handle certain things. 

(I make it sound so much worse than it is I am sure, it's just relationship stuff before anyone thinks I murdered someone). I am alone for the first time in a fair while because of this, I am trying to undo what I have done but right now it seems insurmountable. How will things ever be the same again? What do you do when things are so bad, and it's your fault and you know it? You can only apologise so many times.",16Mar2018,3
35,"Hi Reddit, I'm just going to get straight into this.
Ever since I was a child I have always been a perfectionist. Redoing homework over and over again until it's perfect and looks amazingly neat, crying if I dot an 'i' and it's not perfectly above the letter... It's annoying. 

Relating to this, something that I have always had a problem with is being perfect. Being the perfect student/volunteer/citizen. I spend hours a day perfecting my presence online and in person. I create new Facebook accounts/Reddit accounts/Twitter accounts if something goes wrong (i.e. I post with a spelling mistake or my posts don't come across as friendly and inviting). I can't help it. I want to do good. I'm on my 378th email account (running out of variations of my name at this point...) because I'll send out a few emails, connect with some friends and then realize that I've said something bad or the illusion that I'm not perfect might accidentally slip through.

Someone please help. How can I get this perfect image of being the perfect citizen who does nothing but all good out of my head? I'm tired of having 1983 accounts for everything, and deleting one and restarting it all when the tiniest issue comes up. h e l p do I have some sort of mental problem? ahhhh !!

39,"So I'll try to keep this post really short. My parents sheltered me so much as a child, I was part of a ""good Christian household."" I'm in college now, and I realized how behind I was. I've made huge leaps and strides towards becoming more social and undoing the damage that my parents did to me. But there's literally so much stuff I have to do to get to where I want to be, and it feels very discouraging sometimes. Like learning how to dance well, for instance, is gonna be really tough to do. Any words of advice or encouragement for me? It feels like I'm digging myself out of a 10 feet deep ditch sometimes.",16Mar2018,3

44,"I'll just get right to it. I met a girl my freshman year of college, we started dating and have been for about a year and a half now. Our relationship is far from unhealthy. We hardly ever fight. Neither of us are ""clingy"" with each other. We respect each other's freedom and free time (we hardly even text anymore, it's great). 

But here's the issue. I have just been severely lacking any sense of excitement from the relationship. By that I mean I just don't really get all that excited or happy when we go on dates with each other. I feel the same is true for her also as she is hardly ever outwardly happy when we hang out, mostly just complains about her sorority sisters to me while I sit there and listen. 

This gets me wondering why I am in this relationship at this point in my life. I am 20 years old. In the prime of my life and sometimes I question if I am wasting it by being in this ""eh"" sort of relationship. I would marry this girl for sure but that is at least 10 years down the line (gotta get out of student loan debt first). But I just can't find a concrete reason to end the relationship besides the fact that I am just bored and not feeling happy with the relationship anymore. That in itself would be a real shitty way to end a relationship after a year and a half.

So I guess I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on this. People who dated someone all through school, did you have any regrets of not seeing other people in college? People who ended a relationship after over a year, were you able to keep friendships/ get back together with your partner?

Thanks",16Mar2018,2
47,"Last night I was trying to fall asleep and I would lay there for a minute or two before suddenly just getting this wave of terror that would cause me to sit up suddenly and take a big breath inward. This has never happened to me before. It was almost like the feeling you get when you turn a corner and someone suddenly jumps at you but there was nothing to provoke such a reaction so I don't know why it happened. It happened like 4 or 5 more times when I tried to just lay down again and ignore it, finally it just stopped and I was able to fall asleep. Has anyone else ever had this happen or know why something like this would happen?",16Mar2018,1
48,"By young, I mean teens through late 20s.

It's really weird to think about. I remember being 14 and thinking that the mid-20s girls in movies were older than I'd ever actually want.

Then I remember reaching my early 20s, and pretty much *every* girl presented in moves/shows/porn/etc. was attractive to me. Within the range I wanted, and beautiful.

As I approach my 40s it's...I don't know.

I've had plenty of relationships throughout my life. I've loved, and been loved. There's certainly media that caters to older peoples' romantic needs, but it's in the minority. For the longest time, I thought that it was *just* because younger people are more attractive.

And that's certainly a piece of it. But it's not the whole story. Younger people are more valuable to advertisers. There's the whole concept of ""the demo[graphic]"". And soon I won't be a part of it.

I don't know. It's weird. As I age, I realize that the only people who ""matter"" to society at large are those with power. I'm just a regular person, so as I age the only people who I matter to are those directly in my life. Strangers don't pay me one whit of respect.

It's a little depressing. I think I need to start a family. I dunno.",16Mar2018,6
