0,"can't for the life of me find anything appealing in the life i'm living now. i wanted to study hard to get into Oxford university but after overcoming the naivety of that ambition, what with finding out it's implicitly impossible with my GCSE grades and the fact I'm retaking year 12. So my A*'s have turned to don't actually give a fuck. I started lifting and i'm 1.5 years in. I have no interest in that now. I eat like shit and am ~50% consistent and I have very little conscience about it. My social life is embarrassing, since all my friends are 16-17 while I am 18, since I'm retaking the school year. They're all into pot and parties, I'm past that and wanted that Oxford goal.

3,"My partner is visiting family overseas and while she was out with them her drink was spiked and she woke up in a strangers house with no idea where she was but she was in pain and thinks she was raped.

I feel so angry that I wasn't there to protect her. Even more angry at her family for being with her and seeing her walk out with someone who claimed to be a friend despite being half a world away in a foreign place. I'm so angry that someone would do this to her and I don't know how to deal with this anger. I feel helpless to do anything right now. 

She has told me what happened and that she doesn't want to take it to the police or even tell the family she was with that night. I respect her decision to try and move on but I don't know if it's the right thing to do. Has anyone been through a similar situation? How did you support the person affected? ",01Jan2018,16
5,"It’s been almost a month since we broke up. I can say this with the utmost confidence and conviction: I’m okay. And I’m going to be okay. Upon a lot of time to reflect and process my thoughts, it became clear to me that this relationship was doomed to fail. No matter what I could do to stop it, it was always doomed to fail. 

We are objectively two different people. The things both of us want in life are completely different. I can finally agree with myself that it’s okay. It was the best time of my life, and the two years we spent together, I wouldn’t trade a second of it. 

It’s over, it’s done, and I can finally move on. I’ve been awaiting this day since December 3rd. I’m glad we had our time together, but it’s in the past. It taught me a lot about myself and what I need to look for in future relationships. With that in mind, I won’t deny that I still get sad about this. I do. It’s human. But it doesn’t control me anymore. 

Thank you for the time we spent together, T. Sincerely, thank you.",01Jan2018,0

We have gotten much busier through the years in college, most of us are engineering or pre-med. But now we meet up and people start pre-gaming and then go bar hopping. We used to go to restaurants, watch movies, etc... now it's just bar hopping. I rarely ever drink and if I do, it's one or two, so I just feel awkward. I know that's what people expect out of 21 year olds, but it really isn't that fun for people like me.

17,"I've never posted so this is a first. I have tried to find happiness myself and keep falling back.

I own a multi million dollar company and make more than any 21 year old ever should, I thought that would help things but I am still extremely lonely and sad. I never believed people when they said money didn't help, but I now realize it doesn't do shit.

I am a drug addict and alcoholic, I continually relapse because I can barely be alone with myself. If I'm not working or with people I start going insane, reminiscing of happier times and when things were better.

I keep going back to my ex who abuses me. She plays with my emotions but she is there for me when I hit bottom. She drinks far too much and makes horrible decisions when she is drunk which is why I left. However she spent the night last night, why can't I say no.

I just moved into my own SF apartment and now I'm more lonely than ever. I need to not drink/use drugs because I am a heroin addict, so bars are out of the question. I'm hitting a point where I do nothing but work and wallow in my own sadness which is pathetic. I plan to join some meetups but idk what to do here. Even when I do that I am still unhappy.

I am on lexapro, suboxone, gabapentin.... got off of buspar. I am pretty fucked up in the head. I'm a very smart guy and been told very attractive but that doesn't help me. I still hate myself and would really appreciate any tips because I can't think myself out of this situation like I can other things.

Thank you.

18,"Today, New Year's Eve, was my birthday. I'm 22 now. Last year in December I made a post here about some goals I had asking for some advice. I wanted to get my license this year and finally get my first job. I also had plans to lose weight. These are goals I've had for a long time. 

I had a little progress this year around the summer. I was trying to drive more and feeling a little better. I also lost almost 20 pounds through diet and exercise. (I have around 100 to lose). But then I kinda just stopped these things, I started feeling bad. I haven't been driving in probably four months. I stopped exercising and counting my calories. I gained back all the weight I lost and probably 3-5 more pounds. 

I've just been feeling bad. This year wasn't my worst year ever, but it definitely wasn't a good year. I feel like I just threw it away. I didn't make any progress from the previous year. I read a post on reddit that asked something like, ""if you had died/killed yourself (can't remember which) last year what is something you would have missed in this year?"" I tried to think of something, and it was hard to think of anything that great that happened or that I did. I just felt sad that it's hard for me to answer that question. 

I keep thinking about how when I was younger I couldn't wait to grow up. I imagined all these possibilities for my life. I was so hopeful. Now I feel like there's nothing for me. I don't know how to fix my life. I don't believe I'll ever just be okay. I don't have any friends or an SO. If my younger self knew she would grow up and be like this I know how disappointed she would be. I'm disappointed in myself. I thought when I grew up I would ""just do"" things like everyone else does. Like driving and getting a job. It'd just happen, because that's how it goes. Well, I've learned I can't just be like most people. 

I wish I could end this and say something hopeful or inspiring. But I'm just not hopeful anymore. I don't know how to turn my life around. ",01Jan2018,1

During this year, I have met a lot of people as a sophomore in university. Some are great—they truly value me for who I am and actively want to create and build a relationship. Others are not so great—those who still judge the book by its cover and always think about themselves rather than the two of us. 

Unfortunately for me, the not-so-great people have come in the form of romantic relationships, it has definitely made me realize that some people are way too caught up about themselves and can never imagine the greater picture—regardless of my thoughtfulness or interest. While it’s completely acceptable that they might not like me back, their decision process and way of handling the situation is truly mind boggling, and has really hurt me emotionally and mentally as it simply does not make sense. It’s sad to see they carry their life that way, and all I can say to them is, “sayonara, good luck.” 

(I’m looking at you, girl who constantly ghosted me, and guy, who never offered to help with our semester project).

But for the other great people, I am blessed to cross paths with them. I have learned that age, gender, race, and background should never prevent you from saying, “Hey, how are you today? Do anything fun? Want to hang out sometime?” For us who can look past those stereotypical social blockades, look back on the great relationships we have made. Once you break through that initial barrier with someone, it is truly awesome to figure out what makes them tick. 

Everything happens for a reason, and it’s important to live it to the fullest. Don’t cut people out and don’t be so self-minded. Some people work really hard to gain your interest and brushing them away like nothing is the worst thing you could do—and ultimately that happens way to much.

I fell deeper into a state of isolation of my own construction along with the breakup and chronic depression and overall deemed it the worst year of my life. So tonight I was thinking about 2017. It wasn't worse than 2016 but it started with early months of suicidal thoughts and a near attempt at taking my own life. As the year progressed I felt more like my old self, dare I say happy around July. I entered into my last year of college and now I'm in a relationship with a girl who objectively speaking is much better for me than the one from 2016. 2017 was a good year, off to a rough start but I'd do it again.

36,"I've always been athletic. I've always been career-oriented and desired to be financially independent. I've always wanted to be seen as intelligent and tough. I have always had a high sex drive.

Now, as a woman in the modern age, I can and have done all those things to the best of my ability.

But- I'll most likely never be able to go up against the average Joe on the street athletically. Average Jane, sure, but not Joe. He barely even needs to exercise to take me on. And I can't train on the first day of my period without a double dose of ibuprofen. 

Being intelligent and self-sufficient is great and all, but it makes me ""intimidating?"" ""Bitchy?"" Heaven forbid I act the same way men do. I'm going to keep doing it. It's just exhausting having to defend my right to do so all the time.

I love sex. LOVE it. But I might get pregnant- which I have to think about every time I have sex. I might get another of my recurring UTIs- my body's personal slut-shaming device.

I spend most of my life trying to figure out if I was trans. After all, the one thing women can do that men can't, have babies, has never had any appeal. Oh, I want kids, I realized. I just don't want to shove them out of my vagina. So, what's the point if I don't want to do that?

But I don't want to be a man, per se. I just hate being a woman. It's something I want to come to terms with this year.

I wanted to post my resolutions somewhere. Maybe if you (yes, you!) see them, I'll feel more pressure to hold strong!

1. No cookies, cake, candy, or ice cream. 

2. No porn.

3. Stop biting nails.

4. Learn how to cook one new meal a month.

5. Make one video a month.

6. Never go two days without working out.

7. No dating apps.

8. Be a better family member and friend (call parents more, listen more in conversations, do favors for others).

46,"It’s the New Year.  2018.  Yay.

A lot of you are probably waking up with bloodshot eyes, a screaming migraine, and smelling like something that died in the back of McDonalds whilst reminiscing over 2017.  Maybe you gained an unwanted 15lbs?  Bought a new fill in the blank you couldn’t afford?  Stayed in the same shitty relationship because of fill in the blank with another shitty excuse.  Picked up an unhealthy addiction to strippers, coke, and tiger blood?  Hey, it worked for Charlie...

So, what to do?

Oh, I know!  Make a New Year’s Resolution!

What’s that you say?  It’s the New Year.  #NewYearNewMe or whatever other #basicasfuck #hashtaggable #colloquialism you can come up with.  Fuck that. #sorrynotsorry  Not to squash your #PSL dreams, but yoga pants, UGGs, man-buns, corgi’s, and your penchant for procrastinating via New Year’s Resolutions aren’t going to change shit and your Instagram feed won’t save you.  But you know what’s really trending?  Getting your shit together.   

The best time to start making a change was yesterday.  The second best time is NOW.  Creating a New Year’s Resolution is the same as waiting for a later time to take action on something that needs to be addressed now.  It may sound like, “I’m starting a diet on Monday to shed these 5lbs,” or, “I’m waiting till next week to call the credit card company.”  No.  Do that shit now. 

When you are genuinely serious about completing a task, you do it now.  If you desperately need to take a shit, do you postpone your poop till the following Wednesday?  No, you run to the john and bust-a-move on the thunder throne.  How about we apply that same crap-your-pants urgency to life? 

Are you with me on this?  Good.

You’ll need five things:

·        A pen.

·        Some paper.

·        A mouth to tell others.

·        The I’m-beyond-tired-of-the-stench-of-my-own-shit state of mind.

·        The willingness to make a change.

Whatever you would like to course correct, write it down.  Shit, write it down several times. 

Why are you still reading?  Write it down. Now.

Good.

Now, post that shit around your house, at the office, on street signs, your neighbor’s annoying-ass kid’s forehead, wherever you’ll see it.  Make it so mentally pervasive you can’t escape it (you know, like the opinions or your in-laws you can’t seem to shake).  Writing your new found purpose down and posting it in your line of sight will serve as a visual reminder to constantly engage the brain.  This will reinforce new thought patterns giving you the continual tap-on-shoulder to make the right choice.

Yeah, you’re still reading, but didn’t post it did you?  Do you notice a trend here?  Go put that piece of paper somewhere you’ll see it.

Tell a friend.  Tell lots of friends.  Tell co-workers, family, neighbors, and strangers; whoever will listen.  And don’t tell them you made a New Year’s Resolution.  They’ll know you’re full of shit, because that’s what New Year’s Resolutions are.  Instead, explain to them that you’ve been thinking about fill in the blank for a while and it’s been weighing on you.  You’ve decided to take these steps to make a positive change because you can’t live like you have anymore.  If they care for you, they’ll buy in and BAM! You’ve got a support network to stand by you. 

 

And remember, you have us, too.  We’re in it together.

It was...unbelievably good to me, expecially after the tragic 2016.
My nerd self finally can play on a system that doesn't come from 2006 (Got a new laptop, a New Nintendo 2DS and a Nintendo Switch) and I'm just SO grateful. 
Finally, my social life began. I used to be one of those ""ew the world"" teenagers until a few years ago, then high school began and was thrown into ""Ha! Say goodbye to everyone and everything you know."" and, again, just grateful it happened. I get to have friends, I get to actually go out and do stuff instead of looking at a screen 24/7. Lastly, I finally managed to get myself into a relationship, which is something I HIGLY needed since I always felt a lack of ""affection"" on a social level.

Though, it may (or may not?) seem like small stuff, I am just very happy and grateful, I wouldn't thrown 2017 away and I welcome 2018 with open arms.
