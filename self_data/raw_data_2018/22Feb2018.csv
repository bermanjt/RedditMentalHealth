0,"I live less than 30 minutes between Stoneman Douglas Highschool and the Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport. You fine folks know of the school from last week... You know of the airport from last year. As to place another shooting that happened in my state... You should also know of the Orlando nightclub shooting the year before that as well. 

Obviously there are loads of more shootings I can place but I'll name the ones within proximity to me for the sake of my reasoning of typing this all up.

My question is if people in our government knew about these guys being mentally unstable and did nothing why don't we go after them instead of blaming a tool? The government has failed my state and its people multiple times when it came to preventing these poor bastards from doing what they did. The tool used isn't truly responsible for what it did. In my opinion the government is just as responsible (if not more since they where told of them) for these deaths as is the shooter.

The mentally unhinged person doing the killings is a lost soul who was failed. If our countries healthcare was modernized by it being collected from our taxes, mental health not stigmatized, and not make someone go into insane amounts of debt then I get the feeling that these shootings would have never happened. No one in their right mind decides to shoot and kill unarmed innocents. A mentally sound individual would not seek blood but someone who has a few screws that need to be tighten might. Let's face it: our healthcare is one of the best in the world but the way it's set up it's a constant gamble and a 1 way ticket to heavy financial burden! If our health care was done in like a rational way then a win win situation would be that we'd all be healthier for it. But as it stands it's like picking straws and the smallest straw drawn does you in 4 ways to Sunday!

I'll keep this section short. The government dropped the ball... Again! Like with the other 2 mentioned the government was well warned in advance about these folks. Every agency involved with firearms, firearm purchases and potentially dangerous people have failed us once again. I can't say I'm angry anymore at this lack of oversight... All I can say is I'm disappointed. If I can't trust the government to stop these types of people from purchasing firearms then what the hell do I do? 

 I am very pro gun BUT I'll support any method to help curb the sales of firearms of potentially dangerous people. I'm also for universal healthcare so we all can become healthier together... My honest opinion is if you take care of the mental aspect of people then these shootings shouldn't happen at all. Or the number of them should drop off considerably to the point where mass shootings are extremely rare.

 If you look at all the shooters of recent years they all had 1 thing in common: they where mentally unstable. Help the unstable become stable and watch these mass shootings drop off so suddenly you would think you've woken up from a nightmare.",22Feb2018,1
1,"We were always kind to each other. That is something for which I am exceedingly grateful.

I need to remind myself to be thankful for things. I never took a day I spent with you for granted and in some ways, that makes this so much harder. 

So I sit here, trying to numb myself in various ways to any sensation that might remind myself of you and failing miserably.

I tell myself that you're better off without me. Happier, more stable - closer to God. 

Some days I almost believe it.

I miss hearing your voice linds. 

p.s.  I didn't reach out on your birthday because I didn't want to be selfish.  I just wanted you to enjoy your day. 25 years old - and I am *so* proud of you. You're beautiful, smart, and an all-around incredible person. I didn't forget. I hope you know that.

love always,

2,"If you don't want to spend the next 5 minutes shaking your head and cursing at your screen at some pathetic ungrateful human being you've never met, you should probably stop reading this post now. That's the beauty of choice. If you don't like what you're listening to on the radio, watching on television, or reading in the paper (or in this case, the Internet), you have the ability to pivot and freely consume more personally acceptable content.

There's a lot of culturally divisive events going on in our country right now. Very, very, important events that can alter the course of our future. From our second amendment rights and the hashtag me too movement, to foreign affairs and our current white house administration, we are in the middle of a sea of news that can often times make us feel like we're drowning. It's overwhelming and difficult to maintain perspective; to navigate the firehose of media coverage and discern between what warrants a person's full attention and what can (and quite frankly, should) be ignored. 

But I'm not here to discuss matters of any meaningful importance. I'm here to whine like an ungrateful little bitch about how I'm not as wealthy as I once was and how it's, like, totally bumming me the fuck out RN. 

I began the workforce, like most everyone else, on the ground floor. After finishing college I caught a break and got my foot in the door of a company. From there, as most people do, I continued down my career path with promotions, new positions, and new jobs at new companies. I've been in the same industry for close to 30 years. In that time span I've continued to move up ""the ladder"" and slowly and methodically improve my quality of life. I've been ""adulting"" for a long time now and have been extremely fortunate. Now in my midlife... okay, let's be honest... DEEP in my midlife years, I finally achieved financial stability. I was making a respectable salary. I was investing (a very adulty thing to do), I was saving for retirement. I was saving for my child's college education, and (sans my mortgage) I don't have any debt and only purchase things I can buy in full, in cash, right at that moment. I've suffered from crippling debt in the past and it's not a place I ever want to return to. The best thing in my professional life was finally reaching a point where I was making a steady flow of disposable income to experience amazing vacations, stay at the best hotels, eat at the finest restaurants, fly private (because why commercial?), and afford to buy whatever ""stuff"" I wanted. But this is a relatively new occurrence in my life. I grew up dirt poor. And most of my adult life I struggled to make ends meet. I worked many long and hard years to get to this point and I was finally seeing the fruits of my labor. I was living the dream and I was happy.

But I'm old and am sadly aging out of the ""youthful"" industry that I was once the exact demographic it focused on. And after nearly two decades of loyal service, the company I always assumed I would retire at, forced me out. For the first time in a long time I had to find a new job. But (as I'm sure many of you will attest) jobs are hard to come by. Thankfully, it only took a couple months to land a new gig. But there was a downside and I had to take a severe and life altering 45% pay cut. In an instant, all the years of working my way up were dashed. In an instant, I was now making the same salary I was making in my late 20's. In an instant, I was no longer making enough to contribute to retirement, make substantial contributions to my child's college fund, expand my investment portfolio, and definitely no longer had any disposable income to buy ""stuff"". Every penny of my paycheck is now earmarked for essentials - mortgage, bills, and expenses. God forbid something unexpected rears its ugly head! OMG, I would have to use a credit card! /shutter. No, no, no! Anything but that!

""This is a good thing,"" my friends would tell me. ""Adversity builds character,"" others said. Many would remind me that ""everything happens for a reason."" One friend even told me I was ""making too much money anyways,"" and that ""money doesn't buy happiness."" These words of optimism are great and exactly what friends should say. And don't get me wrong, I appreciated the encouragement. It's what I needed to hear. But the truth is, I HAVE experienced adversity, I DID struggle with debt and financial instability for most of my adult life. I worked my ass off so I WOULDN'T have to worry about that sort of thing anymore. So I could provide a better quality of life for my family than I had. As far as ""money doesn't buy happiness"" goes, I agree... but it sure does help! If something in the house needed repair or replacement I didn't have to worry if I could afford it. If my child needed braces or glasses I didn't have to worry if I could afford it. I didn't have to scramble to figure out how to pay for anything. And I never had to stress about if there was enough money in the bank to pay for our monthly expenses or our mortgage. I was thankful that fighting about finances was something I no longer had to deal with anymore. For those of you out there that do struggle and argue every month about money, I get it. I've been there. And trust me, having that weight lifted brings... well... a sense of peace. One might even call it happiness!

A 45% pay cut is a lot. It doesn't matter how much a person makes. Ask anyone to sacrifice half of every single paycheck and I'm sure 100% a those polled would tell you to bugger off. I don't know what YOUR annual salary is, but imagine cutting that in half. Now imagine just how much it would effect your life. What adjustments would need to be implemented in order to make that work? What sacrifices big or small would you have to do to adapt? No more daily coffee in the morning. After all, that’s  $3 a day, $15 a week, $60 a month. That money could go towards your cable bill! But wait, maybe you'd need to cut that expense too! That would save you another couple hundred a month. How about your Netflix or Amazon Prime subscription? Would you drive less to save on gasoline and maintenance costs? Could you even continue to afford where you live? Would you have to downsize?

Yes, I am fully aware I'm acting like a whiny little bitch - which explains why I'm hiding behind the anonymity of reddit instead of posting this on my personal Facebook or LinkedIn. It's actually quite embarrassing. I should seriously just shut up and be thankful I have a job at all. I should be thankful for my health and the health of my family. I should be thankful I have a roof over my head. Instead, I'm jealous of the life I once had. I can't escape it. The Internet has a good couple years of analyzing my habits and now constantly targets ads that are no longer applicable to me. Here's an ad enticing me to stay at The Ritz Carlton or The Four Seasons during my next vacation. Here's one to charter a jet for my next weekend getaway. Another enticing me to consider Aston Martin for my next vehicle purchase. Every day I'm reminded of the person I once was. 

But whatever. I need to just suck it up and face facts. I'm an old man that's not particularly attractive to employers anymore. I can't demand the salary I once had, nor do I deserve it anymore. I had a good run. There are younger people out there that are hungrier, cheaper, and if I'm being honest, are probably more capable than I am. It's time for me to shut my face and just be happy for what I have. All good things come to an end. I just wish it didn't end so abruptly.

Now excuse me while I enjoy my microwaved Cup Noodle. ",22Feb2018,0

4,"And he never left! Here we are 5 apartments later, one dog, a couple cats and 3 kids. We are celebrating our decade milestone by taking everyone out for pasta tomorrow. 

A little back story -
I had moved to a new city and met him through work. Over the course of a year we had a few casual hangouts mostly with other friends. One day for I invited him over to my place for an after work beer as all our other friends were busy and it was our ""Friday"". We drank. We talked. We drank and we talked. Somewhere in there (maybe the beer got the best of us) he kissed me. With no previous romantic thoughts at all between us I think it shocked us both. We spent the rest of the night and into the next day talking about EVERYTHING. He moved in 3 days later and (so far) we have lived happily ever after.

Also, it was by a text message which just added insult to injury. What is even worse is that she was even more of a friend to me than a girlfriend if that makes sense. And right now I'm missing a friend.

Anyways, I kept as busy as could be by going out and doing at least something every night since then but this past Monday I was all alone in the office and allowed it all to catch up with me. Now, I'm barely eating, drinking a lot more than I should, watching movies like 500 Days of Summer and Her, and just not very happy.

10,"Hi, I'm new to this sub so sorry if bad formatting.

I'm currently in 9th grade at my high school. I have a ~96 average, take all honors and am advanced track for math. I take 3 main extracurriculars and am part of a few clubs as well as Vice President of the Student Council. I recently got a 33 on the ACT and 1440 on the 10/11 PSAT.

In my school, I'm planning to take about 5 AP courses by the end of junior year (physics and math related), and I know I will have enough credits to graduate by that time. I simply don't see the merit in staying in high school an extra year when most colleges don't ask for a senior transcript. I also feel that the extra year of extracurriculars won't make much of a difference seeing as I take so many already.

I'm planning to go to a STEM or medical college (not sure yet) but I'm going to UWM for undergraduate seeing as I'll probably get a full ride scholarship.

12,"Hey there,
There's a lot I have to say, and honestly I don't even know how to say it. 
First of all, don't criticize my spanglish, me expreso mil veces mejor cuando lo hago. 
Creo que debes saber varias cosas, como el fact de que no me aleje porque me estoy poniendo high o porque volví con alguien, I'm just a stupid girl who doesn't know how to mantener a alguien en su vida, me espanto cuando alguien demuestra que me quiere y me da pánico saber que en verdad existe alguna persona que esta dispuesta a dar amor por mi, no me cabe la idea de ser tan amada, al final termino creyendo que no es amor y que seguramente las personas querrán algo de mi, y me lastimaran. 
Mi objetivo jamás fue lastimarte y te debo una disculpa muy grande, y yo se que no merezco que la aceptes. No supe que hacer, estaba empezando a sentir way too much and my brain it just went crazy and I was like: no, wait, you're gonna hurt him, you always end up hurting the ones you love... Y pensé que alejarme sería lo mejor.
Eres de esas personas que quieres que nunca se vayan de tu vida, pero creo que yo no soy la persona indicada para eso, yo huyo de lo bonito, le corro al amor, te lo juro, lloré cuando supe que te irías sabiendo que no volvería a verte.
Tampoco me siento enough, I think I'm not enough for someone so incredible, caring, loving, handsome, I think I'm trash compared to you, and I just couldn't accept your love.
In my mind there was this thought, all the time, should I go with him? Should I move to mty and leave everything behind? O mean, I got nothing to lose, I could just start over again and be happy, but what if he doesn't like me, what if he yells at me, what if he gets mad at me, what if he realizes the shitty person I am, what am I gonna do all alone? 
I'm always overthinking, generating scenarios where the worse is about to happen.
When I say you arw the most amazing creature on earth I'm not lying, thank you for teaching me so many things, like I have an amazing potential, that I need to give myself some time to cultivate my mind, that I'm beautiful and someone can truly love me without hurting me.
Deja de usar tu psicología inversa que va a funcionar, espero algún día ver esa película con la única compañía que puede verse. No importa si son dos semanas, dos años u otra vida, yo esperare pacientemente a que ese momento suceda.
Estaría padre si me das tu dirección para mandarte tus cosas.

It looks hysterical on my frame and I'm shamed of it. I browsed r/normalnudes and hell even 4chan cock rate threads and most of the guys there are bigger than me and  have shit bodies. It's reached the point where I think destructive things like ""even if I do get a hot gf or get married she'd probably cheat on me for a bigger dick"". 

At this point I've convinced myself that any hot girl will either laugh, leave the room, and or tell her girlfriends about it.

14,"met this woman because I found her on an app. We talked and real reason she wanted to meet was to buy my xanax. I sold her some and we became friends.  this went on for couple years, we went on lunch dates, but that's about it. Made out but that's the furthest I got. She tells me she loves me but never shows it. Never meets me besides for lunch, can't go out at night because she lives with her parents. 

One time she needed more and was able to ""sneak out"" after 9 pm. But could never sneak out to go to movies or dinner. Never wanted to give me snapchat cause I could track her, but she knew she could disable it. Finally did and never updated stories, but was always busy. 

She said no to my date i tried to schedule, but when drunk posted sc stories. Then she didn't have money so she promised me to go to movies and dinner but never does.

I stop seeing her and get calls in the middle of the night crying and after a while we get lunch and no selling. Goes back to it after a while again and tells me how she met someone on tinder and was able to go out on a date at night with him. so i lost it and yelled at her and broke up again.

repeat, over and over.

I can't let her go and I no longer have xanax to sell her, but she still finds ways to manipulate me. 

I know what I need to do, block her and move on, but it's hard. I dont normally date let alone fall in love. She was the only person, in my life, that I ever had candies delivered to. that really shows how much I love her. My mom, sisters, and exgf never got that from me.

But the truth is, there has never been a better moment in history to achieve what you want in life. 

With so much opportunity, we have the choice to move forwards or backwards. It's up to us. 

The internet represents freedom. It enables our habits and behaviours. But that can be a good or a bad thing. 

If you want to consume mindless content for hours and ""wake up"" with tired eyes and a frantic mind, you can do that. 

But if you want to learn and develop as a person, you can do that too. 

The only thing that is stopping you... is *yourself*. 

Sure, you might have some self-defeating behaviours. You might have some psychological baggage. You might have a thousand responsibilities with barely any free time. Or you might have too much free time and just can't get yourself to fulfil it productively. 


But there's two things that make this the most fortunate time to be alive: 

- The *even distribution* of more **knowledge** than has ever existed 
- The **freedom** to be able to work towards what we want, if we *choose to* 

What are you feeding your mind on a daily basis? What are you doing with your time? You need to be aware of what you are currently doing. That is the first step.  

There is a gap between what you need to be doing to achieve what you want, and what you are doing currently. Every day is an opportunity to move the needle towards the direction of being better. 

We're often preoccupied with our normal life. We are so used to the day-to-day grind that we don't take what is around us, for what it really is. 

But imagine what a person from 100 years ago would think about the opportunities you have today. Just take a second and remember how lucky you are.

29,"she feels the magnetism of her yearning for you in every audible, conscious thought; through the nerves of her limbs; at the corners of her mouth because, truthfully, she's been smiling too long and too hard to notice the ache, but can still recognize the slight discomfort. The whole world needs to know and understand that she's found a human being in which to give herself. She imagines them as they are--wholly autonomous from herself--but still understands that in their separated autonomy, there exists an invisible pull always causing collision, reuniting, and love--always the most passionate love. 

But when an empath falls in love she doesn't always tell her lover. It's a fragile precipice to summit--the act of telling someone you've met within the last few weeks that--because you're the creature of more feeling than thinking and reasoning, you love them. It's a spoken devotion and, for the empath, means commitment. In her mind, committing to this person is simply, easy, and true but when there is the pressure of commitment; the pressure of fulfilling love as they see it--she hesitates. 

It takes only a moment for an empath to fall in love and there are worlds of great sweeping moments that would suck the air straight from your lungs. It could have only been the smile, or the glimmer of a smile, at a quaint thought that when she spoke it aloud, she was sure was going to result in rejection but, alas, it was accepted. And there's the moment. Or, perhaps, something a little bigger--a sign taken from nature that love is happening; that she is, in fact, valid in her thoughts. 

Yet, guilt accompanies the love of an empath because love can happen so suddenly and easily and abruptly that it tears through her reality but, too, comes the opposite of love--indifference. 

And so, how to justify the love of an empath? The love that occurs so violently and passionately within her self, her soul, and can take leave of its owner without permission. ",22Feb2018,3
30,"With someone whose voice I can't wait to hear again.       
I just hope I'm not crying in this very same bed because of this in the future. I really do. I want this to make me feel good more than it makes me feel bad.    
I'm very sensible (I have no idea why) and I'm sick. I am listening to the same song over and over. The first time I cried like I haven't cried in a long time. It was sadness. For a reason that... just wouldn't make sense if I explained it. But now I feel different. I even took a painkiller and I feel better. I might even be able to sleep! I couldn't sleep this morning because of the pain. 
My life has been a real feel trip lately. I just wanted to share these feelings with someone.",22Feb2018,7
32,"This friend I considered my best friend for most of these years, we went out together, took drugs together and it was non stop talking. 2 years ago I had a bad drug experience that turned my life upside down. He was there to help somewhat but after I while I was in psychosis. After some time I stopped confiding in him as much and reflected on all of my friendships. This particular one I realized that my perspective on things and my social/emotional intelligence had been very off. In fact, although we hung out a lot over the years we often didn't see each other for weeks or a month+ but I texted him almost daily and he did as well but I'm realizing now that he did so because I did.

Realizing this I felt so bad. So many memories of him confiding in me and me listening but not knowing the extent of which he was suffering. And the tables were turned. It was now me needing help yet also being shown my skewed perception all this time. After sort of getting back to hanging out again, I confided in him about a secret I kept for a couple of years. Something shameful and embarrassing and one I'd rather have kept with close friends. However i eventually came go realize from his other friend and being able to read situations better that he told his girlfriend. I eventually confronted to him about this but I said it's ok and I forgive him without really asking why he did it. 

many months now we have been quite distant, hanging out a few times going for drives and it's like the Dynamics have flipped. He talks non stop, mostly about weed and other drugs (which was normal in the past and I was the one leading it) and I'm quitting and I just can't talk about it anymore. He also doesn't seem to recognize when I'm feeling down now or thinks that I don't want to talk about it and after a few of these hang outs I actually don't anymore. I've lost trust with him and we're better off not being friends. But I can't help but feel like he's going to become bitter and not only tell secrets but spread lies making me out to be evil.

I have so much paranoia as it is and I can't deal with him doing that but I can't go on like this either. It truly seems like in his eyes we're fine. It's like he still sees me as the old me but I'm not. I've changed so much and he just can't accept it. A big part is my fault because I haven't shared how I feel but the few times that I have he seems to agree, make a basic point about it or rationalize things (just like I used to do). He messaged the other day about hanging out and that's just going to be us going for a drive while I have weed with him of which I don't even want. Maybe if I continue going out with him once in a while it'll be better that way? I don't want to feel like I'm being manipulating but I'm lost as to what to do. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.",22Feb2018,2

With the recent shooting i dont know why people would think this would be funny. I know its probably somebody messing around but at the same time theres always the possibility that someone has bad intentions and i dont wanna be in a school shooting and for some reason shootings have become very common.

39,"I have no idea where to fucking post this so here I am at r/self. Reading this you are probably like what...? I didn't know what to title it either. Let me start this off by saying I'm not waiting for it, its just an observation I pretty much realized just today. I have never heard my mom go take a shower/bath. I have heard my brother when he goes in the shower, I have heard my dad, and my sister. But never in my 14 short years of existence have I heard my mom take one. Its just so weird. So you may be thinking 'she probably just takes one while you're at school' Well nope. I'm home schooled. Ok so now you may be thinking 'she probably just takes one when you are sleeping' Well. On average I stay up later than her 4/7 days of the week. Its weird how on none of those days I have heard her. I'm not obsessed but my young vivid imagination goes crazy. What if she is actually a witch like in the Wizard of Oz and melts when water touches her?? She doesn't really drink it either. Just sips soda all day. And now that I'm thinking about it never goes in the pool either... I just think its crazy. Especially because she always says to my sister and I ""If I don't see it or hear it, it didn't happen""  I just needed to get this off my chest. What do you think? ",22Feb2018,3
41,"So I moved out a month ago and tried to pay on the spot and they said no I need to mail a money order because they are going to lock me out of the online payment system. They said they would mail the invoice to my new address. Three weeks go by and I'm wondering what is going on and why it's not here so I call and ask what's up and they say they mailed it to my old address.

So i tell them I moved out, literally gave them the keys to the mailbox and they still put it there. They said they will mail it to my right address and email which they still haven't done. .

What's up with this? ",22Feb2018,2
42,I can’t even begin to describe how sad and stressed I am. There are  too many factors to even begin describing or even to start thinking about without having a panic attack. Please help me. Am I just stressed? Do I have anxiety? I went to my doctor to discuss anxiety and he told me that it just seemed like I have a bunch of phobias. I guess I wasn’t able to describe the way I feel in a way that he understood. He just told me that when it starts affecting my life to contact him. I tried to tell him it was affecting my life but I don’t think he understood. I don’t know what to do about anything ,22Feb2018,3
44,"As someone who speaks only English I feel like I don't appreciate enough the amount of people around the world that speak it as a second language. I was just watching a video of two people playing starcraft, one from Hungary the other from the Netherlands, and they were conversing with each other in English. I think I take it for granted sometimes how easy I have it only really needing to know English as my first language whereas the majority of people I have met from other countries have also learned it. Mental. Props to them.",22Feb2018,384
46,"So this is how the story went
I met someone by accident
That blew me away
That blew me away

It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away

And I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

You dropped me off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of my head
You watched me wave
Watched me wave
Then you went on home to your skyscrapers
Neon lights and waiting papers
That you call home
You call it home

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappeared one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away

I woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain
The morning rein
And although I wished that you were near
That same old road that brought me here
Is calling me home
Is calling me home

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappeared one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
And I could spend my whole life hiding my heart away
