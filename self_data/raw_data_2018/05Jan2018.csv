3,"Hey guys, so I'm curious if this sounds legitimate or not, or if you've ever heard of something like this?

A gig I found on Craigslist goes like this. This guy claims he works for a marketing company in Vegas that does research on promotional materials from local casinos.

I'm supposed to go to these three local casinos and sign up for players cards at each casino. Once I'm done, I give the cards to this guy from Craigslist and I get $75 cash in return. 

Im in the Miami area if it makes a difference. This is bringing up red flags in my head, but I don't know how this could be a scam. Anyone heard of this before? Sounds like easy money to me, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm going to get murdered or something. 

Thanks for the help guys",05Jan2018,1

6,"So, my best friend (let’s call him John) and I are approaching the ends of our high school careers. We both come from similar backgrounds and have similar interests, so we meshed pretty well. One of those interests has always been video games. We would play together all the time and have tons of fun. That was up until around June of 2016, when it was revealed that he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant.

Since then, I’ve been keeping a distance from him and talking to him maybe once a week (if that). I sold my PlayStation in April 2017 and I’ve been working to get my act together in preparation for life after high school. Meanwhile, his child was born in November of 2016 as he continued to play video games. He still does to this day, and he won’t go out and get a job to support his girlfriend and child. I was angered, horrified, and deeply saddened when I realized his girlfriend has been selling herself to a sugar daddy in order to make money. John is **somehow okay** with this.

I’ve pretty much given up on this guy. He’s never going to get the wake-up call that he needs because his dad is living and working in Texas as CEO of a construction company; his dad sends him money every month and sent him a brand new PS4 during Christmas. At this point I’m more worried about his girlfriend’s health and the potential future of their child. A couple of friends of both him and I have gotten together and discussed actually going over to his girlfriend’s dad’s house (where they live) and staging an intervention, as well as possibly taking his PS3 and PS4 until he gets a job. I know that sounds drastic but we’re all extremely worried about him and his family.

(Just to clarify, yes his dad sends him money but it’s usually between $100 to $200 a month and they can’t afford to live off of it, which is why his girlfriend does what she does.)",05Jan2018,0

They generally complain about 'womanly' things and how woman aren't worthy as men, they're too emotional and men are technical, 'men built society', things like that. So, if they endorsed and helped trans people in society, and accepted homosexuality, they could have normal PIV sex with trans men, maybe even impregnate them if they wanted. The world would get more manly and womanly, but sex segregated, because people would think more about which sex they belong since there will be a different type of sexism, even though it seems counter-intuitive.",05Jan2018,0

14,"I realized that It isn't that time goes by too fast. It's that longer periods of time have lessening value. 

A year is no longer 1/2 or 1/3 of my entire life, and a month can easily be redone now. I'm resilient to hunger and discomfort. 

There aren't a million things around me that are yet to be explored, my perspective and social experience have been developed, thus there is less to do, then when I find something to do I only anticipate having to live through the next day. I've gotten adjusted to time, I have awareness that movies only last two hours, songs only last a couple minutes, certain tasks now take longer than ever because I'm lugging around a big body force. Months are only 30 days, weeks are only 7, and days are only ~18 hours awake. I've lived through millions of hours and an extraordinary amount of days. A year is only a small fraction of my life, I've had many of them and I'm aware of how many more I'll have. 

There are less spontaneous priorities. As an adult, the largest events in the past many many years have been my children, process of my marriage, high school graduation, doing nursing for years then staying home as a mom, and a couple new homes. I get up for the same reasons everyday and have ideas; it isn't as if I'm improvising, slowly treading my way through with no idea what my true purpose is or what things are or why things exist. I have solid plans and a steadier control of how my days and weeks will end. I have a confident notion, an identity of some sort, an understanding of reality and desensitization/common knowledge to things that used to amuse the fuck out of me. 
It's not like I learned to take my first step yesterday and will be amused by walking for an entire 1/3 of what's been my life so far, not like I discovered an entire new color or shape two days in a row last week , discovered one of many appendages on my own body throughout my recent life, felt a new sensation in my mouth never having knew that bananas existed, and as if I was thrust into an alien world 100 billion times my size and have more to see. I've seen what I've needed to, and now it's easy to get caught up in a repeat. No more waiting and watching and learning, I simply dive into what I need to do or head straight for what I want. I see kids living slow lives everyday and only enhances my awareness of how short a moment actually is and of how much much knowledge I no longer need to fulfill.

Not like I'm curious and dependent anymore, I've developed self awareness, time awareness, existential and individual awareness, authority awareness, environmental awareness. 

Time doesn't go by fast. Small pieces of time just has less value and any big change happens over a period of time and we don't make crucial discoveries every few minutes everyday anymore. So us humans learn to live in periods of days or weeks rather than seconds or moments. ",05Jan2018,29

I wish I could say I’m angry. I am angry. But I wish I could say it. I wish you would listen to me say anything like you used to. I would record audiobooks for you. Anything. *would’ve recorded. It becomes conditional without the opportunity to do so. 

I got the job. Exactly what I wanted. Woo. I have to keep it secret, but a few people know. So all day I had to pretend to be secretly happy. And that’s on top of my already pretend happy work demeanor. 
I should’ve been an actor. No one suspected that I’m double secretly crushed under her foot. She’d like that though. The woman likes foot crushing. I don’t judge. 

I can’t sleep. I have the opportunity to make a lot of really dumb mistakes tonight and really don’t know what I’ll do. I made a joke about using cocaine to my dad at dinner. (I never have.) If I joke about it again, he’s going to cross the line to extremely worried. I wish I could say I’m not tempted. (Disclaimer: of course I won’t be anywhere that will have illegal drugs. That’s not somewhere a guy like me would be.)

I need to stop saying I wish. There is no Genie. Robin Williams died. He was miserable and the funniest man on the planet. What chance do I have? He’d probably tell me not to make the mistakes he made. Or maybe not because he’s dead and can’t tell me anything. Maybe he’d pull out his classic Good Will Hunting “it’s not your fault” and I’d weep in his arms. Note to self: try to lucid dream that. 

My ex-girlfriend thinks I need to grieve for the childhood I never had. The narcissist father that technically provides but cannot feel or understand. The co-dependent control freak mother. The alcoholic control freak stepfather that my mother enables and battles, often in the same breath. 

My ex also thinks I keep secrets as a stand-in for boundaries. (She’s 100% right there.) I kept the fact that I fell in love with a woman I never met a secret. That one goes in the never reveal under penalty of death pile. 

How can I not yet be tired of complimenting this fucking woman that wants nothing to do with me? I want to yell at her. Get angry. I’m not like the others, you fucking bitch. I’m not like anyone else. There I go comparing myself to others when I’m the problem. 

Yeah, I called her a bitch. She loved that. And the anger, while real, would be because she’d like that too. Hard to not tailor things to what she liked. So I get to sit here reminded every 4 seconds that she’ll never fucking ever talk to me again. That I could’ve been better and I’d hear her voice again. I could’ve chilled the fuck out and been her friend for life. I got so fucking weird. I hate myself for that. Another first. 

I don’t know whether to scream or cry. My face is wet, so maybe it’s one more thing that’s not my choice. 

I want so much to find it within myself to keep the elephants. I guess we all have our self-harm. They felt so fucking special. Fuck me, the notebook too.

Today is Friday and he's coming to pick up the dog on Sunday, which means I only have 2 nights left with her. 

I've been a cat guy all my life and previously owned a cat for 13 years until his death by old age. This is my first time caring for a dog and I love it. The way they greet you when you come home from work or help you wake up in the mornings is priceless. Getting woken up at 3am isn't ideal, but my cat sometimes did the same shit anyways. 

I was heartbroken to find out recently that my dad decided that he may not necessarily be able to adopt this dog due to his busy work schedule which has him traveling around very often. His decision is still up in the air, but I'm obviously hoping he'll be able to adopt her. 

If not, I'm assuming the dog will be sent to a shelter soon after she leaves my care. I'm having an incredibly difficult time dealing with this thought.

I’m pretty shy and I hardly ever even try go out and when I do I never get with any girls. Anyway, this girl who I’ve known for many years and all snapchats me to ask what I’m up to, it’s strange because she never really snapchats me. We don’t talk too much. She asks if she can come over, so I’m like ahh I’ll check with the guys. They like her so they are like yeah sure. Then she says she’s bringing this guy and her friend.

Well here we are 11:50 on New Years, I’m like running down the street to make it to the pub my mates are at but I’m like no I can’t leave her like this by herself (a lot of bad people out on New Years where we are) so I stay with her in the hope we make it there together safely. Well, as we run. She is like calling out for him to hurry up. We started talking about what a piece of shit he is and how he plays all the girls. He’s a complete fuck wit. Then as she waits for him I just go off to find my friends and she’s calling him to hurry up. Well as I reach the street of pubs I hear the countdown, can’t find my mates but as I turn around I just see the two of them, he comes up and grabs her, she pulls him in close and they just hook up right there 30m up the street before my eyes as everyone calls out happy new year. From the point, I knew who I had to be and what I had to do this year. It makes it hard to trust people. Why would she say such shit about him and then just take him in? She isn’t a slut. She deserves better and I deserve better. I walked 16km home smoking a cigar wondering what the fuck I saw. That’s my New Years. I don’t know why I feel cut, like I’m not like crushing hard on her.

When I got down there I seen something strange a head on the path, there looked like there was something reflective on the path, once I got closer I realised it was a big puddle covering the path, stretching 15 metres and a couple of inches deep.

I've been inside my own head for the past two years, thinking of all the mistakes that happened. I find it's affecting my current relationships, and dating has been difficult for me. I use to feel optimistic about life, but lately I've felt a dark cloud over me. I find myself engaging in toxic relationships, and having casual sex even though it's something I don't really want. It brings me momentary satisfaction, but in the long run it makes me feel alone and empty.

Every guy I've met seems emotionally unavailable. Either they just got out of a relationship, or aren't looking for anything serious.

I don't have any feelings for my ex, but maybe the situation I went through with him still has an affect on me? He was an alcoholic, abused prescription pills, and was verbally abusive to me. I noticed when I watch tv shows that involve addiction I get a little bothered by it. Mainly when I'm under the influence esp with marijuana.

33,"Yes, I have asked this on another sub but I want more answers.

Let me cut to the chase. I (20 F) took my friend out to get her (19 F) head shaved. The reason why is that she wanted to get her head shaved for years now. She has a brain condition and when she gets surgery, the doctor will shave a part off her hair anyways. Also, a grandma recently passed from cancer and she wanted to commemorate her. She was tired of her hair. I mean, it’s her hair and life, right? Why not just shave it off?

When we came back home from the shave, her mother screamed at both of us. I’m not mad at her mother at all. She did not want her daughter to shave her head because she figured it was self destructive. Her mother yelled at me for “encouraging” her daughter and that I should have never took her hand to get her head shaved. She also said she felt like a bad mother because her daughter continuously rebelled against her. I felt like shit and felt incredibly guilty afterwards because she was grieving too. She screamed at how I was being a bad influence to her daughter and that her daughter always disobeys and never listens. I felt awful because the grandmother passed just...days ago. I just wanted to be there for my friend.

we do not do drugs, we do not drink. Part of me feels as if her mother overreacted but I also feel now as if I am an enabler and I didn’t “support” my friend fully. She got in trouble cause of me. I’ve asked her many times if she really wanted to shave her hair and she did not budge. She also knew her mother would be angry. She is my dear friend and I always want to be there for her. But I also get why her mother would be so upset with her and me. My friend shrugged it off and just let things be. But I just couldn’t stop feeling so horrible and I should have stopped her from shaving her head. My friend does love her mother. And I know her mother does love her too and is just concerned. I just feel so shit right now. I didn’t want my friend to get in trouble.

And please, I don't want anyone attacking the mother or of the sort. She isn't abusive or anything. I just felt disgusting and horrible for getting my friend into trouble and hurting the mother too. I'm conflicted and am questioning if I am a good friend or not. A friend shouldn't get a friend in trouble but I did and I regret it. Maybe we should have waited because her grandmother passed like two days before we went to get her head shaved. I feel awful for not stopping her. I have spoken to her before about what would happen and all but I couldn't exactly parent her either.

I want the honest truth. I feel like the worse friend ever. I couldn’t stay long in the house because I felt so guilty. I apologized to the mother but it's obvious that she fucking hates me.

Now I understand with the Son-in-law he got the expensive gift because the daughter had been very ill recently and he was really good with looking after and supporting her.

&gt; It does matter. Big dicks can reach locations smaller dicks can't, make certain positions in sex easier, and are socially adored. Women who post on this subreddit saying size doesn't matter at all are either a minority or are lying because they know they will get heavily downvoted if they tell the truth. 
&gt; 
&gt; That does **not** mean that having sex with a smaller dick can't be pleasurable or someone with a small dick can't have a good sex life. But there are things we can't make a woman feel, a stretching feeling we'll never be able to emulate, and we have to try a lot harder to find sex because of how many people laugh at us. Having a small dick carries with it both enormous social shame and the knowledge that, while a woman may consider you her ideal in every way, many will leave you solely because of something you're born with and can never change.

I had another  internet friend but she only called me stupid, bitch, and she said I don’t deserve to live I „broke up” with her after 3 years begin friends.
I really have good relationships with one of physiotherapist from camp. He is always there for me and I am there for him. We can laugh and cry with each other,we often disscus wirth each other on camp and we have some smiliar hobbies. I am not in love with him. Isn’t that werid?

What about my love life? I never been kissed, I never been on date I never had sex. I never been confessed I should be depressed about that, but I think I will be happier with begin single. It’s something wrong with that but I can’t change the way I think even I tried  to do it many times.
I had two crushes. 
Frist on my high school teacher, second on my physiotherapist  form camp .( but not  in one that I talked about  before). They are both males.
and there were sometihing werid about my love for them I never wanted to go with the. on dates, I never want wanted to kiss them or having sex with them. I just wanted to talk with them and sometimes hug… I never was sad cause I .can’t be with them

I never wanted and I don’t want to have sex with anyone. I  don’t understand why people like that very much. Naked bodies of both sexes never makes me wantss sex. I don’t masturbate ethier.

My educiaton is my worst factor. I never liked to study. I only liked english. After gratulation from high school I stayed home cause I didin’t pass my high school exam, but I tried to pass it about 4 times. I still live with my parents and siblings.
I was on some kind of centre wheere disabled  people learn how to look after themselfs, but I left that „school” few days ago cause  I find it not practical and one of teachers was mean for me.
What about my looks? Outside internet  people say nothing about my look, on internet they say  I’m ugly, and I have masculine face or I look average.
I’m bit overweight but when I start walk even more often and eat less junk food it gets  bit better, I still work for good shape. I look a bit younger than I am but I think that good point
My style has both tomboyish and girlish vibe. I never use make up. I often wear braids or pigtails, I like to wear loose t-shirts, hoodies and comfy pants and sneakers :)

I spend mostly of my free time on internet. I’m into japanese popculture ( Idol jpop, jmovies, anime, manga) and I like creepy mysterous films on youtube for example „Kraina Grzybów” („Mushroom land”) or „Magiczny Świat Ani” ( „Magical world of Annie” 
I like that  „mysterous, creppy things + 90’s in Poland” theme

How would rate me life?

Sorry for mistakes, I’m not english native speaker, anyway feel free to correct me

46,"My gf and I were flying out of Seattle last Friday. While waiting at the gate we found that the plane would be slightly delayed (half an hour maybe). 

A middle aged woman at our gate became upset at this because (from what I overheard) she thought that this meant she would miss her connecting flight. She started arguing with the gate agent, it got heated, she started throwing papers, pens, and whatever was on the gate desk. At that point the gate agent said that because she had gotten physical he would have to call security. The woman responded with a string of obscenities at the top of her lungs that ended with ""you fucking faggot!""

After that a college age black woman with her hair in dreads who had been sitting near us sprung up and went straight for the middle age woman at the gate and it's a little fuzzy now but the exchange went a but like this: 

College aged: ""You cannot call him that!""

Middle aged: ""I call him what I want!""

CA: ""You cannot use language like that!""""

MA: ""I say wha I want!""

back &amp; forth 3-5 times

CA: ""That is language that has to go! It's gross and intolerance is not OK. We cannot use bigoted words like that!""

And then ... everybody clapped.

That applause was one of more surreal moments of my life. All I could think during it was a loop of "" This doesn't happen ... but it's happening ... but it doesn't happen ... but it's happening ...""

Well anyways, it was weird enough that I had to share it. And I guess that at least one recent ""everybody clapped"" post on some blog somewhere is actually real.",05Jan2018,36
47,"My husband got a warehouse worker job a few years ago.  
The plant operations director had a warehouse manager who had a coordinator who was supervisor over the warehouse workers.
The plant operations director didn't like him despite having NEVER ONCE talked to him.
The first warehouse manager, his first boss, who worked directly under the plant operations director, treated him badly and she was fired for stealing.  Her coordinator treated him badly as well.  
When the warehouse manager was fired the coordinator moved up to the warehouse manager position.  
She chose a girl who was not very intelligent as coordinator.
They treated him badly despite the fact that all the other employees treated them badly (sexual harassment ... leaving tampons on their desks) and he was the only one that didn't.  The warehouse manager finally quit to go to a different job.  
She left for another job.  Within six months her work closed down and she came back looking for a job.  They didn't want her.  
The coordinator moved to a different department.  
The plant operations manager chose a guy that was hired after my husband and had a very spotty work record.
That warehouse manager promoted my husband to coordinator.
That warehouse manager was an alcoholic and crashed and burned out of the job.
My husband acted as interim warehouse manager.  
The plant operations director hired an outside guy as the warehouse manager.
The warehouse manager was fired for stealing from the company and intimidating the customers into paying him under the table.  
My husband has acted as warehouse manager in the interim.
Today all the managers were called into a meeting and told that the plant operations manager was fired and they have a new plant operations manager who had been working as an assistant to the plant operations manager for six months.
That guy has actually talked with my husband over the past six months and said a few months ago that my husband should have been promoted to the warehouse manager position.
Hoping for the best.
TLDR:  Hoping that my husband gets a promotion.",05Jan2018,5
48,"(sorry in advance if this ends up being a lengthy post)

I’ve always believed that everybody here on this earth is here for s reason, and that we all have a calling that we will excel in, and if we find it hopefully make it our career.

While I’m not yet an adult, I’ve always dreamed about and envisioned my future. I’ve stayed up late contemplating why I’m here, and what my purpose is

But most of all, I’ve thought about what do I want to be in life, and what will make me happy.

On one hand, I’m a straight A student. 4.5 gpa, president and captain of clubs and teams, etc. I have big dreams for college; hopefully I can get into Harvard, and go on to med school and end up as a neurologist or neurosurgeon. 

However, I’ve always been told that the thing you think about most, the thing that you constantly dream of and envision, is the thing you’re meant to do in life. Ever since I made my school’s track team three years ago, running had made such a lasting impact on my life.

I’m not saying I’m great, but it’s something that I’m always dreaming of; me running times I never thought possible and proving to people that I can do what I put my mind to.

However, it’s not like I could tell MY parents I want to be a runner. It doesn’t make enough money, and they’d say i’m not that good and I’d make a good neurosurgeon.

So, even thought I’m still “young and don’t have to make these choices right now”, I just want some help finding clarity on what I should do and who I want to be.

Sorry if this ended up being an annoying rant.",05Jan2018,2
