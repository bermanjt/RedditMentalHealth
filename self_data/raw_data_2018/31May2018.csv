0,"One of the friendships that I used to have with someone on my floor... wasn't good.  Every single conversation I had with her was one-sided, in the sense where it felt like she's the only one that is allowed to talk, and everything I say was superfluous, wrong, and unnecessary, no matter what I say.  

The thing that always stuck with me though was how often she told me that I was boring.  We had gotten to the topic on sex and BDSM, and I'm vanilla (one part body image issues, one part depression dampening my desire for sex overall, one part BDSM mostly freaks me out), and she went on and on about how boring I was because of my vanilla-ness.  She did it to some on the other people on the floor, but she made most of these comments towards me.  I went with it because I didn't want to be a drag about how much that bothered me, and I thought that that was the only real instance of that happening.  Then, later on, I mentioned something about meeting up with a guy.  She asked what it was suggestively, and I mentioned it was for a club that I was part of, and she just goes, ""oh, that's boring.""  

It wasn't just those couple of instances.  It feels like every time I try to contribute something to the conversation, her reply is just ""so?"", ""I don't give a shit"", or nothing at all, just judgemental looks in my direction. 

I must sound really sensitive right now, but because of her constantly mentioning how boring I was, I've become self-conscious about everything I do.  I've recently been trying to get my life together, but everything I do to get my life together (applying for a job, cleaning my room, finding a new, cheap hobby), I hear a voice that sounds suspiciously like her telling me that ""it's too boring"", and I get so unfathomably angry because of it.  I know boring is entirely subjective, and I wasn't put on this earth solely for the purpose of entertaining one (1) blabbermouth, but it still stings and it's sort of affecting how I navigate life, and it's sort of becoming something like an intrusive thought process that happens anytime my mind wanders for too long.

tl;dr: I got called boring a lot and I'm self-conscious about it, to the point where I can't stop thinking about it.  ",31May2018,1
1,"I'm confused as fuck. Known her for years. She supposedly loved me but I split out of fear before meeting. Stayed friends and became quite close. I care about her a lot but I don't like to use any other words but I like her a lot. Stillel never met her though. She said we should meet up soon and I agreed. When we talk it sometimes feels like she says things to push me away. She struggles with mental health issues so maybe it's a defense mechanism, but I'm worried I'll get it horribly wrong and it'll not only make things awkward, it'll ruin our friendship. I even said something about my concerns but along the lines of us might hating each other and she said it'll never happen. I guess I feel like a cuck and I don't want to appear that way but I don't want to be fake with her whatsoever",31May2018,1
2," I think it's been way too long to bring it up in casual conversation. Or even drunk bar conversation. Or even drunk on the hallway floor conversation. I know my friends would listen to me bitch about it for the next ten years, but I don't want keep being that depressing reminder that people can fucking suck. Or that I'm not strong or whatever.

I didn’t think you’d be spending so long in my life. I’d known who you were, but never actually knew you. You always brought up how you hadn’t made a big enough impression then. You made me feel bad over the stupidest fucking thing.

Free of complication. I thought we’d have one party. You’d realize I wasn’t quite what you were looking for. Was I a challenge? Did you think we’d be together for that many years? Why the fuck did I have to be another person left in your psychopathic wake. When did you decide you were going to make me feel so empty.

I don’t think it was during those first nervous trips to get coffee. Or during all of those “normal dates” we went on, until we confessed that we hated dinner and coffees. Or when you brought me home to your parents at Christmas. Or when I covered up your bruise from the punch you took to the face the night before from some idiot at the bar. Or when we were so upset we forgot our reusable bags for the thousandth time and bought more to add to the pile. I miss your mom.

I wish I could pinpoint when you stopped caring. I hate that you brought all these people into my life who I loved, and now I can’t have them. I had to give back your friends. I had to give back your mom. Your dog. So much of me was you. 

You manipulated me. You broke me down over six years. It was abuse. I’m better off without you. I keep telling myself that. Your friends told me that when they were still talking to me. I put everything into us. I didn’t deserve what happened to me. Maybe I did. Maybe I shouldn’t have put so much effort into fixing someone who just wanted to break everyone else. I was stupid.

It’s a lot easier as time has passed. I sleep through the night. I sleep in the middle of the bed. I quit my job, I moved. I stopped pausing when I get those moments of you. I can make it through a day. The week. A month. I threw everything away. I kept a box for a year at my parents, in case you wanted anything back. I cared about you for far too long. I thought you were it. I’m lying when I say I hate you. I’m lying when I say I wish I could hurt you as bad as you hurt me. I wonder if people are lying when they say I’m stronger, I’m so much happier. 

I’m scared I’m going to make someone feel like you made me felt. I’m scared someone is going to make me feel like that again. I feel like I’m standing at the edge of a road with invisible traffic, being pushed to cross. I don’t want to try this again. I wouldn’t have if I knew what this was going to do to me. I think I do fucking hate you. When did you become that person that could hurt me so bad. Why didn’t I notice it. Why did I ignore it. Why did I make excuses for you. Why didn’t I leave sooner. Why didn’t you just let me go if you didn’t love me anymore. Why did you have to do it the way you did. Did you hate yourself as much as you hated me. Fuckkk this shit sucks. I really wish you would get hit by a car; then I wouldn’t have to wonder anymore how the fuck you got over it so fast. How you moved on so fucking fast is such a mindfuck. 

You didn’t just fall out of love and chose to end things, you literally fucked me up in every way possible, then skipped on to your new life. I wish I didn’t let this hurt me as much as it did.
You’re still a fucking asshole tho.

3,"I was a big girl in college.

Not fat, but big and athletic. 6'2. Collegiate wrestler.

Many times other girls would start shit with me. Test me.

I would never attack anyone first, but if they ever started a fight, I would make sure by the end of it they were stripped naked.

I would strip them butt-ass naked. Right there in front of everybody. Smack 'em on their bare white ass and send 'em running for cover.

I'd collect their bra and undies and keep them, just to make them go home with the indignity of being commando. I always imagined the bounce of their unsupported breasts and bare butts against their jeans reminded them how I put them in their place.

After the 3rd nude girl, nobody started shit for the next 4 years.

There was even a geeky freshman boy who started shit with me. I sent him and his little bare floppy penis and balls running for cover and still have his tighty-whities to this day.

Nice way to keep people from messing with you, if you can do it lol.

5,"In third grade, I was a quiet student with few friends, but it was by choice, as I was content with playing by myself. However, I like to believe I had pretty good relations with my peers, as i enjoyed their company when they occasionally asked me to play with them.

Anyway, not only was I quiet, but I was a bad student with bad grades, so one day I had to attend a parent-teacher conference. My teacher noticed I was almost always alone, so she asked this one specific question, this one question that to this day still pops up at random moments when I lie in bed at night:

**""Are you alone because you don't like the other kids or because they don't like you?""**

Now I hope you see why this is a bad question. I should have ignored her suggestions and formed my own answer of course, but unfortunately for 8 year old me, the word of the adult was sacred and I thought I only had those 2 choices. Plus, you know, I was just a dumb kid in general.

So I just picked the least wrong one (in my mind): I didn't like the other kids. To me, it was more along the lines of ""I don't like playing with other kids.""

At that moment, a loud, audible gasp came out from both my mom and my teacher, as if I just let out a nasty swear. It wasn't true that I didn't like the other kids and I knew it, so i felt like shit for saying that.

After that, for the rest of the year, my teacher seemed to dislike me even more. You know how it is: desk in front, singling me out when the class was rowdy, constant eye contact, the whole shebang.

To this day, i suppose it's made me mindful of how I phrased my questions since then, but I still wish I answered that differently. I liked my peers very much-- in fact, I'm still friends with one of them 15 years later. Take that, Ms. H!",31May2018,0
6,"So I’ve been lucky enough to have always had close friends. There have only been little moments in my life where I’ve felt lonely, but those feelings were temporary as there was a spot in the future I knew I’d be with people. 

I still have close friends but we all have grown physically apart. My friends are living out of state with internships or they moved out to a new town while Imm still stuck at home. We all have kept in touch on social media really well but it has been slowly dying off. For the first time ever for me, I feel I have no one to talk to.

I scrolled through my old texts to see if there was anyone who I could reconnect with or check in with and there really isn’t anyone I feel would want to catch up with me. That’s not meant to be self deprecating, but just the truth. A lot of people where I was a B character in their life.

15,"So having been bugged with ghost stories this and haunted that the past week now . I wanted to share a very short story about what me and my younger brother saw one night when home alone. 

Two quick things , 1. I don't believe in ghosts curses or demons outside of fun stories. But I can not explain what we saw. 
2. I'm the middle child , my older brother is 3 years older then me and I am 4 years older then my little brother. 

Three to five years ago me and my little brother were left home alone. My older brother was in college at the time states away and my parents had left for a weekend vacation. We live in a nice home on 3 Acer's of land half of which is just woods. 
Saturday night rolls in and me and him both wake up from napping or rather falling asleep watching YouTube bored out of our minds. I decided to make dinner . 
 Our kitchen has sliding doors that go out onto the deck on the back of our house. At night we keep the spot lights on as homes around here including ours have been broken into before. 
A hour goes by and we are just talking in the kitchen waiting for the stakes to finish. 

Now to set this up , i was wearing blue and grey and he was wearing green and grey. We were standing on the opposite side of the counter from the sliding glass doors when I caught a glimpse of something on the deck through the doors behind my lil brother. 

Standing on the deck , clear as day to see almost against the door looking in at us with a calm smile was my little brother wearing a red shirt and blue jeans. We couldn't stop staring in disbelief. We finally looked at each other sideways not willing to look fully away. But as our heads turned the calm smile suddenly turned to look of worry as if he had just gotten into trouble and knew it. He turned straight around and in a slightly quickened pace walked off the deck THROUGH THE RAILING.  

Whatever it was it has never been seen since and personally we both hope it stays that way. Never in my life have I wished to forget something so badly. ",31May2018,3

17,"Today, I suffered silently.  I had a \(nearly\) full\-blown panic attack and I felt like I was going to faint on and off for about half an hour.  I say \(nearly\) because I didn't have to go to the hospital and I didn't break down sobbing and I didn't feel have to leave the place I was at \(thank goodness\).  I was at the local Children's Museum with two friends and their kids.  To say that I am sick of being *that* emotional basket\-case in public, would be a pretty huge understatement.  People can be supportive and really, really kind.  However, people also don't handle drama or sick people well \(not that I fully blame them\- especially if they are hanging on by a thread themselves\).  So I sat on this bench next to these women I have known for at least a year \(1 and the other nearly 3\) and I bit my cheek.  I talked to myself in my head and then I asked one of them to watch GG \(my daughter\)  while I went to go buy juice.

I am still just figuring things out.  It has been sixish months since I had half of my pancreas removed and it has been a long recovery process.  I have a chance now to get ahead of all the crashing and rising but I am still weird and I am learning that I have to take care of myself and do things ""normal"" people don't need to do.  And it sucks.  And I stamp my Barbie\-pink glittered feet.  Like any good alcoholic, I deal with the behaviors now and not the actual substances.  I can become a hamster on a wheel with lightning speed repeating the same actions over and over and expecting different results.  Note to dumbass: they are *never* different.

I have had to transition from how I was living before: a crazy\-ass recluse in her bedroom all day, imbibing sugar and still having wild mood swings, *and* feeling like fainting and being hotter than anyone ought to ever feel.  Oh, and the puking.  Did I mention the puking?  So. Much. Puking.  Now, I am basically ""normal"" with the caveat of I have to eat regularly \(like every two hours regularly....sometimes more\) and listen to my body.  When I start to feel like a worthless piece of junk, I need to eat.  It isn't the depression I've had my whole life, it is my mind and blood sugar playing a super\-fun game I call what\-the\-fuck\-please\-stop\-this\-ride\-i\-want\-to\-get\-off\-now\-pretty\-please.  It* feel*s exactly like the depression and anxiety I have dealt with my whole life, but it isn't.

I have to learn what to eat.  Since my gestational diabetes with GG, I have been researching glycemic index, complex and simple carbs, and quantities recommended for diabetics/pre\-diabetics.  Nothing before would help me.  No amount of less carb, more carb, or right carb would settle my blood sugar because my pancreas was happily dumping insulin all the live, long day.  So now after years of living like this, I have to tell my brain to ""shut\-up"" it is lying to me and now I can control it.  I am ""fixed""  My Endocrinologist doesn't want me testing blood sugar because it is not medically necessary \(at least a few months ago\) and it will drive me insane \(her exact words\).

So, here I am floating amorphously in a galaxy of trying to figure shit out *and* in charge of a toddler, while Hubband is doing this crazy thing called ""earning a living.""  I know fo sho that I cannot eat at night.  But, when I am the only one up in the house the food is like my secret cigarette or glass of wine.  It lulls me to sleep.  It calms me.  It makes me happy.  The next day?  Like a hangover from hell.  Everything feels slightly off and sugar seems harder to control. So, duh.  Stop eating before bed.  I've been saying this for months and I probably make it maybe 25&amp;#37; of the time.

When my MIL \(I call her Mom and really like her\) was here, I had coffee because it's what we do together and that went horribly as well.  I wasn't paying attention to what I was eating and I ended up internally freaking out at a swimming lesson and externally freaking\-out and sobbing in a restaurant.  These times are super not fun for others, they are also no joy\-bath for me.  I have changed from my life experiences, and I have become much more introverted.  Plus, after years of having little to no control of my body and my mind at certain times, I relish being in control and stable.

However, I digress, I was sitting on this bench and doing everything I could to stop being my own mind\-fuck, which sounds super\-easy in theory; just like depression sounds easy to get past in theory.  In reality?  Arrrrgh, I'm gonna die.  Text Hubband or Bestie sobbing.  Talk to someone.  Except, I can't.  I have to put on my big\-girl panties \(did you wonder when that was coming\).  If I indulge in these past behaviors, it makes things worse.  I cry harder and longer and I'm trying to put those days of being a victim behind me.  I am told to be a survivor.  A warrior.

So, in my own small way, I try.  I focus really hard on making it upstairs and getting juice which I drink.  I come back and focus on my daughter and making small talk with my friends.  I focus on making it through this moment telling myself all these ""lies"" I don't believe, about how it will pass and things will get better.  And they do.  Not because I am magically fixed, but because I have to work at it every damn day.  Because I have to choose over and over to create new patterns in my brain to replace the chaos and despair that was my life for a long time.  It is slow hard work and some days I really fucking suck at it.  I need this reminder.  I need to know on the days I give up and it is harder that this is possible.  That it is like climbing Mount Everest and might take years.

The coping skills we have used to get through trauma and abuse are a bunch of assholes.  You feel like you need them to keep you safe but in reality, they do more harm than good. 

A lot of the time, I don't feel worthy still.  And some moments \(and some days\) the only thing that gets me through is Garnett or Hubband.   I know it isn't healthy to live for someone else, but I figure it will be fine, until I am strong enough to live for myself more, and for everyone else, less.",31May2018,0

20,"I recently broke up with my boyfriend of two and a half years, and I’m so relieved. I spent the entire time making excuses for his behaviour and pretending everything was normal. 

The first time I tried to break up with him, he got angry and drove us towards another car. The next day he bought flowers and apologised. I knew it wasn’t okay but I thought it wasn’t his fault because he had a bad childhood. His parents are pretty horrible people. I felt like I couldn’t blame him. 

The next time I tried to break up with him, he promised he would change and even went to see a psychiatrist. It helped for a while, but then he stopped going. 

Any time I tried to bring up issues, he would tell I was a sook and that I was making up problems. He was happy so there was no problem. Of course he was happy, I cleaned everything and paid for so much. He never had money because he spent it on weed and crap. He smoked weed every day and eventually I did too. He couldn’t quit it. He needed it to stay calm and not be angry all the time. Every time he ran out I would try to stay out of his way and not annoy him. 

Once he threw a washing basket at me. He would drive erratically and speed around. He would road rage and tailgate. If I asked him to stop, he would tell me to shut the fuck up. He said I don’t get an opinion because I don’t have a licence. 

And he was so nice most of the time. He cooked every night and used to be loving. I put up with all of this shit until finally he didn’t even bother to be loving. He spoke to me when he wanted sex, otherwise he just played his xbox that I bought on the TV I bought. I finally realised he didn’t care about me. He was just comfortable. I became really unwell, mentally and physically, and he didn’t care. He didn’t clean, he didn’t ask how I was, he didn’t take care of me. I realised how much I did for him and how much I cared about him, and how much he couldn’t care less about me. 

I am so, so relieved. I’m not even really upset at this point. When I finally left him, he thought I was being cruel. Because for once I’m not emotional about it. But I’ve been crying for months and I’ve run out of tears for him. I’m past being upset, I’m just done. ",31May2018,161

**Beginning**
I guess you could say that this sort of stemmed from when I was a child, a very young child, I hardly grew up with my parents and for the most parts I was with different family members, my Mums Mum, my Dads Mum and for a long period of time my Aunt and her civil partner. They were my Guardians and raised me for a long time of my childhood. A lot of things occurred to me whilst I was under their care, nothing directly from them, but things a child should not have to go through. I would spend birthdays, Christmases, easter and any kind of public holiday sat by the door waiting for something from both my Mum and Dad. Hardly anything ever arrived and when they did; gave hope by means of empty and unkept promises. I’m pretty sure that in the end, my Aunties would snatch them up before I could reach them as to protect me from them. For this, I am thankful now that I am older and able to understand. I was a young boy, yearning for the love, comfort and guidance of his parents. You can family, but nothing is quite like your parents. I would have people come in to see me and check up on me, Social Services, they would sit me down and make sure I was being properly cared for and looked after. I was too young to give a shit in all fairness. This is where everything began, my lack of trust for my parents has affected me until this very day and has contributed to everything that has happened in my life.

The first time I ever remember actually seeing my Dad, I arrived at his Mums house as I did every weekend, and as I walked through the front door, he was there to my left, sat in the chair. I looked at him and walked straight past him. I walked into the kitchen as to where his Mum was and I asked her “Who is that mister in the chair” to which she replied “that is your Dad”. Well as you could imagine I couldn’t believe it, the man who had helped bring me into this world was sat in the other room and the very first memory of him I have, I had no idea who he was.

After some time I moved in with my Grandparents, my Nana and Grandad. My Grandad isn’t my biological Grandad but he is the best Grandad I could ever hope for. I never met my Mums dad and very rarely ever saw my Dads Dad. Life was good with my Nana and Grandad, I had everything I could of wanted at that age; a stable home, clothes on my back and plenty of food in my stomach but there was always something missing that most kids never had. My parents. My Mum had contact with me every now and then, but nothing consistent. I kind of realised this was life and this was how it was going to be, up until the point I was asked if I wanted to live with her. This at the time was the most exciting thing I had ever done, but in the end became one of the worst decisions of my life.

Life was good for a short while, I lived with my Mum in a nice flat, perfect for the two of us. I had no reason to complain. Eventually, we moved into a new house, it was at this point she met her new boyfriend Josh. I was still young at this point. Probably around 10 or 11. I was going to my Dads on a weekend and life was good. Then after a few months, my Mum became pregnant with my beautiful little sister; and so Grace was born. We moved from our house in REDACTED, surrounded by our family, into our new house just around the corner, this was my Grandad's house so which it was good for us. Not many problems happened here, except the time I went out one day and had to come back as I had forgotten something. Only to peer through the window on my way to the back door to see my mum injecting herself, at the time I had no idea what it was. Now, now I know it was Heroin.

We eventually moved to REDACTED, away from everyone. I grew older here I was probably around the age of about 11 or 12. This is where the problems within the family started. My Mum was getting accused by my Nana of stealing things from her house. Of course I couldn’t believe what she was saying because she was blaming my Mum; but I knew my Nana as a very proud woman and I knew she would never accuse her of something unless she was absolutely sure of it. I was stuck between them. Things continued to happen whilst living with my Mum, she would take my consoles off of me and then they would end up missing. The best excuse was “We gave it to a friend to look after so you couldn’t find it and they were burgled” I honestly believed it, I had no reason to not believe her. She was my Mum after all. Time went on and little things happened but nothing major and nothing I remember enough about to write in detail without making inconsistencies within the story. Then came the end of our time in REDACTED, we had one of my Mum’s boyfriend's friends staying with us, to cut that short I will cut to the chase. He was basically going out on a night time and breaking into people's houses to steal their stuff. This was obviously unbeknownst to me as they obviously didn’t tell me. The only time I found out was when I was home alone and somebody put the front room window through. Naturally and quite stupidly actually I poke my head out of my bedroom window to see what was going on, only to have abuse hurtled at me as they thought I was my Mums Boyfriend. Luckily about a minute later my Mum came around the window and saw what was going on and confirmed that I was actually a kid and not a burglar. Within hours I had a back packed and was told to go to my dads until further notice while they got a lift to somewhere with my sister. I tried to get on the bus with all my bags, but I didn’t have a bus pass so they wouldn’t let me on for 60p. Shock I know, I was a kid, late at night with loads of bags and they shunted me off the bus. The next one wasn’t for another hour and I didn’t favour my odds of it being a different bus driver with a kinder heart. So, I walked to my dads; at this point I didn’t have a smartphone or anything to help me. I kind of had to remember as much of the way as I could and guess the rest. I walked about 6-7 miles, as a kid, In the middle of the night with my bags on my back and shoulders. Eventually after walking 3 quarters of the way I attempted my luck again on the bus, luckily I was let on. I arrived at my Dads and everything was sweet for a while.

We then moved back to REDACTED into a different house and life got a little better, not with my Mum but in general, with my friends and such. By this time I was 13 and I was back with everyone I grew up with and it helped to take my mind off of my crumbling home life. It’s actually quite funny, I lost my virginity in that house, before we moved in, inside an empty cold house. Not the best first time but, who’s to judge when you’re getting laid. Time went on and I got a new girlfriend, we spent everyday together at school and then after school in my room, playing Guitar hero and doing stuff you do when you’re kids. That came to crumbling an abrupt halt after almost half a year and I was upset to say the least but it didn’t stop me much. I carried on as usual eventually. This is when things got worse with my Mum, she asked to take my new smartphone and pawn it for money because they had none and they needed it for food and bills. Obviously I said yes without hesitation and she promised to get the phone back when she got paid. She never did, this pissed my Dad off as he was the one who bought me the phone as a gift for Christmas.

None the less, we ended up moving out of the house and I went back to living with my Nana. By this point i was around 15, 16? I think saying my life improved was an understatement. It was at this point that I met another girl and she was great and all but we never worked out. I did however end up with her Bestfriend, naughty I know. This is probably one of the only times I will mention names because the story needs it. I will change their names. So, Katie. Me and Katie was together for a little over 2 years. It was great up until a certain point. I am kind of to blame for this because for the first part of the relationship I was very negligent towards her. Not in a way of abusive but I was very self indulgent. I didn’t spend much time with her and she eventually kind of stopped trying with me. We was still together but it was a rather distant relationship. Eventually someone else came onto the scene and I realised I had to book my ideas up. The guy was called Dylan and I found out that he was picking her and her friends up during and after school and taking them places. I wasn’t very comfortable with this, he was a little older than me and I didn’t like him being around my girlfriend in the way he was and as much as he was. I started to make more of an appearance with her and spend more time with her. By this point it was pretty much too late though and I didn’t realise this until later on. In the end this thing with Dylan became that much of an issue that I had to bring up with Katie and let her know how I feel. I didn’t tell her to stop talking to him or being around him. I just mentioned that it makes me uncomfortable and I didn’t really like her being around him. Other small things happened between then and this point but it’s little things and I don’t remember enough details. She told me that she didn’t speak to me anymore and was adamant that she didn’t. One day I was round at her house and I found that she had changed his number in her phone to one of her friends as to hide the fact that she was still talking to him. This obviously pissed me off, not just because she lied to my face but also because of the fact that she went out of her way to hide this from me. Loads of things happened with Dylan, going from her staying at his house, to being seen late at night in his care. The biggest one was when I caught her at his house , to which she said that she was getting her E-Cig from his house. Called bullshit but being as manipulative as she was, I believed her, apologised and smashed my hand up in the process from punching walls. The punching walls thing was my way of getting my anger out. I wasn’t a violent person but I had to let it out somehow. This carried on for a while, we broke up, got back together and so forth for a while until we reached just after our 2 years together in which it came to an end completely. I gave up my dream of being in the army for her, I did end up joining but that was almost a year later.

It came to about 2 years later and I still hadn’t had another relationship, I was so insecure, I had really bad trust issues, I didn’t feel I could love again, I was scared of getting hurt and I thought everyone was out to get me. I pushed everyone away, my friends and even my family. I found very little comfort in anything and nothing made me happy. I eventually joined the army in 2016 and I managed to get over my problems. They were still there but I didn’t acknowledge them as much. I still couldn’t get into a relationship, I had one night stands and such but nothing ever meaningful. This carried on for 2 years until we reach 2018. I met a new girl in the new year, changing her name again. So I met, Lucy. Lucy was like nothing I had ever met before, she was one of the greatest human beings I had ever met, she was smart, funny, had great ambitions and aspirations and above all was absolutely stunning. That relationship didn’t last long. This was the first relationship I had took a gamble with, put all my negative feelings behind me and pushed aside my problems and to my disbelief it was working, for the first month things were going great. I had no problems and my feelings towards her were strong, she was after all the first girl I had let in for 2 years and I opened up to her. However, after that first month and the “honeymoon” period had worn off, I couldn’t control the feelings and my problems from my previous relationship. They started to take hold of me, my Anxiety, the paranoia and the constant feeling that she was growing distant from me. I managed to suppress them as much as I could for a couple of weeks but the eventually bubbled over and I exposed them for what they was for the first time to Lucy. She knew of my past but had never experienced the problems that came with me. I told her about everything and how I was feeling and I tried to make her understand in a way that wouldn’t seem like I was accusing her of all these things and that it was in fact my subconscious reaching out and trying to warn my brain. I was suppressing these as much as I could but in the end I was just pushing her away. I was making matters worse by trying to make the better and it was not helping me. I was making her feel worse, adding the stress and pressure of her busy life and I was starting to feel like I was becoming a burden. We had spent so much time together since we met and I had such strong feelings towards her. As of me writing this, me and Lucy are still together, however she has told me that she needs a few days to think about things and to determine the outcome of our relationship. During this time she doesn’t want me speaking to her which is understandable. But as a naive boyfriend that I am, that is hard for me and so far I actually haven’t stopped. I do mean to, it’s just hard to. Hopefully I won’t be adding to the bottom of this to explain that we have broken up but I cannot decide the future, I can only hope that with it comes something good, because at this moment in time; everything in my life has amounted to this moment and it is all starting to come out. Every emotion and feeling that I have ever suppressed and kept inside me is ready to come out and I am struggling to hold it all together. ",31May2018,5

32,"So yesterday I fucked up. I backed my. Forklift into a bumper on a pole. I didn't cause any serious damage. When it happened I was sure I was going to get fired. But from my understanding after accident all the managers told me I was fine and I'd be back tomorrow. They said I was getting drug tested as a formality. I took it with a grain of salt and drove to the staffing office. I did the drug test and they even said I was fine to come back to work. When I was there I filled out a form explaining what happened. They asked me if I recieved any formal training from the company and I told them I had only done a 1 hour forklift safety course(pre-qualify test) on my first day, but no formal forklift driving training, that they just handed me the keys and told me to go to work, the staffing office even called me back after I left to reiterate that point. So today I get a call from the staffing agency that my assignment was ended.

I'm not saying I'm in anyway right for my potentially very dangerous mistake. If the circumstances were different I would've have killed someone. I understand be getting fired for that reason. But given the fact that there are more Dangerous drivers in the floor who are associates who have done far more damage than I, I can't help but wonder if by my telling them I was never trained, caused the company to do damage control and drop me altogether. It's a huge liability having drivers who haven't gone through company training procedures to make mistakes. I'm not scared or worried, this job was only temperary until I find something in my expertise.

Tl;Dr: I think that because I told them I was never formally trained I got fired. ",31May2018,2
33,"Hey guys first post here, I’ve been reading posts about post graduation life for the past month and finally decided to start my own post. 

So I graduated a year ago now with a degree in Computer Science. I got a job a month later and have been working full time ever since. The job isn’t in my major but it’s a Fortune 500 company voted one of the best places to work on LinkedIn and Indeed as well (don’t wanna say the name). I was still 21 when I got the job offer for 65K a year which is now 71.5K now after a raise, with excellent benefits as well. I’m 22 now and financially I’m in a better position than every peer I know even though I got a job out of my major.

I still live at home and haven’t been in a rush to move out yet really. I only live with my mom and sister and there’s enough space at home for us all. 

My mom is already looking at homes in Florida and she plans to move by end of next year with her fiancé (he works a high profile job in another country so the relationship is long distance). She wants me to move down there with her so I can save my money/pay off my student loans; which has me kind of conflicted. Better weather and a nicer house, but I’d lose my well paying job. I have no real attachment to my job though, I’m not passionate about it but I don’t hate being here at the same time and the company is so big and I’m still so new that I’m just a pebble here I’m not sure if I would be working here for the rest of my life anyways, this job assumes your here for life lol.

I live a couple of towns away from Boston and a year ago I was foreseeing myself moving there eventually. I pay a good chunk of change every month in loans, car insurance and other bills so even with my current salary I would probably just barely survive living on my own. I definitely wouldn’t be able to save or make extra payments to my loans like I’ve been doing. I want to pay off the loans ASAP but I have like $50,000-$60,000 left to pay. 

Moving out is definitely going to happen one way or another the question is will it be in MA or Florida. Honestly I’m not even sure I want to spend the rest of my life in either location still. Cali is really on my mind I’ll know for sure when I go to LA for vacation this summer. A lot on my mind lol, what do you guys think?",31May2018,3

42,"Long story short, I hooked up with an old flame of almost two years about 2 weeks ago. As usual, I knew he wouldn't call me back, but that doesn't help it hurt any less. This dude and I are friends on social media, because regardless of how much we don't talk after a hookup, we're still going to talk to each other at some point after. I'm still not sure why, but I don't want him completely out of my life yet, even though I know he is bad for me because he isn't actually interested, he just says he is \(and very convincingly, might I add\) so he can hook up with me now and again \(which I don't mind because we always have great chemistry and the sex is amazing\).

Fast forward to two days ago, I made some stupid joke on twitter as a response to one of his tweets, which I thought was funny. He said something along the lines of ""my mom always asks me why I'm not looking for a girlfriend, and I always tell her I'd rather work instead. She is always disappointed..."" to which I tweeted back ""your mother and I have that in common"", which I thought was hilarious \(what can I say, I have an interesting sense of humor, I guess?

I took a screen shot and showed it to my best friend, and she said I needed to stop because I look ""desperate"". Seriously? Over a fucking joke? So then I texted the same screenshot to my other best friend, this one is a dude. He basically said that if he didn't know my sense of humor, that would sound desperate af. It honestly kind of made me mad. Why do we care so much to sound aloof or apathetic to people we are attracted to??? Even more so, why is a STUPID JOKE ON TWITTER that bad, bad enough for someone to be deemed ""desperate""? Wtf is up with this dating culture of ""let's see who can care less"" and treating people like disposable garbage??? So many questions, and so many things I want to say about this. And so it began. With a stupid tweet.

I'd been contemplating starting a secret youtube channel which I will not be sharing with anyone I know in real life, to make sort of a video journal of all the shitty dating things I do/are done to me, and to talk to other people who might feel the same about how fucked our dating culture is \(which I'm assuming it's most of us\)... so after the shit from my best friends happened.... I did. So here it is. Check it out if y'all want. I love this subreddit, and I figured that if there's a community out there who might appreciate and want to hear about the stuff I have to say, you guys would be it.  
Anyway, hopefully you'll like it if you decide to check it out, and if not, that's cool too.

Thank you for reading. I needed to let that out. \&lt;3

43," I got in my car yesterday and the first thing I thought was ""damn, why does my car smell like crotch.""  It is Arizona in the summer time, so not only does it smell like crotch, but it smells like crotch baking in the supernova heat.  A little background: my car is not dirty.  It is only five years old.  I can be a messy person but I am not a dirty person.  The difference?  Messy means clean clothes might sit on the couch a few days.  Dirty means husband has 96 empty Coke Zero cans in his office, 12 plates with sauces and food particles irrevocably glued on,  7 random\-ass eating utensils, and a partridge in a fucking pear tree.   

The only one that ever messes up my car is darling Hubband simply because he forgets items exist the second he places them in the car \(the only exception is our daughter\).  Garnett is also very clean and doesn't like being untidy or smelly and we have cleaned up anytime she has made a mess with food and washed cat seat cover.  So WTF car?  To be completely honest it smells like 90&amp;#37; crotch and about 10&amp;#37; SmartFood White Cheddar Popcorn \(I, nor any one else, has had any in the car\).  

This would be waaaaaaaay less random and weird if it weren't an independently verified smell.  I switched cars with husband yesterday and as soon as he got in the car, he looks over and says through the respective open car windows: ""Why does your car smell like crotch?""  I nearly died laughing.  I had not said a word about Crotch Car because I had forgotten to tell him during the appointment.  I didn't remember to ask him to locate the smell until he reminded me.  He spent five minutes climbing around in my car and in the trunk sniffing and he could not located the odor.  He refused to drive until it was dealt with.  Unfortunately for him, his bloodhound tracking skills suck ass and he couldn't find the source.  ",31May2018,0

I'm using FB marketplace for the first time, mainly bc my friends told me they had good success on here. But my experience has been completely different. Is the marketplace really shady, or is everyone just really flaky? 

I'm trying to sell a few things. But I'm getting replies from random people, many who don't even live in the same state (according to their profile). Most of them ask if the item is available, then never respond again after i reply. some ask me dimensions or size of the item, and then don't respond again.

Literally just now, a guy said he was coming over to pick up a desk i'm selling, so I gave him my address. I told him to come before a certain time, otherwise I won't be around for the exchange. Then he said he'd be an hour, and then a couple hours. and now he's being incredibly dodgy, saying he doesn't know his ETA, but he'll ""let me no"". over and over again, that's his response. So now i'm paranoid that I gave some shady ass dude my address, AND he knows when I won't be there.

Am I overthinking things right now? is this how marketplace normally works?
