2,"So there was predrinking at the flat that I am the main tenant of. My flatmate (one of the 2 subtenants) had invited his friends.
Background story: We had a new years eve party a week ago, neighbours had complained twice, almost with physical escalation, police was there etc.

Now today there was a lot of talk already about the neighbours having had complained. Then, after 12, a girl connected her/somebodys phone to the speaker/box and put full volume.
I told her to put it down. I told her to put the volume down again, else I am going to throw out the (expensive) box out of the window.
She didnt listen. I took the box and went to the balcony. I waited for a couple seconds, but music was still on full volume or just a bit less loud (man if sb. was threatening this and took an expensive box and went to the balcony, I would put music completely out or super much down). She did not. 
So I threw this 100-200 € box from a 4 story building. It s obviously broken.

Then comes a long after story, she screamed at me, saying that I was so insecure, I needed to show off etc. and how can I do this to my flatmate etc. 
I personally really think she didnt get the concept of responsibility. When the host tells her to put the music down or else, she has to FUCKING PUT THE MUSIC DOWN. She tried to distract herself from the fact that she had just made my flatmate lose money. There was almost phyiscial escalation, I told them ""to leave and that I dont have a problem beating sb. or calling the police"". So then there was almost a fight with one of her male friends... which was avoided by some more calm guys. Anyway.

The girl later told me, she hadnt heard the massiv and repeated talk about the neighbours having had complained already. And one friend of her, who was actually cool and talking calmly, took me to the side and told me she thought its a joke. Well, I dont know, I am German, and we are in Germany, I dont make jokes about such things. If I say smth, I do it. And I dont like when people diarespect me in my flat. I dont want to get thrown out of the flat by the landlords cause there s again complaining from neighbours or the like. I have invested heavily into this flat and finding a new place in this market could cost me thousands.

So in the end, another girl screams at me, a calm dude takes me to the side until they all left. They were all angry at me except my flatmates, i mean they also didnt like what I did, but I think they are too chill to really react badly/nice people. Even the guy who s box I threw down. Obviously, they were more chill but also thought I overreacted.

But did I? I need some advise on that. I mean, as I said, we are in Germany. I am used to people abiding to rules.

Sure, going to my flatmate and telling him to get his friends under control would have been the better way. But a) I didnt think about that, b) they knew I was owning the flat (or I was the main tenant) so why the fuck would they not listen. I was seriously afraid that another complaint from the neighbour could lead to us all getting thrown out.

And also blaming alcohol lol. I was sober, they were drunk, yeah, but I still think I can decide how loud the music in my flat is and they can respond, if they are still able to walk.

The bad thing is, that it wasnt the girls box, but my flatmates. It s probably like 200 €. In my opinion:
- I warned her
- He should have kept his friends under control
- Even if I overreacted, I didnt do physical harm to anybody, and people just cant live with the results of their actions. That s my opinion.
- I made sure that we could all continue to live her, so I actually saved me and my 2 flatmates ass in the long-term. Personally I think, that s what s most important.

Now the thing is, I actually like the flatmate who s box/speaker this was. 
So, what do you advise?
I guess to keep him in the flat long-term, I will have to replace the box/speaker out of my own pocket. I could do it, but I feel like it s not my responsibility. I think the girl should do it, which she will never do for sure (cause she cant even afford it).

5,"There are many who know some of this information, so some of what I have written here might not be new. There are, however, some important things that need to be said:

---------------------
**Impeachment before the mid-term elections**

Impeachment of the president requires a majority vote in the House of Representatives. There are 435 members of the house. Currently the spread is 239:193 in favour of Republicans over Democrats.

Once the house passes the bill, it is then taken to the Senate. Two-thirds of the senate (67 out of 100 senators) must vote to remove the president. If the result is less than two-thirds, then the president remains in office. This is what happened to Bill Clinton in 1998 and Andrew Johnson in 1868.

Currently the senate is spread 51:47 in favour of the Republicans.

So to effectively impeach and remove Trump, Democrats need at least 25 of the 241 Republican members of the lower house to initially pass the bill, then 20 of the 51 Republican members of the senate to remove the president.

---------------------
**Impeachment after the mid-term elections**

As things stand, it is likely that the Democrats will win control of the House and will thus be able to pass an impeachment bill on their own. But what about removing him in the senate?

33 of the 100 seats in the senate are [up for re-election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2018). Of these, 8 are Republican and 2 independent. If the Democrats managed to win every single senate seat up for election, they will end up with a maximum of 57 seats in the senate - a very powerful position, but not enough to remove the president during impeachment hearings. They would need the votes of 10 of the 43 Republicans left to achieve this.


---------------------
**25th Amendment**

[The amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) was written to codify what would happen if the president were unable to function for some reason. Illness and recovery from an assassination attempt would result in the Vice President becoming the ""Acting President"" until such time as the president recovered and was able to function in his job again.

Reagan (once) and GW Bush (twice), appointed their VPs as acting presidents during medical procedures according to the 25th amendment.

NOTE THE FOLLOWING:

**There is provision within the amendment to prevent a ""palace coup"" by the president's cabinet, namely that the president can communicate with congress (via letter) that he is quite capable of executing his duties as president. When this occurs, the only recourse is for Congress to rule against the president's decision, and this would require a two-thirds majority of BOTH the House AND the Senate.**

---------------------
**Conclusions**

The only way for Trump to be removed from office (assuming that he is unwilling to resign) requires bipartisan support. If we assume all the Democrats vote to remove (either via impeachment or by the president nixing the 25th Amendment), there will always be a need to gain support of a minority of Republicans. And this not only applies to now,  but also after an assumed Democratic victory in the 2018 mid-terms.

My firsts for everything. He was there through my last years of college, and the hardest moment of my life when my dad passed away. There has been a fair share of fights. Indifference. Infidelity. The main reason for our separation is because we’re not where we want to be career-wise. I made the choice to move to a different state where my mom is and maybe go back to school. He’s moving to a different city to better his chances in becoming a cop.  I’d say the separation is a mutual agreement. As much as I want to hate him for hurting me in the past, I forgive him.  I still think of him as an incredible human being. I’m grateful for everything he once was. I wish him all the best and hope to see him at his best self in the future, whether it’s with me or someone else.

9,"Rant:

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, ffs.

One: I just finished watching Bright then went to read the discussion thread over in /r/movies. People are pointing to the low rottentomatoes rating vs the high audience rating as if it's evidence that there's some conspiracy where the studios are paying off critics to give this movie bad ratings to discredit Netflix.  
What's more likely, a bunch of stuffy critics don't like fantasy/action movies with a weak second act^1 but that type of movie appeals to the main demographic of this site, *OR* that every critic who wrote a negative review is on the studios' payroll, not one of them decided to blow the whistle in a media climate that would eat that shit up, they gave stellar reviews to Okja and Beasts of No Nation just to throw us off the conspiracy, and they also spammed the IMDB ratings to make the audience reviews poor there.  
I mean fuck, audiences love the transformers movies which critics hate, is that the studios secretly trying to discredit themselves?

Two: the whole ""facebook records your conversations to sell you ads"" thing. Again, what's more likely: the corporation whose business model involves tracking literally everything you and your friends do online and selling you ads based on it serves you an ad about something your friend may have looked up online once before they talked to you about it, and you remembered that ad because you had a conversation about it (unlike the 10000 other ads you saw that day), and you're just less unique than you think and ads targeted to your demographic may overlap with your conversations, *OR* Facebook decided that your entire internet history wasn't good enough and managed to hack iOS and Android with nobody finding out or leaking anything and decided to do something that's probably illegal due to wiretapping to sell you cat food or whatever.

Ironically, I'm sure a lot of these people want to pretend that reddit is a secret club where they're the only ones that have figured out the truth^2, meanwhile it's the fifth most popular site in the US, and a massive target for social media ad campaigns and political fuckery. But let's just ignore stuff that's actually been proven, right?

11,"A few weeks ago me, my brother, and two of my friends were drinking at my brother’s place. He was going out for a cigarette at one point and i asked if i could have one and he was kind of rude and passive about it but said i could have one any way so i went outside with him to smoke and he was being a dick to me for no apparent reason (aside from asking for a cig? he had been drinking beer i paid for lol) so i decided not to take his attitude and walked back inside snd hung out with my friends until he stormed inside and told me to get out. 

it  upset me that he kicked me out and was being a douchebag, so when i got home after he kicked me out i sent him some “Fuck you” texts which definitely didnt help but i was upset and drunk 



but anyway that whole event has affected our relationship a ton because he DOESNT REMEMBER KICKING ME OUT. To this day he thinks i stormed out snd cursed him out for no reason. I didnt even know he thought that until today. I had one of my friends over who was there that night and she brought it up and recalled it EXACTLY how i did. He doesnt remember it


Even when i tell him this he still denies it. All this contention because he doesnt remember doing the thing that threw our relationship into a whirl. He tells me I recall things differently and get mad about it but hes the one doing it. for example, this situation and another situation after this one where he told my dad i punched him in the face when that just.. did not happen. I didnt touch him 


what do i do? His ego is blocking his ability to see the situations for what they were. I told him one of our friends is a witness to it and brought it up with me exactly how i recall and he still gets mad and denies it... im bummed about this i dont know what to do. I think hes blocked my numbers

15,"Explorations and first sexual contact for me was with a guy over 20 years ago, I’m 33 now and male FYI.

So I’m married now to a woman and these explorations were when I was a preteen and teen but are relived in my mind a lot.

It went from boys hanging out and doing what they do play sports, watch sports, play games, watch tv and movies. Talks about all that and cars and girls and women used to come up and fantasies and desires. Now there used to be 4-5 of us that regular got together because of our families being close. But I was closest to one of the boys let’s call him M. M was about 4-5 years older then me. 

One night it was just my family at Ms house and we were hanging out in the basement like usual and while watching some movie together with some sexual scenes and M asked if I was getting hard which wasn’t uncommon as we all did talk about women around us that we found hot and women in movies etc. I being younger out of the bunch was usually more on the listening side when the older guys were talking about things. But in this case it was just us 2. I said no even tho I was. M said I’m super hard want to see? I declined, but M insisted we show each other and compare “don’t you wanna see what a real dick looked like” he stated teasing me. Both sitting on the couch M pulled his pants down revealing himself fully hard and I noticed his dick was circumcised and I am not. (Around this same age I was discovering my foreskin and bringing it full down and up, I was not shown or told this our cultures aren’t open sexually) 

So being gutsy and teased on I also pulled down my pants and both of us were there cocks out with out parents upstairs and his grandparents down the hall in their room. 

It went from us touching each other to the sexual scene together to getting closer together. He eventually took my hand and placed it on his cock.. clearly a lot bigger and harder than me I was preteen and he was a teen.  I found it interesting he had no foreskin lol and he found it interesting I did. We went from no lips kissing, (folding our lips into our mouths kissing) to soft kisses on the lips. And then we heard a noise and jumped up just before someone coming down  and busting us in the act. Good thing about older houses can hear someone about to enter a room. 

As we got together quite often but not always alone we would at times have to keep it to ourselves at times, but when it was just us two things lead to talks about that night and sexual desires but about women. We also of course got back to where we left off kisses, making out and mutual masturbation. Things then built up to wanting more and him wanting me to blow him. I was ok with the JO sessions and making out but declined the bjs many times before eventually it leading to that. I never let him cum on me or in my mouth and the same went for him never cum on or in him. He used to time me at times for how long I could do it as it wasn’t always my favourite thing and also the attraction to women still was and is in me. Things started to fall off when he would not reciprocate the BJs as much as I would be asked to. Being so young I didn’t quite understand the pleasures and desires and things I know now of course but I do have the desires for mutual jos, bjs and fun again.

It clearly has an impact on my sexual relationships and intimacy now. It has an impact on my mind and desires. It is not something I’m angry about as I would explore again.

18,"This post will be the long one, but please stick around if you can help me. It's a bit complicated and I may be overcomplicating it. 

So, here is the very short version of this but it's far from the whole story: I'm in my early teens and recently I have started thinking about what my fetishes may do long term for my brain. They are *NOT* illegal, not gross (compared to what's probably out there), but I still feel crap about what it may mean for me.
_____________________________
I first started discovering my fetishes by looking at futuristic girls on google (didn't think it had to do anything with sex and things, I just liked them) when I was younger. I probably got into that sort of futuristic/cyborg thing because of cartoons. I only started really discovering that these are so-called fetishes about a year and a half ago, and around that time I started to make a collection of images that I liked. Not too long after that, since my friends were talking about jerking off to porn and how I should try it, I decided to try it out on one of those images and I enjoyed that feeling. Since then, I discovered more of these fetishes besides the futuristic stuff. Here they are (incl. the ones I mentioned):

* Latex (Women in latex clothing)

* Inflatables and pooltoys (drawn inflatables and pooltoys, SFW ones mostly, I find them arousing and cute)

* Robotic (cyborg and android girls)

* Futuristic girls

* Korean girls (not naked, but just pretty, like models or 'racing queens' for example)

* Japanese girls in swimsuit (just what the title says, not fetishy ones) 

_____________________________

So, after that first experience, I have been doing it regularly (sometimes multiple times a day) and been building up a giant collection of these images and now I'm at a 1000+ (everything but inflatables). I went from rabbit hole to rabbit hole, but never went so deep that it affected me as a person in real life and everything (besides that multiple times a day thing) was all good. 

But around this New Year's and january, I started thinking about stopping doing this because of the following:

- The things it may do to the brain

I started reading up on this and I found out that masturbation has some benefits, but on the long term it can act like a drug. I don't want to have an addiction problem, especially not this early in life. At the least, I *have* to stop doing it so many times and I'm already on a couple day break. So far, it seems to be successful.

- The cyborg thing: 
I have a thing for them, but let's face it: They are *objects* designed to like you (if they even had conciousness/real emotions, which is a whole other endless discussion in itself, but I always knew that), and I don't want to treat anyone like that. I'm not one of those Nice Guys(Tm) who sees women as sex objects and wants that and nothing else, and I've never treated anyone that way, but I'm scared that on the long-term, this may flip a switch in my brain that I only see them like that, even if I want to treat everyone like a human. I read that porn has a similar effect, though (go ahead, laugh) I've never watched porn, just images. 

- The inflatables

*sigh*. Why do I even like them? So bizzare (it's nothing compared to what may be out there that's just plain disgusting, but it's just.. weird)! I kind of feel guilty about this.

I go back in a few days which has just brought these feelings to the surface and I have a big group assignment due today and we've barely completed anything.

The course I don't enjoy a single aspect of and am finding it extremely difficult and the university don't offer much support in learning the course.

In my accommodation I don't really have many friends so to speak, we simply live together and that is it when most of my friends from home their main friends come from their accommodation. 

Socially I go out with people on my course at least once a week, but they aren't really ""friends"" so to speak and I only go just to have some form of social life, if we weren't on the same course I wouldn't see us going out.

Everything right now is telling me to drop out, move back home and get a job because honestly I'm only really here out of family pressure.

31,"I am 19 year old male who has a serious depression for living in country like Egypt and I always wish that I was born somewhere else in Europe or USA. There's multiple reasons for hating to live there. The first one is because of the extreme sexual repression I mean there's very few open minded people in Egypt due to religious reasons. Because of Islam every male can hardly talk to any women and if he did they consider it rape. Unlike foreign countries which anybody can have sex anytime with anybody. That explains why Egypt tops the world countries in watching porn because of the sexual repression and we don't have open minded women who could make us less horny. Another example is for countries like Saudi Arabia there's Hella lots of gay people because of that niqap that almost every woman there wears it that every male there hardly even know that women looks like

I was actually Muslim but turned atheist that's why I say such things  I mean I don't care about religion anymore but what makes it worse is that I hide that from my family and even my close friends. If they ever know that I'd be the most hated person for them and that increases my desire to move to west because they are more acceptable to atheism

One of the other reasons for hating living there is because of slow internet, everything is insanely increasing in prices by the time, no hot chicks, bullshit educational system which needs a whole thread about it. 

Another reason is that I am more into Americans and Europeans culture as I only watch Hollywood or any foreign movies although my country tops the middle East in making movies but I still watch foreign movies. Even as a kid I watched America's cartoon shows like spongebob, courage, fairly odd parents and also Disney movies and Pixar movies. i am even more into christians holidays like Christmas and Halloween more than Muslim ones not because of religion but because I am more interested in your culture. I also always dream that I will move to the USA one day and live like a normal citizen since I was a kid

Well, we didn't had any contact, but then 1 year ago he smh became my phone number and we've met sometimes. He has completly changed, like I've changed completly too and we had nothing in common, except for the fact that we were best friends since elementary. 

I've never had fun hanging out with him, bc we had completly other interests. His only interests were his gf, fast food and rap and it was imposible to talk to him to topics, that go futher. Also he never got any interesting stories. Basically he is uneducated ,never experienced anything and also talks like a foreigner that only speaks German for 1 year, but he sometimes wanted to hang out and bc he was my best friend, I thought ""fuck it"" and did it most of the time. He always wanted just to lurk in the city and that's it. 

I never wanted to be a douche to him or block him or anything like that, bc it's quite sad to lose a friend from childhood, you know, so recently he wanted to hang out again and so that I don't waste my time that much, I've offered him to do something else except hanging out. He got pissed off and wanted to lurk again. 

Fine - so I've offered him to go to a different place, which I really like, but he never have been. It's in a different city district, but he didn't wanted to do that and smh got pissed off at me, bc his furthest place he wants to hang out should be in the distance of 2-3 metro stations and since I don't want to hang out with him in always the same park/street, he stopped responding.

Tbh I don't want to hang out with him (i often hate it ), but it would be sad to break the contact with him. what should i do?",07Jan2018,8
36,"I don't know how to describe it I have just ran out of ammo. It's no longer anxiety it's no longer depression I just feel defeated.

37,"For almost a week, I’ve cried every single day. This is different because I never cry. I think I am having a mental breakdown and things keep piling up. Like school, my self worth, my eating habits, or simply just agitation with people. Can I have some advice or maybe reasons why I am like this?",07Jan2018,14
41,"My store closed down this week. I was the general manager of one store in a local chain of restaurants. My store wasn't the busiest by any means, but it did well enough. The other day our owner came in and closed early on a Friday night to deliver the news. He is transferring us all to other stores in the company or we can just quit. My wife is due in less than a month with our second kid and I am either jobless or demoted in a company that I'm not sure how I feel about anymore. I was going to make 2018 my year after a very rough 2016-17, but it isn't looking great so far. Ranting here about it because I'm too embarrassed to face any of my friends or family seeing as I was the manager who was blindsided and new nothing about his own store going down.",07Jan2018,12

Most of my spare time is spent browsing craigslist for job openings, but I already have a job! Two jobs, in fact! I have no idea why I do this but I just cant stop. 

I also just purchased two kayaks. I always have two kayaks because I actually use them very often, but for some reason I constantly find myself online browsing more kayaks to buy. I know I'll never actually buy them, I dont even plan on buying them, but I just cant stop browsing them.

I just cant take myself away from Amazon or Craigslist, browsing stuff I never even plan on purchasing. What is wrong with me",07Jan2018,1

Today, I blew out what looked like a little wolf spider onto my counter. It was a horrifying lunch.

50,"For the past year and a bit I've been going to amateur spoken word evenings, mostly to support friends, but I've also performed some readings from books - I'm in the minority here though, as most of what I've heard performed is poetry - amateur poetry mostly, but occasionally by poet laureates.

At first I thought it was an amazing community of creatives... Poetry isn't usually my thing, but I can appreciate a good piece - and this is a mixed bag.

Unfortunately some of the 'genuine' attitudes of the poets I've begun to see through - a lot of the poets I've spoken to and socialised with are ""over-nice"" - and to me it's a bit strange and a little off, as though they're over-compensating...  I've since worked out that this is for the purpose of self-promotion - it's all about their image and approachability.

The poets don't often socialise with me outside of these nights, and when they do it's always because they *want something* from me. 

I've soon realised too that many of these people are 'mock-intellectuals' or 'pseudo-intellectuals', vain or narcissistic in a really unexpected way, it feels like we're all ten or twenty years younger and they're trying to prove themselves to a bunch of classmates. One of them sells matchboxes for $12 with a line of her poems written on each one - on a typewriter, because she won't use a computer. The pretentiousness of these poets is ridiculous. The most bizarre thing is that they must be selling... She also owns a pet snail and likes to describe herself as a faerie. 

I really, really try and like people, especially people who are pleasant towards me, but something about the self-importance and pretentiousness of these people is making me feel very uncomfortable, and whilst they're nice to my face, I'm almost certain that behind my back it's a different matter altogether - clearly if I'm posting about it then I'm guilty of the same though.",07Jan2018,18

55,"I can't help thinking that I should feel like the rest of my peers. I'm an 18 year old female, and everyone else is getting out there, midway through first year of University, loving life. Enjoying the constant drinking, enjoying learning about their chosen subject in depth. 

But I'm completely disillusioned. I've had depression since I was 13, or for nearly 6 years now. Been medicated for two of them, I was in therapy but stopped in June (being referred to start again). I'm doing a degree I hate, which I've decided to change but it means I'll be starting all over again in September. I do drugs occasionally, which is the only time I actually feel happy. The rest of the time I'm in a near constant state of numbness. If not the numbness, it's a deep aching in my chest. I'm not sure which is worse.

I have a chronic health condition that is incurable but not life threatening. I can't help wishing it was life threatening, and then I feel shitty for thinking it. I want to kill myself, very much, but I know I'd hurt my family and all of the other bullshit I tell myself because I'm too much of a pussy to follow through with it. 

I miss my teen years, because my depression completely destroyed them and I never got a chance to enjoy myself. I feel like I've majorly missed out. I am not excited about the future. I can see it from here - an 8-5 job that I struggle through because of my illness to make money to do..what? I'm going to start 3 years again, get into even more debt, to study law and..become a solicitor? Sit at home with my husband, my children? Go on holiday occasionally, wish I'd done something differently, have constant regrets, hate going to work everyday, live for the weekends just so I can nap and watch TV? 

I'm completely disillusioned with life. I have friends but I've begun totally withdrawing from them because some (not all) are complete fucking narcissists. They brag non-stop about their degree, their friends, how amazing their Uni experience is, or their new job is, etc etc and not ONCE do they ask how anyone else is doing. I mention one thing in my life like, 'hey I've started new medication' and without even pretending to care they start bragging about some other shit that I don't give a fuck about. I'm sorry, but I do not give a flying fuck what grade you got in one piece of coursework, if you don't give a shit what my doctor said about my deteriorating physical and mental health. 

I just don't know. I hate being alive. I really, really hate it. I don't like doing anything. I don't enjoy showering, I don't like waking up. I wake up, fill my days with pointless internet garbage, try to get up the energy to reply to people, try to have conversations. I'm angry and everyone and everything and most of all I'm so, so sad that I have to keep living every single day because I'm too much of a loser to just end it. 

And I'm so dumb I'm crying whilst writing this. I just want it all to end. God, I would do anything to just have someone shoot me in my head. And it's not like it goes away. I mean, I've been better. I've gotten out of the depression. But it always - ALWAYS - comes back. It's done it for six years. Every time I think it's gone it comes back and it's even harder than before and one day I'm gonna crack.

Sorry for this, I just really needed to rant. ",07Jan2018,7
57,"Growing up, my father would occasionally lose his temper and go on a full blown, verbally abusive tirade.  It was always scary.  Today he admitted to me he thought it was normal.  This made me nervous around him over time and still does when he yells.  He hit me a couple of times and I never hit back.  Sometimes he threw around my belongings or would call me names like ""fat ass"" or ""fucking stupid"".  He would just do his best to make me feel better later by buying me toys or something else I wanted and I would think everything was okay until he would start yelling again another time.  Eventually I knew it would keep hapening and I began to keep my distance from him.  

I'm a grown man now (late 20s).  He yelled at me and said some very mean things to me last year that were very unwarranted.  I wanted to hit him.  I was shaking with rage.  Instead I walked away and stopped talking to him until he said he was sorry.  He told me he wouldn't do it again, just like all of the other times, but he did it again.  He always depends on me to do some things for him and I'm happy to help.  

My dad lived a hard life growing up.  His father abused him physically and he experienced some other trauma. He dropped out of high school and worked a middle class job for most of his early adulthood until he lost his job in middle age.  Now he works a minimum wage job.  

There were times when he would tell me that I should give up college and just get a job at a retail store and ""work my way up"".  He doesn't know that you still need to go to university to be able to even be considered to be allowed to work your way up in a company.  In his mind, mediocrity is okay.  That's not what I want for my life.  I made that very clear to him.

A month ago he yelled at me again and I tried to reason with him but he wouldn't listen.  Again, I walked away.  I had special plans for yesterday that I had planned in advance. Both he and my mother got sick so I cancelled and stood with them at home to take care of them.  I told him today what I sacrificed in order to take care of them.  He likes to say I am useless or don't do anything to help when I actually do a lot.  Unfortunately, I don't have my dream job yet and it's going to be a bit before it finally happens.  I've been applying for jobs everywhere that I am interested in and I am still hearing back from various companies.  Considering I took care of him and let it be known that I cancelled my plans to take care of him, I thought it would be a good time to finally have a civil discussion with him about his behavior over the years.  I don't know how much longer he'll be here nor do I know how much time I have left.  I told him we were going to have a civil discussion and that he would not yell or talk over me like he always does.

I asked him why he thought it was okay to always yell at me and he said he thought it was normal.  I told him it wasn't and that it's very disrespectful and that it's verbal abuse.  He said I need to let go of that stuff but he is very guility of holding grudges with his own family.  One of his brothers yelled at him in adulthood and instead of working things out he wrote his brother off and never spoke to him again.  I asked him why, then, it's wrong for me to have similar feelings.  He also thinks I'm lying when I tell him about the work I am doing towards getting a better career.  I told him I'm not lying and that it's hard to explain the effort that goes into it considering he never went beyond high school.  I told him of all the sacrifices I have to make just to keep up with the work I have to do for school.  I told him that he's more than welcome to come with me to a job fair so he can see what it's like these days.  

Then I asked him two questions I was always afraid to ask because I know they go deep for him.  He lost his brother when he was young but his brother was not a good man.  I asked him why he always talks about him like he's great and he says it's because he's ""his brother"" but that he knows he also isn't good.  I know his father would abuse him and his brothers when he was young and I asked him why he never hit him back.  My father began to cry and said he was afraid of him.  I told him that's how I feel when he yells at me even as I got older.  My father then rambled about life not being fair and hates having to work everyday and doesn't want to live anymore.  He told me that he tells my mother that he wishes he would die already so he doesn't have to deal with life anymore.  It was here that I realized that my father's problems go deeper than I thought.  He is a sad man and I don't think he is willing to get the help he needs.  I think he buries his emotions.  To make it worse, he takes things out on me.  I had to make it clear that wasn't allowed at all anymore.",07Jan2018,2
