0,How did everyones Chirstmas go yesterday? Honestly I just want to talk to someone,27Dec2018,1
1,"-Thinking of staying for around 3 nights
-Planning on a solo adventure
-Love photography, cities, and quirky/random opportunities

Thank you, I'm struggling hard with this decision",27Dec2018,1
2,"so last weekend I was over at a friend's house and he brought a new friend of his that I haven't met before. he introduced me to her and as the night on we got pretty flirty and when everyone went to bed we slept together (not sexually), making out and cuddling. so now I have feelings for her and I think she shares the same feelings towards me.

the problem is that before she met me she was talking to someone else that she had feelings for, but she just informed me that she doesn't know about those feelings (for the specific person) anymore. so now I feel kinda shitty because I made her feel conflicted and also because there's a possibility that she'll choose this other guy over me. so idk what should I do/say",27Dec2018,1
3,"One of my co-workers told me she thoughti was the sweetest thing. She says I'm always smiling and never let costumers see me upset and I'm a great waitress and hostess! I hugged and thanked her bc that actually meant a lot to me considering how lately I've just been getting upset about nothing, or stupid stuff, I'm glad to not be taking it out on others!! Sometimes I'd say something and think I'd think I was being harsh but apparently I've been doing well about it! Idk why this made me so happy",27Dec2018,1

5,"Before I get into my details, I would like to say that I made a post about this issue complaining about everything a couple of days ago blaming my parents in a hostile, emotionally fueled manner in a reaction to an event I found out. This was probably not the wisest course of action (especially around the holidays) considering that people reading it hypothetically could‚Äôve lost family members and friends and all of had something else rough going on in their life‚Äôs before Christmas. It probably wasn‚Äôt the right subreddit for it either. I was called put downs like ‚Äúbrat‚Äù and ‚Äúungrateful baby‚Äù and all of that, which was probably deserved for the manner I wrote it in. And it was wrong, I‚Äôll admit that. But I believe I‚Äôm the exact opposite of those comments considering what I see around me. Now let me dive into the story.

NOTE: Please, please don‚Äôt read this if something dramatic has happened in your life recently, this is little shit compared to what you‚Äôve experienced, just a warning. I‚Äôm sorry. Thanks. I don‚Äôt want to sound like an asshole again.

So, I‚Äôm stuck on a trip living with my fathers family, me and my mother are not fans of the trip and its length. We had to drive for 1.5 days to another part of the country to spend 1.5 weeks living in the same house as my fathers side. Note, this is not that fair to my mother either considering she has a limited amount of days off from her job and would only get one vacation day at home. Also she misses out on seeing her side of the family on Christmas and a lot of people in her family are getting up there in age.

Personally, I enjoy being around my moms side of the family so much more on Christmas Eve and seeing my cousins there, since I don‚Äôt see them that often. Yes I don‚Äôt see my dads side either, but this could easily be solved by a plane trip ticket on Christmas Day. Now, that was probably the part that irked/will irk some people. But, all my cousins on my dads side were able to nicely fly into the area for Christmas Day. Also, I missed going to a NFL with my friends who all had amazing seats. This part irked me because I don‚Äôt see my friends from home often considering I go to college in a city 2, 4 hours away from them.

Now another extremely irking part. All of them were able to bring a friend/significant other with them. Was I? Nope. They also get their parents to pay for trips for them to go out of the country with friends a couple of times each year. For example, Individual 1 got to take his SO to Cancun, Hawaii, and now Egypt over the past 2 years. I would be lucky if I could go on a trip 2 hours away for a day. Then, my uncle (I2) allows my other cousin (I3) to drink all the time and do whatever shit she wants. And he encourages her underage drinking. Everything you can imagine. Yes, I am happy my parents raised me that I‚Äôm not going to do stupid shit like that in the future, but Am I wrong for feeling angry about this?

I want to ask you guys how you feel about this, I feel like I have a right to be upset that my cousins get all of these perks in life while I‚Äôm stuck writing this post alone by myself tonight. All I want is not to feel like I‚Äôm not wasting the enjoyable years of my life (college age). My mom has come to my side and says that I can take a friend down next year and fly after Christmas. And I‚Äôm so thankful for that.

But really, should I have the right to be upset. Please, please- I need feedback and opinions on my situation. Any age, sex whatever is fine. However, if you think I‚Äôm a ‚Äúbrat‚Äù for feeling this way, please explain why and how I‚Äôm twisting this. Constructive criticism is completely fair game to me, no personal insults. If you have read this far, thank you so much and have a great last week of 2018.

TL;DR- My cousins are spoiled as crap, should I have the right to feel angry that I can‚Äôt get treatment even close to what they receive.? I wouldn‚Äôt even want my parents to pay for ridiculous trips out of the country. But I would like to receive the perks like taking a plane with a friend for a week for Winter Break once. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs asking for too much.",27Dec2018,1

8,You know how every so often you‚Äôre hit with the sudden realization that everyone you love is going to die someday? And that you‚Äôre also going to die someday? Then after you imagine how everyone would react given a certain persons death and how that death would affect you and their loved ones? In detail? I do that every single day and it‚Äôs so exhausting. I want to just enjoy a moment with my family without bursting into tears at the thought of losing them. I‚Äôve thought about my death and various family members death in immense detail daily for the past two months and I hate living like this.  I‚Äôm fucking miserable. ,27Dec2018,1
9,"Hi reddit... this is my first time on here, and I honestly never intended to post this but its 3am again and I have no one to talk to - this is my last resort. 

I met a guy when I was on vacation when I was 12 years old (in 2012), he was 2 years older but we got on really well. We stayed in touch until this year, Skyping a couple of times a year but never meeting in person. For some reason I always considered him a close friend of mine, and the fact that we didn‚Äôt see each other in person didn‚Äôt matter to me. This year, he finally had the chance to come visit me in my country, and it was amazing to see him again - not at all awkward or weird and we clicked like old friends.  

One night I we went out together and I ended up getting pretty drunk - I am something of a lightweight. I told him he could crash at mine since he was unfamiliar with the city and public transport can be tricky at night. I have a big bed so I‚Äôm used to sharing it with friends, guys and girls included and there is enough space to sleep unbothered. 

Anyway, we went back to my place and I grabbed an oversized shirt and gave it to him to sleep in. I took one for myself, still very drunk and put it on, leaving on my underwear - these are the clothes I usually sleep in, even when my friends are around because I trust them. I then crawled into bed, him next to me and turned away from him, passing out. 

I woke up what felt like sometime later, uncomfortable and quickly realized that his fingers were inside me. I was so terrified I froze completely and waited for it to be over. I vividly remember crying silently into my pillow and praying that he wouldn‚Äôt notice that he was awake, I was just so scared. I remember waiting for it to end, and eventually just passing out again. I still don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the furthest he went. 

The next morning he acted as though nothing had happened, and he was so casual that I began doubting myself, but the memories kept coming back to me throughout the day, vividly. I didn‚Äôt ask him about it and still feel guilty when I don‚Äôt reply to his messages. 

I know it happened a while ago but I was honestly just so busy with school that I had no time to think about it. Now I‚Äôm less busy and it comes back to me every time I lay in my bed. I can‚Äôt sleep at night because all I do is remember the feeling of being so terrified and sobbing into my pillows. I‚Äôm also scared to sleep because it comes to me in my dreams. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know how to feel about it. I keep wondering if it‚Äôs my fault for not telling him to stop or confronting him about it, but he acts as though it never happens so it makes me feel as though I‚Äôm overreacting. I also trusted him so much that I sometimes can‚Äôt associate that night with him mentally. 
I really just don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm so tired and all I want is to be able to sleep again. ",27Dec2018,1

14,"It took me a while to get around to watching it (I'd heard it definitely didn't live up to the first 2) but on a boxing day with nothing to do I decided to browse Netflix and ended up watching it.

Frankly, it holds up - all the shenanigans, all the heart. There's something about watching a man-child like Alan turn his life around that really resonated with me. On the one hand, I'm concerned with the amount I find myself relating to Alan, on the other hand: I've a clean criminal record and I've never roofie'd anyone or accidentally murdered a Giraffe, so I'm probably not as close as my concerns lead me to fear.

15,"I expect I'll get a lot of answers here telling me to back to /r/lewronggeneration, and I suppose that's fair. But I often wish I had been born in an earlier year rather than the late 90s. I feel very lost and confused in the 21st century. I don't understand social media or peoples obsession with it (I guess that as a redditor this is a little hypocritical on my part), and I don't understand the ""anything goes"" super liberal mentality most everybody seems to have these days. It seems like shame is dead. There's nothing wrong with being so fat you can't walk -- the other person is just fat shaming! If you call somebody out for being incredibly lazy, it's your fault for being elitist! 

I am very fearful of our future, I worry that things will only get worse and worse. I fear rising automation will take my job from me (I work in retail and didn't finish high school, let alone college). I would have liked to have children some day but I couldn't bring them into our world. I just wish I could fall asleep and never wake up.

I love listening to old music and watching older media, particularly wartime stuff. But I'm not completely deluded, I know that we only remember/romanticize the beautiful things amongst all the horror and bloodshed of war (I confess that I think the women were much prettier back then though, lol).

Hello void, let me vent. 

When I think I‚Äôm better, I fucking spiral downhill again. I do the best alone. Maybe that‚Äôs because I can hide my depression from myself very well. Or maybe I‚Äôm just content with being by myself. Can‚Äôt get hurt when all you got is yourself. But introduce me to someone that I may be interested in and BOOM my brain gets all fuzzy and I can‚Äôt fucking be happy. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been happy. I‚Äôm so tired of it. I‚Äôm sick and tired of going through each and every day like a god damn robot. 

Dude and I get it, I have so much to live for. I have this and I have that, but you know what bitch I‚Äôm still not happy. Sex doesn‚Äôt make me happy, the dick doesn‚Äôt fucking make me happy. My career doesn‚Äôt make me happy, rewarding but not happy. School doesn‚Äôt make me happy. I don‚Äôt even like my family so they don‚Äôt make my happy. My limited supply of friends don‚Äôt even make me happy. I workout for therapy, I eat well for my wellbeing. I do all this self-growth and self-love shit and I‚Äôm still not fucking happy. Dude it‚Äôs been 3 years. I‚Äôve been working on myself for 3 years, how am I gonna survive my whole lifetime. 

I get it, I have to make myself happy first but how tf can I when I dissociate my whole fucking life away and I‚Äôm empty. I feel so empty. I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore. It‚Äôs so hard.  ",27Dec2018,1
27,"I grew up in a small private school where each grade had about 30 kids, and it was common for about 5-10 kids from each class to remain a student there from kindergarten all the way through graduation. Our school would call these students Flyers(I guess because our mascot was a hawk), and most of my family had attended this school throughout their life so it was almost a tradition to go there and be a ‚ÄúFlyer‚Äù. I know this might sound weird, but it‚Äôs just what I grew up being accustomed to and the classes were always relatively easy so I never complained. I could write a whole page about the weird traditions and things I had to put up with there but that‚Äôs a post for another day.

Anyways, way back in kindergarten I made a friend named Andrew. Andrew was basically had the same setup as me and we both knew we would be at this school until we graduated. We had a lot of fun playing together and became best friends almost immediately. This was great while we were kids, but things started to change when we got into high school. 

This brings me to the point of this post. As Andrew grew older, a specific part of his personality always stood out and bothered me. He seemed to find little insecurities about people, such as an embarrassing memory, and always keep these thoughts in the back of his mind. The purpose for this was that if he ever got into an argument with someone, no matter how small or petty, he would immediately reach into his memory, recall that embarrassing insecurity, and throw it into their face causing the argument to go from 0-100 *immediately*. The thing was though, that he was generally a really nice and funny guy so he rarely got into these types of altercations with people. I guess this initially stood out to me because I‚Äôve always been the type of person who, if confronted, will try to say something witty or deflect entirely and walk away.

This tactic of his was painfully obvious sometimes because the embarrassing memory would be occasionally be something that everyone else had completely forgotten about. This would cause everyone that witnessed the argument to have a split second of ‚Äúhmmm, where the hell did that come from?‚Äù I guess I should give an example of one of these arguments for clarity, so I‚Äôll use one of the first ones that targeted me.

I think we were about 13 at the time, and Facebook was just becoming popular. All of my friends and I made an account and had a great time in the earlier days of social media when there were almost no adults at all on the site. This was also the time that I really started taking interest in girls and wanting to date. I remember there was this particular girl that I had a huge crush on named Rachel. I was friends with Rachel on Facebook and being a weird little 13 year old, I found a feature that was basically a primitive version of the ‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù button. What it did was send you a text message on your phone anytime that person updated their status and tell you what it said so you wouldn‚Äôt have to go pull up your laptop and check(remember, no smartphones yet). So every time she‚Äôd post I‚Äôd get a little text on my phone and I had the option to like or comment by replying to the text. So flash forward about a year and a half into the future, I get into a little argument with Andrew in the middle of class. I can‚Äôt even remember how it started so it must have not been anything super serious. But as usual, it immediately escalated as Andrew came out of nowhere with, ‚ÄúAt least I‚Äôm not the one who stalks Rachel on Facebook with updates on my phone‚Äù. Rachel happened to be in this particular class and needless to say my face turned turned blood red. Thank god I was close enough to her at this point where I could call her after school and explain what he was talking about(not fun).

All I could think during that situation was, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck?! How in the hell does that even remotely apply to this situation?‚Äù How did he even figure out about it? And more importantly, why did he decide to bring it up a year and a half after I actually did it? This was basically him in a nutshell every time he got in an argument with anyone. You may ask yourself, why would you continue to be friends with someone like that? But as I stated before, I went to a very small school. It was either spend a few days pissed off and get over it, or see him every day in my classes for the rest of high school and try to avoid him at every turn. Like I said, stuff like this didn‚Äôt happen with him a lot because he was generally a nice and funny guy so it was hard to stay mad.

So, one of the other weird things about our school/town is that when most of us graduate, we generally all go to the same college located nearby. This brings us to present day. Andrew and I are 21, and we still usually see each other at friendly gatherings and the local college bars.
The only thing is that Andrew has changed a lot. He is generally a lot more unstable when it comes to the way he acts in arguments. He still has the same problem of blowing up on people for the tiniest little things. Being in college, he can‚Äôt use his ‚Äúmemory tactic‚Äù on random strangers, so nowadays he just comes up with whatever super offensive thing he can think of in the moment and leaves. Thankfully, I rarely have to see him anymore due to us having different majors.

I guess my reason for this post is to ask what you guys think could the cause for this? What would cause someone to act like this from such a young age? Could it be insecurity? He‚Äôs not like a male model or anything, but he‚Äôs certainly never had any trouble finding a girlfriend that he likes. Thanks for any help in understanding this. I think I really just wanted to get most of this off my chest as I‚Äôve thought about it for years, but only recently found out about reddit and communities like this one.

39,"Just a little post about my realization about my 2-year relationship.

Lately, I‚Äôve been in a slump. I‚Äôve read so many successful relationship posts about other people and their SO‚Äôs and couldn‚Äôt help but feel resentful towards my SO because I felt like he did not reciprocate my love for him towards me.

We are on our 2nd year of dating and it‚Äôs been kind of rough for me. School gets in the way (we go to a design school, so design jobs can get pretty competitive, especially in what he wants to do so he tries extra hard in his work) but I can‚Äôt help but feel angry when our classmates can go and spend time with their SOs while we just sit in silence doing our work all the time. I felt like our 2nd year was just full of me feeling sad because he wasn‚Äôt loving me as much as he used to when we first started dating.

But after reflection tonight and listening to podcasts about relationships, my mind became clearer. I was reminded about his established intentions that he made in the beginning of our relationship (school first, and that no matter what, he just wants me to succeed and he wished for me to feel the same. I agreed). I wrote down a list of ways he loves me (corny, I know) but it really helped a lot. It made me realize that I was expecting too much out of him (e.g. expecting him to read my mind and to know what I want) and that he does love me a lot through the ways he shows me. 

I was also reminded that he showed me a lot of love during our first year of dating because well, it was the honeymoon phase, which lasted a year, and our freshman year of college was so much more chill than it is now. 

When people say ‚Äúyou have to love yourself before you can love others‚Äù, I think today was when I actually fully understood that phrase. I realized that I should not depend on my SO for happiness or for my confidence.

If you don‚Äôt know, heteroromantic bi means that I am sexually attracted to both men and women, but only romantically attracted to the opposite sex, so I could never date or marry a girl. Since I would only ever date men, would I be accepted in the LGBTQ+ community? Or am ‚Äútoo close to straight‚Äù to be considered a member?

46,"I feel like I should start writing down some of my thoughts more and this seems to be a good place for feedback. So here‚Äôs a humble service announcement I‚Äôd love for you to read...

I‚Äôve found that just because we don‚Äôt understand how we do something doesn‚Äôt mean we aren‚Äôt capable or guilty of already doing it. 
Think of it like breathing. We don‚Äôt completely understand how we make ourselves take in air and exhale, when we aren‚Äôt paying attention to it. Yet somehow we do it anyway. When we pay attention we have the ability to control it (to an extent).

This happens for both good and bad things, the important fact to remember is that when we put our attention in the right place we can realise what we are actually doing and make corrections if need be. We are capable of a lot more than we could possibly conceive. Consciousness isn‚Äôt a fixed automation or calculation, it‚Äôs just us... forever changing and evolving. 
Utilise others perspectives to better our own. Don‚Äôt be stubborn, be open. Open to the fact that nobody is perfect every second of everyday. 
We are all guilty of doing things that hurt others or ourselves without conscious recognition. 
This doesn‚Äôt have to be the case as much as it is in today‚Äôs world. It‚Äôs only when we pay attention to the all the right things and properly distinguish, seperate, eradicate and replace the bad with good that we can really experience true perfection. 
At least that‚Äôs what I think...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",27Dec2018,1
47,"I have no idea why, but recently, im jumping a lot more when I turn corners. I‚Äôve done it occasionally for as long as I can remember but in the last several months it‚Äôs gotten ridiculous. I just went to the toilet in the library and when I go to turn the corner into the door a short woman pops out from the women‚Äôs toilets and it startled me so much I gasped out loud. Every fucking time I turn a corner, I have to slow right the fuck down, but it doesn‚Äôt help one bit, I‚Äôd say it even scares me more, as the anticipation of if somebody‚Äôs going to come round makes me explode when they eventually do. 



It‚Äôs so fucking embarrassing, I literally stop in my tracks with a little jump, widen my eyes, and sometimes even gasp. In the last like 3 months it‚Äôs been AT-LEAST 90% of all the times I‚Äôve turned a corner.

I was up till about midnight and was extremely dizzy. Like it took me about 5 minutes just to walk from the bed to the bathroom door (which is literally right next to my bed) because I couldn‚Äôt walk straight and felt like a weight was holding me down. Anyway this morning I was talking with my mom and she mentioned how both her and my stepdad each were really dizzy last night too.

 I was into someone else and so was she.

Things would fall through and we‚Äôd reach out for one another. Somehow I just blocked having any feelings towards her. Idk why, I was hurt before so I was afraid of that again. Years later, since the past few months I started to realize I felt something.

Shes always been there, always had companionship with her. 

 It only made sense. Its been years since I first met her and I realized the last girl I attempted to date, I didn‚Äôt want to, because my friend was the most real person Ive known.

But the problem arised when this new guy cane i to her job. She became all sprung on him. Crazy thing is that shes 27 and he‚Äôs 20. But supposedly mature for his age.

  I had to do something and asked her out on a date(bad timing). She said she only saw me as a friend. And the whole time thats how I saw her.
Til recently. Told her it changed when I realized she stuck around this whole time and I felt I took her for granted.

 She still stayed close and still hits me up to go out. We went to the movies on Sunday(her idea).

 But as of Christmas. Based on her stories on IG, it seems like its become real between her and that dude. They‚Äôre vague, but I hid thr stories and her posts just to avoid the inevitable heartache. Im still there for her, but J don‚Äôt wanna know about him.

I dug myself a hole, only because it made sense.
This guy just had to exist, and I cant wrap my mind around it. Because my reality is all uncertainty. Her‚Äôs is a fairy tale and im sure shes ob cloud 9 with this guy.

59,"I like to tell myself that the first 25 years of my life were a mulligan. The experiences and hardships molded the person standing here today. There is absolutely no comparison between the person who I was then vs now. One day I had enough, and I forced change cold turkey. There were setbacks, there were failures, tears, lost friendships, and more pain than I ever thought to be imaginable. There is no excuse for my actions in the past, and I have to live with the choices I have made; however, I overcame; I continued to build momentum, and I finished what I set out to do.

I finished high school with a 2.5 gpa, a healthy cigarette addiction, and the self confidence of a chipmunk. I weighed 145lbs, rounded shoulders, and could barely look someone in the eye to hold a conversation. I was angry, painfully shy, zero direction, and hated people more than I hated myself. There's more.. 

My late teens and early twenties did get much better. I developed a drinking problem and used hard drugs semi regularly. I was manipulative toward women, a blatant narcissist, compulsive liar, and was smoking a pack a day. I was in and out of school, regularly dropping classes and disappointing my parents. I was a total mess.. running from previous sexual abuse. Burying a tortured soul beneath layers of wrong doing, manipulation, and substance abuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

At 25 I had enough. Dec 23 2016 I was sitting on the couch, suffering with the flu. While craving a cigarette and a drink I stopped myself right there. I haven't had a smoke since. With it, my desire for alcohol and drugs subsided. I broke down to a friend. I told her how much pain I was in, and what I was running from. Before too long I put myself in a shrinks office, and began to confront my demons. I began to exercise, eat right, reteach myself social skills and how to respect others, and continued my education...

I'm now 27 years old. I proudly stand at 6'1 170lbs. This May I will complete my degree in Mechanical Engineering with a 3.0. I go to the gym 3-5 times per week. I have close friends I consider to be my family. I have repaired friendships which I had burned to the ground, and apologized to those who I hurt most. I can look someone in the eye with confidence, proud of the person I am becoming and tell my story. I am a person who deserves to be happy, and for the first time in my life.. I'm starting to feel what happiness feels like.",27Dec2018,1
60,"This happened a little after 1:00 am on Christmas this week. My husband and I went out to celebrate Christmas Eve. We got a hotel in a bigger city nearby and had a great evening at a restaurant downtown. As it turned out, a couple of our friends were also in town and just a few blocks away. We met up for a couple drinks, which turned into more than a couple. At the end of the night, my hubby and I made our way back to the hotel and eventually fell asleep.

I was passed the fuck out sleeping and suddenly I heard a little tapping at the door. Must be next door or something. I angrily fell back asleep.

Suddenly the knocking sounded loud and desperate, and half asleep, I throw open the door.

It's my husband standing there.

He's NAKED.

Totally, completely buck-ass fucking naked. Hands over his package.

There's a security guard and some other guy.

""Ma'am, is this your husband, he claims he locked himself out?""

The other one said ""Yeah and he just fucking woke me up.""

My glasses-clad only husband squealed ""Marcy I tried heading to the bathroom and went out the wrong door!""

Despite being half-drunk and half-asleep, I laughed. I laughed out loud. So loud it must have echoed down the hall.

There he is. My 31 year old husband. Not fat but that slight round belly he always hides under shirts out for all to see. Desperately covering himself with his hands. Bare from head to toe.

""Marcy please let me in this hallway is freezing I've been out here for over 10 minutes!""

10 minutes??? NAKED???? I laughed harder.

""Yeah yeah, nature boy is with me. Now get in here.""

He rushed past into the room, and I couldn't help it. There it was, just out for all to see, his bare ass. That round butt I have to admit I always loved.

I leaned back and gave him the SMACK of all-time as both guys laughed.

The hotel actually gave us a pretty hefty bill for violating noise ordinances and indecent exposure, no joke. But it might be worth it.

Maybe the funniest thing I've ever seen that I will never, EVER let him live down lol.",27Dec2018,1
61,"Hi,
(This is NOT a joke)
I don‚Äôt go on reddit much, but I know y‚Äôall are good at looking into creepy stuff, so here goes.
I was watching youtube videos with my girlfriend. I have a macbook pro. I know for a fact the webcam light was off when we started. I looked up in the middle of a video to see the camera light on, indicating the camera being activated. I quickly covered it with my thumb and looked to see if there were any apps with access to my camera open. There weren‚Äôt.
I shut down the computer, waited a few minutes, and then turned it back on. When I turned it back on, it was in the middle of some kind of software update (the camera light wasn‚Äôt on). Looked official, but I didn‚Äôt approve any software update. I just shut it down again after that.
I‚Äôm guessing this is some kind of malware.
The reason I‚Äôm posting this here is because we were watching the dark side of the internet videos when this happened, so... figured it was fitting.
Also, this won‚Äôt post on my wifi. Have to go off of it. Eek.
Took me a few tries to post it too...? Now I‚Äôm getting freaked out...
Anyone have ideas about what it could be and how to stop it?
Thanks.

62,"We have a newly graduate P.E and Arts teacher in the start of the year and he is smOkIn hAwt. A lot of girls had their eyes on him but as time passed, they all just saw him as ""the good looking teacher"" but it was different for me. I'm scared that maybe I have this obsession but I really hope it's just a teenage teacher crush that'll soon pass. I'm not too discrete about my crush on him with my friends because it's just a crush and it's illegal to have a teacherXstudent relationship anyway and I have my limits lol. Soon enough, he also knew about it, my whole class teased me during his class, and even other teachers that I'm close  with joined in too. It didn't bother me though, I'm actually amazed from their response. But because of that I got super shy around him and sometimes would completely ignore him when we walk past each other. I just simply slip in a short ""Good morning."" There are times where I lose all my shame and full on show him that I do have a crush on him hahahaha but ofc I regret doing it right after. There was this recent event in our school and I gathered the courage to ask him for a picture, and I did! I was really happy about it and would keep looking at the picture whenever I took hold of my phone. He even put his arm around my shoulder sjsksjsksjsksksk I died that day. Christmas Party came and I gave him a gift (it was a blue shirt) and asked him for a picture before 2018 ends. After giving him the gift, he held his hand up and I was expecting for a high five so I raised mine and oh god he held my hand so tight and just swung it back &amp; forth. He was looking into my eyes and said thank you with the biggest smile I ever saw he had. My friends giggled and goddamn that man knows his effect on me. After bidding goodbye, I was so hung up on that moment I think I drooled while rewatching the things that happened in my head. I went home with a happy heart that day :) 

It was 3 minutes before Christmas and I was thinking hard on what message should I send him. When the clock hit 12:01am I just went with the simple ""Merry Christmas! ‚ù§"" and continued to message my other friends and greet my family. After a hard night, I woke up to his message saying ""Merry Christmas [my naaaaame]! ‚ù§"" and damn what a Christmas morning I had. We chatted for a couple of minutes after that and as soon as our conversation ended, I told my friends about it &amp; they were so excited for me hahaha.

Anyways thank you so much for reading this long ass post. I just wanted to share it with y'all :) This year has been great and I hope yours was too. Btw, he has a girlfriend so i'll just put my love for him at the side and admire him as his student. What's annoying is that he is such a flirt because he knows I have a crush on him, and continues on posting pictures with his girlfriend (ugh my highschool student heart) hahahaha I respect him &amp; his girlfriend tho :) Thank you again for reading and tell me what you think!",27Dec2018,1
63,"The Dream:

In the doorway of my bedroom appeared a demon. Formed from lust she was in every way designed to entice. Her entire manifestation was of terrifying beauty that at any moment shifted ‚Äì rapidly superimposing unappealing and appealing forms. She asked for my phone to which I refused. She wanted to set up video and record our situation. I found this odd seeing as how she had her own phone that she sat on my dresser.

She seduced me. I simultaneously failed and gave into my range of instincts and desires. Her sexual acts were performed with perfected technique as she demanded and orchestrated the sequence of activities. I tried to deny the situation the entire time. I could not be doing this. I love my fianc√©. As the act transgressed parts of her transmogrified and she slowly became less and less appealing.

A car arrived home and you could hear the door shut. It was my brother. The demon receded in an instant. My brother understood my troubles as soon as he saw me. No explanation was necessary. Next to the demon‚Äôs phone was some disc or plate that had symbols marked on one side. We rushed onto the back porch with a grey overcast sky looming above us. He desperately attempted to destroy this item, but it was made from some perfectly malleable material. My brother suddenly stopped and looked at me, ‚ÄúDo you hear that?‚Äù We both looked up towards the woods behind the house. I felt a rush of energy from deep within the trees pressing towards us. From inside of myself I felt the whispering of my name by a multitude of voices.

I was back laying in my bed in the dark. In the doorway appeared a demon woman of entirely new form.

I woke up.

&amp;#x200B;

Context: I am 21 years old. I am engaged to be married next August and am a semester away from graduating college with a chemistry degree. I do not want to use that chemistry degree but instead want to pour my passion into making audio and visual content. I want to slowly get stronger and make better and better art for the world. I want to use it as opportunity to learn about topics that will help me grow and look inside of myself from which I can positively affect culture. These last 6 months have led to me wrestling countless internal problems.

I struggle with several desires. I desire things of a sexual nature that are not available to me in my monogamous relationship. The available resources on the internet to get a dopamine hit off of the illusion of being at the head of any mating hierarchy is difficult to resist. I certainly believe that has to do with this dream. But as I think of all of the events leading up to this dream I cannot shake my strongest desire -- to get exactly what I want out of life. Where I am from, knowing what you want to do with your life and how you want to do it is extremely rare. People are just surviving here. What I want is difficult, but I am driven enough to do it. This dream has left me thinking about what happens when desires swallow you, and you succumb to them to the point of losing awareness. These desires can morph and become something you never wanted. I am having to come to grips with the dualistic nature of desire. It motivates me and encourages me to reach for things that bring meaning and substance, but sacrifice is challenging for me.

My parents are split and Christmas day I stayed with my mother which is a rare occurrence. I love her dearly but have stayed with my father for reasons of convenience and also because I have tried to be a positive effect on his dissolving life. My mother and I essentially went over her entire history up until the divorce with my dad. Direct questions were asked, and transparent, open answers were given. I now have an unbelievably vivid picture of my mother in my mind.

On the drive back home to my father‚Äôs house I just could not understand why I was coming back to him. This man is one of the most selfish, unforgiving, and hateful people I have ever met. No, he is. I am sure. I cannot go into details but this man really took a lot from my mother. Their entire marriage and my entire creation is predicated on her having been vulnerable from the birth of my older half-brother (our relationship has been strained by my father but right before I went to bed I started texting him and we had a very serious conversation. Very interesting he showed up in my dream). Both my mother and father are ravaged from traumas (my father‚Äôs parents killed each other in a double homicide when I was 4, his best friend died while they were in the first war in Iraq, my mother‚Äôs biological father murdered her only father figure in front of her, her and her siblings were kept from their real mother their whole lives, and more). As I try to understand my father I keep those traumas in mind, but the total lack of remorse and responsibility he has for the things he has caused is appalling, and even worse, I know some very dark things about his temptations and previous dealings with my brother‚Äôs social groups that took my horror to a whole new level. The drive home that night was a complete plot twist in the narrative that is the history of my life.

The next day, I woke up from this dream. I went on a walk and came back and produced this track/video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nkiethCRTI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nkiethCRTI). When my dad came home complaining hypocritically (and with some lies) about his lonely Christmas, I confronted him (probably the 10th time I had done this) about not wanting to see him die miserable and full of regret and hate. The act of loving my father had become so abstracted. Ten times now this conversation had opened up and ten times now he is telling me that this is the way he is, he wants to die this way, making excuses and not taking responsibility for what has occurred in his life. He dissociates so impossibly far. This was the last time this ever can happen. In the course of the conversation, he threatened me within inches of my face that if I did not shut the fuck up that he would beat me so badly that I would have to kill him to get him off of me (he is over 300 pounds). This was it. I have been trying to love this man and change his life for the better for so long. I was the last person left in this world trying for so long. The expression of love had become so abstracted. I was attempting to love hatred. I was presented with the reality that the only thing I have left to do to show love ‚Äì calling him out and asking him to take responsibility ‚Äì would lead to him either killing me or forcing me to kill him. I did not want to end up like my two grandparents, or uncle, or any of my distant cousins. I did not want to have to be the person to kill my father either. He is killing himself. This was my last expression of love. It is all I can do. He has what he wants now. I walked over to the neighbor‚Äôs house, gave him my phone number and just asked him to text me whenever he hears from my dad. I gathered my belongings and left and will likely never go back.",27Dec2018,1

66,"I was constantly bothered at my job. I do not want to be their friend, nothing in the job description says I have to be everyone's friend. I don't want to date your friends, I don't want to hang out with them. They get mad because they think they're doing me a massive favour. I guess I am a repulsive loser to them who couldn't make friends or find a gf. Thanks, I always wanted friends who thought so little of me.             

Why did they think this stuff? No clue. I would do my work, and go home. I enjoy my life. They must have jumped to conclusions because obviously they are the greatest people of all time. Who could resist their friendship right? I always wanted friends who jump to conclusions, spread rumours, gossip and think they are god's gift to humanity.            

I lashed out by (vaguely) calling them out on their behaviour. They retaliate (they already started the whole thing btw) and annoy me even more. After 2-3 years of this BS, I had enough. I sent emails around, asking for HR. But I guess my word doesn't count for much. I was dismissed. I looked up the policies specifically about this and restated my case of harassment. But there's no evidence. I said forget it then, I will accept their behaviour, because I have bills to pay. Thanks for all the help.         

I got called today, I was removed from the job. Thanks for all your help people. I just want to work and keep being happy, but you have to make it about you.

I'll mention that to my landlord, they take ""good intentions"" right?               

I've specifically mentioned ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"" to them many times, but to them I am a moron who doesn't know anything, so everything I mention is invalid. The boy who cried wolf is about a boy (you irl people) who said ""wolves are coming!"" as a prank, a joke (the lies and fake attitudes and situations you create) to illicit a certain response (you trying to make me do what you want me to) from the townspeople (me). The townspeople catch on to the boy's BS and stop listening to him. Then when a real wolf comes, they don't believe him and he gets eaten. The moral of the story is: if all you do is shovel shit, then why would anyone (me) believe anything you do or say?                

Not only all of that, but to keep doing the same things over and over to me, expecting different results.             

This is why I think these people are stupid.

""No, I don't want your help or need your help""

I get pissed and call them out on legit BS             

""We're sorry. Because apologizing will stop you from being angry, not that we're actually sorry or will learn anything from this, but because it makes it easier for us to reinitialize our attack""           

""Well, I am not interested, still. You do not live up to my standard as decent human adults, so no still.""

Luckily (or maybe all those ads about impaired driving sunk in) I pulled off to the side of the road, paralleled parked (who the fuck knows why, there were no other cars around) and turned off the car. I called my friend, got out of the car and told her that I was coming back. I thought that I was like 100m away from the driveway, turns out I was a good 1/2 km away. I slept over and drove to work in the morning. 

I guess I just wanted to share my experience with others. I was lucky I was on a rural road late at night without any other cars. It scares me how stupid I was and I‚Äôm so thankful that my rational brain kicked in and nothing bad happened. Stay safe out there!",27Dec2018,1
72,"I‚Äôm constantly way too aware of myself and how other people see me and it sucks so much. I hate how I look, but attempts to feel better about my looks just make me feel even more insecure. It‚Äôs not even that I don‚Äôt like my body. I know that if I wanted to I could objectively look really nice. It‚Äôs just that when i try to it makes my skin crawl and does the opposite of making me feel confident. It feels surreal just seeing myself in the mirror or in photos because I don‚Äôt even recognize me. I hate it so much.

I can‚Äôt be myself around anyone, not even my closest family. I don‚Äôt know what my problem is but I hate it. I used to be super outgoing and happy in elementary school but as soon as puberty hit I just nosedived and became this awkward self-aware mess. I don‚Äôt even know how to feel better about myself.

73,"I was planning on doing this in relationship_advice but then it got stupid long and I realized it's just a rant anyway.

Maria's my closest friend and we've known each other our whole lives. She constantly missed school when we were kids- multiple, multi-day absences per month. I always assumed she had serious health issues and gave her the benefit of the doubt. But over the last 10+ years of being her closest friend, I can safely it's almost always an overreaction. That's how her mom is and how her mom raised her. They both will drop any plans, no matter how important or how much it will put someone else out, at the slightest sniffle or the most minor hangover. Maria always expects everyone to fawn over her ""health drama"" and will get salty if she doesn't get to bask in sympathy. She grew up with her mother babying her every cough and cold, which is why she missed school so much. (I even remember her complaining about the school not accepting her mom's sick notes anymore)

I grew up in a family where, if you're not contagious, then you're still expected to follow through on your responsiblities. My grandmother was a nurse and couldn't stand people who burdened the healthcare system demanding treatment and unnecessary antibiotics for standard illnesses. We believe the hospital is for things you can't treat at home. I used to watch Maria rush to urgent care each year for the flu and as a whiny kid I wanted the same- I'd get told ""All they can do is give you fluids and bring your fever down. We can do the same thing at home.""

But I know I can't say anything without seeming like an unsupportive friend, so I just keep my mouth shut, even though behavior like her constant, unnecessary urgent care trips contribute to healthcare burdens in this country which make the prescription for my own chronic illness almost unaffordable. I never complain about my illness to Maria. I've never gone to urgent care for this illness because I manage it carefully, I manage my whole lifestyle to reduce the impact on my illness.

Yet Maria lives a dramatically unhealthy lifestyle that can only worsen what legitimate health problems she does have. She struggles with depression yet she drinks several times per week and smokes weed daily, and she's borderline obese with horrible eating habits. I struggle with anxiety, so I quit smoking weed and majorly cut down on drinking to manage it, and I eat carefully and exercise and stay hydrated to help manage my chronic illness.

Despite my frustration, I could tolerate all of this until recently Maria started claiming to have the same chronic illness that's been controlling my life since I was 13. I couldn't take it and completely ignored her every time she brought it up, so she conveniently quit mentioning it.

All of that brings me to now. Over Christmas she had more health drama and another hospital trip, this time to the ER because she was so hungover she ""was dramatically dehydrated and had collapsing veins and could have gone into cardiac arrest."" She literally admitted it was a hangover but then claimed it was exacerbated by the flu- which would be like the 3rd time this season she's claiming to have it.

So I'm already pissed because, in my darker and stupider moments, I've drank myself into oblivion and used to hate drinking water so I was constantly dehydrated and it was a major exacerbator of my illness. I've had hangovers where I'm too weak to stand and no doubt was dangerously dehydrated. But I suffered through and I treated myself at home. (look up ORS solution if you ever need a homemade hydration treatment) I didn't force healthcare professionals to deal with my bad choices.

Alright, whatever, Maria up to her usual shit. I toss a throwaway ""Glad you're OK now"" because I don't want to seem completely unsupportive. (I'm guessing by her pointed silence that she expected more sympathy.) But then she went and backed out of our Christmas get-together this Friday, saying she's still sick with the flu. So now I'm pissed because my mom was really excited to have us over for Christmas and she went all out buying tons of food for us, fancy stuff she rarely gets because she's low-/fixed-income. Me and my fiance will still go but I know it'll still hurt my mom's feelings, especially considering she spent most of her monthly food budget on this, I'm sure largely thinking of Maria who loves to eat.",27Dec2018,1
74,"I'm a 36 y/o female, and I don't know what to do with my life. I have suffered from depression many times in my life and the last one was actually due to hormonal disbalance. I'm not feeling depressed right now, just lost.

I know how to cook like a pro, I know A LOT about plants and sustainable agriculture, and have given courses about these subjects before, always without charging anything because I don't feel I know enough of these things to charge people, and also because I don't know how to deal with money. 

I just finished a period of voluntary work at a place where I could use many of my skills, from cooking to painting and gardening to woodworking and people were amazed by my skills, but yet, I don't feel like I know that much to make a living of these things. 

I usually trade my skills for things I need, because I don't know how to charge. It's been 4 months I'm back to my parent's house, and the plan was to stay here for just a few months and leave on a trip.

I worked for a few days at a vegan reataurant but decided to leave because they were paying 3 people to work a 6 people job, it was total human explotation and totally wrong and illegal, and I left with a sense of failure.

I've always wanted to travel across Latin America on my bicycle, and work as I travel selling things and services (handcraft, food, cleaning, and other things) and maybe writing things about it. I don't want to make a trip where I will just live a life of adventures, I want to help other people along the way, with many things: storytelling for children (I have 2 children books ready to be published but I'm afraid to publish them because I feel they are not good), teaching things I know, doing voluntary work in poor communities, and other things. But somehow I feel I will be lying to myself and this will be an escape from the responsibilities of the modern world (having bills to pay, paying rent, have a routine). But I also feel these insecurities is just me self sabotaging my dreams.

It is hard to type these things because I feel like a lost child, afraid of what the world ask of us as adults. I never fitted in regular jobs, I never managed to finish any of the graduations I started, and I feel like I failed as a human being when I compare my life with other people's who have regular jobs and families (I know comparison is dangerous). On the other hand, many people say I'm an amazing wise person with many stories, skills, but I see myself as fake, I don't know why.

75,"Im a guy that has been struggling with mental illness and I may be developing something.

 I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and Im heavily suicidal plus I am a self harmer, so have that in mind.

Since I was 4 Ive deprived myself of food as punishment and as a way to get thinner. Its gotten really bad recently. Right now I weigh 45.6 kg and I am 174 cm. Now this little starving game I play with myself is oufcourse out of pure hatred directed towards my image so I assume this habit is a product of my anxiety or depression.

My pedeatrician says my weight is fine but I look like a walking skeleton, when I shower I can see all of my bones in detail and I still think of myself as a fat pig. I want to keep getting thinner and thinner. It doesnt make sense.

Keep in mind I am probably overreacting since I am 13 and people my age tend to be pretty dramatic. Also sorry if this seems disorganized, I wont read through a second time it so I can get the courage to post it. ",27Dec2018,1
76,"After the prequels came out I was livid... They ruined the mystique of the universe, they played it for laughs, they seemed to have made it into more of a political metaphor than a journey of the self... I hated Anakin and Jar-Jar for mocking my childhood wonder and Lucas for making them.

Now I see their value.

They may have diminished the original films somewhat, but they at least maintained a somewhat consistent narrative with some interesting characters and ideas. Jedi and Sith were bad-ass space ninja-wizards. Even if only for a few minutes at a time. This was their story.

The new films seem like they're trying to distance themselves from the central characters and themes the series was built on. None of it seems to make sense, narrative seems to follow whatever might seem more dramatic than what might really happen and we have characters that are just randomly bad-ass presumably because their hearts are in the right place?

In this Star Wars nothing seems to matter or follow logic. Never touched a lightsaber before? NP, you can easily survive a fight with the most dangerous force-warrior in the galaxy, natch!

Why? Because your name is on the poster...

Fuck this. I'm gonna go watch Qui-Gon fight Maul.",27Dec2018,1
77,Yeah it‚Äôs gotten pretty lonely this Christmas season and I used to drink a lot after my first girlfriend dumped me. It‚Äôs been 8 months since my other girlfriend dumped me and just the lonesomeness and the depression has just made me feel like there‚Äôs no point in this relationship shit. I have nothing to offer and nothing to gain. I just want to drink myself to sleep and beat the piss out of my body at work.,27Dec2018,1
