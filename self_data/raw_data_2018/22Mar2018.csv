1,"I'm a political science major, but I don't want to get into politics per se. I have a vision-- a really idealistic and probably poorly thought out vision-- but I have shown bits and pieces of it to people and they like what they hear. I don't want to go into details about it. But will it catch on? Will I change the world? Maybe. I'm probably not going to have any kids so I have nothing to lose. I'm willing to accept the risks. I have the determination, and it's so crazy that I can't think of anyone else who has really tried it. From a certain perspective I can definitely understand the criticism that I'm just some idealistic kid who hasn't yet accepted that their life doesn't matter in the larger scheme of things. But some people's lives do end up mattering, so why can't I be one of them?",22Mar2018,8

Also, we made a note that any time you can floor the vehicle legally and safely (stop lights, on-ramps, etc), you must :). You can fix any broken parts yourself, if you know how (most aren't mechanically inclined) but ultimately you have to decide how much you want to put into the car and when you've had enough you have to junk it and put the money into a pot.

5,"Despite everything I still miss him. I can’t ignore it anymore. 

...

“If I die, I'd hope to find you in another life
So we could fall again
Be the way we were when we first began
Like the first time that I ever saw you smile
I want that feeling again”

...

“Hi”
“Hi!” 

His smile immediately caught my attention. I didn’t think anything of him until I saw that smile. The kind of smile that makes you feel special. Like you’re the only thing that matters. It would come to mean just that and so much more... 

...

I’ve started to wonder if things could have gone differently. If there was any series of events that could have lead to us still being together. If there’s anything that could happen to lead to us being together again. I can’t believe it myself, but a part of me says I would be willing to consider it. To be real, I could still love him. Mistakes and all. It’s how I always loved him. I think about how painful it was at times to love him knowing his faults and the things he had done to hurt me. How confusing it was for my mind to still love him while feeling hurt and disgust and resentment. That part of me says I’d take that feeling back any day if it meant we were together again. 

I miss him. 

Sometimes I want him back. I know it’s wrong. But something about him makes me forget about what’s wrong and right. What’s good and bad. What’s acceptable. It’s just him. He was my everything. He took me out of this world and its boundaries. That’s still how that part of me sees him. Above all else. Able to forgive and forget anything and everything to be with him again. ",22Mar2018,5
6,"I started high school last year, and of course I just had to get my expectations up just a little higher than normal. When I was younger I was far from popular, but I always had at least a few good friends. Now in high school, the school year is almost over and a bit more than half of my friends moved away since middle school. I've made maybe three new friends since the beginning of the school year. I was, like most naive little 8th graders, severely let down by high school. Like a fool, I thought things would magically get better. That my insignificant problems would somehow improve themselves. But now I find myself talking to maybe 5 different people everyday that I would consider friends. In my classes I am very quiet, and I have been told I have a resting bitch face, or I look like I am about to cry. Everyone looks at me like there is something wrong with me or like I'm stupid and I can only wish it was all in my head. I really don't know what to do. I want high school to be an at least slightly enjoyable experience, but with my severe social anxiety and lack of motivation, friends, or self confidence, I'm not sure how I'm supposed to make that happen. I'm sorry if this is really long or annoying I would just like some advice. Preferably nothing like ""Oh just put yourself out there! Don't care what other people think! It can't be so bad!"" Anything but that would be greatly appreciated.

I send a pic of a park and she's like "" I wouldn't mind to do that all but 95% of the time I either have to babysit my kid or do nursing homework."" I'm like alright sounds great. She has her kid probably 4 or 5 days a week. 

We continue talking for another couple of weeks and I sent her a pic of the shape of water movie and said we should go watch this and she says she has to babysit. Alright we text each other daily. I'm usually the one initiating the texts and sometimes she'll leave one unread and always reply in the morning.

Now I really wanna hang out with her and take my relationship with her to the next level. Now, I don't wanna ask her out again on a date a week after she said she was busy. Ladies, is she playing hard to get here? I figure if she wasn't interested at all I'd either A. get ghosted or B. Just declined entirely. But she did agree to hang out twice. So Sunday I texted her and she didn't reply, I haven't texted her anything since then (3 days). How long should I wait to text back and what should I do to escalate the relationship? ",22Mar2018,6

I was at Target 2 days ago buying some craft paint for a project I'm doing, a girl walks down the craft aisle I'm in and compliments my jacket I'm wearing. We start talking and turns out we work in the same field. We just had a lot in common, she asked a lot about me and seemed genuinely interested in me. I asked her for her number and we added each other on facebook. I was excited because I've lived in this area for 6 months and haven't hung out with anyone but my boyfriend. 

Well, she just called me and and basically said ""I feel like we connected so much the other day, I wanted to see if you were interested in improving your life and being happier while learning how to have better finances and make some extra cash"" 

I hate pyramid schemes and MLMs and the people that support them. It's one thing being messaged on facebook, but to be approached out in the wild with seemingly good intentions...It's a different kind of shitty. I just feel so bad now.

24,"Looking at all the posts on r/socialism, r/communism, and r/latestagecapitalism; it just seems like they conveniently forget that they'll still need people to clean poop out of toilets by hand.  Or, they think the people that clean poop out of those toilets will soon be replaced by robots.  Which, may or may not be the case.  Either way, there will be a lower caste that does shit that they don't want to do that they'll have to fight for.  They'll have to be like ""hey, you, guy who cleans the shit cleaning robot when it gets back to its charging base, we're fighting for you, join us.""  

In either case, there's a lower caste that they have to say should get paid as much as a neurosurgeon, or their favorite capitalist Elon Musk.  Which is fine.  But in their Utopia someone or something has to clean the shit out of toilets.  Like, when the shit hits the back of the bowl.  Either the robot has to do it, or the robot has to go somewhere and then someone has to clean the shit from the robot.  

Which is fine.  But in their Utopia; they never mention that yeah, you're making 100k / yr just like everyone else regardless of station, but you're also cleaning shit off the shit cleaning robot; and the rocket scientist next door also makes 100k / yr but doesn't have to clean shit off a shit cleaning robot.  

Humans find a way to make a caste system.  They find a way for jealousy, greed, etc.  You wont find any angels to administer your utopian government.  You wont find any angels to vote themselves out of office.  Despite your mental abilities to justify all of your actions, the ends more often than not do not justify your means.  

Liberal politicians are okay with school shootings.  Any real world fixes for that; they're going to vote against, because the more school shootings, the more mass shootings, the better; until their ends are met.  The ends, in their minds, justify any means.  They hide behind children until they can get your feels to overpower the reals.   It doesn't matter to them whether or not what they're saying is real.  What is real, is that they have an objective, and that's all that matters.  They're fine with slowly eroding rights, just a piece at a time.  But when something comes up that might turn public opinion to a point where they can take a chunk at a time rather than just a piece?  They'll take it.

38,"I'd love for this to be an inspirational post, but it's not. Honestly, it's a self-indulgent exercise in just shouting about how I think the body can be cruel.

I was 30 when I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. You know the disease; Michael J. Fox and Muhammad Ali were both afflicted. It makes life feel like you move through water every day. Tremors, muscle stiffness, slowness of movement. That's just the basic stuff; I also have vivid nightmares 3-5 times a week, lost my sense of smell and on my best days manage to not look like I'm drunk at 8am.

Then this year, because Parkinson's wasn't enough, I suffered from a stroke that left me literally speechless. Now I sound like a toddler learning English all over again. Writing isn't much better. This post has already taken me an hour to compose. 

So, with all that said, I'm pissed off. But not for why you think.

You see, I can live with physical ailments. I'm mostly good at going to the doctor, taking advice and seeking treatment (well, that and my wife is an incredible person who always pushes me). I had brain surgery in May 2017 to implant a device called Deep Brain Stimulation. It's been nothing short of miraculous. 

No, I'm pissed off because when the going gets tough, people abandon you. It happened to me in 2014 when I was diagnosed with PD. Slowly at first. A message from friends here and there plans to hang out which are then canceled and no follow up. It hurts, but I got used to it and made new friends.

Then the stroke. Do you know what crickets chirping sounds like? It's the sound that happens after you have a stroke at 34 that leaves you unable to work, unable talk like a normal person, unable to socialize where more than two voices are going at once because the words then just sound like gibberish, and then people I considered close friends just disappear.

No more texts from friends I considered almost family. No more calls from people at church. Nothing.

But here is what I do have. I have a wife who I love and she is standing by my side. I have two friends who as a couple are stronger than anything I've ever seen and are always there when I need them.

Well, I should wrap up this selfish rant by saying that if you know anyone suffering from an isolating disease, fucking call them or email them or reach out. Don't be an asshole. You don't need to be with them all the time or even hang out. Just call. Let them know you know they still exist and are still a person.",22Mar2018,22
40,"Title says it all. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Before anyone pounds off in the comments saying things like, ""It was only a matter of time before reddit got rid of subs like these,"" I'm here to tell you- **you're right.** It really was a ticking time bomb using subreddits discussing dark net purchases and general activity on the clear net. I do understand why reddit, a (I'm guessing without doing any research) top 10 most visited site in the country and maybe the world, wouldn't want this activity on their site.

It just pains me that thousands of good people are now without a solid resource. I myself was incredibly active in r/DankNation.

I started using the dark net last year to buy marijuana and other cannabis products and have them delivered to me. I moved to a place where weed was incredibly expensive and scarce from a place where I was buying from one of my childhood best friends. I have incredible back pain and regular anxiety attacks, and I found that marijuana helped me to a degree no doctor or prescription drug had ever done. I decided to look for a way to buy online, and I had recently watched a documentary on the dark net and dark net markets. I found out more about the dark net through reddit. 

But it doesn't stop there. The importance of these subs transcend just finding out how to access the DNMs. Reddit and these subreddits were incredibly important to users like me in that on the dark net, you don't always know who is on the other side of the transaction. With subreddits like r/DankNation (RIP, I love you guys), I was able to search a dark net vendor's name, see if any users had used him before, check out reviews and pictures of the products- hell, the best vendors themselves were active on the sub and verified by the mods to be the real deal. Sure, there was still a scam here and there, but r/DankNation and other communites like it made it a hell of a lot harder on scammers to conduct their business. 

On top of all of that, sometimes the markets were DDOS'd or hacked or something similar. I was able to check the status of these attacks with ease on r/DankNation- a huge sigh of relief for any dark net user who has dealt with sites like AlphaBay completely vanishing from existence and looking for a reason why and where to go next to safely make purchases.

In general, I find it silly and a waste of energy to worry or be upset about things out of my control. However, waking up to realizing that I, along with thousands of wonderful people who wish no ill will or bad intent for anyone, are now out a major resource is an exception. I am completely frustrated at reddit or whoever it may be that is at fault.

I hope reddit is happy with the decisions they've made going forward. I just hope they realize what they've done to this community by shutting down these subs last night en masse.

TL;DR- Reddit got rid of dark net subreddits that many used for help accessing the dark net in a safe, secure manner. They're gone now and the dark net community is out its biggest clear net resource.",22Mar2018,93
41,"Today I am thinking about what “right” and “wrong” mean to me and to other people. I am thinking about how easy people judge other people for their choices. Some ways of living are often deemed as right, correct or good - and other: controversial or even ‘wrong’.

We all do this from time to time - we close ourselves off to an idea, just because we have never tried it before and someone in the past taught us that this was “wrong”. It wasn’t necessarily a specific person, but maybe our culture, overall message we got from watching TV or reading newspapers.

The thing is - no life decision is good or bad in itself!  The “good” and “bad” are only OUR WAYS OF THINKING about certain things. A few decades ago most people were still conditioned to think that homosexuality is bad or sinful, or that it is a ‘disease’. Today this notion seems ridiculous to most of us (although still not to everyone - especially in the older generations people still tend to think that it is ‘not ok to be gay’). 

This shift in our perception of homosexuality as a society is just an example of how our thinking, upbringing and cultural norms can condition us to make certain life decisions. What if we decided to break through this conditioning?

I believe that the only way to see if something is or isn’t right for you is to... try it for yourself. Only then can you formulate your very own opinion on the matter at hand. This applies to how you want to live your life, what food is good for you, what job suits you best and to virtually all the possible choices you could imagine.

Breaking through my own mental inhibitions, I decided to enter a polyamorous relationship with my beloved partner. I used to think that this is ‘wrong’, inappropriate and potentially harmful. But I was only able to see polyamory for what it really is AFTER I EXPERIENCED IT MYSELF.

If you are curious, here is a chunk of my story of embracing polyamory (and breaking through my mind barriers in general): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r5obZnxYTE

It ended eventually but the scars of what happened did heal through therapy.

The first son found the spear from the first man he felled at his feet, and made to drive it through the back of his last foe's skull, but that man's eye was already focused upon him, and as the first son had just begun to move, his foe's body was already in motion, the spear in his hands whipping towards his head.

52,"FIRST OFF; YOU CHEATED ON HIM.

WHY THE FUCK DID YOU CHEAT ON HIM? DUDE, JESUS. LIKE, WHY? LOOK. JUST LOOK AT HIM. CAN SOMEONE GET MORE PERFECT? OK, MAYBE HE ISNT PERFECT, HE'S HUMAN LIKE THE REST OF US, BUT HE SURE IS ONE OF THE AWESOMEST HUMANS YOU'VE EVER MET. HE'S INTELLIGENT, KIND. EMPATHETIC, GENTLE. AND ONE OF THE CUTEST FUCKING DUDES YOU'VE EVER MET.

THAT BRIGHT, SUDDEN SMILE. THOSE HANDS ON THAT BASS. HIS ARMS AS HE PULLED YOU IN. HIS VOICE AS HE ASKED YOU WHETHER YOU WERE OKAY. LYING ON HIS CHEST AS YOU TWO CUDDLED ON HIS BED, WITH QOTSA BLARING FROM THE AMP. HOLDING HANDS, BY ECP, WHERE HE WANTED TO LIVE, TO BE ABLE TO BE CLOSER TO YOU. HE MADE YOU CRY WITH THAT BASS, DIDNT HE? HOW BEAUTIFUL HIS PLAYING WAS. SO MANY THINGS--

you standing in the middle of the room, sobbing uncontrollably. couldn't understand why, just why he was looking at you with such love, couldn't you? after every ""why do you love me?!"" a kiss would come, wordlessly.

YOU WOULD CHEAT ON THAT??

YOU SELFISH, CRUEL, USELESS FUCKER. 

LIKE, I THOUGHT I KNEW YOU, I LIVED WITH YOU FOR SIXTEEN YEARS, BUT NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I SEEN SUCH COMPLETELY THOUGHTLESS, HEARTLESS, CALLOUS BEHAVIOUR. YOU SAID IT YOURSELF, YOU THINK YOU'RE WORTHLESS, BUT I KNOW YOUVE GOT A LIL BIT OF SELF RESPECT IN THAT MEAT SHELL OF YOURS, YOU DIPSHIT. AND IT SAYS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU PRIDE YOURSELF ON IS YOUR EMPATHY, YOUR ABILITY TO CARE FOR OTHERS, YOUR LOVE. WHERES THAT NOW HUH!!!!!!

but I know why you did that.

you were broken, weren't you? now even more so since you've lost him. you still are broken, and what you needed, wanted, craved desperately was for someone to love you as much as you wanted. you wanted to fill up that void in your heart, the part that hated itself, denied that it was deserving of goodness, denied that it was good. you wanted someone to need you. jason is an independent person, a capable person. he is not clingy like the other cat is. and the other cat gave you that affection, making you the only one, loving you intensely. and you fell for that like a sucker, you sucker. you terrible, terrible person.

and you're kind, too kind. and idealistic, almost foolishly idealistic at times. the other cat clung to you desperately, making you the only one he could trust. and when you rejected him, he was hurt and told you about that hurt. you were too kind to drive him away, to let him suffer alone. so when he poured his heart out to you about how much it hurt, losing his love, you pitied him. and you began to fall for him, you stupid bitch. that should not have happened. you should've been stronger. pushed him away. you know yourself, you knew there was a chance this would happen, so why? why?? why the fuck???

IDEALISTIC, ARROGANT FOOL. thought you could have your cake and eat it too, couldn't you? thought you could have Kat as a close friend, revealing private details about yourself, while still keeping him at arm's length and not falling for him. Thought you could remain 100% loyal to Jason simultaneously, too.

Think about that, you. Jason trusted you. He let you keep your close guy friends. He reacted with incredulousness when you suggested that you cut off ties with Kat. HE KNEW OF YOU AND KAT'S MUTUAL FEELINGS FOR EACH OTHER AND YET STILL WANTED YOU TO KEEP THE FRIENDSHIP!!!!!!!!

that day... why, that day? that day full of regrets. so much sin, for so much pain. but we shall talk about it, because it happened.

that day, Kat invited himself over. he was talking, about something that bothered him, probably. You hugged him. He fell over, on the bed. Eyes met. Kiss...

And more. Don't lie, more. Hands on skin. his on yours of course, but nothing below the undergarments. doesn't make it any better, though. He indulged in it even though he knew it was sin, that you were taken, and you were indulged, even though the voice within you was screaming at you to stop. 

oh god. that voice. its familiar, isn't it? that voice of goodness that screams from within you to stop, *stop*, whenever you do something terrible that you will regret. it screams at you whenever you snap at your mother after a draining day at school. it screams at you whenever you pon CCA because you feel worthless like you'll never be good at it. and that day, it screamed at you to stop, because what you were doing was hurting a part of you. Jason's heart. 

and you've gotten so good at ignoring it, haven't you? better to ignore it, ignore the terrible things you were doing. couldn't deal with all that self-hatred + guilt at whatever you were doing. to acknowledge is to admit, and to admit is to admit your terribleness at how you're coping with the terrible feelings, which would cause more terrible feelings. whatever. in this case, you couldn't admit it. Admit that, even though you loved Jason, you liked another guy. Admit that, you thought you had quashed your feelings, but you hadn't. Admit that, you were too kind to push this guy out of your life, and by doing so, you might've valued him over Jason. 

You little overconfident, arrogant, cruel brat. 

Whatever it was, the deed was carried out, and it was done. 

...

After I sent Kat out, I walked back. And the feelings hit me like a brick. Guilt. Shame. Humiliation. Overwhelming. What had I just done? What have I done to Jason? I took my keys, took jason jacket, and went for a walk. Just through the exit when he walked me back home, round the bench when he held my guitar, and up the yellow tower. 

I just looked. but i couldnt stop moving, because of the guilt. so I just laid my head on the nearest bench, and begun to cry.

I cannot tell you, dear reader, what i did then. Mostly I sat on the bench from 7.30 to 9 and cried. Read reddit stories about cheating and how much devastation it wrought on the partner. Cried more. Told people I was trash. But mostly, most fucking ly, I felt overwhelming, terrible guilt. This was the person I **loved**. I had just done the most hurtful thing, the most grevious betrayal. I didnt even know *who* i was, what kind of monster i had become. i thought i was kind, loving. But i had done this. I didnt and still dont recognise myself anymore. 

I left the bench and went back home to eat dinner.

...

Yknow, sometimes I wonder what wouldve happened if you didnt tell him after dinner. He definitely wouldnt have known a thing, and he would just assume something else was wrong, as it often is. It's CTs this week for the Y6s, so you guys wouldve spend a lot of time together this week. Happy times. But... heh. It would've eaten you alive, wouldnt it? Lying to him, straight to his face. The worst possible thing. You couldnt do it. Still a fundamentally honest girl arent you? Also foolish and idealistic. But still terribly honest. Hmm.

Well, he broke up with you. And you've lost the most amazing guy you've ever met. He hates you now, because of the terrible thing youve did. And *I* hate you now. What are you? Are you still the same me I know? Some twisted... sick human being? Anyone who can do that to the person they love the most is not deserving of love, in my opinion. I dont know how I'm supposed to work with this, work with you. How am I supposed to improve you when I'm... this? 

You've still got it together, somehow. You still manage to survive, daresay function, and talk to people. Even that is due to Jason, the safety and stability, the strength he's given to you in the past. Some days are better than others, but today you're up at 3.43am listening to songs and crying and suffering.

So suffer, bitch.

55,"I literally hate doing anything that requires any sort of effort or work on my part. I do a lot of these things, but I feel absolutely miserable the entire time I'm doing them. I have plenty of accolades and achievements that have required a lot of effort and dedication, and getting them is great, but I would do absolutely anything to never have to do anything. Often, I've completed these things not because I've wanted to but because I knew it would make my parents happy. 

If I could do anything in the world, it would be to eat, watch Netflix, and sleep. That's about as much as I have the energy or willpower to complete. 

This isn't to say I don't have interests in things, I do. The things I've put effort into to please my parents are all things I had personal interests in anyway. I wouldn't mind learning things without having to have done anything to do that.

58,"I'm 21 years old, I've been in a relationship for more than a year now. I've been sexually active since 19 years old, but I always used protection and I was never really having much sex, never felt the need to get tested.

It's come to my attention over the last week that my girlfriend *may* have cheated. I don't believe that she is cheating, there is not hard evidence, just a little hint that she possibly may have. I won't go into it here, I will hopefully have the truth soon. My girlfriend and *almost* always use protection, but she is on birth control and we've skipped the condoms here and there.

So I don't believe that my girlfriend cheated on me, I don't believe that I have an STD, but I'm still freaking out. At first I was just freaked out about the possibility of testing positive, but now I'm freaked out about what I will say to my girlfriend if I do test positive. Hell, that wouldn't help her case, but I don't even know how I'd approach it. Imagine if I tested positive, came right out and accused her of cheating, and it turns out she didn't give it to me somehow? Or that she did give it to me but it wasn't because of her cheating??

Shit, man. I don't even know. I probably won't even test positive and I'm already freaking out about that kind of thing. My head's done in, I'm just going through a whirlwind of emotions and I'm so anxious.
