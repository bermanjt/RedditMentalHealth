They weren‚Äôt like rude or anything but i was feeling like i was distancing them with my behavior.

Ever since then i started to hate myself a lot,insulting myself and randomly remembering every time i‚Äôve done something cringy.

I feel like i‚Äôve completly fucked up my relationship with that group and i cant stop hating myself for that.",05Nov2018,1
1,"Small Backstory: Soo ever since i could remember. i have struggled from anxiety and depression. i always will. it is genetics not from a source. I've had separation Anxiety from my mom to panic attacks in first grade feeling like i can not breathe. ive had depression from self-hatred/harm to trying to commit suicide, one very serious attempt. im not nieve to the fact that it is lack of certain chemicals in brain to be the blame of all my mental illness. (yes there is more, but not the time right now) i have been to more therapist than i can count. i have tried natural remedies. i have tried many medications and have been on medication since i was in 9th grade until about a couple days ago. 

the medication i was on was Lexapro, i started with a baby dose 5mg and increased as i grew or when i felt i was starting to hit a slump. i finished taking 40mg a day and it was rough. since i was taking such a high dosage it was actually just causing more harm than good. i was feeling no motivation to take care of myself. i was finding myself spacing out thinking about harming myself. more times than not being able to have a conversation because i just couldn't focus on anything else besides my thoughts. (i have adhd and i know the difference between not being able to focus cause of my depression vs not being intrested) i sometimes would get a sudden urge to cry because of just not wanting to live. 

i originally wanted to get off this medication because i recently learned that the medication caused erectial dysfunction. growing up with the medication i always thought i just never had a big sexual appetite. but learning that it was the medication made sense. 

on top of the recent slump because of the medication, a week or two maybe. i met a girl and we hit it off very well, long story short. we both said we wanted something serious and like usual im the one left behind looking dumb. i was also having a bit of a rough time at my job also. so everything all happened at once and felt over welhiming. so my mom told me to go see my councilor. he is a family friend and understands me

Fast-Forward to my session with Bill my councilor: we were talking about the events that had progressed into this slump. i first was saying that the girl situation was honestly not that big of a deal. but of course he knows me too well and it was a big deal. im not going to lie. everything happend in a week span with her. im a very sensitive person and need a lot of affection/attention. so i rarely pursue anyone cause people take my kindness for granted. she pursued me and that alone makes me like her more. i loved to be pursued and wanted and needed. of course she told me everything i want to hear and you know the rest. through out the session we were talking about the other events that has transpired into why i was there but kept circling around to the girl when it still thought it wasnt a big deal and he says 

Bill: ""so why do you think that i keep bringing up her (ashlee)""

Me: ""I don't know. to tourture me haha. it is not that big of deal. i thought about it. its not the fact that she left. its the fact that this happens a lot. they say they want something serious but leave when the time comes. im not going to lie to you. i knew that it was fast and should have been more patient. i know i need to work on that forsure. you know that if i want something, i get it.""

Bill: ""im glad you can recognize that you need to work on your patience. but there is something still at play here. take a guess""

Me: ""Hmm. honestly i have no clue""

Bill: ""May i take a stab at it?""

Me: ""please""

Bill: "" you need affection. that is why you rush things.""

Me: ""duh""

Bill ""you are a very sensitive person. you need that affection. but you turn to someone else to give it to you. why is that""

Me: ""what do you mean?""

Bill: ""you turn to other people because you need that feeling of being loved, being cared for, being needed. why do you need other people to give you that??""

Me: ""because i like to feel loved?""

Bill: ""everyone does but it seems to me that lack of loving yourself is making you feel like you need it from someone else.""

And once i heard that i started to choke up. what he said was true. in my 19 years of living i dont think i have ever once loved myself. i cut, burned, scared up my body because i hated myself. i never once gave myself recognition for something i did good. it finally clicked. i need to love myself before i can love anyone else.

i left that session and instantly balled in my car for about 10 mins having this overwelhming feeling of never actually loving myself. i thought to myself ""how can i love myself?"" ""how will i be able to?"". ""i dont know how to love myself if ive been hating myself for 19 years"" 

that was about a week ago. im really trying to love myself. it comes easy to most people but it is very hard for me. ive been working on trying to give myself more breaks. let myself indulge a little bit more. going out by myself and spending time being comfortable in my own skin. even just having more confidence in my step.

i am posting this because if you feel like this, you are not alone. you need to love yourself. i know it is hard but you gotta keep trying. do not ever give up on yourself. ",05Nov2018,1

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to feed you every detail, I just want to share this with someone because I really don't have anybody I feel okay sharing this with and it will be a bit of a secret.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the main story is: everything went wrong lol. I've learned to accept it and laugh at it by now because I wouldn't really be able to survive if I took it seriously but damn. Nobody in my life but my parents even know about this. My grandmother died when I was 5-6ish and my grandfather came and started living with us. For at least months when I was little, he would call me into his room every morning to empty this bucket into our toilet. He never told me why or what it was. It was only when I told my father that I learned it was urine. Gee. Off to a great start.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway years went by and I went to high school. And that was hard. Effing hard. I have a weak chin and my ears stick out so you can cue heavy bullying for a few years. And not just by 1 or 2 groups but by several different people every day. That wasn't fun. However during that time and all throughout college I started getting the mindset ""Screw people, I'm gonna enjoy myself and my life and whether they like it or not, I don't care"", and I learned that as long as I was interesting and funny, I still could get people interested in having dates with me and hanging out with me. All throughout my teenage years I was approaching people I couldn't care less about with one goal in mind: am I funny/interesting enough to get this person interested in me? If no, I would beat myself up. If yes, I would let the person go, and then beat myself up. And then I would meet someone else a few weeks later and restart this whole thing by saying""Maybe I'm not as funny or interesting as I was 1-2 weeks ago"". And I would have to prove myself to myself again.

&amp;#x200B;

And then my grandfather got cancer and died. It was the first time I was faced with death in this way. I mean, we weren't close or anything (duh) but having to go to the hospital, to the place where they basically send living corpses into, hearing doctors telling my father ""Well if he's here you can be sure he's not going anywhere else"", for 5-6 months... That got all that enthusiasm right out of me.

&amp;#x200B;

So now. College. The same pattern still applies. I'm still looking for proof I am funny and interesting enough. It's not that I'm sexually attracted to girl X or that I want to develop a friendship with guy Y. It's just that I want them to take interest in me so I can prove to myself I'm still funny. However, what's been happening, is that girl X doesn't find me funny or interesting. So maybe she's always quiet around me and is extremely talkative and playful around some other guy. Or she doesn't invite me to dinners at her house, or I'm the last one getting invited, or she invites me through someone else. Alarms go off. Or maybe guy Y is friendly at school but never invites me to hang out with his group of friends. Alarms go off. There's clearly something wrong with me. Now every time I see X interacting playfully with someone else (which happens daily), or every time I know Y went out without inviting me, cue jealously and anger and not feeling good enough for anybody.

&amp;#x200B;

And I decided it was time to reach out for help. I'm having my first appointment this week and I haven't been this happy and excited for ages. I literally clapped and went running for a few miles out of happiness when I got the call.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I want to address something else. Every time I've shared this last part of the story on reddit asking for advice, I always come across somebody saying ""Well you're an adult, you don't have anything to do with X or who she chooses as a sexual partner or who she prefers to hang out with, and same goes for Y and his friends"". WELL DUH. You don't say. I know that. I know that this is not normal and that I shouldn't let other people's relationships and choices interfere with how I'm feeling. That's the whole reason I'm reaching out for help in the first place. I'm not blaming anybody else but me and I'm taking action to make things right.

22,"My boyfriend and I have been together for just over a year and got into our first fight recently. He has never raised his voice in his life besides maybe a handful of times, and never to me until the other day. I had mentioned that I might want to apply for disability income, and later when he let it build up it just exploded into ""why cant you just get a real job instead of using disability as a cop-out?"" And even said if I did he might break up with me because he couldnt live with someone ""cheating the system."" He thinks I dont qualify as disabled just because Im not in a wheelchair.

I was... honestly shocked at this reaction. I'm only 22, but I have problems that hes well aware of. I HAVE had jobs, but have trouble holding onto them because of my issues.

I have impact damage in my spine, which makes it VERY difficult to stand for long periods of time. I am legally blind and though I have glasses, its still difficult for me to see. Typing this on my phone is just giving me a headache from trying to focus. I have asthma and swell-up-your-face allergies, which has made physical labor and working outdoors difficult. I take medication for depression but still have to push myself to function even at nearly the maximum legal dose, I have bad anxiety, etc.

A lot of things legally qualify me for disability, and yes it is having an impact on my ability to work. It was really hard for me to admit that I might need it, but after his reaction I feel even more shitty and am afraid to bring it up again. I applied for a new job, but havent heard back yet.

I talked to him about it and I think he understands better now. I didnt think I would have to explain since he has a chronic illness himself, but because he has A++ medical insurance its very well managed.

32,"Hey, everyone! 

I have kind of a story to share with you!

I used to suffer from what was classified as a 'moderate' depression back in the days. As my mental health declined I would also develop migraine-like headaches everytime I left the house for a few hours. 

Those headaches felt as if my eyeballs had turned into hot lumps of coal and my brain had swollen up, hitting against my skull if I only moved the slightest. The first sign of those migraines arising was me getting progressively more tired and struggling to concentrate. A bit later my eyes would hurt if I rolled them to the corners of my eyes, and from there on the pain would just increase until I felt like a tired little kid who wants to lay down where it stands, or start crying out of frustration. 

As result of those migraines, my day was essentially over whenever I returned home from school/work/shopping. I would just pop a painkiller, darken my room, and lay there in quite a vegetative state until I eventually fell asleep. 

If I stayed home or went to another persons place, I was fine, so I concluded that it must be some psychosomatic, stress-related thing linked to my bad mental health. I was always tired, yet pushed myself to be a functional human being, so I interpreted those headaches as my body's attempt to force me back into my cave.

Over the years, I gradually became *much* more healthy, mentally and physically. My attitude towards life was positive, and I was able to find  joy in the smallest things. However, chronic fatigue and migraines always stuck with me. Some say you can't ever fully recover from that chemical imbalance inside your brain, so I just accepted that this must be the leftover symptoms I just had to deal with. That was nothing compared to my worst days, and I wasn't someone to complain a lot anyways, so ... 

Moving on, about three years ago, I noticed how if I looked down on my paper for a while, and looked up again, I would see everything blurry for a few seconds. Also, I felt like things in the distance were occasionally blurring in front of my eyes. That motivated me to get my eyes tested for free at a shop which sells glasses. I had -0.5 on both eyes, but the salesmen told me that's *nothing*, and that it's just a placebo effect that I think looking through those glasses I just tried on made my sight better. ""Why would a salesman who could've made profit off of me lie about this?"", I thought to myself, and agreed that I just got a little hypochrondric.

Nevertheless, it bothered me. Once you notice such a thing, you can't *un-notice* it, you know? So I went to another store a year later, just to be told that -0.5 isn't something anyone needs to get glasses for, because it's perfectly normal to not have perfect eyesight anymore at some point in your life. I'm in my early 20s. I'm told to come back in a few years. 

This year, someone close to me got glasses, which inspired me to get my eyes checked out by a professional doctor. He asks me about other symptoms, I tell him about my migraines. The man is genuinly shocked about me living like that for ~10 years. I immediately get a prescription for glasses (note: where I live insurance will only cover glasses if it's *crucial* for your functionality in everyday life). 

Fast foreward, I now have glasses since two weeks now, and I am *radiating energy*. No more headaches, no more burning eyes. Everything looks brighter and clearer now. I can now concentrate for longer periods of time. I'm looking at the world as I remember doing as a child - without having to try hard to focus, seeing little details such as particles of dust on a cupboard, single hairs of fur on a cat, the various tiny sharp edges of the leaves on a bush, etc. My eyes focus much faster, too - it's as if I am taking pictures with my Canon, except I am looking *through my own eyes*! For the first time, I saw an HD screen in HD - I never really understood where the big difference was to non-HD screens before. Etc etc etc

Whenever I take off my glasses the difference is *huge*. Half of my life could've went much different if I had made this discovery earlier! 

Tl;dr: Don't just sign off things as ""psychosomatic"" and live with them. Always get second, or third, opinions on medical issues. Don't let anyone tell you that a symptom is insignificant, because it's *your* body, reacting *individually*, and what you feel is *real* even if it defies all laws of medicine. Also, glasses make a huge difference. ",05Nov2018,1

34,"I was listening to [Strangers in the Wind](https://open.spotify.com/track/0Yk9pUjag0vNBww57XrzST?si=AVkVdgooRtOZW_mUZft_AQ) and the beginning of the song reminded me of a song I used to listen to on my PSP.

It reminded me of when I used to walk to a tutor everyday and would use my PSP as an iPod. Oh shit I now just remember the guy who uses to take me for a while ‚Äî and his name. (Don't remember the song name but if you can help that would be cool - I should ask /r/tipofmytongue)

Anyway so I'm still searching for this song and I think it's maybe Natasha Bedingfield, which led me to [Unwritten](https://open.spotify.com/track/1D1nixOVWOxvNfWi0UD7VX?si=r3zZxY5tThme4ut7X5di9w).

I don't know why, but this song strikes an emotional chord with me. It's not the lyrics ‚Äî the song itself just overwhelms me with melancholic nostalgia.

Maybe the date is significant, I think. According to Wikipedia it ""was released on 29 November 2004"". Hmm maybe it's from a period of time where my mum was in hospital.

She died in May 2005 and I remember her telling my me and my siblings that she had cancer. We were in a McDonald's. I didn't hear what she said, but my siblings had immediately given her a big hug, and so I joined in as well.

Thing is, whenever I think about May I think ""ooh my birthday is in May!"" (thankfully I don't associate the month with my mum).

And so I thought ""ooh my birthday is in May!"" ‚Äî but given the context I'm reminded of my sister telling me ""recently"" (once in the past few years) that I got so many presents for my birthday that month.

Which then cemented a memory in time for me. I remember being at my grandma's house. My mum wasn't there with me. Some of my presents were in her house. Some cousins from London were here at my grandma's house, and they usually only came only once a year, if ever.

I remember an aunt asking what I wanted for my birthday. I didn't usually get that many presents from my family.

My cousins (well actually cousins removed once, my cousin's children) were hanging out with me in front garden. My granddad used to angry with the kids going in the back garden, but he didn't care this time.

Oh. And that reminds me of the pop disc: it had Witch Doctor, Barbie Girl, and a couple others songs on it. Probably S Club as well. It was two discs. My mum had bought me this album/compilation/CD and I really liked the music. But it was my cousin's birthday and so my mum needed to give the compilation as the present because she didn't have time to go get a present.

My mum promised me she would get me a new CD but that never happened. I guess the timeline was set up in such a way that made this impossible. Maybe she just hated the music and wanted to get rid of it.

I remember trying to scam my cousin's mum out of the CDs. She proposed we could share one CD each for a few days. I tried getting both for myself so I could keep it. Lol.

I remember visiting my mum in the hospital and her getting given hospital food. She gave her dessert to me. It was apple crumble. I guess cancer fucks with your appetite. I was happy to eat it. I remember her orange juice (orange squash) but maybe I'm mixing memories here.

Maybe it's good that I don't remember much from my childhood. I can't imagine what it's like for my older siblings who probably remember and have a (metal, video) record of everything.

My mum used to record everything from my siblings' childhood but I was seven when she died and so there aren't many (or any) videos with me. Or any with me talking.

Heh. I should try to recover the VCRs and somehow convert them to a video format. It'd be nice to see her again. I've kinda forgotten what she looks like. I remember her short black hair. A bit of her face. Her blue coat. The utility room in our old home.

Anyway, time to stop being emo on Reddit, and time to write a fucking C compiler. I need to return some jeans and clean my damn room.

One last thing: it's cool how I associate some songs with certain memories. It helps pin down a date to that memory.",05Nov2018,1

38,"Here's how it works:

1. The legal prohibition on sex work creates an artificial scarcity in the supply of sex.
2. This leads to a bunch of thirsty dudes running around trying to get laid, which creates greater demand for sex, which increases women's market power.
3. Because women have greater market power in the sexual marketplace, even mediocre women are able to command a higher price and discard a large number of otherwise good dudes if they are not perfect, let alone people with deformities or disabilities or what have you. Exhibit A being most dudes automatically right-swiping on dating apps but mostly getting rejected, and women being able to be really choosy.
4. Some percentage of men will be disaffected and alienated under this system, and they will predictably lash out in all kinds of ways, including misogyny and sexual assault and outright violence sometimes. (I'm not at all justifying this, but I am saying it is a predictable consequence of the legal prohibition on sex work.)

Under this system, even the winners are losers. Why do men spend their lives acquiring ridiculous fortunes rather than moving on and actually helping the species? A major reason is that they are competing for women's attention, which would not be as valuable if there were not so many thirsty dudes running around and supply was not restricted.

Everyone loses in this system in the long run. Men end up being much more brutal to each other than they would otherwise be, because they're trying to win the contest for female attention in a high demand, restricted supply marketplace, and as a result the prohibition on sex work turns otherwise good men into toxic winners (acquiring ridiculous fortunes) or toxic losers (incels).

No one wants to advocate for or be associated with incels because thirsty dudes are by definition at the bottom of the social hierarchy and may have any number of liabilities, mental illnesses, or deformities or what have you.

But imagine how wonderful life could have been and could be if people were less brutal toward one another and just accepted and acknowledged each others' humanity rather than punching down on the people who are already losers in society under the current social and legal rules.

For the record, I hold my opinions lightly, I consider this one reasonable perspective among many, and I could argue for alternative views.

In the dark, barely lit by a dim street light, glaring at passersby that stare, digging and kicking the blade into the soft earth. Surprising what a moment of relapse of control can make me do. Thankfully, my thin nitrile gloves held up well against the rough grain and the bits of wood sticking out. Superior puncture resistance.

 I went back there today, the same hour as before. I didn't dig it back up though. One of the street lamps were replaced with a brighter one - possibly an LED lamp. I just stood on the spot for a little. The place I dug up (I did put the wet dirt back in and sprinkled dry sand over it, effectively masking the wetness - but the slight bumpiness didn't go away even after some amount of pacing and patting on it.) was practically unnoticeable.

44,"There's a wonderful man in my life who has been my best friend, besides God, for many years. I will call him Joe. I am unable to travel in my own. He has traveled multiple times for me. I forget I'm disabled physically and mentally when we chat. I feel like I am in a safe haven as long as he's near. :)

I got distracted when his brother started acting like he wanted me to pick him instead of Joe. But the brother only made efforts with others, never with me. I have even been accused of being jealous of the other girls, when the reality is I was never jealous. If he can want to make the effort with others and he knows others are telling me he isn't making the effort with me because I'm handicapped, wouldn't it make sense for him to either make the effort with me to prove them wrong or to contact me and let me know what's going on? He also has a temper that has frightened me and landed me in the hospital many times unconscious.

Every time I fantasized about him, Joe would be there too. I am not the type who is into 3-sums, but my heart apparently has been reminding me of the safe haven I have in Joe and the possibly deadly stress I get from his brother. My heart is never letting go of Joe and it has been letting me know. I have been warned since my twenties (I am 41 now) to stay away from his brother because his brother would hurt me. I always gave him a chance to be believed.

He has asked many girls out while privately wanting me to pick him. My stepdad and others have wondered repeatedly why he has never asked me out if he truly wanted me because I can't travel on my own but he can, and it would mean he has to travel to me to date me.

The stress for a while killed my belief in romantic love and my love of romantic movies on Hallmark and UP. After I recently realized Joe is my true love and has been all along, my belief in romantic love started seeing a resurrection and I can watch movies on Hallmark and UP. These movies don't have a romance focal point, but they still have romance intertwined in them somehow. So, I'm counting it. I still watched the mystery movies on Hallmark all this time.

I am not mad at Joe's brother. He made efforts where he wanted to make them. I wish him well.

I would be lying if I said that I didn‚Äôt think that their relationship destroyed our friend group. I don‚Äôt even see anyone else in our friend group anymore either.

61,"I'm from the US and recently spent some time in a Nordic country. Almost every day I went to two different swimming pools because apparently that's the thing to do there and their pools are AMAZING. Some of them were tourist spots but most of them were just public pools where the majority of people were locals. 

I knew going into it that I was entering a different culture with different norms. This gave me a little anxiety at first but I also tend to be a rule-follower so when I noticed all the signs IN ENGLISH (coincidence? Not likely) that gave explicit instructions on how to shower NAKED before getting into the pool I decided to go ahead and do what they asked. Plus, everyone else was doing it. It didn't take long for it to just feel normal. I even started to notice how easy it was to pick an American tourist out in the locker room because there'd be 20 other people in the shower and they'd be the only one so terrified of someone seeing their junk that they'd be showering with their suit on. I'm sure the locals were internally rolling their eyes (I was). 

So I've been back in the States for a while and the difference is pretty amazing. Of course all of the pools have showers and you're supposedly required to shower, but hardly anyone actually uses them; if they do, they wear their suits; and they usually don't even have soap to wash with! How are you supposed to wash your buttcrack with your suit on and no soap? They just make this stupid rule even though they have no expectation of anyone actually following it. If ya'll are too ashamed or sketched out by nudity that you'd rather swim with some rando's dingleberries, let's just save the money and quit putting showers in the locker rooms. Or maybe just be an adult and don't put your suit on until after you've showered because that's fucking gross, for real. ",05Nov2018,1

I get transferred to level 2 support after a 30 minute wait on hold and calling back again. This time I get yelled at and lectured about modifying my system, having my 8 and 11 year old children accused of having tampered with the device. Entirely talked over me I sorta have a panic attack and hang up.

I'm at a loss here guys, I wish I knew what to do.. I worked up the nerves to call back again, this time defeated and wondering if I could at least save my hundreds of hours of saves transferred to a new system or if my account is permanently tainted, when it's revealed I have one chargeback on my account on October 30th. I've never chargedback anything and didn't even know it was something you could do. The support agent asked me for the last four digits of my current credit cards and none of them matched...

What do I do? What did I do? How can I prevent this from happening again? Why is my favorite company punishing me like this?!
