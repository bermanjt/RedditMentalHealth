1,"Tl;dr: Long probably boring read. I’m just a sad teenager who feels alone and needed to get everything out there. 

I just managed to stop bawling after doing it for 30 minutes straight. I’m in my car parked in a parking lot just so I can be alone. It feels like I haven’t had a real friend in my entire life. I have no one that truly wants to be with me. I’m not antisocial, I’m the one that cracks jokes and talks to everyone. I’m not ugly, I’m not dumb. Why is it I can’t get anyone to like me? I always have a group of friends in school who seem genuinely happy to talk to me and see me but never outside of school. Its been like this my whole life no matter who I’m with. I always tag along with others and am never invited out. In elementary school I didn’t really think about it too much, but I never had many play dates or hung out with the kids from school. One day towards the end of fifth grade everyone st my lunch table told me to my face they weren’t my friends. Neighborhood kids went to a different school than me, so I was an outsider from the start and eventually got pushed away. Middle school was hell for me. I managed to become friends with all the people in the popular group and they even invited me to hang out a couple times before they eventually stopped. Freshman year of high school I abandoned all my middle school “friends” and started trying to find new people but found no one. Spent the whole year talking to people in class and on my sports team and all of them seemed to like me but not really though I guess. Sophomore year I somehow managed to tag along with the right people and met new friends. Me and one other became especially close and I got to experience all the joys of being a teenager. It was great. I was happy. But only the one friend would invite me out places. Everyone else seemed to enjoy my presence when I was there but never wanted to invite me to anything. Me and that friend have now drifted apart and I’m back to ground zero. 

I called my old good friend and one others “friend” today to see if I could find some plans but was turned down twice. 

I could go on forever but this is as long as I want to write. I know this is shit quality and no one really cares but I needed to put it out somewhere. I feel so alone. ",06Oct2018,1

4,"i don’t know where to post this but i just wanted to talk to someone about it like get it out there. but yeah, it has been months and months of deep depression almost just feeling numb. i have been struggling so much with my health physically and mentally, and everything else. i’m not going to get into everything because who cares... but basically it has been the worst spring/ summer i’ve ever had. i feel like i’m wasting away. 

i watched [Fraiser](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasier) a couple of years ago on Netflix because it was my grandpa’s favorite show and just kinda forgot about it. I started watching it again and I haven’t laughed like this in months. I recommend this show to everyone. It is a spin off of another show but you don’t really have to watch the first show to understand this one. This is a very witty show if that is your style. this is the best i’ve felt in months. 

who knew a show could pull you out of such a dark place... i thought i would never smile again.",06Oct2018,1
5,"I accidentally fell asleep earlier, only to have a horrible nightmare I couldn’t wakeup from. The dream was me living my life, but I would “wakeup” weeks later and be told by friends and family that I had a mental breakdown. This went on for a bit, and I remember feeling scared and frustrated not being able to make it stop. 

I woke up in a cold sweat, breathing like crazy, and in the fetal position. I’m still trying to calm down from it. ",06Oct2018,1
6,"Hi, 

I am just wondering, what makes people get **motivated** over things/projects? I am motivated by many projects most of the time, living in an intense fun&amp;healthy workaholism; but in certain instances I get demotivated and wonder whether it is all worth it after all. I feel this is perfectly normal, but I'd love to know some of the ""science"" behind it or factors that affect the feeling of motivation or getting excited for things in general.

Does this happen to you? How or why do you think you get excited with things/projects? :)

13,"I graduated in 2017. I know everyone says this, but I genuinely feel like I wasted those years. I spent the first two years incredibly depressed. I wasn’t an athlete, or a band kid, or anything. People were also either brutally mean, or ignored me all together. I went to therapy and by junior year, I wasn’t feeling like myself, but I had the building blocks to heal. But my first two years were so bad, my brain has actually blocked all memory of them. No joke. I remember almost nothing from my freshman or sophomore years. 

The last two years were just spent chasing after 2 different girls. I was crazy about the first one, but she eventually ended up with my close friend. The second was a damaged soul. She displayed many signs of borderline personality disorder. She also lied about previous sexual assaults and threatened self harm when my life wasn’t 100% focused on her. After I safely ended things, I started realizing that I did nothing meaningful with high school, but by then I was graduated.

The last two paragraphs are the entirety of my teenage life. No parties. No risk taking. No football games or anything else that makes high school special. Just a lot of late nights crying and wishing I could be more. I ended with a 2 GPA and few good memories.

But this isn’t supposed to be a “my life sucks” story. I’ve grown so much in the past year or so. I’m so confident and extroverted. I can crack jokes and tell stories and everyone tells me I light up a room with my personality. I’m hard working(and hard spending). I channel my pain into music and I’m looking to record my own EP with recording equipment I bought. I can talk to girls now who I would have never even made eye contact with two years ago, but I still haven’t gotten back into dating yet, mostly because I feel that I need to care for myself more first. I’m physically healthier and I wake up most days curious to learn new things.

15,"This is something I never like to admit because it simply isn't me. But for the past few years, I have not been myself, and it's a long road to get things right (aka back to where they were).

I was always independent, I have always understood my problems and have been able to face them head on. I grew up alone. I've had a lot of time to learn about myself and explore my mind and know who I was. Then the girl of my dreams walked into my life. We understood each other so perfectly and helped each other out all the time. She was my best friend. We soon fell in love and it was to this day, I identify those as the happiest days of my life. How couldn't they be? I was happy with who I was, and was with the best girl I could ever ask for. We were perfect for each other.

Some time goes by and we begin to part ways because there were outer factors beyond our control that made it difficult for us to be together. I handled it pretty well at the time, understanding that if it's not in my control I shouldn't worry about it. So we stopped talking like we used to. I started seeing other people.

Some more time goes by (we're at about 3 years ago now) and something terrible happened. To this day, I still have no idea what caused this, but everything that made me happy and who I was vanished in the blink of an eye. I started having panic/anxiety attacks. I've never had panic attacks in my entire life. But now, I still get them today. I completely lost my sense of self and understanding and for the very first time since I was literally a child, like pre-13 years old, I felt like I needed **help.** I, for the first time in many, many years, felt like I needed to reach out to somebody. Not just a helping hand though, like I was on my knees begging for someone to take me out of my misery.

By the way, before all of that anxiety stuff hit me, I never, ever used drugs (except my prescription anti-depressants and vyvanse just to help keep me focused if I ever felt like I needed it. I also smoked weed very, very rarely. I was never a smoker or drug user of any kind. I never even cared enough to think about them, really.) I went on feeling this way for a very long time, and it's never gotten better, and I ended up coming to accept that asking for help is what I need to do. But it was so foreign to me that I literally felt handicapped. As time went on I began to adjust to things and began to at least feel a little bit better. I started going out to parties all the time (another thing I never really did), I got involved with a lot more drugs, and little did I know that despite me feeling content/happy, I was not who I once was and this feeling of content really blinded me from that.

So fast forward a little bit and that girl I used to talk to came back, and to make a very long story short, she was the closest thing in my life at that point I had that made me feel like myself, because I know I said I was content, but deep down I knew I wasn't truly happy with who I was. This doesn't mean I didn't realize how much I've changed though. So when she comes back only for me to be this entirely different person, we clashed. A lot. And some more...and some more. We fought so much; we were in two completely different mindsets now, and she made me realize that so fucking fast it's honestly crazy. I wasn't happy to, but I realized I wasn't the guy she fell in love with anymore. And I absolutely hated it. We **never** fought before. I was so confused, I didn't know whether to be mad at her for not accepting me or mad at myself for not catching myself from falling into this rut sooner.

Fast forward to today, at this very moment. Her and I are still talking since we've gotten back in touch after so much time *not* talking to each other. Things still aren't the same way they used to be (or rather how I'd like them to be); her and I don't fit like puzzle pieces the way we used to. Communicating with each other is a lot more difficult and compared to who we once were, it's become an uphill battle for us to gel. But we're together because we love each other and while we both know we're not where we once were with each other, **I** know that I'm to blame, and this brings me to my main point.

I have become too reliant on other people, and while my mind is a lot nicer to me nowadays, this is my number one flaw, and I encourage anyone reading this to do the same as what I want to do for myself. Back before all of this started I never bothered to remember or think about what made me so good at handling my problems because I never expected that I would be sitting here, years from then, *needing* to know what made me who I was. But as the days go by I learn more and more, and I have her to thank because she understands me more than anyone else, and we can agree that we both liked who I was before, and who I, right now aspire to be.

**TL;DR (This is my personal takeaway):** Set yourself on a path towards personal development. I'm not saying it's not okay to ask for help, but **do not rely solely on other people to solve your problems.** Learn to face your problems head on, do not give up on or let yourself go like I did. Do not let anything or anyone change who you are. Aspire to become a better person than you were yesterday, everyday. Live whatever way that allows you to be comfortable with who you are.",06Oct2018,1

So since I moved out here the vast majority of the people I've met out here are mormon. I've met a bunch of awesome people that I've become friends with but at the end of each day I feel unsettled. No matter how my day was or what I've accomplished I always feel like I could be doing more, this leads me to lose a ton of sleep each night. My school is in a small town with not much to do at all. I spend most my time doing school work, in class, or playing video games with friends. I love spending time with my friends here but I'm not a fan of video games and neither are any of my friends, we just resort to them out of boredom.

Look at Jimmy Page, one of the most loved and admired guitarists of all time. He was having sex with thirteen year old girls when he was in his twenties. If someone did that today practically the whole world would unite in hating that person but because he was a rock star somehow that's totally different. People love to argue that ""it was different back then"" but it was also different back when it was socially acceptable to call all black people the n-word. That doesn't mean that it was *okay* to call them that back then, it just means society didn't protect people's rights like they do today, or at least attempt to. The sexual abuse of children wasn't something anyone talked about back then, now people *have* to talk about it in order to protect the rights of children.

So much music has been ruined for me by reading about what the people who made that music actually got up to. I guarantee that everyone who worships Jimmy Page thinks Gary Glitter is a terrible person but they're both the same, they're both paedophiles.

35,"
My name is Jessica Erickson. The first time I was raped was when I was around four or five years old. I was allowed to stay up late to watch 'Beavis and Butthead' with my stepfather (at the time). When both my mother and sister had been asleep for around 30 minutes, my stepfather raped me. Since I told my mother everything at the time, I told her what he did to me the following day during breakfast. His response was to strip me and lock me in the backyard. I screamed and cried as the sun came up.

The sexual abuse from this man continued for years following the first incident, becoming codified into a routine as time went on, interspersed with the occasional beating or involuntary confinement. For example, after a year or so, my sister and I took turns on Wednesdays each week either doing dishes or being raped by him.

Around that time, there was a field trip, and one girl was loudly talking about what she had seen on the news: a woman had been raped. First, she explained how the police were handling the case. Then, after someone else asked what rape even was, she detailed what had happened to the woman.

As she spoke, I realized that her explanation of what rape was was what was happening to my sister and I. Since the girl seemed to be an expert on the matter, I thought that if I told her what was happening to me, she could tell me how to get help. So I said ""Then I've been raped, too"". She responded ""No you haven't! If you were raped, you'd be dead"". At that point, I thought that maybe my understanding was wrong after all, and what was happening to us was as normal as I thought it was before.

About a year after that bus ride, something changed, and my stepfather sat my sister and I down in front of the front door to our house. He had a shiny silver revolver in his right hand. I remember thinking that I was about to die, but didn't really know why. He then pointed the gun at each of us, saying that if one of us told anyone what he was doing to us, he would kill the other one, then kill our mother. After that, we were sent off to bed.

The next day, when I was at recess, I was thinking about running away. I stared out at the house we lived in across the street, that he was in at the time, and was trying to figure out how to run away without him, or anyone who might tell him that I had run away, noticing. A girl who was trying to be friends with me asked me why I wasn't coming in from recess. I said ""I don't want to go home"". She accepted that, then went inside.

Not long after she left, one of the recess teachers came out and pulled me back inside the school building, straight to the counselor's office. The counselor was told what I said and kept asking me why I didn't want to go home. For a while, I said ""Nothing"" and ""I don't know"", remembering the threat from the night before. I didn't know that what he had been doing to my family was illegal. I didn't know that society didn't like people like that. I didn't know that someone could help me get my family away from him.

As each lie piled up around me in the counselor's office, I felt more and more guilty, because I did know that lying was a sin. Finally, I broke with the condition that they would protect my sister. I remember sobbing in the process, because I couldn't get them to protect my mother, too. My sister and I were sent to Child Protective Services that day and a foster home that night. I think it was in October, because the next time I saw my mother was several days later in the school's cafeteria, which was covered with Halloween decorations.

The reason I am sharing my story today is that this country is heading in a direction that would have led to my death two decades ago. I had to tell three times over 4 years to escape the clutches of the man who abused me, my sister, and my mother (and another mother and daughter before he found us). Dr. Blasey Ford is on number two. If you, the Senate, confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court today without a full investigation into the allegations against him, you will be telling every one of your constituents that, if they are suffering, like I did, at the hands of someone else, there is no point in telling, because the people in power don't care and aren't listening.

I have sent this letter to both of the Senators of my home state, the Great State of Colorado, and posted it online. The one who is reading this to you is the one who is actually listening. If you value the honor of your positions as the voices of the people, then please do not confirm someone suspected of sexual misconduct to the highest court of our country. Clear his name first. Lead this country by showing us that allegations of sexual assault, sexual abuse, and attempted rape should be taken seriously by those with the power to investigate those allegations.

36,"Posted a confession earlier but I left out a lot, so I wanted to get it right. 

I’m a pathological liar.. it’s been pretty obvious since I was a child, to me at least. I’m an almost 18 year old girl. Everything in this post is true. I have nothing to loose since I’m using a throw away account. 

I grew up in a good home. My parents are and were incredible. They love me and support me. My sister is great too. 

When I was 15 I started to begin being taught that I was only useful for sex. I was pressured into a blowjob, the first time I ever did anything sexual. Didn’t feel much, moved on. I just thought from there on out the only interaction I deserved is being used for sex. I was ok with that since I was pretty emotionless. It didn’t bother me. I had a good friend I would enjoy spending time with. 

After a party one night I needed a place to go. Went to someone’s house who i met at a party, he was sober, and so was I. I blatantly said no to hooking up with him. He kept touching me and taking off my clothes. It was really uncomfortable and the morning after he drove me home, he didn’t talk, he asked how old I was (as if he didn’t know) I said 16, he was 20. I did say no here, multiple times, but I could have gotten up or done something more. I just was very uncomfortable and wanted it to be morning so I could just go home so I kinda just let it go. 

I lied that he raped me. There was no penetration. He just kept touching me and undressing me. No one I knew, knew him. He wouldn’t get in trouble, and no one knows I lied about this. I don’t know why I did it. It’s like I can’t help myself. 

Throughout high school I would give myself bruises, and would lie that my dad gave me the bruises even though it was completely a lie. My dad is amazing. 


I was assaulted twice. One time in someone’s bed next to my best friend I was forced into being fingered. One time I was asleep and woke up with hands in my pants and on my breasts. 
I was so humiliated, I wanted to die. I cried all of the next day. 

I cry and have panic attacks every time I even try to have sex now. I always blame it on the “rape”. No one will really take it seriously if I only blame the assault. I am nothing but a shitty fucked up liar. 

My ex boyfriend fucked me up pretty bad. My relationship with him was based on avoiding sex through my “rape” he was a fucked up person too. He emotionally abused me by telling me I was stupid, to shut up everytime I opened my mouth. After I let go of my fears and had sex with him the first time he expected it every time. Once he kicked me out (I was drunk and would’ve had to sleep in my car) because I didn’t want it. Another time, he manipulated me into sex. I said I didn’t feel like it but he just kept pushing. I started crying during sex, it turned into a panic attack. He still finished then, kicked me out. I ended things with him earlier today. 

it’s almost as if I started using this excuse of being raped as a way to avoid sex. (Most) People understand if you have gone through trauma and don’t want it, but not if you just don’t want it. I didn’t want to be an object anymore. 

The worst part is I’ve never been caught in a lie. No one has ever called me out on this because I know exactly what to say and how to lie. People also really really like me. They put me on a pedestal without knowing me. I don’t know why, I am not a real person. I’m living a huge huge lie.

I'm not ready to go, I don't know when I'll be, but death can take me anytime. It makes me shake just thinking about it. I'm never going to be able to put everything right, and be able to lay on my deathbed happy with my life. I could go in an hour, or 80 years. It scares me so much. There's going to be a time where I step outside and see the sun rise, the last time I hug, the last time I cry, and the last time I smile. And I can't deal not knowing when.

39,"“this is the only thing i do that makes sense,” her eyes dart around the staged room, looking for a face or place to settle, “it’s the only thing about me that i like, everything else is shaded in fake, erratic and removed from this thing that is me,” her eyes plead with something i don’t quite see.

“a few scraps of letters bound together by custom, education, and a strange intuition,” she slides to the floor, lets out her legs, “letters combined to make words that combine to make sense of the stuff of everyday life,” she kicks off her worn out shoes.

40,"The 1990’s are often described as the second summer of love, for teens and young adults’ alike drugs were plentiful, and we were all doing them. Our teenage years were full of excitement, drama, overreaction, fun, chaos and peer pressure. At 15 years of age, pressure from our peers can make or break reputations, while daunting, everyone wants to fit in, to be in the cool crowd that thinks they are above everyone else.

While our parents preach to us about drugs and alcohol, we go along with their words and agree with what they have said about alcohol and drugs, many hear the message but ignore it at the same time. As we mature, looking back we notice how stupid we looked not only while on drugs, but also how we handled ourselves in an attempt to be somebody, a cool person who walks with a fake limp.

It is a given that many mistakes will be made during these years as we struggle to find exactly who we are and want to be. In high school, finding myself meant trying various drugs and attempting to get with girls; school work was my last priority. Our in crowd was the most important I had encountered. I was accepted and welcomed into the group of people that my parents ultimately warned me about. These are not those people I thought, my new friends are the real deal.

It is was Friday afternoon, school was almost out; and for the twentieth time that day I pulled a small piece of aluminum foil from my wallet. Wrapped into a small square and tucked safely within a small pouch, I couldn’t help but check on it every chance I had. I could not let the foil and its contents get wet as my hit of acid would be destroyed, or even worse, absorb into my skin while at school. Butterflies fluttered throughout my abdomen as the evening grew closer. I needed it for the upcoming night.

Within the tin foil tucked safely within my wallet was a square piece of litmus paper, it was stamped with a pair of purple colored lips on one side. About a quarter size of a stamp, it had been soaked in lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD. We heard the older crowd tell stories of their trips on it, this made us want to experience it too. The 1990’s era was a different time in history, one before widespread use of the internet and the age of social media. It was a simpler time, much easier to hide things from our parents and to escape them without a mobile phone ringing off the hook.

My friend and I had been saving our LSD hits for the right time, we knew it would last about eight to ten hours, that’s what we heard anyway. Neither one of us had a driver’s license, much less a vehicle, so when an acquaintance asked us to go out that night, we knew it was right time to stick the soaked litmus paper on our tongues.

A teen club called ‘The Yellow Rose’ was the place to be. The club played cheesy dance music where people did the ‘running man’ and snuck in alcohol to drink. Rivals from surrounding cities met up to fight one another; it was a normal teen hangout. Our acquaintance picked us up in his T-top 1985 IROC-Z Chevrolet Camaro, a beast of a car that did donuts on demand. My friend and I decided not to let our driver know about our Purple Lips, this friend was not down with partying like we wanted to.

Butterflies filled my abdomen as we arrived at the teen club destination. Hesitant to unwrap the foil, we held off on dropping the hits until we arrived inside the club; in all honesty, we were a bit fearful of what was about to happen. As the three of us walked into the packed venue, girls in daisy dukes did the tootsie roll and twerked against the wall as a two group of guys rolled around on the floor after bumping into each other.

We found an open table overlooking the dance floor and grabbed a seat. Our friend who drove us there walked off to grab a coke and follow a girl he had been eyeing. It was now or never to drop the Purple Lips onto our tongues. Unwrapping the foil, we placed the hits onto our tongues. Neither of us were dancers, so we sat, watched, and waited to see what would happen.

My abdomen continued to fill with butterflies that fluttered up into my throat. I started to feel a little uppity as a soft vibration moved throughout my whole body. Soon afterwards, we began to laugh for no reason at all while pointing out people and objects that appeared funny, unnatural, and out of this world.

People started to look extremely strange, their facial expressions were exaggerated as we read their minds and giggled. Even though the cheesy music being played at the club was horrible, it began to make sense in every way possible. While soaking in the external stimuli being fed to me and singing along to the music, a unifying vibration took over every inch of my skin, on occasion, a heat wave shook my bones from head to toe.

Gradually and without warning, the LSD was in full effect over us. Bug eyed and insane looking, we browsed the club laughing at every person who looked at us, as their faces sloughed off. Traces of light filled the room as I turned my head. The DJ’s voice made no sense as his words sounded like gibberish. People were weird beings doing their own thing as we observed them from the outside looking in.

A sense of wonder, oneness, and amazement stopped the hands of time, five hours felt like thirty minutes, it was time to go. During the drive back home from the club, my friend and I laughed at everything and nothing, our acquaintance driving thought we had been drinking. He looked at us like we had went insane. The laughter finally stopped as we pulled up at the driver’s house. His mother sat on the porch swing petting a cat and smoking a cigarette.

Attempting to avoid her at all cost, we walked into the kitchen and sat down. A split-second later she entered the kitchen too. We had to face the mother who was still awake and asking multiple questions. At the kitchen table bug eyed and lost, I stared at the wall as its paisley wallpaper spiraled like a top, the walls moved in and out as if the house was taking deep breaths, every other object in sight waved like a flag in the wind. I am unsure what she asked or told us, we seemed to make it through. The sky became green, clouds turned red, life was anything but blue.",06Oct2018,1

43,"And today is my birthday.. I spent the whole day laying on my bed, watching YouTube videos, browsing Reddit and sleeping.

44,"For a long time I've felt really insecure about being single and not feeling as if I'm desirable to women. I thought I'd just end up dying alone, never experiencing the warmth, comfort, and love of a relationship. Same for sex. I thought I was too ugly and awkward for anybody to want to do such a thing with me. ""Women have standards"" I would tell myself. ""No way those standards go that low."" 

Now... I don't really give a shit anymore. I've finally convinced myself that I don't need those things to be happy in life. I've gotten more comfortable with being single and with the person I am. Being a single virgin doesn't necessarily indicate being a failure in life or that something's wrong. Life can totally go on and be great while staying a single virgin. 

I guess the reason it gets to me so much is my age. It seems like half the people at school have an S.O. I see people flirting, hugging, laughing, and just being happy with their S.O.s and do shit like successfully ask someone to homecoming. This all just has to do with the feeling of being left out. I've now realized that what I should be doing is making my own happiness and carving my own path so to speak. Yesterday I went to a listening party at a record store for the new Behemoth album. That was the most fun I had in a while. There wasn't a care in the world for me, just the great people there and the music. That's what makes me happy, and it had nothing to do with dating or sex. 

I kinda see dating as sex in the same way as skydiving (as stupid as that sounds). Sure, it might be really fun and great to experience it, but there are so many other amazing things to do and fun to be had without ever experiencing it once in your lifetime. I'm okay with never experiencing a woman's touch or affection ever in my life. This is what I mean by ""progress...I guess."" While I don't personally think I'll be having sex or getting into a relationship anytime soon, I realize it's actually possible that I'll experience it at least once, and if I don't, that's okay. What matters most is that I'm happy with who I am (while realizing there's room for improvement) and what I've got.

47,"I've never had any pets in my life but on Saturday night when a kitten was at my door meowing I let her in and she has been here ever since.

She happily ate chicken meat scraps, chicken organs and goat brains which my friendly butcher gave me. But I noticed she had diarrhea. It was green in color with bits of white things (picture in the end if you can look at it). Her diarrhea got better because the last time I saw her poop it was semi okay but I haven't seen any signs of poop since Tuesday (maybe Wednesday) morning. Anyways, I continued to feed her to the best of my abilities. But she hasn't eaten anything since the past three days, including today. She eats one or two pieces of meat scraps and doesn't eat the rest. But I'm assuming she's hungry because she does sniff the food whenever she passes by her food bowl. I got her some cat food but turns out its for adults so she didn't touch it. 

English isn't my first language so I don't know what the word for the place is but she's inside the boundary of my house but outside the walls of my house. Make any sense, (I'll take a picture of the place later). The reason I'm telling you this is because stray cats often come inside by climbing over the wall looking for shelter at night. The problem is that they tend to bully the kitten. They also eat her food so I cant leave it in the bowl for her to eat it anytime she wants to because it will be gone by the time she gets to it. I managed to feed her a few bites today by constantly holding a piece of chicken heart under her mouth until she ate it. For some reason she's more likely to try to eat if the food is in my hand.

I live in a country where pets aren't the norm so pet food is hard to find. My car will be back from the workshop on Monday (hopefully) so I can't buy kitten food until than. Vets are also very hard to find since most of them are quacks in very legit looking self owned clinics, (human Doctors are okay though).

She is extremely human friendly and its hard to walk in the area she's in because she keeps getting in the way of your feet. But now she doesn't do that as much as she used to (maybe its because of low energy due to not eating).

If anyone can figure out her age by pictures than please do tell

**TL;DR**  
1. Cat had diarrhea which I think got better but she has stopped eating.
2. How to stop other cats from bullying her?

I've never been this stressed in my life. I even dreamed of me trying to feed her something.

There were a few other things I wanted to mention but can't remember right now so please look for edits. Also mods, if this isn't the right place to post this then please tell me where to post before deleting it. I'm not a part of any pet related reddit community so I have no idea where else I can post this.

51,"As someone who grew up walking on eggshells, I am highly critical of myself and often seek validation during a conversation (after making a comment, etc.) I used to get yelled at a lot over little things and felt that I had to go out of my way not to be noticed by my mother who would start drunken arguments randomly. That led me to adopt a mindset of, ""is this ok?""

What are some ways to overcome this and ""take ownership"" of my own thoughts, opinions, etc?/How can I be less critical or doubting of myself? It's affecting how I interact with friends, people at work, etc. and I want to become a carefree/happy person.

For example, I generally get very animated when talking about things I enjoy but when I don't see a matched enthusiasm, I often get deflated or wonder if I ""said something wrong.""

52,"I don't wanna make this too long, but before my grandma (3-4 years ago) was like any normal grandma. Cooking food, going for walks or to the nearby market.

But now she lives in a apartment complex (?) where there is a lot of elderly and disabled people. 

She barely goes outside, maybe max once a month. She is basically inside home, alone, only thing being is her TV and bed. She is alone all the time, her man sees her however maybe 2-3 times a week and brings her alcohol every Friday, maybe even on other days.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, grandma was not answering my mothers calls or texts, so my mom went to check out if she was alright.

She was found in the bathroom, almost glued to the toilet seat because she was sitting there in that exact same position for like 20 hours. Her leg was swollen really bad, and she was not able to walk at all. 

My mom told her we need to call an ambulance, but she refused and told my mom she wants to die. She refused, she did not wanna get better. She could get surgery for her legs (she has a lot of pain when moving around) or even medicine.

The thing is, this has happened 3-4  times during this year. Maybe not as bad, but that my mom has found our grandma somewhere laying on the floor (not answering calls) not able to stand up or move. Because my grandma is quite big as a person, if she falls to the ground she cant get up. + The pain.

&amp;#x200B;

What can even be done? I think my grandma is heavily depressed, she must be. Sitting inside 24/7, only entertaiment being your TV and a bed, must not be good for anybody. 

She also barely socializes, only with her man or my mom. Sometimes she calls her kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

She is not even ""that"" old, she is 69. But its not looking good for him. She maybe leaves her home maybe MAX once a month, all the other time is spent inside, sitting in her couch or bed. She has really poor diet too, because she doesn't cook.

&amp;#x200B;

I also suffer from depression myself and its hard to see her do so bad. I can imagine her life being not that enjoyable, with that much pain and not  really anybody to talk to.

I also started to feel guilty, because I haven't seen my grandma a lot and she lives 10 minutes from my house. Literally 10 minutes and I'll be at her house, but I just haven't visited in a while. I feel guilty. I'm probably her ""favorite"" grand son, and I barely even visit her or call. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger (7-12) I used to live a lot with my grandma and spend time with her because my mom had to work. 

This just sucks. Do you guys have any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

I was even thinking of maybe offering her some weed, this is probably a bad idea and I will probably not do it but it just crossed my mind. Marijuana helps a lot with pain and other things, it could really help her.

But im from EU, where weed is obviously illegal and she probably thinks that it's a drug on the same level as heroin. 

But it just crossed my mind, should I offer him weed. It really could help, if done correctly.",06Oct2018,1

This morning I called my dentist's office to ask how much it would cost me out of pocket for two crowns that I need. For starters when you call you have to choose the existing paitent line or the new patient line.

So I tell her my name and that I'm an existing patient and GOING BY MY TREATMENT PLAN I need two crowns and I'm wanting to know how much out of pocket it will cost me. She tells me I'll need to come in to be seen by the dentist to figure out what I need.

Me: ...I am already a patient...

Stupid lady: Oh uh can you spell your last name?

I spell it out four time with her repeating it each time for her to tell me I'm not a patient there. My last name isn't common but it's not hard to spell and is only a few letters long.

Stupid lady: Um ok so I'm not seeing you as a patient in my system. Are you sure you come here?

Me: Yes. We have talked in person multiple times, I was last there in August for myself and last month with my husband where I again spoke with you.

Stupid: Oh um spell your last name again...

So I do and she again repeats it back.

Stupid lady: Oh I was spelling it wrong. So you want to make an appointment?

Me: No, I want to know how much out of pocket crowns will cost me.

Stupid lady: Your insurance is covering 90% so you would pay like 10% out of pocket.

Me: Exactly 10%. I know but how much is that in dollars? Like $500 or what? Does the office charge for anything that my insurance isn't covering?

Stupid lady: Where are you getting $500? I don't see anything that says 500...

Me: Omg, it was an example. Ok so let's say I had an appointment to get crowns today how much would YOU tell me I owe?

This is where my head split open and my soul left my body and has yet to return.

60,"I am a student and I have this one friend we will call Jay. Before I met him I've had a very promising life. I guess due to some bullying trauma I've became very insecure, aloof but never noticed it. Once I came to grips with some of those realizations that threw me in deep lows. So Jay is what I believe to be a toxic friend. Basically I believe he uses me for smoking pot. When I start getting in that ""yourself"" zone I start to notice how he starts questioning my actions. I am pretty sure I'm an introvert, but an introvert who really tries to form connections with people, get to know them and be himself - I'm putting the work on myself and fighting this hard battle. I have to say I find that very hard and smoking weed is of not much help to me because it makes me paranoid. Last night I was a witness to something weird I don't know how to describe. We got high and he starts scratching this paper that's glued to a shelf. I am certain I would have forgotten that whole thing and think of it as something funny, but that is just me being insecure, so I am thankful I wrote that down on my phone. That was something I think sinester, because when I asked what is he doing he told me nothing. While he was scratching that paper he was looking me straight in to the eyes. I came to the conclusion that he is secretly trying to make me doubt myself. 




Then I go out with some normal guys and notice how people like Jay and uncoutiously me just contribute to me living a life wondering is this what life is and just total lack of motivation and confidence. Since it came to this, am I really stuck? -I wonder. Hope, I just need a ray of that. The idea that my attitude got me pretty much walking solo. Well in all honesty, the hard times make a true friend afraid to ask. So I tell myself. It's the real friends that make you feel good. Not the opposite making you doubt yourself and make you feel that way. What's worrying me is that it makes me believe I'm that way, it is like my man Jay, my good friend Jay is making me just feel like I deserve it. It's a bad feeling.




What in the world happened to me. If I had stuck with good friends, which I was a part of growing up, today it would have been a different story. I remember always being the silent one but speaking what I meant. Cant remember when I had things like that all under control. Now when I hit the streets I always remind myself I'm worth of love and that I am confident that often I have to readjust my body language to stick to the ""zone"". If I were to get control over my life I really have to focus on me rather than any emotional gabbage that may be lurking and keep it under control till I am that consiring and confident person I aspire to become. This was on my mind for a few days now. Thank you for reading.



Tl;dr Have this guy we will call Jay who is not a true friend. It's like I see a person I want to be and this one toxic friend is making a negative impact on my life. I remember how it used to be and it's sad to think that things did not need to turn out this way for me, all things considered. Jay was not supposed to be a part of my life. I want to be fully myself, but at the same time, happy. Like truly happy.",06Oct2018,1

62,"""I find the typical approach to romance so.... weird. Like. Why aren't people open with their partners? Why don't they just have calm civil discussions about problems as soon as they arise? Why can't people realize that the other person is a person just like you? A person who has difficulties and insecurities and failings just like you, because they too are a human being, and human beings are beautifully flawed. 

I remember seeing someone say that ""romance ruined love"", and I think that's true. Yes, romance is good in a relationship. Take them to places that are beautiful because you want to see the wonder in their eyes. Make or get them something that will make them feel touched and cared about. Do something for them that makes them feel appreciated.
But the obsession with romance has ruined love. In media of all kinds, relationships are, well... romanticized. So people end up with a false idea of what love is. Yes they are intense and passionate and even heavily romantic for the first little while, but that's just infatuation and then limerance (might be misspelling that). That shit wears off. That shit is just in place to set up a foundation, to get you close. Love is supposed to hold you together after that. And love... isn't romantic.

Love is hard. Love takes work. Love is boring. Love is every day. Love is comfort and routine. If you feel like a ""spark"" is gone and that's why you think your relationship is failing... then you don't understand love. Love is just wanting to spend time with the other person. Being happier for having them in your life. Love is having something happen in your life, or hearing about something, and being excited to tell your partner all about it. Love is enjoying doing the simple everyday things with your partner. Love is finding comfort in their presence. Love is not being able to imagine your life without them in it. 

Love is also boundaries. Being able to say no. To disagree. To have differences. 
Love is about two people sharing their own unique lives with each other. Not two halves becoming a whole. 

Love is also laughter and jokes. Including teasing your partner. Taking jokes from your partner. 
But also knowing what shouldn't be joked about, what limits are needed with the teasing.

Love is not all consuming. You need to be able to have friends. Your social supports should extend beyond your significant other. No one person can help you with everything. So you find support for certain things with certain people. Sometimes with multiple people. Humans are social creatures. We thrive from social groups. One person can't possibly be everything for us.

Humans are beautifully flawed. Falling in love means loving your partner's flaws. Because after all; you like a person for their qualities, but you love them for their flaws.﻿""",06Oct2018,1
63,"Long***I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls (only 2 of them are in this , a blonde girl and a brunette girl) were there for a few hours in the night at the end before closing time the blonde girl walked up stairs with some other girl to the toilet she kept looking back at me down the stairs and laughing a bit with hand to mouth . but couldn’t make it out fully. later I walked around the corner towards by where they were sitting one of them (that same blonde girl) was looking at me and like politely smiled a little (not a full smile just like a tighten lips hard to explain) and she didn’t look away and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say whisper to her friend the brunette girl 'that lads just been staring at me'. another while later I was cleaning a table (they were the last customers left in there it was late before closing) and the brunette girl asked over at me ‘excuse me’ twice then I looked and then she asked ‘how do yer get a job in here?’ I answered and walked towards her because she asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) I said yes and she was saying they don’t know her that well and then said ‘yea she’s not weird’ as she was talking with the blonde girl too but the blonde girl was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit...yer know.’ and then looked at me after she sipped her drink with a straw then grew a smile and said 'she likes you' and they all burst out laughing I just walked away (she meant the girl at work who said was weird likes me but she doesn’ she was just joking) then I then went back to finish cleaning the table and then the same brunette girl asked ‘excuse me’ I looked and she looked a bit tipsy and nervous as she asked pointing at me 'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she said 'have you got a girlfriend?' Relaxingly, ignored her and their was a pause then the blonde girl then said 'aww leave him alone...he’s dead cute' while looking over at me smiling (idk if she said it like puppy dog cute is that bad?) and then said “he probably has” (probably has a gf) the brunette then looked at me a bot and asked me it again saying ‘have er have you got a gf’ nicely and I blanked her and then the blonde girl said laughed a bit and said ‘ aww leave him alone now hes fumin” . On their way out by the door when I was cleaning other tables the brown girl looked a bit drunk and the blonde girl who seemed normal said ‘byyeee’ smiling politely idk they looked like pleasant well spoken girls not loud drunk girls",06Oct2018,1
