0,"Hello,

I’m currently studying a 3 year film course at university (UK) and am 2/3rds through it, however since the start of the 2nd year I’ve lost all interesting in wanting to follow this career path, I still find some of the aspects of filmmaking and theory interesting but I can’t see myself using this degree for anything career wise- the thought of even trying to get a job in this industry doesn’t interest me at all. 

At the start I was very adamant to get a job in the industry and pursue a career in filmmaking but this has changed whilst studying it, it could be the course, it could be me, I don’t know! 

I’m going to finish the course because I don’t quit once I’ve gave so much time and effort to something, and besides I really enjoy university life. 

My main interests lie in tech development, computers, hardware etc, I’m a very tech savvy person and really enjoy it. If you offered me a job at Apple/google/Tesla or any of the big tech companies I’d take it straight away-But I feel like I’m never gonna be able to get into that sort of thing as my degree won’t be in that sort of sector/industry. (I acknowledge those companies are very hard to get a job at anyway but I used them as the ideal job). 

So what’s next ? What steps can I take to ensure that I’m not left with a degree which is “worthless” to me, cause part of me really feels like it’ll be a dead end trying to get into the tech industry without a degree suitable to those jobs.
Any advice/discussion/real life experience is appreciated!

Thanks!",21Apr2018,2
1,"I work in a small bookstore. Today was pretty slow, no customers in the store, until a group of kids came in. Probably about 7th grade. All clearly from fairly upper class conservative families, boys looking like miniature frat guys and girls well groomed with clothes that were clearly expensive but not super fashion-forward. Not the usual crowd for an independent bookstore but we’re in a pretty rich suburb and school is out today so it’s not that strange.

The apparent leader of the pack asked me to show him to the horror section because he needed to read a book (any book) for school and wanted something more attuned to the taste of 13 year boys than whatever his parents gave him. I took him to the Fantasy/SF/Horror shelf on the other side of the store and left him there. While his friends were gawking over all the bloody pulp they weren’t allowed to read at home one of them broke off from the group. Short kid, and clearly so nervous he was nearly doubled over. Looking straight at the ground with his head retracted into his shoulders like a turtle. He came up to the desk and started whispering. I couldn’t understand him at first so he repeated that he’d like to know “if y’all have any books about coming out”. Being in such a conservative area, although our clientele does skew a bit left, we don’t have much in the way of a queer lit section, though I pointed out some relevant memoirs and offered to special order something more specific. He declined, I wished him good luck and he left when his friends came back.

It wasn’t until afterwards that I realized why he approached me. I’m a straight man, but for the last couple years I’ve painted my nails regularly. I’ve always dressed pretty idiosyncratically and I move in artsier social circles so it’s never seemed like a terribly strange thing to me. Plus, ironically, girls tend to like it. I take it off when I go out into the country (I live in the Deep South), but other than that I usually don’t even think about it. But to realize that this kid still figuring out his sexuality and place in the world presumably saw me living comfortably and openly as an apparently queer man in the Deep South and felt comfortable enough to ask me for help with something that’s obviously weighing on him a lot makes me feel really proud, gives me a sense of social, almost paternal, responsibility I’ve never felt before. I feel a little guilty for being proud given what a rough time this kid must be having though, especially since I’m not actually gay. I really really hope he’s okay.",21Apr2018,8
2,"I feel like such an idiot writing this but I have to, otherwise I'll lose my mind. I may have already done so for all I know anyway.

Two years ago, I met someone at work, and started falling for him during the time we worked together. I never told him how I felt before he left unexpectedly. Why? Well, I'm a self-conscious, over-thinking idiot. So I lost all contact. This summer is going to be two years since I last saw him, but the memory of our chats during the shifts is as alive as ever. Every day since that time I've missed him more than I can bear.

Once I realised he won't be coming back to work, I fell apart emotionally. A lot of stuff had gone wrong in that year, but this was the final nail in the coffin. I fell into a deep depression that I've just barely crawled out of recently. I've been trying to get my shit together, nurture hobbies, make money, start a career, get in shape, stay in contact with my friends ... but my mind keeps wandering back to him every day, all the time.

I keep worrying if he's OK, asking the sky how he's doing, hoping I'll bump into him one day. Apart from that one hope I'm empty. Nothing I do helps. Can't forget him. My heart won't let me. There's only so many times that I can talk to my mom about this. There's nothing new to say, no new revelation for me to come to, no fresh perspective to view the events from. I'm struggling not to burst into tears throughout my days, and whenever my friends bring up their wonderful new relationships I want to scream.

I spend hours every night awake, imagining what it would be like if he was next to me, hugging me to sleep. I just want to hear his voice again. He was the loveliest. This agony is impossible to live with, and yet the pain has become the majority part of who I am. Feels like I lost something irreplaceable. He felt like home. But I had to go and mess it all up. I can't forgive myself for it. Fool! FOOL!

Maybe I'm sounding like an obsessed lunatic, and perhaps that's exactly what I've become. Instead of going to sleep at a reasonable time, I just spent an hour and a half sifting through old Instagram posts so I'd find pictures from the place we worked at, hoping one of them captured him by accident. I don't even have a fucking picture of him to cry over. Well ... I may have found one of his back tonight. I guess my efforts haven't been a complete waste of time after all. And guess what? I'm bawling my eyes out.",21Apr2018,1

I got a call from a place that I would really like to work at and they said they would send me the information regarding the interview over email.

4,"At first I was just delighted that somebody paid attention to me. I had never been in a relationship before and my only thought was ""cute guy = not running = must be wuv"".

This wasn't his fault. In hindsight, I'm not sure he knew much better. It was his first serious relationship as well, and I'm sure the infatuation I showed him wasn't easy to handle...especially coming off a break up and having not even touched a woman six months prior.

I wasn't obsessed at first...I honestly went out of my way to act detached even as my mind was telling me different. I didn't want to be one of those stereotypical virgins who latches onto the guy immediately after having sex, so I overcompensated and acted as if his entire existence was ""meh"".

I did this for a long time.

I didn't genuinely feel this way, but that was proper behavior for someone who had recently been deflowered. Noncholant and dismissive. But that also means that I allowed a lot of behaviors in the early stages of the relationship that I was extremely uncomfortable with, and ignored an excessive amount of red flags.

I had plenty of my own, sure.

But this half of the story is about why I had to leave him. This half is about my side.

The first red flag for me came about a month into the relationship. He was out with a group of friends playing some sort of game, and they all started insulting him and berating him. At the time, it didn't occur to me why he would be hanging out with these people. Why he wouldn't set limits in his own life for healthy relationships and stable, encouraging friends. I look back on it now and think ""holy hell"", that should have been the neon sign that down the road his friendships would become one of the biggest reasons why I had to leave for my own health.

Several minor red flags crept in almost immediately afterwards. One was that he had no sleeping schedule whatsoever. Sometimes he'd pass out at 6 p.m. and wake up at 2, sometimes he'd be up until 4, sometimes he'd be asleep during the day and on the prowl all night. It was never my place to tell him how to sleep, but it messed up my own job performance and mental stamina to have to coordinate our interactions around the times he was actually awake. Sure enough, two years down the line I was missing whole nights of sleep trying to stay up with him and almost wrecking after dragging myself in to work at 7.

A tie-in: He was very reckless and just generally irresponsible. At the start he had no idea about paying bills and spent all his time partying. Again it wasn't my place to tell him how to spend his weekends, but the excessive drunkenness, drug use, and wild lifestyle conflicted with my needs to have somebody understand what it was to have a job to go to the next morning, to depend on your paycheck just to eat, to not know where you'd be sleeping that night, to not have enough money after bills to even throw a party. He and every single one of his friends were 110% on mommy's dime and still are. They were so wild and carefree the word responsibility was a foreign language to them. I couldn't keep up. I had shit to take care of, and his cluelessness of that concept only got worse as time went on. 

He didn't seem to devote the amount of energy to the relationship that I did. We lived two hours away and I was always the one driving to see him, even at the expense of my early morning shifts, a sputtery beater car, and cutting my paycheck down after multiple days off. I was the one primarily getting him gifts, I was the one primarily rushing to hand hold him after a bad trip or a bad hangover or a rager with yet more ""friends"" who ended up backstabbing him, I was the one dragging myself out of bed and wandering through all of downtown so I could be there for him during a panic attack which cost me a broken window, I was the one who seemed devoted to giving him all of my energy while he kind of basked.

He'd be sad over a minor annoyance and I'd speed over to briefly hold him before going all the way back downtown. We always talked about what he wanted to talk about, we always wrote what he wanted to write, watched what he wanted to watch. I always split the check with him even when it put me into overdraft. I always spent extra on cooking gluten free, dairy free, and vegan even when it meant going without a meal myself. More than once I picked up the entire tab for the restaurant, but since I could only afford one meal, just sat quietly while he ate. I dressed to the nines in clothes far too expensive for my bracket and he wore sweatpants. I shaved my entire body and he shaved nothing. I slathered myself in lotions and he, frankly, stunk. I went down on him like my life depended on it and yet went without sex for a year because he was uncomfortable with intimacy. I cleaned up piles of skin flakes, wiped up blood and crap, and spent half an hour freezing naked in the bathroom applying his Vaseline. I dealt with dirty condescending looks from his family, stomached their beet and sour cream concoctions, and watched their cheesy Lifetime movies. I dealt with all the questions, the prodding, and the passive aggressive digs. He wouldn't have done that for me.

I let him leave the bed whenever he was scared. Yet, he forcibly restrained me when I tried to leave.

I bit my tongue so many times even when his behavior was hurtful. He would go out partying and I'd sit at home. His plans excluded me. He scrapped a date night to play DnD, then barred me from coming. If we did have plans and another proposition came up, it was ""oh, sorry!"" He went with others to see movies I'd been dying to watch with him. He drove 40 minutes to act as a moral support cushion for someone he barely knew, got up at 5 am to take a friend to the airport, treated another friend to a gaming night he knew I'd asked to go to and then *lied* about it, yet would always brush off my desire to see him as ""well, when I can get to it"". He smeared me to his ""friends"" and they smeared me back. He hid me from everyone. Women who hit him up, both recently and in the past, still have no clue I was ever in existence. I begged him to be proud of me. I begged him to protect me. He let people say horrible things about me, never caring how it made me feel. He ragged on his ex and how much everyone hated her, too.

It began to dawn on me that his ex wasn't just some horrific demonic monster of a person. His friends were just abusive to her with his permission for no reason. So what if she was dumb? She was 17. She took an insane amount of mistreatment and then I somehow believed his narrative that it was her fault she bailed after three months.

I just wanted to know that somebody was willing to put forth the same amount of energy into the relationship that I was. Maybe even somebody who would recognize when I needed a break, somebody who would help me in times of struggle just like I helped him, even when he didn't need it.

I'm exhausted. I spent so many nights crying. I spent so many nights berating myself because maybe I just wasn't good enough and maybe if I just did this better than he would love me and maybe I deserved this treatment. So many people expressed concerns and told me that I seemed unhappier and more despondent but I just told them that I was being ungrateful. After all he said he loved me so that was enough!!

Slowly I started to confide that I was unhappy. Slowly I started to ask if my reasons for wanting to leave were valid. People were telling me that I didn't need a list. If I wanted to break up then that was all the justification I needed. But that wasn't good enough! I didn't want to be the bitch who just ended things because I was too lazy to work on them. After all, *he* was trying!!

I could do it. I could be the 0.0001% who makes their very first relationship ever their last. I could have the fairy tale love story, I could.

Then something clicked. He was around extremely toxic and abusive couples and would mimic their behavior in his interactions with me. I expressed discomfort and he lied and said he'd limit them. I caught him hitting them up like nothing had ever happened, and that was when my brain snapped into gear.

Each one of these couples were severely unhappy with each other. His own parents were severely unhappy with each other. But they stayed. Because pride.

I would be different. I would break the cycle. I could be stronger. I was stronger.

I walked out that day. I bawled in the car, trembling violently. It felt like I had made a horrible mistake. Like...I shouldn't have run from the relationship causing me pain. And I didn't even have any ties to him like finances or children or a house. This, my friends, is how women end up stuck in abusive relationships for years never attempting to leave. They think it's their fault.

I thought it was my fault. 

I wasn't perfect. There are numerous things I could have done differently, as well as two sides to everything. 

Ultimately I don't have the energy to quibble technicalities. 

This is the story of how I overcame. Raw and unadulterated. And I'm proud that I broke every chain. My parents', his parents', his friends', every individual out there who's stuck.

I did it for you.

And I will go on in your place.",21Apr2018,3
5,"I’m sorry if i this sounds boastful, but I don’t have much people to tell about this, and my mind is spinning.

I’ve always wrote short stories, because my imagination would weave tales I just had to document. I never really got any far with any of them, all of them either being turned down by the community of authors I shared it with or just being straight ripped apart. Until I wrote one story on a whim. This story as inspired from a horror story called Dear Abby, and it was titled Dear Girl. I didn’t put much effort into it, just being the letter of a dying man. But when I posted it, it got praise. It didn’t hit the tops of charts or anything, but people seemed to like it, and just this one time, the favorites outranked the thumbs downs. I was elated. I wrote this story three years ago. I kept writing after that, making a few others that people seemed to like, but never as much as Dear Girl. So there was a little competition at my school, a thing where they would take ten short stories written by students and publish them in a book. I rewrote Dear Girl, wanting to share that story again. I never thought it would get far, but I received a letter today telling me it got accepted and would be published. I am utterly elated, I also a copy of the first page of my story, and I hung it up. I now see the words Dear Girl, in a page soon to be in a published book, making me a somewhat published author. I somehow got picked from about a hundred kids with my three year old short story. I can’t even wrap my head around it right now. It all feels so surreal. 

I thought that story would collect dust, a memory, but  it’s the first story to actually be featured in a book. I am now a seventeen year old published author. For the first time in forever, my grandma is walking around bragging about she has a published author in the house, and says she’s really proud of me. I am so happy, I’m sorry for going on like this, but I never thought I would get this far. Even if it’s rather minuscule, I’m still proud, and even if I do make a good book later, I will still look back and smile. 

Thank you for listening.",21Apr2018,4

# Why I don't have a phone

I dropped my phone about three years ago and the screen broke. I used it in that state for a few months (with a USB trackpad attached on top, because the touch digitizer wasn't working at all), and then finally got around to trying to replace the screen. The replacement (which I had ordered almost immediately when the original broke, and was now out of the return period) was DOA. At this point, it was difficult to find a replacement screen again, because the phone model was getting old, but I wasn't ready to upgrade to a new phone yet. So I just decided to go without a phone for a little bit and decide what to do. I found I didn't actually miss it much (because I also had and still have a Wi-Fi-only Android tablet that fits in my pocket), so I let my phone plan (pay-as-you-go) end.

That was about two and a half years ago. Since then, I've had not very much desire to have a phone again. It would be nice to be able to communicate with friends more conveniently, but it's not a huge problem because my friends and I often hang out at one well-defined location, so I can just go there at any time of day or night and there's often someone there. (Also, I have Internet access there.) It's also nice to have some times during the day (usually while riding the bus/train) when I can't go online, so that I have a defined time to read the newspaper or a book, because I'd never do that otherwise.

I would be willing to have a phone again, if I saw a large benefit to it. Earning money could be such a benefit, especially if having a phone would enable me to earn enough money to pay for the phone and phone service. But I'd like to not have to get a phone first and then hope to earn money; I'd rather be able to earn the extra money first and then, if I find success in that, get a phone.

# The problem I've encountered being phoneless

But there's one huge problem, for me, with not having a phone: Some websites and online services (including ones that let you earn money!) require you to have a phone! You can't participate if you don't have one! Some examples I've found recently:

* Google. You must have a phone to establish a Google account, even though you are not required to use your phone in any way after creating the account. (You can use it for a second factor of authentication, but that's optional; you can alternatively use TOTP (e.g. Google Authenticator) with an offline device such as my tablet.) Google allows you to create five (IIRC) accounts with one phone number, and has built features to enable easy switching between your accounts, so it's not like they want to prevent people from having multiple accounts. I haven't signed up for a new Google Account since I ceased to have a phone.
* Freelancer (whatever kind of freelance work you want to do). You need a phone to activate (IIRC) your account. This one is a little bit justified, in that clients may want to be able to phone you to discuss work. Indeed, they display your phone number to all clients (potential clients, too, I think), and you can't opt out of that. But it would work just as well to not require every freelancer to have a phone, and then they just wouldn't get as much work as ones who do provide a phone number (which is fair). I didn't sign up.
* Kaggle (data science &amp; machine learning competition platform). You need a phone to activate your account and be able to participate in competitions. One-account-per-person verification is the only thing they use your phone number for. I was able to sign up using a landline, but it was extra hassle.
* MowSnowPros (basically Uber for yard work). You need a phone number to sign up as a yard worker. I don't know if it is then used for clients to contact you, but I don't think so, because arranging work and giving feedback seems to be done entirely through their app. I didn't sign up.

(Using phone numbers to enforce a one-account-per-person policy also brings up other issues, stemming from the fact that phone numbers are not bound 1:1 to individual people for life. Maybe you change your phone number, and someone else gets your old one. Then that person is forever banned from joining websites and services that use phone verification that you've already joined (at least without contacting each company and explaining the situation, which not everybody will be willing to do). Conversely, one person can easily get multiple phone numbers at the same time, and probably a majority of people already do have multiple phone numbers at any given time.)

# Let's share our problems and solutions

**Let's make a list of the ways not having a phone makes life difficult.** [I've started a collaborative list of companies/websites/services that require a phone number when it doesn't seem really needed](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tgCwry0kyAM4KXF8d7bzjkBk1hr1cYJBKbfmIH0Ryaw/edit?usp=sharing); let's expand that list and encourage those companies to change their policies.

Then we can try to find and share solutions to all of these problems, and make phoneless life easier to live.",21Apr2018,2

13,"So I have been quite depressed for a while. This was due to some shitty people at my job. There is a lot of office politics, backbiting and manipulation at my job. Over the last year and a half this has caused me a lot of pain. Over the last month I have developed  depression.   Long story short my company rented me out to another company. I told my own company what was happening and after trying to convince me to stay they told me that we can leave.

I was quite hopefull for yesterday. A guy (lets call him L)from my company was coming to tell this renter company that I am unhappy and I want to leave. After a long long time my torture was going to end and I was gonna be free of all of this backbiting. They met my boss who was one of the assholes. My boss was very nice to the person and gave a positive review about me.
 
After him , I had the meeting with L. However I was beyond pissed after that. It seemed like that L was keen on insisting that the whole thing was somehow my lack of understanding.

Here is how everything went.

L: That guy was really nice and professional. From what I heard from their story it seems that he just made a professional comment about you and you took it real personal.

Me: It did not happen only one time. It happened many many times. He was constantly talking about me behind my back. I heard him. Trying to make me look bad.

L: But that was just a professional comment. It happens all the time.

Me: He was very mean to me. He has done other mean things. one of those things is saying that my country is a supporter of ""is"" (This is because I come from an islamic country). 

L: At this point you have mentioned this three times already. Have you ever told him how you felt ? I also joke a lot of things about my girlfriends country. 

Me: But he was not joking. I did not like it.

L: Did you talk to him? why dont you talk to him ? 

Me: What should i say to him? I do not know what to say in these situations.

L: Maybe its a cultural thing. We are more direct about our feedback.

Me: If that is the case then why dont I have any problems with any other person in the team.

L: *Visibly upset* There is no problem! There is no issue! It is just professional remarks on your work.

Me: Yes but that was not the only case. And it was not about professional remarks. They were personal remarks.

L: next time you have something like that with someone then just ask them for a meeting and discuss that with them.

At this point I realized that we were not going anywhere with this. I told him ok and left back for my work. 

When I came home at night however, my feelings of sadness had changed to extreme anger and irritation. It feels like my head is on fire. 

So my question is how should I proceed with this because this is driving me crazy? I was thinking about writing an e-mail and telling L to setup a meeting to discuss about it. I would say that it left me quite uncomfortable the way he dismissed everything. What do you think?

I have been depressed about it as long as I can think, I have lost everything because of it and no one, no one takes it in the serious manner that it deserves. reading about it on reddit, one the various subs like /r/smalldickproblems /r/short or /r/tressless, I thought I were able to find people who could emphasize with me but it turns out, it made it actually worse. now, I can‘t think straight anymore, can‘t think of the last time I did not think hours a day about my flaws. and here I am now I am am about to end it all. all the cope, all the good feel talk, it really is of no significance to me, it does not change the issue, it does not make me feel better about it. I wouldn‘t say that i feel like a subhuman but I certainly feel undateable. and I am. and if anyone would ever want me it‘s because they themselves have run out of options.
so fuck this",21Apr2018,3
22,"If you open your browser's console right now (on chrome press F12 then click the Console tab) you'll see a ascii picture or the reddit logo. Kind of cute.

Well this logo is printed to the console every time you load any reddit page. I estimate that it takes about 100 microseconds to print the whole thing to console based on tests on my laptop. My personal reddit usage means I load something like 100 reddit.com pages on an average day based on my last couple of weeks worth of browser history. I think I'm quite a heavy user though so I'll estimate that the average user loads 10 pages per day. Reddit gets around 50 million unique users per day, so assuming each of them is an ""average"" user that means that the reddit logo is printed to someone's browser console 50m\*10 = 500 million timers per day. At 100 microseconds per print, that's about 14 hours of combined CPU time per day. Mobile CPUs consume around 5-10 watts and the fastest consumer desktop CPUs consume around 95 watts. However common CPUs in laptops consume around 35 watts so that seems like a nice average to take. 35 watts over 14 hours is 1.7 megajoules of energy. Over an entire year it works out at **0.6 Gigajoules**.

So reddit admins are directly responsible for 0.6 GJ of wasted energy per year, for the sake of an ascii image that nobody ever looks at.

Just a thought.",21Apr2018,5
23,"I don't know who I am. I consider myself as a  multipotentialite but I'm not really sure because I've never taken any tests.
I have a BA in Japanese language. But I cant speak Japanese fluently like people who has this BA degree are supposed to. So I kinda throw Japanese away...(But I've been re-studying Japanese language in Japanese language school in Japan for 6 months right now, which I consider the wasted 6-month time in my life. I'm going back to my country in this April but I will be lost because I dont know what to do after that. I'm 26 but still dont have career like everyone else.)

 I'm interested in Film industry. After graduated 3 years ago, I've once worked as a tv drama script writer for 1 year and a half, liked it, but got fired because the company needed only best people and I was not one of those people. My weak point was writing emotional scenes, still is.  I'm also interested in video editing. I'm currently teaching myself on After Effects program by watching YouTube videos. But I'm not really sure it's what I really want to do or it's just my defense mechanism ""not be able to be fluent in Japanese so I'll find something else"". Actually, I'm interested in CG drawings too.  Whenever I see beautiful CG drawings, I feel like I want to be able to do that. And whenever I see great edited videos, I feel like I want to be able to that too. The same goes with good scripted movies or series.  It's like my passion is up to my emotions at that very time and it keeps looping. I really want to have 10 hands and do everything at the same time, but it's impossible so I'm stuck. I cant figure out what I should  do. Everyone around me tells me to find what I like the most and go for it to become the best in that field. But...I dont know the answer of that question. So... I dont know who I am. What do you think I should do?

Thank you so much for taking time reading this. I'm actually really bad at expressing myself because most of the time I dont know what I feel.

But now since the temperatures climbed up I wake up in the morning and think about him, crying because I still love him and don't know why our love broke.

28,"I don't know how to get this started or how to put to words what I feel, but I shall try anyway.

I've stayed with my classmates in a 2BHK flat for 10 months, and I haven't really had an amazing time with them. Before I go into the specifics of my stay with them, let me give you a little bit of background. I'm 21, two and three years older than my two roommates. One hails from a second tier town \(as do I\) while the other comes from a village. They both have different worldviews from me, and I don't really enjoy spending time with them. While I understand that nobody ever enjoys spending time with their housemates, I find conversations with them super draining. They're mild anxiety inducers. I'm a mild neat\-freak and a very organized person; they are anything but. They're also behind the curve in things that I really care about.

They also have absolutely no regard for my time. They force me into hanging out with them despite my telling them that I have tonnes of work to do.

They offer nothing to the table. They borrow my scooter, chair and table, among other things and I don't really like sharing my stuff, especially those I use daily. I can't set boundaries with them, as they clearly don't get the concept of boundaries. Plus, they're some of the most irresponsible persons I've ever known. You can find clothes lying around everywhere in the house and, unless I point it out, the clothes won't go anywhere until they do their monthly laundry \(using my detergent, mind you\).

Talking about detergents reminds me of the things they never buy but use anyway. They eat my fruits without ever asking me \(and I follow a fruitarian diet of sorts\) and never replace them. They use my cutlery \(no boundaries, let me remind you\), toothpaste, mosquito repellent and clothes conditioner, among other things.

Also, the fact that I also share my classroom space with them means I see them all the time. It gets to me sometimes, as they often want to speak about class stuff \(gossips, usually\) with me. Even when I clearly no show interest, they still continue to talk anyway.

Plus, I pay the electric bill, internet bill, rent and other things; they sometimes don't send in the money to my account on time, and it makes me irate when they do that. Plus, if a tap doesn't work, the bathrooms are unclean, internet doesn't work, or the fan stops working, I must call plumbers, electricians and scavengers to get things sorted; they never do that. 

Sadly, we don't communicate like adults, and that only results in my resentment growing in leaps and bounds.

**That said, I think I need to be with them as well.**

Here are five reasons why I think I need to be with them.

1. I'm not a very social person. About 70 percent of the friends I've made in the recent times were friends with them initially.
2. They're my classmates, and it makes doing assignments pretty easy and efficient. Also, they help me wake up in time for the class, as my circadian rhythm is effed up.
3. I don't want loneliness to exacerbate underlying mental or personality disorders and addictions. My family members do seem to have a few bit of undiagnosed mental or personality disorders, and I think having conversations with them \(even if I don't particularly enjoy those poor quality conversations\) is at least marginally important.
4. Living alone can be expensive. I'll have to pay thrice as much as I've done the last 10 months.
5. I wake up sad on most days. Hearing them talk loudly in the other room helps me forget the things that make me sad.

For some reason, getting them all down on paper along with my plans to achieve them made me feel incredible empowered.  I split them into financial, personal, and professional goals.  Some excerpts:

- Have no debt
- Run a half marathon (I'm signed up for one this October!)
- Publish a book
- Have $10k in checking and $5k in savings
- Join the 1000lb club
- Release The Cartographer, my multimedia project
- Pay off my dad's house so he can retire
- Get a tattoo

31,"I'm 24. I've just never had to bake anything. But I just bought a giant box of mozzarella sticks from costco so...



I also bought a cookie sheet. And then I bought parchment paper cause when I was googling about cookie sheets, parchment paper came up as a related search. And then I looked up how/why parchment paper doesnt catch fire in the over (the answer is cause it won't ignite until over 450 degrees and in my head I was like ""oh duh I read the book fahrenheit 451 im an idiot"")


Anyway, the mozzarella sticks are baking now and I just realized I dont have an oven mitt so I'll stop them 1 minute short and just leave the oven open until it cools down to where I can pull them out.

33,"I literally argue all the time, I say things to piss people off I tell them things I know that's get them mad. When theyre talking I correct their grammar in person. When someone is doing something, I tell them they're doing it wrong and explain in every little detail to piss them off.  I do it all not to start fights or debates but to amuse myself. I even argue on the internet like YouTube and reddits. I always win, I will argue like a troll either throwing logic in their face or just say some stupid mean shit. I can argue all day and a couple days. When I post a comment knowing what I'm going to say will piss them off and I know I'm getting a reply, so I wait eagerly doing something and when I get that notification they replied I get really excited.

34,"yeah. im not very good at making rational decisions, planning for the long term, or even making goals that I will stick to. I turn 20 this fall and for the past two years I half-committed myself to community college classes and worked some low end jobs, with the intent that i would be able to start a business with all the free time I had, and looking back my effort and persistence was pretty lackluster. 

I had so much goddamn free time and what did I do with it? nothing. I consistently sacrificed the present moment for instant gratification and found myself unable and unwilling to hold back my temporary pleasure seeking urges. 

This has led to a meaningless life that desperately needs structure and purpose outside of short term pleasure. I just dont really know where to start. I dont really have friends or a good social life so Im thinking about going to university in the fall? I dont really care anymore and I just need something to do and people that I care about.

42,"I said to her that I wanted my own space tonight. Then when I was working I heard her knocking her head against the bannister, so I went downstairs and called an ambulance. But she calmed down and the ambulance was called off. I went back to my room.

After a while, she joined me in my room, curled up in front of the door. I turned up the music in my headphones to block her out. But she started hitting herself again. So I took my work to the kitchen table. I had to force her to the side to escape.

She followed me to the kitchen. And I said if she started hitting herself again I'd go upstairs and barricade the door. Instead she started telling me how much she hates herself. I refused to respond. After a while of not working, I threw an apple against the wall. Then I tidied up the mess I made and went up to my room and barricaded the door.

She banged against the door over and over, telling me she felt in danger. I told her to call an ambulance. After half an hour I caved. She lay on my floor and I watched TV.

She punched pillows for a bit. Then she asked me to section her. And then she started punching herself again. I told her to leave, I needed to sleep. She refused, do I took my duvet and am now on the sofa.

Last night I had to tape her hands behind her back and a pillow around her head. That's the only way she'd stop. When I call 111 or 999 she tells them she's fine, but she goes back to hurting herself again.

She has PTSD. She didn't choose this. She's been strong, so strong, but it's become so toxic. She's my best friend. She's been living with me for her safety, there are other people in the loop, welfare tutors, doctors, but no family. She's a runaway.
