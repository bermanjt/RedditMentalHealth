0,"I felt like creating a throwaway account for this but I thought better of it and to post it on my main account.
Basically there's this one manager who (despite his c***ish ways will remain nameless) and he's always condescending sarcastic and offensive towards me specifically and I feel target by him and it really  ruins my shift and mood for the day and really upsets me almost to a pint of crying. The main reason it nearly brings me to tears is cause of the ullying through high school wich I thought I had gone past when I left to go to college. But this manager is just always targeting me and when I find he's working with me I get uncomfortable and almost scared in a way to make mistakes and stuff. I also feel like if I reported him it would make this worse because he would have to be talked to about it and it makes me scared to report him. ",26Jul2018,1
1,"I was just walking out for a quick smoke when I glanced in your direction. And I saw  your boob.

I have no clue why it popped out (you were licking what looked like a pile of letters), but it did and then we locked eyes. I walked off, but it happened &amp; there was nothing I could do about it.

It looked nice, so please don't think that you have to cover all your windows or anything - just a random encounter.",26Jul2018,403
2,"I had a dream last night. A group of people came into my home and killed my family and my pets (dogs). I escaped with myself and one of my dogs. I made it to the end of the driveway where I was met with the street. I ran across it while my dog ran as fast as it could away from the scene and away from me. I ran down the sidewalk trying to deal with everything that had happened. I saw an oncoming bus heading down the street. Not able to deal with everything, I ran out in front of the bus, which made it hit it brakes and stopped itself from hitting me. I forced myself to wake up manually. I don’t know, it felt so real that I contemplated getting hit by a car. I felt real guilt when my dog ran away from me. All of it, it felt real. I know it’s a dream and all, but I had to stop and think about ending my life. What are my dreams trying to tell me? What can I do?",26Jul2018,1
3,"So, somehow we got onto the subject of dating; not something I’ve had success with over the years. She explained how she felt both she and my older brother had agreed they both felt that in the past they’d felt they needed to date multiple people to find the right person. I said something along the lines of “well, it’s all very well if you have those sorts of opportunities.” She then proceeded to call me out on the fact that I don’t go out of my way to meet people and can be very dismissive of people. I can’t say she’s wrong, but I don’t know, it just took me by surprise to hear her say it, I guess. Unfortunately, I think it’s part of my nature. I suggested that perhaps because I’m so critical and expect more of myself, I then project those expectations onto other people. Who knows? But somehow I’d felt like me being socially inept was a little joke I made of myself to make light of my less than extroverted personality, but maybe there’s more truth to it than I’d thought.",26Jul2018,1

Hey,

I don't know why I'm writing this text. I just... I'm emotional and I think this is a nice place to just talk sometimes. Maybe I could x-post this to Reddit so that the people there can just _know_. And this is different — funny different. My usual posts are always from the perspective of someone else looking in or just a ramble about how I feel from my perspective. But this is... like... writing to someone. This is also good literacy practice.

I still think about you. I haven't set my role to ""Moved On"" because I'm still ""Healing"". I'm still a bit bitter. I'm still in the angry phase. This phase has been the longest so far, I think.

You broke up with me over three months ago. What the fuck? I know right. I can't believe it either.

I know I'm still bitter and angry because now if someone asks me for details about our breakup or ask why I might _sometimes_ be visibly hostile to you, I will just say ""I broke up with her, then she begged for me back, I took her back, and then she broke up with me"". Which is kinda the truth. Kinda.

It's disgusting. I know. I don't care. Fuck you.

I know I need to work on myself quite a bit — I need to just not a give a fuck about you. Learn to effectively pretend you don't exist. I love that it drives you mad though. I get to tell people ""LOL MY EX KEPT MESSAGING ME EVERY OTHER WEEK AFTER I CUT CONTACT'

1 month, 3 weeks, and 2 days. I'm so proud of my progress. You should be too! You changed me a lot! I would always always always reply to messages and end conversations — I changed after meeting you. And you've left me in a different place.

I can't say if it was better but hey, lets be honest, you have improved me. Thx for that m8.

I'm crazy horny. I'm horny all the time. Well, not really. Guess what, my new flatmate and his girlfriend are basically bunnies. You know when you walk into the kitchen and there are shoes strewn off everywhere? They DEFINITELY fucked in the kitchen. Don't care, I remember when we did this. Wait, did we also fuck in your kitchen during Christmas — in your flat?

No! Not the one person flat you got evicted from! Your first year flat that you were sharing!!!

Haha, I'm not sorry for mentioning the fact you got evicted. And I'm not sorry for defending you in front of your landlord. You deserved to get evicted. You had no arguments! You broke the lease. That was all that needed to be said.

I'm hella lucky I never moved in with you in the end. Co-signing your lease was a good experience. Never again, though. Never again.

I thought about sex with you the other day. I was think about... well, our last time having sex. About how I asked if you were clean for me to go down on you (you know, like in case you were still spotting) and you said ""not as clean as you'd like to be"". And I went down on you. And then we fucked. I was thinking about how at the time I didn't think that would be the last time we ever had sex. I haven't had any sort of intimate touch in such a long time. It's... yeah I'm not happy with that. But whatever.

Lets talk about other women now!

I met this cool girl Frankie. She's so cool. So much smarter than you. So much more genuine as well. A genuinely awesome personality. She's in the year above and I'm kindaaaa falling for her. Yeah, I know, not good! But oh well, I'm attracted to her. Lets see where this goes, okay?

So, today all the interns went out for ice cream (yes... she's a colleague and she's also an intern like me). Well, it was like five of us. We all sat on a wall just in the shade next to the bush. Next to the forts, yeah.

So that five interns turned into four, then three. Then the three of us had a really nice conversation. Then it was just the two of us. And we just kept talking. I don't know how long it was but it felt liek an hour or more. It was 7:40pm. We finish work at 5pm. So I guess it must have been at least 1 hour!

In the end Frankie was like ""oook well my turn to go off home"". Some of the conversation got deep. She asked about my parents and what they do. No, I haven't told her my mum is dead yet. None of them know! I wonder... I should do some sort of experiment and see how the other interns react. I won't experiment on Frankie, just the others. Well, maybe I won't experiment at all. It's a bit weird.

Back where I was. Yeah, I didn't mention mon frere. I just mentioned my Dad and the conversation kind of diverted on from there. Pretty entertaining discussion and it's nice knowing you can still hold a discussion.

We were talking about our coursework and how it involved database relationships and how we had to implement an SQL ""like"" query. I was gonna say you know the LIKE queries, like ""exmoose likes frankie"". Then realised I didn't have the balls to do that.

Back to tinder... I guess? I'll see where this goes. Maybe she liked our long conversation too.

A cool dude gave me Tinder suggestions. Fuck you for saying that girls find superlikes a turn off.


Hmm, so what else is there to say? I finally replied to my cousin. Yeah the estranged one with the kid. Yeah I don't think she'll reply. It's unfortunate. I've missed out on two penpals. Tbh, they could just be busy. I don't know. So I've just finally sent another one to my first penpal. I hope she'll reply... I kinda miss her.

You know. I fell in love with my first penpal's words. Well it was just a crush. But that crush went away when I found out she had a boyfriend so that was fine. I just wanted to mention it to you.

Oh oh oh! That reminds me! I've also found another girl pretty amazing. Z's flatmate and best friend. She's a medic. She's fucking beautiful, she's so smart, and she has an amazing personality. But, of course, she's taken. And do you know how I found out? I asked her ""hey, are you single?"". She said no, she's not, but she wants boyfriends, in the sense just guys that are friends. She's mentioned on two separate occasions ""it's hard to have guy friends"" or something to that effect... she's just that good at attracting guys, I guess :P

But yeah, she might be so fucking amazing but I'll just be her friend.

With absolutely zero love,

Big D.

p.s. hey, you know, i should just ask Frankie if she is single, shouldn't i? what do you think?",26Jul2018,3
6,"Dear web developers,  

Don't take this the wrong way, but you seem to have been losing your collective minds over the last few years.  The internet does at least look a lot better than it did twenty years ago, I'll give you that.  But I have a few grievances with some of your latest ideas and trends.  

Nobody wants your shitty app.  If I were to tell you that you could spend your limited resources for an item which is effectively the same as another item which you already own except it only works in a very limited subset of use cases without actually improving on anything in the very few cases it was useful, you'd rightly tell me to fuck off.  This item you are trying to replace is the browser on our phones.  But only for your website.  No thanks, stop badgering me about it.  

I hear that, when used correctly, javascript can make a beautiful and functional website.  Unfortunately it has yet to be demonstrated.  Infinite scrolling, loading loops, ram leaking, etc.  If there is literally any other option, go with that. Please.  

I thought we left autoplaying video and sound in the same hole Myspace, Geocities, and Angelfire fell into.  News sites probably take the brunt of the blame for this one, but I'll be honest when I say that the only reason I bother with ad blockers at all is the shit with sound.  While we're on the topic, though, a popup to nag about blocking things like popups is really just proving the point.  And blocking the browser with adblocker? Come on, modify headers: is adblocker == false.  

A personal pet peeve of mine, Country does not equal language.  Major retailers and providers with several regional and country websites like apple and netflix are major offenders here.  If you have several languages available, don't tie them to location.  I live in Sweden, but am not comfortable making a major purchase online in Swedish.  My grasp of the language is not that good.  I know you have an English/French/German/etc site, why is this not available in my country?  

Lastly, the vast majority of mobile sites (with or without nagging over a useless app) are completely pointless.  Click on a link to the regular site, get redirected to the mobile homepage, can't get back to the article/page originally navigated to.  Stupid.  Not to mention, most mobile sites end up just being worse to use on a phone than the desktop version.  What a great idea: reducing functionality and increasing difficulty for people trying to use your site.  Yeah.  

I hope this wasn't too incoherent.  I know the internet has given people a lot to play with in terms of making things in new and interesting ways, but these trends have to stop.  At least until you learn to test before committing.  Best to have someone over the age of 40 and someone under the age of 13 play around with it and not just the people who made it.  

Sincerely,  
An internet user",26Jul2018,0

8,"Kinda weight post but here it goes.

It has been about 4 months since I have decided to join the marines. I’m that amount of time I have done so much to be eligible. My life in general feels like it has been going on the fast setting. Just right now I realized this.

Let’s starts with the most “shocking” thing. When I was little I used to be very obese. Not sure if anyone reading this can relate to this but, when I jumped, everything jiggled. When I ran, I was out of breath, every second I used to look forward to eating. Yet when I looked in the mirror I was disgusted. I have spent the years between 8th grade and 12th grade wanting to lose weight and struggling to keep it off. Now, well, it all happened so fast. 4 months ago I was “skinny fat” i remember how I still had “man boobs” and everything was bouncy. A few minutes ago I woke up from a nap and you know how when you’re asleep you do dumb shit? (Well I do.. I have some stories lmao) ok so I woke up touching my self (not like that 😐) I sleep without a shirt and like I was passing my hand over my chest and I remember how it was bouncy and shit but now it’s firm. Arms too, back etc. 

I guess what I’m sayin is, I spend so many years trying to lose weight and having setbacks so often but now I’m just 4 month Im in a better shape than I’ve ever been in. I never imagined I’d be here and to me it’s shocking how I transformed my body from being jiggly to having muscles left and right in such a small amount of time. 

Throughout all of this I have changed my name too. This is a huge accomplishment in 2 ways. I have had sever selective mutism and social anxiety for years and for me to go Into a count room and explain my reasons, go to every government building and request my files changed is freakin huge. I mean like throughout all of this I, 1. Got a mind of myself and went with it(changed my name against my parents wishes) 2. Talked to so many people 3. I was clueless on how and what to change but I went out of my way to figure out without someone holding my hand. I have always hated my birth name and I guess now I officially say, “I love my name” without being ashamed to tell people what it was when they asked. 

Here a big one too. I woke up and I was like “lol..” “you can do pull ups” “whaaaaat” lmao because it’s like a reality check. The last thing I needed to be eligible to join the marines is to be able to do pull ups. I started wanting to join by not even being able to pick up a 20lb dumbbell. I can do 15 pull ups now like wtf? That’s amazing. I’m terrified of what I’m going to go through in boot camp. I honestly am. Like I mentioned, I suffered from social anxiety and selective mutism and I’m going to be 100% out of my comfort zone. Sure I’m terrified but I’m also really excited. I have wanted this for so long and it’s finally within reach. It’s like being in that pitch black tunnel for decades and finally being able to see that light at the end of the tunnel. 

It’s all been happening so fast I haven’t really had time to process it all. I have achieved so much but I have a long way to go though and I intend on getting there. ",26Jul2018,1

11,"So, I live in Amsterdam and the driving test here is pretty hard but despite that, after 16 one hour lessons I am ready for the exam. However I have been waiting 5 weeks to get my code of good health, and that can take up to 3 more weeks and only when I get that I can schedule my exam which means that I will be put on a waiting list for that which can also take up to 3 more months. And if I fail that I have to wait 3 more months before I can retry. 

Honestly nothing sucks more than being able to drive perfectly well but not being allowed to.

12,"I went to the gynecologist today for the first time. I don't think she liked me because I was anxious and kept asking questions and I also declined to get an IUD even though she kept trying to convince me.

Before she did my pap smear, I told her about my terrible experience on the pill and part of it, to me, was that on the second week of each pill pack, I would get little breaks in my skin near my vagina which would sting in the shower or when I peed. After I stopped birth control, they pretty much went away.

She cut me off and told me in a very judgemental way, ""Yeah, that sounds like herpes. You better tell your partner cause you definitely already gave it to him."" She told me I need a blood test, which is my extreme fear in life. I've been working with a psychologist to get me to get my first blood test (I'm 22,) but I still break into panic attack at the thought. No doctor will prescribe me anything to calm my nerves for one. I told her I will do my best to bring myself to do blood work to figure it out.

I didn't really know what herpes looks like or what it actually is so I just started freaking out and immediately after my pap smear, I got dressed to interrogate my boyfriend. I've has two sexual partners. My current boyfriend, and my ex. My ex and I only ever had oral sex though and I have no recollection of him having mouth herpes or any cold sores. The pictures I saw on google looked nothing like anything I've ever seen, the symptoms don't sound like anything I've ever had really. I've never had pimples, just very faint raw spots. But I'm not a doctor, she clearly knows what she's talking about.

My current boyfriend was adamant that he got tested right at the start of our relationship and he is absolutely clean. We are still in the honeymoon phase of our relationship after 10 months and I am confident beyond belief that he did not cheat. 

I'm so confused and terrified. I just saw another thread somewhere that said traditional STD tests don't test for herpes. He's going to get tested tomorrow.

I'm so scared and confused. And to top it off, my mom is my ultimate rock but she's very conservative and I cannot confide in her about this. I'm really scared of the stigma.",26Jul2018,2
13,"I’ve just been thinking about how much organized sports has given to my kids. 

They played pretty much exclusively through school, with most of my kids being three, sometimes four, season athletes from 3rd grade through college. 

It was critical for them to feel like they were a part of something bigger than themselves, and in high school when they had to make some tough choices about how to spend their time and the friend groups they would associate with (especially as some middle school friends went one way and some went another) having sports to keep them on track was priceless. 

It made them feel like they were making the right decisions not because Mom and Dad told them they had to or because they weren’t cool and adventurous, but because they were athletes and they needed to take care of themselves and keep their grades up so they could achieve peak performance in the games. 

I’m especially grateful to a few of the really attentive coaches my kids had. When my son was on the crew team in high school his grades started to drop, my husband and I were working full time and raising five kids and no letters had come home yet, it was standard practice to check every rowers’ transcripts for signs of trouble every few weeks, and they talked to him right away and asked if everything was ok, and when it came out he was having some social struggles, encouraged him to talk to his dad about it and made themselves 100% available for him. 

From sophomore year onward they’d talk to the kids about the college admissions process, make sure they were on track to take the SATs. Obviously that was huge, but even the small things like the kids having to stay organized enough to get up for early practices and keep all their gear together really taught them a lot of skills that I didn’t have the opportunity to learn until much later in life. 

I’m so lucky my town had a great program, the  whole experience was invaluable. ",26Jul2018,1
14,"This summer, I worked as a maintenance person/janitor at my school, and I must say, the experience granted me with even more respect for the maintenance crew, and for good reason. They are really great people and are nice to talk to, except for my boss. Waking up at 5:30 every morning and working for nine hours a day really had an effect on me; it’s really impressive that the maintenance team can do this year-round. I always liked and respected the maintenance crew at my school, but working with them really opened up my eyes to just how much they do for the school, and how important people of the profession are in general. It sucks that a lot of people look down on maintenance people, as they work hard and help more than most people know. ",26Jul2018,1
15,"I fucking love working at this tavern as a waitress. It’s my 2nd job as a 17 y/o and the first one I genuinely enjoy

I’ve been so depressed and spent all my day in bed. I barely left the house, and was a lazy POS. 

I’ve been training for the past 2 days and I think I’ll start to take my first tables. I actually have somewhere to be everyday. I’m actually somewhat useful. I’m also working on communication. I made a friend today with one of the ladies that works there. She’s from Kyiv, just like me!

I get free meals at the end of the night, and I bring them home to my parents and we sit down and eat them. They’re so fucking proud of me, even if it’s only been 2 days this job has pulled me out of deep depression. I think when I got off I was genuinely happy driving home.

16,"So I always expected my 18th birthday would be hella fun but it was my first birthday since my dad and I moved to the ghetto and I kinda doubted he would do a lot of effort but it was worse than I expected.

So I woke up, and I was home alone for some reason so I went to flex in the livingroom. There were no decorations, no b-day card, no present.
Then my dad came home with my sister, he said he was gonna pick up a matress for my sister at Ikea and then they left again.

Once they came back I reminded my dad it was my birthday and that we should do something, so we went grocery shopping. Which I gotta say is more fun when it's your bday because you get to decide what you eat so I opted for making pizza with my dad and sister.
While we were there I decided to buy me a pack of cigs even though my dad bought me a fresh pack the day before but I just wanted to be able to flash my ID for once.

So then we went home, I had to light the candles to my own cake and cut it too, ate the thing while my dad and sister were just on their phone.

Later I asked my dad and sister if they wanted to make pizza, but my dad was going to get dinner at a restaurant with a friend, so me and my sister made some delicious pizza which was nice.

When she left I descided to meet 3 friends downtown, to go to a coffeeshop for them (I live in Amsterdam so coffeeshops sell 18+ goodies). I couldn't wait to show my ID in a coffeeshop for once, but they didn't ask for it, but that was to be expected since I went to most coffeeshops since I was 15 (it helps to be 203cm and tattood).

So I got the weed, but due to health circumstances I had to quit weed 4 months prior so no fun for me. Went back home and slept.

17,"My good friend who I have known for a long time works at geek squad as an ARA. 
I’m currently looking for a job and applied for a position at geek squad as a CA and also as an appliance agent. When I first mentioned this to him, he didn’t care or thought much of the appliance agent position, even kind of gloated that it was “just a job installing fridges and dishwashers”. 

Fast forward a month and I get a call today to set up an interview for the open position as an appliance agent, and my first thought after hanging up with the recruiter was to tell my friend all about it. 

How happy I was, I told him, and how cool it’s going to be going to people’s houses to install electronics and fix appliances and what not. I asked him again what he thought of it and he pretty much gave me the same “mehh, not my cup of tea” answer. 

Him, his girlfriend and I have a group chat and I mentioned how I was excited and looking forward to the interview and “I wonder what it’s going to be like. Just the thought of going to people’s houses and doing all that fun stuff sounds pretty cool” and his girlfriend goes “well why don’t you ask M. He did it today.”

Turns out he went to that department and rode along with one of the agents to a customer’s house to install a sound bar. 

Didn’t think to tell me, and clearly it was super relevant to my situation, and that’s when I began to start overthinking that I believe he tried to one up me for the position. I’m also considering that he submitted an application and since he has the connections already, I feel like my interview tomorrow is a lost cause, unless they’re looking for more than just one body and if I sell myself during the interview.

What irks me the most is that he didn’t mention this little trip today. So happens that he decides to take this trip on the day I tell him about my good news. He’s never gone with them, ever... 

I thought he wouldn’t stoop that low since he is a bit of a manipulative person, but honestly, I hope I’m wrong, and that it’s all in my head.

18,"My older brother has paranoid schizophrenia. His condition also comes with essentially a narcissistic personality disorder.

For starters, it’s been one of the saddest and most terrifying experiences of my life to see him transform. I always followed in his footsteps and he was such a great role model. Funny, smart, great athlete, truly amazing person. Now every time I see him I only feel like crying or punching a wall.

He dropped out of college his sophomore year and hasn’t left home since. He doesn’t believe he is sick, and he lacks executive function such as being able to balance a job, relationship, or money. This past week he gambled $300+ of money he earned away online. 

He lives in a detached garage we made into a nice apartment next to our house. He comes to our door begging for money for weed so that he can sleep. When he doesn’t get cash from us he finds other ways to get it from people.

His delusions revolve around essentially a subconscious belief that he’s still in high school. If you ask him he of course would say he isn’t still a high schooler, but he doesn’t think he needs a job, he tries to date girls who are way too young for him, and  tries to hang out with kids my age.

His narcissism stems from his success in high school (in my opinion). He believes he is entitled and has a massive amount of grandiosity. Because of this he is incredibly rude and is horrible to everyone including his own family. We have tried to get him on meds many times, but we cannot force him to without claiming guardianship (which means we are liable if he were to do something horrible), and if we were to send him to an asylum he’d live the rest of his days hopelessly watching his life pass by without any sense of emotion. My parents haven’t kicked him out yet because he does not have executive function, and simply can’t live on his own. It would be like forcing paralyzed man to run a race. 

I’ve had to nearly cut off all interaction with him. When I get home I have to walk quickly to the door and lock it behind me while feeling very anxious because my own brother wants to speak to me, when I know that he is just trying to ‘get on my side’ to convince me my parents are drug addicts (one of his delusions), or to beg me for money. It’s gotten to the point where seeing him ruins my fucking day. I used to love this person.

There are many times that he is simply very rude to people for no reason, because he feels so entitled. But he is unable to tell that he was rude to them. When my parents are in public with him and notice that he may have acted this way, they will try to apologize to the person he may have been rude to, and explain that he is mentally ill, and they scoff or get in their face and say exactly what you’re saying, that it’s no excuse and act like it’s either my parents’ or my brothers’ fault. Our family has suffered enough from losing a wonderful person without others insulting the way we have had to handle it. 

I also should mention that to others, he seems like he is a perfectly normal person. In fact, the few times he has been to a mental hospital, he has been able to fool the doctors into thinking he’s completely normal, then he gets home and becomes psychotic again. The severity of his psychosis tends to vary a lot like this.

Mostly when he gets broken up with it’s the worst. He always seems desperate to be in a relationship, and it’s usually one of, if not the most important thing in his life. So when a girl ends their relationship, he becomes depressed, anxious, and begins to have more extreme and psychotic delusions. One girl had gotten in an incredibly minor car accident a few weeks before she broke up with him. (He then argued for days after the accident to make us pay for her to get it repaired because ‘it’s what guys do’). He naturally thought that she got a concussion and had brain damage which is why she broke up with him. He wouldn’t leave her alone and didn’t accept that it was over. 

But this girl and couple of others decided to be obnoxious and cruel. We had told them many times to not date him and to avoid a relationship for these reasons, but they always ignored us. They would get in a relationship with him, then do what some girls (and some guys) think is fun: break up with them for attention and drama. It’s always about the drama. It’s ‘fun’. They get to tell their friends about how she had to make such a difficult decision but to finally let him go despite how hard it was for her. She gets sympathy from her friends and is rewarded by seeing my brother suffer without her, making her feel desirable.

Then a month later she gets back together with him. And then guess what? She does it again. And again. Every time they get together she loads a bullet into the chamber, then soon enough pulls the trigger and causes more havoc for my family. I’ve kept count. **14**. 14 times with 3 different girls. I don’t know why they all love doing this to him, but it’s ruining my family’s lives. He’s a fucking human being. They know he’s sick. What kind of person wants whatever kind of fucked up affection he’s offering when he begs them to come back? They’re causing me and my family’s lives to be miserable and they *wont fucking listen* to our warnings. This isn’t some fucking joke. You’re making us give up hope on my brother. You’re making me get pushed to the point where I don’t believe that the same person I knew growing up even exists anymore. He’s dead for all I can tell, and their fun little hobby fuels the fucking demon that killed him.

Don’t toy with someone’s emotions, especially someone who is mentally ill. It’s one of the most unethical things I can think of. 

You know what the worst part is? And I just now noticed this. I would be *such* great friends with him. The person that I’ve become today, reminds me a lot of him at my age. There are so many fun things that we both liked to do, we had similar senses of humor, I’d be able to hang out with him and still be proud to have him as my brother, not as a burden, not as baggage.

My other brother and I have actually grown pretty close this year, and we are very different. He’s a lot more introverted and geeky, which I love him for. But I just know that if my oldest brother wasn’t schizophrenic, I’d look forward to the days he came home more than my own birthday. I think we’d be amazingly close and good friends. Instead I have to forget that he’s my brother just to keep my sanity.

I was so damn excited when I heard he was coming home from college. That sophomore year in college. I thought of all the fun we’d continue to have now that he could take a break from school. I stayed up all night to say hi when the overnight bus brought him home. But it slowly became clear that someone else came home on that bus, and I’d most likely never see my brother again. 

I can’t even remember what it was like to be around him and be happy. I only associate him now with my anger, sadness, and fear. At this point it’s actually more just pure hatred. I hate him. That’s really the bottom line.

Schizophrenia seems to warp certain aspects of his personality and now I associate the old way he was with what he’s like now. I don’t want him to use the same jokes or talk the same goofy way. Because if the version I see of him now uses them, then all I see is a distorted, terrifying version of my brother. It’s as cruel as you can imagine. 

I wish everything about him changed when he got the illness so that I could accept that he completely different and that maybe his old sense of humor and personality was deep down in him somewhere. But instead it’s all combined and distorted, the illness and him, seemingly inseparable. 

I just fucking want him back",26Jul2018,14
19,"The first choice is absurdly difficult but an exciting challenge to me. I don't really want to accept my limits. It sounds cheesy but I really would rather die trying to experience my dreams than give up on them and settle/accept current state. It might be toxic, but I would be really disappointed in myself if five years from now I'm more of what I'm expected to be than what I want. 

I'm also really scared of ""falling behind"". To me that's never getting married/having kids and not having a career. What I was explaining above is more of me desiring an exceptional life over average, but I think I would fall into either extreme and not the average. My "" homeostatic"" state if you could call it that will make me a recluse who will be extremely depressed and suicidal by 35 if I don't at least have the ""basics"" down. I.e. starting a family by then. However, if I really go in on my discipline/effort I could be a millionaire in LA. 

I'm just venting though because a friend was kind of being condescending about how I should try to just stay average. That wasn't his phrasing, but he wanted me to stray away from the basic/shallow view of success I have (I don't really care how shallow it is. All that matters to me is that it's what I want).

23,"I'll preface this with I love my mother very much and I truly appreciate everything that she has tried to do. 

On the other hand she is clinically insane. Below are just somethings that I need to get off my chest. 

1. Its always someone else's fault
   1. The title says it all. She is literally incapable of admitting that she is wrong despite any and all evidence to the contrary. Despite holding 3 different masters degree in various in demand field, she has never held down a job for more than 6 month. She has change 6 jobs in 5 years. Initially when we heard her work stories, we thought that the boss was an asshole, or the coworker is out to get her. But as she repeatedly gets fired, we found out that the ""asshole"" boss is an asshole because he asked her to do the work a certain way, you know the right way that the job needs to be done. The coworker is out to get her because she won't let her make 3 hour phone calls during work or do her job for her. She became lost and couldn't find the store because she went in the opposite direction than the one she usually takes and its my fault because she spend 3 hours driving around and have no idea how to use her iPhone X. I could go on, but you get the jist. Everyone else is insane and crazy because she is always right.
2. Extreme vanity and snobbishness and hypocritical beliefs + unwillingness and inability to see it
   1. Despite the fact that she doesn't get along with anyone and has zero ability, she is by far one of the snobbiest person I know. She constantly look down on people with ""less education"" and brags about how she went to Peking University and about how she was the smartest person in her province. She constantly derides the nuveau rich chinese people because they became rich through ""illegitimate ways"" and have low breeding because of their lack of degree. It has reached a point where she had paid nearly $100K and is continuing to pay $20K a year to ""educate"" one of her nephews to take SAT and various other test prep courses. None of which has actually helped. IF we were loaded or she earned the money herself than I really would have nothing to say but neither of those things are true. She hasn't worked in over 4 years now and what my dad makes barely covers their normal bills. She has been advocating her relative to spend money that they don't have to take classes for nothing but vanity! SAT and APs mean NOTHING! The money she spend is just feeding her ego of educational superiority. 
3. Extreme lack of common sense that is the equivalent of stupidity 
   1. She falls for every scam in the books. If you name a scam she has fallen to it at one point or another. IRS scam? check. Computer technician from the internet that needs to access your computer and credit card? check. Pyramid scheme? check. 10K for guaranteed advertising for your business? check. She believes strangers over family and is extremely stubborn. If she thinks that the earth is center of the universe than it is. No evidence, no matter how compelling is able to change her mind.

I wanted to take her to the hospital in the morning to see my dad go in before surgery prep but she refused to because she doesn't like hospitals and doesn't want to be in a hospital on her birthday. Even knowing it's going to be just for a bit. 

What should I do now? I bought it up in message and now she became irrate, I just felt like telling her that I was kinda upset about it and I didn't want to hide it. But she said, ""I don't need this on my birthday."" So I don't know where to place myself as currently. Our relationship has been on the rocks with arguments and miscommunications. So I honestly don't know what to do at this point? Either I'm over reacting and she has the right to feel this way because it is her birthday or I should feel disappointed because she won't be there for me and my family when he goes into surgery.

26,"I live pretty far from home, and I have an older cousin I see semi-regularly in the city I live in. Even though my cousin and I are very different and lead different lives, I still enjoy seeing him since the rest of my family is so far away.

Today we had dinner, and he kept trying to debate me on a topic that we both feel very differently about. I never care to have serious discussions with him because he's never trying to understand or genuinely listen to my stance. Like this is not the debate team. I'm just trying to hang out with you and enjoy a meal together. I was getting pretty exasperated and kept trying to change the topic. I'm sure I flat out told him I didn't want to talk about it at some point. 

Flash forward a few hours, I'm home and I get a text from him trying to prove a point from our previous conversation. I got really mad, like *really*? You're just trying to start something at this point. We had a short text exchange and I couldn't shake off my feelings so I called him about it. I was pretty upset and emotional at this point because I felt like it was just super disrespectful of him to continue to push this issue when I'd said repeatedly it was not something I wanted to discuss. More over, he'd made some comment about my profession today ""not being a real job"" because I both freelance and part time. He's also previously made a comment like ""How do you expect to make money in the field that you're in?"" It just comes off as super demeaning and that he looks down on what I do.

I told him exactly how I felt (between getting choked up and upset) and his response was like a petulant child being scolded by their mother. He totally didn't understand where I was coming from and reluctantly apologize. My cousin likes to joke and doesn't seem to take things seriously, but it was even more upsetting to feel like he couldn't take me seriously when I was being vulnerable and honest with him about how I felt.

27,"Yet a friend who I get along well with when we're both tipsy, but a bit awkward with when sober told me multiple times that she likes me because I'm nice. 

Weird. There's no reason for her to lie so I take it at face value and I tell her I like her too. Which is the truth. I'm just easily irritable. 

But I'm not _very_ fond of her. Her values and behaviour doesn't align with me. 

But she's the second person I've ever befriended that sought my presence out on her own. First one, was pretty wonderful, unfortunately she prefers her home country than here so she went back home. I've never felt irritated when I'm with her nor her to me based from our interactions and I miss her a lot but she has plenty of other friends back in her home so eh I suppose welp 

Idk, I like going out a lot on my own. It's nice not having to worry about entertaining others just myself but sometimes I feel a bit sad at moments when I'd like someone to be with me but I tend to not be very open because... Well, there are facts about myself that are a bit off-putting. Which makes sense because if I were in their shoes, I'd be put off by myself too. 

But there's no right time than the present so... I oughta try anyway.

28,"The main issue with me is a total lack of love, self-esteem and respect for myself. And this reflects in all aspects of my life: what I do, feel and think.

I feel like I'm not in the right place to have a relationship because I doubt myself too much and I struggle with anxious and depressive states and I end up projecting all this on my SO.

My life's a clusterfuck really, I feel like I don't have anything going on: I work for shit money for a shit boss, only because it's an easy job and I'm too comfortable here and afraid to change that.

I'm shit at making friends and socializing also, or keeping a tight enough bond with the few mates I still have left.

I still live at home in my hometown, and when my parents are out of town, it's like I cannot even care for myself. I only do the necessary shopping and eating, but it feels like chaos around me.

I don't know which direction to take in life, I don't really know what makes me happy anymore, what I want from myself or from those around me.

I acted like a douchebag with my girlfriend in a few different occasions. I got mad at her a few times, over some seemingly petty matters and I feel like a normal dude wouldn't even think of them. I'm not saying she's a total angel, but I still feel like all the blame I put on her is actually directed at me.

I keep thinking if I really love her that much or if I'm just keeping her around out of my own selfishness. I wonder if she's actually my emotional cruch, because I cannot support myself in that way. 

More than that, she's the first kinda serious gf I have after a loong time of not being intimate with women in any way.

Of course I'm also projecting this on her, wondering if her feelings for me are genuine, or I'm the same emotional support for her. The worst is at times when she seems a bit more detached and less loving than she usually is, that's when all my worries spike.

I want to escape all this hatred and anger I have in me. I want to be a somewhat happy dude, have some sort of balance in my life, be content and grateful with what I have and experience immense love, towards others and myself.

I want to sail beyond this stormy sea and finally get to where the waters are calm and still. And meanwhile, master the art of sailing, even on dark waters.

35,"So yeah like the title said it been feeling quite depressed. Some background about me. I am a late 26 year old man, slightly overweight but not bad looking (I want to think that way at least), plus I have been working out a lot.



Throughout my life I've had very few friends, and never even kissed a girl. Pathetic I know. I missed a lot out of high school and college life due to money being tight, shyness and low self esteem. Plus all my few friends at high school were the type of nerdy people called, roughly translated people-repellents, and I made few friends in college, many of whom I've lost touch with. 


After a kinda bad year at work, and and even harder last summer due to mandatory conscription, I decided I needed a vacation. I haven't had one for 5 years and even more before that so I really wanted to have fun.


Since I didn't want to spend a lot of money I opted for camping. Unfortunately none of the few friends I have left were willing or able to accompany me for various reasons, so after some thinking I decided what the hell I'll go for it alone.


 So I arrived at an island well know for partying and socialising. And so far everything has sucked so much for me. From the accommodations to experiences I can't seem to find anything good to write home about.


I constantly feel like an outcast and here the feeling is 10 times worse. I even had in mind to practice maybe flirting and socialising since I'm 3 years from joining the wizardring world, but every time I even thing about approaching a girl I black out, even though I keep telling myself they are tourists like you and they don't care or will never see me again. Admittedly the language barrier and the fact they are always in groups doesn't help.


My already nonexistent self esteem has drop beyond the basement, and I can barely find fun in anything. I keep berating myself, telling my self I am missing out on yet another summer ill never get back but to no avail. 


Of course it doesn't help that the Majority of the activities are tailored around groups of friends, and even the organisers and people who bring people in bars and clubs seem to shun me and even discourage me from entering.

At the same time though, I don’t have much other ways of meeting girls, I’m too nervous to approach anyone when I’m out at the weekend.

37,"I am not even worried about the results right now. I work in breast cancer research and I'm well aware that my chances of having breast cancer are slim to none. And I'm not the type to worry about results until I get them anyway. 

What I am worried about is the procedure itself. To be honest, I'm terrified. I'm terrified of all medical procedures. For how many times I landed in the hospital as a sickly little kid, for how many surgeries I've observed, and for how many slides of breast biopsies I've seen and will continue to see in my work... I cannot shake the abject fear I feel right now over what will happen tomorrow morning. 

I'll be half naked in a strange place with strange people. I'll be laying face down on a table with my boobs hanging down through a hole. The boob getting the biopsy will be numbed with lidocaine and then stuck with a large gauge needle. I'm young, and my tissue is dense so there's no telling how difficult it may be for them to get the needle where they want it. My boyfriend will be there. I have no idea if he will be able to hold my hand or just sit across the room and watch me be humiliated. And the whole thing will be done in a building next door to where I work, so when I leave with a numb, bruised boob that's sticky with ultrasound gel and starting to swell, I may see someone from my building. Or even my boss. They won't know what just happened, but I'll be uncomfortable nonetheless. 

And while I was given a pamphlet for what to expect, it was vague and so elementary that they had pronunciations for the words 'biopsy' and 'benign.' I feel like I still don't really know what will happen. How long will I be laying on that table? How many people will be in the room? How many times am I going to be stuck? How much pain am I going to be in? For how long? Will it be visible that one of my boobs is swollen? If my wound gets infected, what happens then?

So yes, I'm pretty terrified. And only you guys know it. My family knows what's happening but we don't discuss things like being scared in my family.

38,"Hello Ladies and Gentlemen,

Tara Pine here.

Today we continue talking about how our lives revolved, revolve and will be revolving around one simple issue - our energy levels. 

I bet that all of you heard that humans consist not just out of their physical bodies but also out of the subtle energy fields functioning in certain ways.

Let's look into it. Only 2-3% of our energy flow is controlled by us consciously in every day life by our so called ""day consiousness"", the rest of our energy is under control of our subconscious.

That's why, in order to get access to more energy we ultimately need to get in touch with deep layers of our mind. One needs 5% of theory and 95% of practice to achieve a considerable progress along this path. There is one clear criteria to indicate that you are moving in the right direction - raising of your energy levels. It is very simple indeed but it's also very different from the way we used to learn at school by training our brain to memorise sums and time tables. This process is much more subtle and its called meditation.

Everyone is capable of feeling his own energy levels and energy flow through his chakras. Say, you are in a certain mood, at the certain energy level and then memories about a sexual partner from your past enter your thoughts. Undoubtedly, you will start feeling somehow differently. The change will happen within few seconds. Acknowledging and observing this change is the first step on your path into the depths of your mind.

Many people nowadays feel that there was something important missing in our school syllabus. They realise that our lives are sequences of energy interactions. We have our own specific ways of relating to the world around us which result in particular patterns in our energy channels.

In the previous video we talked about people living in big cities and how they often have only one or two chakras functioning properly and the rest keep on going thanks to the resonance with other people.

Many of us would like to increase the energy flow through our chakras. However, it is necessary to prepare ourselves for this increase otherwise it may be like pumping water under pressure into a blocked pipe - it will hurt our weakest points.

There is a simple exercise we can do to prevent this. Look into the mirror and say out loud: ""I deserve all the best in the worls."" Surprisingly, many people find it very hard to convince themselves that they do deserve it indeed. You should try different angles of looking in the mirror, different timbre of your voice. You should connect to the part of yourself which agree with your statement and make it grow bigger everyday. You should believe yourself 100%, there should not be any doubt whatsoever about you deserving all the best in this world. You'll find it easier to achieve some days than other. Please practice it for at least two weeks before attempting to do any type of meditation.

Love and light to you all.",26Jul2018,0
39,"I've got a story to tell that's been sitting on my chest for years. It's become a little less heavy with years but its still weighing me down, and maybe talking about it will help. 

Sometimes, at my ripe old age of 31, I'll sit back and think about my life's events, my triumphs and regrets, and realize I've come to terms with my regrets, even learned to appreciate them. After a rough childhood, I followed protocol and entered into a very standard abusive relationship at the age of 19. What's funny about abusive relationships is that even though they're hell on earth and you can't imagine there are other sadistic fucks out there doing the exact same thing, when you meet other people in abusive relationships they all have very similar stories -- the things the abuser says and does are pretty much the same across the board. Anyway, mine ended after 1.5 years with him kidnapping me for 3 months. It, obviously, was a bad 3 months – torture, physical abuse and rape, frequently a gun to my head… we were on the run from the police the whole time so a majority of the 3 months was spent in a dark room, silent. A federal SWAT team eventually found us and my ex went to prison for kidnapping. My free defense attorney talked me out of pressing any further charges so that's all he got; he got out of prison in just a few years and has since gotten a PhD in psychology and is working as a psychologist. Pretty scary. 

Thinking back on it today, I finally don't regret all that happened with my ex. Sure, if I could repeat history I wouldn't make the same mistake again, but I can see now how everything that's happened in my life since then was a product of what happened. I've grown from it and become a much less naïve individual. And hell, it's a pretty exciting story – how many people will go through a movie-like kidnapping in their lives? 

There's only one thing in my life that I can't reconcile, nor will I ever. My abusive ex and I got 2 kittens together – one, Simba, was brave, loving and kind – one of those cat-dogs that everyone loves the minute they meet 'em – and the other, Skitty, is a bit feral and terrified of her own shadow. They were the only ones who saw everything that happened with my ex and I, the only other ones who knew what really happened. During one of the torture sessions my ex threatened to put Simba in the microwave unless I cut my hair off with scissors and ate dog food, so of course I did. After that moment, I daydreamed frequently of how I would kill my ex or anyone if they ever hurt Simba. 

Simba became like a support animal to me after the abuse; he comforted me through my PTSD and through all the scary new beginnings as I sought to move further and further away from my ex, should he try to find me when he got out of prison. Simba was the mortar that held me together, and Skitty too since she lives a very scared life. She worshipped the ground he walked on – she followed him everywhere he went, staring at him adoringly. 

One day, a few years after I escaped my ex, I was in a rush to work and didn't lock the front door. I’d just moved into a new place and hadn't learned yet that the door would open on its own if it wasn't locked. So Simba escaped and got killed. I couldn’t bring myself to even look at his body, I made the landlord bury him. I hope to god he did and didn't just throw the body in the trash. 

It's been 8 years and I’ve finally stopped thinking ""maybe I should have killed myself as punishment”, because I recognize it’s a waste to end 2 lives over 1 mistake. But I’ll never stop regretting it. I'll never look back and think ""oh, this helped me become a better person."" No, it hardened me, changed me in ways that abuse never did. I lost all my sparkle, the part of me that was fantastical and lovely. I am hardened now, like a butterfly cage that lost its butterfly.  

I can only imagine that anyone who has ever accidentally killed someone, even a stranger, is never allowed to live a fully normal life. Never allowed because they won’t permit themselves. At this point, I am able to accept it was a mistake and feel less anger at myself, but I’ll never forget Simba – I owe him that much. 

I'm not looking for advice. Just pondering regret in life, and the impact of loss.

43,"On Sunday, I’m meeting a circle of people in my town to discuss philosophy. I’ll be hosting the session. It’s something we do every other Sunday and I’ve come to develop a sense of belonging there. It’s a refuge to me. It never fails to make me happy and I look forward to it. It’s helped me go through plenty of bad experiences I’ve had in my life. I put a lot of preparation in hosting the session this Sunday. 

Just now, my long-term boyfriend told me that he wants me to skip it so we can go to his friend’s engagement. I’ve went to their pre-engagement event previously. I was out of place but I put on my best attitude. I don’t mind it but this time I told him I can’t go because I have the philosophy meetup planned. 

He told me that I don’t have my priorities straight. He told me that I should be able to skip some simple meetup with friends to go to his friend’s engagement party. 

Safe spaces and sense of belonging is something hard to find. I’ve never felt like I belonged when I was with my family. I feel anxiety and stress whenever I have to fulfil familial obligations of attending family events or visiting family. My dad constantly brings up how I’m prioritising my friends over family, over people who love me and will always be there for me. These years of discomfort and mental breakdowns came in waves when I heard my boyfriend use the same tone as my dad did.

I think, sometimes, we find home in many unexpected and unconventional places. And we find discomfort and alienation in places that are supposed to be our homes, our families, but we don’t. 

I’ve been trying to look for reasons why I might be like this. Whether I can ever feel at home with people who love me, in their own special way, but not in the way I want them to. I think we all deserve to be allowed to feel at home wherever we find it, whether with family or with friends. And we should all understand that other people might not share the same sense of belonging as you do. 

And it’s not right to try and make me feel guilty about it. It’s what my parents tried to do, what my ex tried to do, and now it’s what my boyfriend’s doing.

49,"I was twelve or thirteen, with my parents having dinner at a restaurant. Towards the end of the meal, my father, under the mild buzz of alcohol, grabbed two toothpicks from the table and started fiddling with them under the table, just out of my sight. I am pretty sure I heard one snap. He then cups his hands and displays the arrangement of toothpicks (which I couldn't see) to my mother and says ""this is what happens to a woman when she's drunk"". They both erupt in hearty laughter, to the point of tears.

I obviously wanted in on the joke, but he wouldn't tell me. After repeatedly nagging him about it for the remainder of the night, he promised to explain it to me when I turned eighteen, and that was the end of that conversation.

A decade passed and I suddenly remembered this incident when I was twenty four, a few years ago. I spoke to the old man about it, but he doesn't remember it. He genuinely doesn't remember it! My mother faintly remembers the incident but not the joke, and was pretty much surprised that I remember what little I remember.

Ever since then, on my holidays, at work, at the pub, every new person I've ever met I've eventually mentioned this story to, in the hopes that someone can give me some closure and tell me the damned joke. No luck, sadly. Maybe one of you lot here could finish that joke for me.",26Jul2018,1
50,"I went on a brunch date with my boyfriend and he made me pay for our date. This usually never happens. He always picked up the check happily because were traditional daters.

51,"So a lot of the times, I’ll here someone say they’re doing and they offer me to go. And I’m the moment, I’ll be interested and say sure. Then I spend the time leading up to the event regretting what I just agreed to and thinking of excuses to get out of it. A lot of times I do end up getting out of it somehow. Anyone else like this? It’s irritating. I feel like an asshole and it’s always my own fault. ",26Jul2018,1

I’m tired of my adult kids and their constant level of stress it inflicts on me. I’m tired of pretending I’m in a happy marriage. He’s a decent guy, I’m not happy because of me not him. This is the easiest way I think out of all of it. ",26Jul2018,2

57,"So this a post to hopefully help others if they have the same issue as I do. I have urinated frequently for my entire life, while sometimes are worse than others. There’s days I urinate 20+ times, there’s days where I urinate every 5 minutes (with a full amount of urine), and there’s nights where I get up to urinate 5 or 6 times. I have googled just about everything possible about this issue of mine for years, and all I could find was people saying they have an overactive bladder that they were diagnosed with, or they had to use a catheter to urinate. My mother discouraged me from going to a urologist, because she took me to one when I was younger and they didn’t diagnose me with anything. She told me it was probably just an overactive bladder which can’t really be treated much. 
Well, after all of these years, (I’m 21 now) I figured enough was enough. It isn’t normal to urinate every 5 minutes after I drink a cup of coffee, or even a glass of water. So I made an appointment with a urologist at the Cleveland Clinic, since this is the second best hospital in the country and it’s only 10 minutes away from me! 
When I arrived they had me urinate into a cup, and immediately after they had me lay down where they gave me an ultrasound on my bladder. After that, the urologist stuck her fingers in my vagina, (sorry if this is tmi) but when this was finished, she was able to finally answer the questions I’ve had about this issue for years. I have been diagnosed with a pelvic floor spasm.  What this means, is that I have trained myself into urinating in an incorrect way. Women are not supposed to “push out” urine; our pelvic floor muscles are supposed to relax, and then the urine should come out naturally. I did not know that, as I have been pushing out my urine for years, but not because I chose to, because I had to. My pelvic floor muscles got trained into me pushing my urine out, which caused them to result in a spasm. The urologist told me that when she gave me the ultrasound, even though it was right after I urinated, my bladder was still pretty full, even though I didn’t even really feel like I needed to urinate that much. When she stuck her fingers into me, she said she could actually feel the spasm. So this isn’t even really a bladder or a urinary issue, it’s an issue with my pelvic floor muscles. And the reason I urinate so frequent is because the spasm makes it basically impossible for my bladder to empty when I use the restroom, which results in me using the restroom very often.
So to my relief, she informed me that this is a very treatable condition, and the treatment actually involved a pelvic floor physical therapist to actually massage the spasm out. Sounds a little weird, I know, but I can’t wait to start my PT to get back to normal! Haven’t started yet only because Cleveland clinic appointments are all filled up for a while, so once I am finished with this treatment I will follow up letting you guys know how it goes!",26Jul2018,18
