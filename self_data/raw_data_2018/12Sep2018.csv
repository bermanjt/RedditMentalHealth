1,"I've never been by myself before. We got together when I was 16, had a baby at 17, bought a house this year. He's awesome, I just don't think we're good together. We've always had a joint bank account, we share a car. He handles all the money. I just don't even know where to start. I don't get paid much, all my family is across the bridge but my daughter goes to school here. We don't even know what we're going to do with the house because he says he doesn't want to keep it but I can't possibly afford it myself.

2,"My brother and I would stand at the edge of the sidewalk, watching in anticipation to see him round the corner; briefcase in hand, uniform pressed and worn proudly. That image is forever imprinted into my mind, and my heart still aches for the children waiting on September 11th for parents who would never make it home.

Seventeen years ago, the world stopped for an entire day, and for some families, life will forever move in slow motion. We've grown so cynical as a nation, but let us never become too distracted by opinions and politics to remember the bravery of the first responders, the victims and their loved ones, and the military who sacrificed, and continue to sacrifice, so much for us.

6,"I like to keep my mind busy. I like to play games and have a podcast or video playing on the side. 

I have been adding a lot to my feed what with learning about Offline TV and already being an RT fan. I realized when I was wanting to watch something but couldn’t that I have subscribed to enough groups and people that I have filled up my weekly schedule with at least one video a day. Add all that to my reddit subscriptions and you’ve got yourself hours of just looking at my phone screen.

One of the problems is, I don’t like to get behind. I don’t like knowing I missed some random thing from one of the Offline TV streams or an episode of one of Rooster Teeth’s podcasts. So I feel the need to watch EVERYTHING I can.

I retreated to my bed as soon as I got home and didn't feel like I could get up. My anxiety was telling me everything I needed to do and my depression was saying how worthless I was for not being able to do any of it.

My fiance called me and could immediately tell I was not ok, though I didn't feel like sharing why. He eventually got me to open up, and then assured me that I could do everything I needed. He then walked me through everything I needed to do, and helped me find the mental strength to get out of bed. Because of him, I finished my homework, ate dinner, walked our dog, and set up coffee for the morning. I had felt like I was being crushed, and it was like he lifted all the burden off of me.

20,"I overheard my Mum telling my twin sister that “71-no Bhabhi” died just before Qurbani Eid. Mum found out when Mum called to check up, which Mum does occasionally when Mum reminisces and worries about her (in my family, it’s disrespectful to call your parents he, she, her and you).

When my Dad was around, she and her younger son used to come to our home what felt like all the time, whereas we only visited her occasionally. I remember once awkwardly standing with a carrier bag full of clothes waiting for them to take it off my hands when I was a little girl. And when we were leaving, I shouted “bye Bhabhi” (sister-in-law), when I should be saying “bye Suto Mami” (Little Aunt) - everyone laughed at my adorableness and I felt embarrassed and confused. One odd memory I had when I was younger I thought there were two 71-no Bhabhis for the longest time, up until recently actually – a shorter one and a taller one – but turns out they were only one. My eyes must’ve deceived me.

When Dad passed away, she and her husband “71-no Bhai” came over weekly. On the day Dad died, she stayed over. No one had ever stayed over at our house before. That night a button from the cardigan I was wearing fell off. I cried as I felt like my world was falling apart. My Little Aunt simply took my cardigan and sewed the button on as she tried to cheer me up. She was sleeping in what was the spare room at the time and checked up on me before I went to bed. A funny memory I have from that time was when she made soojir halwa (a sweet dish) on the day of the funeral. When everyone ate it we looked at each other as it didn’t taste right. It turns out she put salt in instead of sugar. With tears in our eyes, we all erupted in laughter. Mum looked up to her and Bhaisaab. I remember coming home from school and seeing Mum sitting knelt on the floor in front of them as they were sitting on the chair talking. When her husband fell into a coma and then subsequently died a couple of years later, Mum was devastated.

I should clarify that they are not actually related to us. In my South Asian culture, we refer to almost every brown person as if they are family. I always thought they were just the parents of the one of Dad’s restaurant workers, but although their younger son did work for us briefly, I found out in my late teens that they were a bit more than that. My parents found themselves accidentally homeless and penniless when Dad took Mum and my older brother to England in 1980 on short notice (Dad emigrated in the early 60s and was a citizen by then). A minicab driver (I think his name is Iqbal, who I believe became one of Dad’s best friends) took them to the only Bengali family he knows living in our town at the time, at the house with the door number 71. They had four children (three sons and a daughter), but they still let my parents sleep over for the night in the living room. After learning about this, I took a picture of that living room and a couple of pictures of my cute bonneted Little Aunt with cute Mum the very last time I visited around 2005.

I’ve never known my relatives. My grandparents died long before I was born and my parents kept in touch with some of the family via post and long distance phone calls. I only said a few words to my Dad’s maternal aunt a couple of times. Even though we weren’t close, Little Aunt was probably the closest thing to a relative to me. I’ve always known her to be old (she’s around 15-30 years older than my parents), so she was a granny-like figure to me, especially with her hijab on. As an elderly widow, she still walked to our house to have a tea and talk with Mum. I think this eased Mum’s loneliness after Dad’s passing. She stopped coming around when she moved away some years later to live with her older son in a hilly town. Our communication with her had diminished from then.

As her health deteriorated and needed surgeries, she moved back into her long-time home - house number 71 - to live with her younger son and daughter-in-law again. I encouraged Mum to visit her before it’s too late. Mum luckily went to see her earlier this year what was to be the very last time. I wish I could say she was happy coming towards the end of her life. Her younger son – the one who visited us all the time – went wayward. And her granddaughter – the cutest baby I had ever seen – as mum said is “not okay”. She’s now a beautiful 16 years old, but has severe learning difficulties. Apparently the constant crying as baby was a telltale sign. Learning about this broke my heart.

Her children don’t keep in contact with us. They have a big family and busy lives, hence why we found out about her death weeks later when my Mum called to check up. I didn’t know what to think when I heard Mum say that Little Aunt died. I pretended I didn’t hear it. Her death was expected as she was frail and bedridden, but I did sob a little in my room when I thought about it too much (I try to save my emotions for when someone close to me dies). Had they told us sooner, I would’ve gone to her funeral like she went to my Dad’s. She’s not an important part of my life, but she was a part of my childhood and was there during the pivotal moments in my parents’ lives. I thank her for this.

I wanted to type this out because I know I won’t have the chance to talk about her much from now on. She’ll only be a blurry memory and one of the billions of names recorded in history. My nephew had never met her and will never learn about her except when he comes across the two pictures I took of her with Mum. To preserve my parents’ legacy, I plan to endlessly tell him stories about his paternal grandparents, the stories of my grandparents that I was told, and my childhood. Little Aunt is only be a tiny part of those stories. My Mum stopped dying Mum’s hair and now it’s almost completely white. Upon seeing it for the first time, Little Aunt noted how the years had gone by and how old they’ve become the very last time Mum visited. I could see Mum’s body is breaking down. I hope Mum lives as long as she had. My life depends on it.

My father escalated a situation and it turned into,”im going to kill you”. So to start off, we got into an argument which I started talking back to him and my father doesn’t enjoy being disrespected. He hit me on the mouth as i grumbled when he tried to leave the room, he then told me I had to leave the house because I didn’t deserve to stay  under his roof. As a teen, i ignored it and just continued with my life but he ran into my room and tried to drag me out while my mum told him to stop.

I could hear them arguing as she tried to take the knife off of him, that’s when i heard those words,” I’m going to kill you”. As my mum calmed him down he told me I was an ungrateful child and he went off to do his own thing.

Originally it was me doing things I deemed morally wrong or things that would have bad consequences for me. I remember in one I killed one of my good friends for his jacket then killed everyone with him. In another I accidentally totalled a friend's car in the parking lot. Recently I murdered half of my 100 student class. In one I cheated on my girlfriend (now ex, u related to the dream) . In another, the girl I'm seeing right now started dating someone else instead.

I mean I subscribe to a fan subreddit cause I like that thing and want to be part of a forum with other people that like that thing.

I don’t subscribe to see “this guys content used to be so good” or “this band’s new music sucks” or ”this new expansion ruined the game”.

52,I had a really odd interaction at the pharmacy awhile ago. Some VERY old man dropped a 5 dollar bill and I picked it up and handed it to him. This middle aged lady behind me then proceeded to start a conversation and kiss my ass about it. Like that's SO NICE!!! you could have taken it!! Ummm no lady. it was around a huge bunch of people and I'm not a complete asshole. I have anxiety and hate attention. I honestly wouldn't have done that and waited for someone else if I knew some old lady found a great opportunity to talk my fucking ear off and annoy me. I sound like a grinch. whatever ,12Sep2018,6
53,"This is going to be rambly and without good formatting because I’m on mobile. Sorry!
I’ve noticed a lot of people I’m close to all have the mindset that once things get hairy, they’re ready to abandon the people and things they love. I understand you have to let things go to progress in life. But... you shouldn’t be  flippantly turning your back on things that make you happy. The main subject of this concerns relationships, but it can be applied to any other part of your life. 
A friend of mine broke up with their SO because they thought this school semester was going to be stressful. They were happy. In love. But he just dropped it, a relationship he had worked hard to build and maintain. It’s as if he doesn’t care. As if nothing about the relationship mattered to him. I don’t understand. Being in a healthy relationship shouldn’t add any stress in your life. So why break it off? Because a different part of your life is getting hard? That’s ridiculous. At least to me. 
Keep what is good, for as long as it’s good. When the rest of your world is crumbling down, at least you have this small warmth, a faint, but beautiful light to keep you out of complete darkness. I want to scream at him, smack him over the head and tell him how dumb he’s being. This isn’t how you should be handling this whole situation. But I can’t, of course. It’s his life, I won’t tell him what to do. But to me it doesn’t make sense. 
I’ve heard quite a few people talk about how even if they found their soulmate, they wouldn’t pursue a relationship if the timing of their life is “wrong”. What? What does that even mean? It’s not the right time in your life to be in love? God, I’m so sick of people wanting to act “cool” or whatever by being completely emotionless and acting as if they don’t care about anything. Are you 12? Being an emotionless ass isn’t “cool”. It just makes you an ass. A stupid ass. 
Love! Be happy! Joy isn’t a fucking weakness. It’s something to embrace and I don’t give two shits how cheesy that sounds. Fucking sue me. 
It’s easy to get upset, be depressed, angry, jealous. Finding happiness and love isn’t so easy. I wish it was. But it’s not. So when you do find it, so long as it fills you with its light, don’t let it go. Don’t be so damn flippant. You don’t focus on just one part of your life and ignore everything else. That’s how you end up miserable, drinking at a bar alone every other night wondering where you went wrong. Wondering why none of your friends talk to you anymore. Wondering why it’s so hard for you to keep people around. 
Sorry, I just wanted to rant a little. I’ve been thinking about this for days and it’s been driving me insane. Be reasonable, people! Sometimes leaving people behind is the right thing to do for you and your future. But most of the time y’all are being dumb and just abandoning people willy-nilly. God!
TL;DR: Why do you feel lonely and isolated from all your friends? Because your dumbass kept turning your back on them when the smallest road bump in your life popped up.

54,"There's countless examples and definately worse ones but today's is most recent.

Like I wasn't having a good day anyway, woke up feeling like I haven't slept in 5 days, my gym session sucked badly. Just wanted to sleep all day. I remembered I told my mates I'd come cinema with them today. I waited 40 minutes for a bus to show, 4 were supposed to show but never did and 5 passed the other direction. Even if I got the bus at that point I would've been late, so I had to get an uber, just as it confirmed my pickup a bus came.

And then when I got there a couple people haven't showed up yet so we ended up missing the first 5/10 minutes anyway to wait for them.

Idk it does sound like a first world problem now reading through it, but its like everything that could've gone wrong today did. ",12Sep2018,0
55,"I realized that in life, a soulmate doesn't have to be your wife, or girlfriend. It could just be a friend. I realized mine and I'm really sad now knowing that mine may have cut me out of their life. Here's my story.

On the surface, we are very different. I'm a guy and she's a girl. She's a short, petite girl and I'm a big, hairy dude. We grow up in two different types of households: hers being quiet and reserved while mine was loud and confrontation. Introvert and ambivert. Awkward and awkward. As such, we shouldn't have been friends but we are.

We shared **a lot** of interests which sparked it. Cartoons, video games, and weirdly enough, RWBY. RWBY in particular jump-started our friendship and grew into a year of long text conversations and talking about that show, which led to other shows, which led to even more interesting conversations. Our friendship was exclusively through text until this summer.

We shared personal secrets, with her being her family life and with mine, more personal than hers. Depression. Clinical depression. She was my confidant for a few months and I told her some morbid thing about me, and I was fearful at the time that it would change the way she looked at me. My therapist belittled when I told her because she saw my as a form of manipulation, which it wasn't. But for my friend, it didn't matter. She comforted and was there for me and for something I couldn't even tell my parents. 

This summer came and we hung out a few times. Just hanging out with friends and once to a museum. I realized that though I was having fun with our mutual frienda, I didn't relate to them much. They were just nice people but conversation felt stale sometimes. And the group rarely hung out because of work and internships so I went to my friend to hang out.

We did and though it was only one time, I had the most fun I had that summer for that one day. It was simple but having her around made it all the more worthwhile. We talked about our lives and we learned a lot about each other: our family history, our college lives and wacky moments, and just life. And it was weird, sure, we talked about them over text but in person, it felt more genuine. 

She seemed to really enjoy herself through her initial awkwardness, she ate a whole industrial bag of Cheetos I had and even became a chatterbox after I gave her some lemonade. We ate like shit and even bake cookies during our cartoon binge. It wasn't until she had to leave that I realized I actually love this girl (not romantically but emotionally) and I got sad after because I knew this would be the last time we hung out.

But our friendship wasn't always peachy. I wasn't and still wasn't used to the way she coped with stress, which was not responding to my texts for almost a day. I would ask her if she was okay and she would say what was up. But when it didn't, paranoia would set in and my hours would be miserable until she texted me back. Because I was never used that and still not. 

In my family, silence is associated with being bad and being indirect. It was better to just say what was going on than not at all. Because silence is open for interpretation, and because of paranoia resulting from my depression, I always chose the worst case scenario. I would say 90% of our friendship problems were based around miscommunication issues.

Then came the end. It was after a heart-to-heart and she told me about things happening around her. Her grandma was in the hospital at the time and one day, she told me that she wasn't having a good day and didn't want to talk about it. That was the last day she responded to my texts. It's been a month now. I sent ten texts and even called once since then but all have resulted in nothing coming back to her. I thought I said something for her to hate me.

I talked with her brother since then and he has been my ear for what was up with her. He assured me that she was just stressed and that she does that when she is, even to her other friends. He told me that he talked to her about me, and he told me that I had said nothing to upset or annoy but surprisedly, she assured him that it was the opposite and that she was just dealing with life things. But even still, why is she ignoring me? Her brother is also at a point where he feels that mentioning my name more will result in her getting annoyed of me.

Plan on talking to her this weekend if possible. Cherish the ones you want around you.

56,"     So a couple nights ago I did some meditation and it went well. I felt cleansed and felt the need to get bad thoughts out of my mind for once. Now I'm a fast typer when it comes to phones or computers so the messages ended up a minute apart. About 10 hours go by and I get a response. He said something about something else I typed and then said, 

     ""The rest is copy pasta."" 

     I was so shocked but so relieved at the same time. So I just played along like, 

     ""Ya got me. I was just trying to scare ya."" Then no response since then. 

    I'm kinda glad he didn't take it seriously because I'm afraid he would've told my other friends. I'm hoping he does not change his mind at any point in time.

57,"How do I go about getting it produced? I live off $20/week that doesn’t go to bills. 

They measure 11 by 13 by 17.46 cu-atom widths. You can fit 33 quintillion of them in a cubic inch. Here’s the math of what they produce for one rotation: 

Townsend Atomic-level Generator Maths:
25,400,000,000 picometres in an inch. 
/270 pm/atoms (width, height, length)=
(11cu)Width: 8552188.55
(13cu)Height: 7236467.24
(17.46cu)Length: 5387976.75
# of generators per cubic inch: 3.33449124e+20
Determining number of moving electrons for one full rotation per cubic inch:
(3.33449124e+20)(3 phases)(6 change states)= 6.00208423e+21
Divide by number of electrons in a coulomb to determine number of coulombs created:
6.00208423e+21/6.2415e+18=
961.641309 coulombs per rotation. 
Multiply by number of rotations per second (unknown). 
Determine mah:
3.6 coulombs per mah. 
961.642309/3.6= 267.122586 mah per rotation. 
Resistance throughout generator:
1.68e-8*(112/1)= 1.8816e-6
Resistance per cubed inch in parallel:
(3.33449124e+20)(1/1.8816e-6)= 
1.77215733e+26 Watts 
 Volts = Watts/Amps:
(1.77215733e+26/961.642309)=
1.8428446e+23 volts per rotation.

So you’ll likely need much less than that to indefinitely feed the power requirements of any device. They can be scaled up to any use case. No more need for batteries or offsite power production. 

I’m on mobile so I can’t add a diagram of what it looks like but I’ll add the link once I get to a suitable format. 

Every atom that’s not a production atom is a silicate tetrahedron so it’ll be super durable and strong. 

I’ve been sending diagrams to the folks on twitter that I think will see the use in it. And emailing a few ceos with the same info. What else should I do?

I just confessed to him that I didn't tell him all along that the first Friday of the school year is ""Freshman Friday"" where the senior boys strip all of the freshman boys down to only their underwear and make them run across the quad at 1:00pm while all the other students wait and watch the run while laughing.

He is blushing, but does not believe me. Can you please confirm that this is absolutely true for all colleges?

60,"Martin and Daisy were close friends in high school. 

Although he's a geek, Daisy did always think Martin had a cute bubble butt &amp; was attracted to the nerd. Though they went to separate colleges &amp; grew apart, years later during the summer when both are 22, Daisy spots her friend Martin at the beach. 

They start up a conversation. Perfectly normal except---Daisy is in a shoulders to toe wetsuit, while Martin is butt-naked! 

Daisy knew Martin was shy in high school &amp; that he is clearly embarrassed at this. It's also his first time at a clothing-optional beach. 

His friends told him to try it out NUDE by himself to get out of his shell because who would know him at a beach 50 miles away? 

Martin tries to play it cool, hands at his sides, but he's blushing red. Daisy thinks it's cute, but is still a bit sore at Martin for turning her down as a prom date back in high school to ask a cheerleader (she said no). She heard he's still a virgin. 

As Daisy:

1. How old are you? Are you a geek, or outgoing?

2. What is your reaction at spotting Martin from behind in this situation &amp; what are you thinking? How do you get his attention from behind?

3. Does he look vulnerable? Why?

4. Does his status as a 22 year old virgin make you giggle that he's on this beach nude? Why?

5. What is something funny you can say in conversation as you take a subtle but noticeable look down?


6. As Martin turns his bare buns to leave, you say ""Hey Martin, one last thing..."" &amp; say or do WHAT to make him REALLY blush red &amp; run down the beach for his towel?

61,"I’ve been putting a big effort in recently to improving myself. I’m 20 and up until now I’ve been one of those guys who basically judged his self-worth over whether I could get with girls, and since my teenager years weren’t exactly filled with sexual tension and fulfilling relationships, I felt like I was some kind of freakish loser. After the most recent time where I crushed on a girl I’m good friends with for a year without doing anything, and spent 6 more months getting over her when things didn’t work out, I decided I’d had enough. I hit the gym, started reading a lot more, bought new clothes, focused down on college, done a lot of thinking about why I’m like this, and overall I feel like I’ve really managed to improve myself. I’m more confident and in a much better place, and kinda started to enjoy being single and just living my life. I actually feel like girls have been taking a lot more notice of me recently, maybe I’m just a bit more confident now or whatever, which is annoying the shit out of me because it’s at the one time in my life I kinda don’t need it at all. 

The big example of of this started a couple of weeks ago when I had a really fun night out with a girl I know. My guy friends are pretty much intertwined to this group of girls, since a couple of them are in relationships, so we all have become pretty close over the years. One of these girls has never really talked to me too much, but a couple of weeks ago it was like we’d met each other for the first time again or something. All our friends were out together, and we just kinda clicked, and were hitting it off like crazy. We spent most of the night trying to be around each other. I thought it might just be a one off, like we were both just drunk and happened to keep sitting next to each other and ending up stuck together or whatever. I thought about that night quite a bit over the next week though, I had a blast.

But nope. The next weekend she was out again, and I spent the full day before I went out with that nervous excitement at the thought of seeing her. When we were together we were hitting it off exactly the same, and I realised I’m starting to like her, which I drunkenly told a few of my friends about. Since we’re all in the same group of friends I’m sure she’ll find out soon enough, and honestly the thought doesn’t scare me too much. While I used to bottle up my feelings when this kind of thing happened, I’m not going to this time. I’ve decided I’m just gonna own it and try joke around about it when it gets brought up, like I have a little thing for her, it’s not the end of the world. I’m actually seeing it as a sign of progress that I’m willing to just embrace this instead of hiding how I feel and worrying over it constantly.

But still I’m scared of having this kind of taking over my life again. I think I’m able to deal with it better now, but I still know it’s gonna be something I have to deal with and it’s likely just gonna grow and grow. Whenever I like someone, I like them a fucking lot and get way in over my head. I know that’s just human nature, and it’s part of the fun, but fuck if it isn’t kinda annoying. When I get feelings for someone they become all I think about, and that’s not an exaggeration. I literally can’t focus well on other shit, and even this week I can’t stop thinking about this weekend coming up, hoping I get to see her, wondering whether she’s thinking the same. Like I was starting to enjoy just being myself, thinking I don’t need someone to complete me, telling myself a relationship is the last thing I need etc., and within one night of talking to a girl for a couple of hours I can feel myself starting to hope things work out between us and just thinking about her constantly. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still doing all the things I was before this to try work on myself and getting on with my life, but my mind is completely elsewhere. It’s like I’m just going through the motions until I get to see her again. I wish I didn’t fall for people so fucking quick.

64,"Idk why I'm even in college right now. It really has not been that great, to be completely honest.

This thought hit me out of the blue as I woke up this morning, and it hit hard. I thought about how I'll (hopefully) find a job that will pay me enough to get by, but then what's the point of working solely for the purpose of staying alive? Then I thought, in the hypothetical scenario where I did make a lot of money, no amount would make me happy if I realized that I would only be able to enjoy my wealth for short time periods (the weekends and the six hours that I'm not working). So say, for example, that I retire at 65 (which is a generous estimate) and start full time work at 24. That's approximately 2132 days off work (excluding holidays) and 10,701 days slaving away to make some CEO richer. If you look at it like that, what's the fucking point? In the numerous years people have been living like this, why has everyone continued to let the elites step on their throats and milk them for every last penny while giving them a minimum return on their labor?
