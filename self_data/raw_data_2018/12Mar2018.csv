0,"So, today I wake up with a MASSIVE headache okay, I know, I'll just walk up to the starbucks down the street and get some coffee, pop over to the leasing office about a maintenance issue and go back home. Mmmkay so I stop off at the starbucks and it's super crowded so I figure I'll walk up to leasing office across the street.

As I do this some dude yells out, ""hey heavy girl how you doing?"" he's african american and usually I could careless what color you are but he's dirty baggy pants and all trying to pick me up &amp; whatnots. I ignore him because I'm far too tired for this shit. He mutters ""fat bitch"" and it kinda pisses me off and I'm armed with literally 75cents and a set of keys so as I approach the leasing office I realize it's Sunday and they're closed. I also don't have my phone on me.

So I turn around do a quick scan for him and start making my way back to starbucks across the street. Dude pops out from behind a car scaring the beejeebers outta me and goes, ""look I didn't mean it...."" I don't know what came over me but too tired for this shit and wanting to make myself loud and known because this fool is basically stalking me at this point I raise my glasses and loudly go:

I DON'T GIVE A FUCK. JUST DO IT ON A DAY MY BROTHER DIDN'T JUST FUCKING DIE.
----

This fool starts apologizing so hard, ""god bless, man I'm so sorry, damn.....be careful, sorry,"" and I just go ""stay away from me okay?"" and he goes ""Sorry, yeah! ok."" and I walk into starbucks wait 20 min and head home. Didn't see him on the way home so yahhhh.

I mean I do have a dead brother he just didn't die today.

I usually don't do shit like that. I think I've been overstressed combined with a nightmare I had last night about my brother and a lot of other things going on that just spilled out. Usually, I'd probably entertain the guy for like 5 min let him apologize and move on, I just wasn't up for it today.",12Mar2018,3
1,"I was playing my guitar. I was completely oblivious to how loud I was playing, and also what the time was. I forgot how thin the walls were between our houses, and I just got an angry knock at the front door. They were there for several minutes shouting outside, and I was too afraid to answer, so I pretended to ""not be there"" by turning off the light immediately and not making myself known. I know that they knew I was there (no one's that stupid). I was just too afraid to answer. I don't like confrontation but at this point I probably deserved it. 

I feel like a complete and utter asshole for keeping someone up so late on a Sunday night, especially when they are up early the next day for taking their kids to school. I'm probably going to get a knock tomorrow morning, and other than apologise I don't know if there's anything I can do to make up for it. When my girlfriend (who lives here to but it away currently) finds out, I'm going to be in even more trouble!

2,"I used to shrug them off. I can't expect every woman to be into me, but you'd think at least someone was interested a little bit at this point. I'm having nothing but negative experiences with women and it hurts. I don't know why, either. I'd love to improve, if I knew what I was doing wrong. I think I'm decently attractive, have a good career and I try to be nice and funny. I'd definitely date me. It always ends up with me getting ghosted or with a ""no"", though, on Tinder as well as in person.",12Mar2018,3
3,"So about a month and a half ago me and my girlfriend of a year and a half broke up. When she broke up with me, she didn’t really give me a reason to why she wanted to break up with me. After a month of contemplation I finally decided to ask her, and her response was not what I intended. She responded with things about me that simply aren’t true (I asked some of my closest friends and some of her closest friends and all of them confirmed she was wrong). I tried looking at things from her perspective and even asked some questions (I really do want my best relationship to be better so that’s why i asked) and she couldn’t give me answers. From my perspective it ended because I kept nagging her to come visit me while I’m off at school (she is not in school and lives near my hometown). For an entire year she never once visited me and the last month of our relationship was me practically begging for her to attempt to see me that wasn’t in our hometown. But some of the things she told were completely false from my point of view. She said I didn’t allow her to be herself, and I allowed her to do whatever she wanted to do, hang with whoever she wanted, and all I wanted her to do was come visit me (I’m not a strict person and I wanted to give her the opportunity to flourish under her own circumstances and not my circumstances). Each time I came back from school she seemed to get more and more distant from me and I tried my best to support her no matter what. I don’t want to be pushy so I allowed her to talk whenever she wanted but every morning and every night I would tell her I loved her. I tried so hard at this relationship and I felt like (and her friends felt like) she was the one that wasn’t trying. But each time I read the reasons she broke up with me they make no sense and I hate myself for it. I tried lots of different things to get this off my mind but I can’t. If anybody has any advice or words or wisdom that would be much appreciated. Thanks for reading this lengthy and boring story",12Mar2018,1
4,"   I have spent the last hour (at least) of my life searching for an eye affliction I might have (it looks like a sliver of my iris is detached from the sclera on the righthand side of my right eye, but it’s too hard to see into it for me to come to any conclusions. Don’t worry— I’m seeing the doctor tomorrow), and seeing all of the eye problems, disorders, and diseases that can happen for no real reason has truly enforced an unfortunate truth about life and humanity: it fucking sucks. You can do nothing wrong and die suffering more than any other man before you; you can randomly contract a disease that does unspeakable things to very close, sensitive parts of your body (don’t even get me started on eyes); and you can develop osteoporosis and, one day, suddenly have your bones collapse, dropping you on your head, causing a fatal concussion, and leaving you where nobody can hear you scream. And speaking of concussions... I bet you didn’t know that contracting two harsh concussions, one on-top of the other, can lead to brain swelling— meaning that, if they don’t open your head up real soon, your brain will start bleeding out your nose. Yeah. Being human sucks more than just being alive. I try to stay chill when I can, but the one thing that makes me livid above all else is how unfair life is. 

   If you think we will ever cure cancer, I want you to consider this: our biologists— the ones in charge of curing cancer, among other things— don’t care. If they did care, they certainly stopped caring after 1) a while or 2) they saw their paycheck. These people aren’t paid based on how hard they work, or what they do from day to day, so they reason “I don’t NEED to cure cancer to be paid tons, so why use redundant effort?” That’s it. The ratio of workers who genuinely do it to cure cancer to the workers who are in it for the money tips way over the latter half. 

   Hell, I might just really have an eye problem. Maybe it’s something never seen before. It happens more often than you’d think.",12Mar2018,1
5,"College freshman Dean’s List geek here.

I sort of have a soft “rivalry” with Brandon at my school. He’s a 6'5 frat guy who plays football, and I’m a 5'7 calculus nerd.

He mentioned that his best subject is history, and I said “Well it’s my worst, but I’ll still score higher than you at your best.”

He said why not make it interesting? Whoever gets the highest score on the midterms gets to make the loser do whatever they want that night.

I said “Are you crazy?! You’re on!”

I barely even studied. I got a 97.

My face went white in shock when he showed me his 98.

Okay fine, what stupid thing do I have to do?

He said “No big deal, James. You just have to run across the football field tonight at midnight.”

“Okay fine.”

“Naked.”

My face turned red and my jaw dropped as everyone around him laughed.

“Yeah, right. Haha. What do I really have to do?”

He said “You have to run across the football field at midnight tonight. Butt-naked. Not even socks.”

A cute girl said “Oh baby! I know my plans tonight!” and laughed as I struggled for air.

Even my friends Heather (just a friend, she has a BF) and Jason laughed.

Again, I am a huge geek. Obviously a virgin.

""You're not serious are you?""

And at midnight that night, there I was. With about 10 cheering students on each side of me, standing at the endzone of the football field. I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and dropped my fluffy, white robe to the ground.

There I was, running across my own college football field.

As naked as the day I was born.

Wearing nothing but my glasses and the pink blush on my cheeks.

I am lily-white from the neck-down. Not fat but a “studies-while-eating-Doritos” belly shaking as I ran. My “bigger-than-you’d think” bubble butt jiggling behind me. And my…ahem…small package flapping in the breeze.

About a dozen students, Brandon's friends and a few of mine, screaming ""WOOOOO!!!! Check out that BUTT!"" and laughing.

The loudest roar of laughter was when I ran back past Brandon and he said ""Look everybody, it's the genius!"" and SPANKED my naked ass hard as I yelped out loud.

Not only was the spank LOUD, not only did he perfectly get me across both bare cheeks, but oh my goodness did it STING.

I just continued and ran towards my pile of clothes I stripped out of, with my bare, white butt stinging behind me and tears in my eyes from how much it stung.",12Mar2018,0

9,"I have until May 1 to decide where I’m going to college. I’m going to visit 2 of the ones I got accepted to and I have a somewhat good idea about them, but deep down I feel scared. Like I feel like I’m not meant to leave high school yet, or that I’m not ready for the real world. Friends and family tell me I’m really mature, and my dad has told me I’ve been adult for a long time, but I don’t believe any of it. I’m so scared of the change coming and I don’t know how I’m going to deal with it. 

Just hearing my mom get sad about one of the colleges I’m considering is 7 hours away, and *just that* makes me second guess if that college is even an option, because it makes me feel like I’m too attached to my mom and family and my whole environment. I act like I’m ready for change but I’m not sure if I really am

On top of that I feel like I never invested as much time as I should have on researching colleges. Obviously I have done more than the average kid at my school but seeing the lengths of what people do on r/ApplyingToCollege just gets me down, like even if I like at least one of the colleges I’m going to visit I feel that it’ll be a mistake no matter what.

19,"hello interwebs! i love to do backflips, i’m twelve and i posted my first picture on Instagram three years ago. i’ve had four accounts at one point in my life. i only really use one these days as my new friends shouldn’t see who i used to follow or what i posted when i was younger.

we need smartphones in school where i live to use google therefore i have one. my mom is in control of the phone but last few months i’ve been having it more and more. before i’d often spend my time on IG and she only has facebook so she’s not sure how it all works. just knows its for sharing photos. when i’m being bad she takes it away and keeps it for week plus sometimes. i’m very active, i play sports and love video games. oh i also use snapchat which both apps end up being great tools to communicate with my friends from school. i like to use stories, on both apps and post videos doing backflips, skating in park, being silly with my friends or singing rap songs when in my room alone.

recently all my school mates got an app called sarahah where you can send anyone an anonymous comment or message within snapchat. it’s very addictive because it feels so beautiful to read nice messages and the bad ones are probably just my friends having a laugh. everyone is using this app!

since my mother doesn’t really use social media besides facebook, and my father logs into his once every two months. they don’t understand the depth of these apps, and that’s fair. but i’d love to evolve to as best human as possible and i think my parents would love this too.

my parents haven’t had the best energy between them last few years. i don’t get along with my dad much, he’s quit smoking and drinking a few months back so hes been in his own world it seems. i’ve got this gut feeling that maybe this isn’t the best for me.

can the use of these apps cause any bad to me? make me want to be “perfect” in situations where i should be authentic? is that life?

i’m lost and need interwebs to help me. please tell me the depth of positive and negative aspects of these apps in my life! i genuinely want to live a mentally healthy life!",12Mar2018,1
20,"  We have a mouse in our house. Lol, it's like a serious crisis because my sister saw a mouse in our bathroom run into the walls. I don't know why she's so scared, so so scared of a little mouse. But then she bought a bunch of mousetraps and put them in the bathroom. I'm not loling. This tea tiny baby mouse, and she wants to break it's little neck? I can't get rid of the traps, she'd know. So what does my crazy mind think of... put a little of my cat's litter around the traps. Feel like it's not enough so I literally pee a little onto a tissue and rub it around the hole the mouse is coming out. I will do anything not to see a little baby mouse with it's neck broke. I know it seems crazy, but I have some serious trauma with having to hold my last two cats as they died. I just can not accept the death of an animal in my presence ever again.

It's funny that I have the ability to fucking save unimportant documents like my 3 year old college acceptance papers/paper checks from my first job but I can't keep track of the second most important document I've ever received.

27,"From the outside, it looks like I have it all. A steady job which pays well and at which I am valued and well-respected, a husband and a four year old son whom I love more than anything in the world, an ex-wife/co-parent who lives down the street and who is my best friend... I have a lot to be thankful for, which makes everything that’s going on in my brain even more difficult to cope with. 

I feel like I don’t have anything that is truly *mine*. I get up, I go teach science to high schoolers, come home, grade papers, cook dinner, pick up my kid from school, play and read until it’s his bedtime, then chill and watch TV with my husband. I don’t really have any hobbies that are my own, nothing I’m really good at or love doing. I don’t have any friends that live in town, no one I can hang out with or go have fun with.  I do run three times a week, but that’s it. 

My husband is a poet in his free time. He’s working on his poems constantly. He just had his first book published and went to a big writers’ conference to do a reading and a book signing. He did a great job and made a lot of friends. I’m incredibly proud of him and his poetry means the world to me. But there’s a part of me that almost resents it- I do a lot of the housework (yes, he does help some), I cook dinner, I make us cocktails some evenings and then clean up, I help proofread his poems and give him feedback... and the fact that he is so successful in this beautiful, creative thing that is absolutely his own highlights and underscores this gap in my life right now, and it hurts so much. I feel guilty for letting it get to me, I wish I could be proud and happy and supportive and that these negative feelings would go away. 

I am really into philosophy and have been studying it on my own for the past two or three years. I recently dove into a particularly difficult text and have spent literally hundreds of hours over the past few months reading, reading commentaries, listening to podcasts and lectures, trying to understand and analyze this one work. I’m not even halfway through and I have the slightest grasp on it and I barely understand it, and I have nothing to show for it. It all feels empty, impotent, useless- a big game or a joke. Even if I did understand it better, I have no one with whom I can converse about it. I feel incredibly alone and unseen. Lately I’ve been spending my free time just crying in the shower or laying on the couch, staring. 

More than anything, I want to be seen and valued. I want to make friends. I want my life to mean something beyond my home. My home life is beautiful, yes, but there’s a gap. I feel guilty for dwelling on that lack- I should be more thankful for what I do have. I need a change in perspective. I need some kind of change. I don’t know how long I can last feeling like this.

28,"And all on this app called Snap that anyone can download and watch them, too. 

The reason I wanted to post about this and share this is that I'm struggling to deal with it all morally. So this app is made for a certain security camera device that is made by Sengled. The camera is attached to an LED light that you can view through the Snap app by Spengled on any mobile device..

I got one and after downloading the app, I noticed this thing called Discover. I went into it and... Holy Shit, there is live footage from all these cameras being broadcasted to anyone with the app. I quickly went into settings and noticed that the 'Discovery On' box was checked, which allows your footage from your camera to be broadcasted to whoever else has the app.

Now there is ethically and morally a debate about this feature and how it is set up alone.

But I stumbled upon this group of people in a bedroom and this camera is recording them 100% of the time. I have seen them smoke crack/meth, do heroin, saw the guy physically and verbally physically abuse his gf etc,

My previous relationship(she was a co-worker) of around 5 years ended about 4 years ago and at the time I swore to never date anyone from work again due to all of the drama during and when the relationship ended. I prefer to know someone before I begin dating them. I have somewhat of a trust issue with people I do not know. I am 45 now and to be honest I have not dated seriously since the previous relationship, just a few dates that went nowhere. Recently I have become very aware that this is too long to go without a relationship and it is a little depressing so I was considering my options. I do not feel comfortable with meeting and dating in the bar scene and I have not gone the online route. She is aware of my ex who no longer works with us and she is also aware of my rule about dating co-workers. I also know that she would not do to me what my ex did when we broke it off, so I am not really worried about work related drama from her. My question to you all is what should I do? Should I take the chance and ask her out or leave it alone and seek other options? PS I have not shared this with friends or co-workers as they would know immediately who I was talking about so i have little options for advice here. Has anyone else been in the same situation and how did it go?",12Mar2018,1
50,"This year started off in a bad tone with my Senior I work closely with at work leaving our company, leaving myself alone to handle a grouping of projects (1 year old graduate, definitely not normal).

Small company. 15 people. Doing architectural services with mainly government clients.

I’m not going to lie, I am having difficulty trying to meet deadlines. Sure I do have other colleagues to ask from help but they too are busy with their own jobs. Yada yada yada lets skip those details for now...

Straight to the point. My purpose of this post is to get some feedback from Redditors out there. Help me understand what am I personally experiencing. So here we go:

I realise that I am starting to lose motivation to get work done. I feel the need to speak to other colleagues, asking how they are with their work. Hoping to understand and learn from them how they manage. At the same time, I am starting to look at seniors at other companies whom i have worked with before, hoping to start a conversation, same thing, to understand what does it take to get to where there are now. I’m sure they have been in this situation before right? All this while trying to keep a front, maintaining my composure to say “hey im doing fine... just having a lil bit if difficulty here thats all”

The most interesting part is that im starting to find past employees (trying my best to stalk them in Linkedin or Facebook) hoping to ask them what was their experience in this company and what made them leave. Is this phase that i am experiencing “normal” in the context of this company?

So ya... do u guys think I’m seeking validation? I’ll be honest, I’ve always felt that im the kinda person that needs to have a mentor. I learn from others advice/example.",12Mar2018,2
51,"I mean their personality.

I'm 21 and most young people I see are rather arrogant, mean, fake, etc. You can barely talk to them, or hold a conversation or whatever. 
I rarely met young people with whom you can talk to without forcing the conversation. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining or anything. It's just what I observed, you know?

Today, while I was riding the train back home, I met this elderly couple. I was able to talk to them, share life experiences, talk about myself, find out things about them. Open conversation, which didn't have to be forced. And that's how most older people are. 

They told me I'm beautiful, that I should find a nice girl, they felt sorry for my breakup which was months ago and that I have a great future in front of me. That was after like half an hour of talking to them. 

No one, I mean no one my age, ever told me that. Even close people. 

All you see around is sad people staring at their phones all damn time or listening to music in headphones. I would like to initiate conversation with them, but it's not possible. 

Anyway, can someone offer a historical/scientifical explanations of this? A book, maybe? 
Or just anyone who wants to chat about this thing.",12Mar2018,6
53,"One girl talked about a guy sending her snaps of his huge house and they joked about how she should marry him just to get half his stuff.

Then the other girl talked about how she was snapping with a cute guy. She said she'd wait a few hours to reply to him and he'd respond instantly. ""I just can't respect that. I block all the guys that do that"".

I just can't believe two completely normal looking girls could think like that. It really makes me wonder.",12Mar2018,17
54,"Every time the head of some government agency thinks we'll just mandate by law that everything that is encrypted has a backdoor for government I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

First, there is an unspoken assumption here that encryption is some arcane subject that probably only Microsoft knows about and everybody therefore has to use the encryption we are given by the big companies.  Encryption is something that every mathematician knows about, good encryption takes like 20 lines of code, and any half-way intelligent person can roll their own.

So, are we assuming ISIS is too dumb to write an encryption algorithm?  It isn't reasonable to believe that any organization that has 100 to 1000 people won't contain somebody who can roll their own encryption.  As I understand ISIS, that might just be what gets you out of being a suicide bomber.

Second, if somebody sends an encrypted message to somebody else, they are doing you (the intelligence agencies who are watching) an immense favor.  You know that a message went from this person to that person at such and such a time and probably have a reasonable idea how long the message was.  You should be able to infer a lot from that.

A smart opponent knows how to send encrypted messages in a way that no amount of CPU time can decrypt.  Ever heard of a one-time pad?  People have been using them since WWI.  It is bad games theory to assume your opponent is dumb.

A really smart opponent would use steganography.  Go ahead and google that, I'll wait.  Done properly, it means you won't even know that a message has changed hands.

Obviously, if your opponent knows you are watching, and knows there is a back door in the encryption Microsoft gave them, then they are going to pick a technique that you cannot decrypt (and possibly can't even detect).

Or they might just be as dumb as you are of course.  God help us all.",12Mar2018,2

57,"Couldn’t post this on r/AskReddit so...

In the summer of my 16th year I was introduced to Fifty Shades Of Grey through social media and I was OBSESSED with it. I was sure it was the best piece of literature I had read period. My father was flying to the States, to New Jersey for a conference and I begged him to him to take me along. On a blog dedicated to the book, I had found one of the hoardings of Mr. Grey ( YES a hoarding ONLY, not a meet and greet or anything)located on Grand St. in New York. Thusly, I flew 22 hours, drove 3 more hours and dragged my father who still does not know what the book is about, to take me to see the hoarding and take pictures of me in front of it.   

I will try to find and post the picture.",12Mar2018,1
59,"I’m a senior in college and I’ve been throwing out applications like crazy. Almost always these fall on deaf ears and I never hear back from the company.

Reluctantly, I decide to attend a career fair where I talk with a lot of companies, big and small. A few eventually reach back out to me, one of which is a pretty big name in my field.

This is very exciting for me because at last I have a chance at, not just a job, but a fulfilling and prestigious job that isn’t contracting work (I live near DC so the only stuff around for me is contractor after contractor)

I go through the interview process. It was tough but I felt reeeeealy good on 3/4 interviews. The second one I was pretty shaky on. But I figured since I got called back after the technical round and into the HR round things we’re looking really good.

Then today, a little over a week later, I got the rejection email. I just wasn’t good enough. I thought I did so well and that I might finally have a job in a location I would like, doing fulfilling work, with a competitive salary. I got so excited, but I just wasn’t good enough. 

Now I’m back to having no job prospects upon graduation, no hope of moving to a new area, and seemingly no way in hell that I’ll find any work that I genuinely enjoy. I really have no clue where to go from here. I’m so worn out from class and feel so devalued due to this whole job search. I’m just really really disappointed ",12Mar2018,4
62,"I've always been this way. I ruminate constantly. I analyze myself and my situations waaaaay too deeply all the goddamn time. I'm stuck inside my head and never putting my thoughts into actions because i don't know how to. 

It's partly why I'm so isolated. I mean, relatively. I'm surrounded by a lot of people but at the end of the day I feel alone. Because I know what I want for myself and what I want for a partner and other friends, but I dunno how to make that a reality. This doesn't even make any sense, but I've just been inside my head too much lately. 

I wish I were extroverted. I wish I found comfort in other people rather than in my room. Thinking too much is fucking me up. I wish I could channel my anxieties outside of myself. I see a counselor but it's not really what I mean here. I take life way too fucking seriously but I can't really change that about myself because it is and has been part of my core personality for over 20 years. 

I wish i was free.",12Mar2018,6
63,"Knowing that people form impressions of me and judge me makes me feel highly uncomfortable. If I had to guess as to a reason why this is happening, it would probably be because I hate myself and also don't have much of an idea of who I am. As people get to know me better they'd start seeing the parts of me I hate. And they might notice parts of me that I am unaware of. Just knowing that people might know me better than I know myself frightens me. 

I also am practically allergic to having an emotional connection with other people I know. I can't say I love you to my friends and when they say it to me I feel an immense pressure to reciprocate except when I do I feel terrible afterwards. 

If anyone I knew in real life read this, I would be absolutely mortified. I'd probably avoid seeing them for a while just because knowing that they know this about me terrifies me. However, I have absolutely no problem telling strangers on the internet this stuff. 

Just a short incoherent rant on my emotional unavailability that I really had to get out. Hopefully one day I'll be different :(",12Mar2018,4
64,"Lol ive got something quick to submit, i dont know where my brain is but i hope i find it.

So context: 
I know this younger girl at work, we have exchanged phone numbers but have never texted. We chat sometimes, but im never the one to initiate. Shes open about her ADHD and it explains why she likes to talk so much with others and bounce around in general. People describe her as weird sometimes but other than that kind of attractive. And i can agree. Ive admittedly found myself on multiple occasions thinking if i wasnt such a loaf of bread maybe... i dont know.

Anyway fast forward to the weekend we are at an awards event. She shows up late but there is a seat open right next to me. Ofcourse i dont mind this. She sits down and she immediately starts up a conversation. We talk a bit. Then after that she starts poking me, rubbing my legs, arms squeezing my arms, asking for a fist pump every five seconds and pulling me into her. I had every opportunity to say stop. But i diddnt, because i liked it but i had to act like i diddnt. Eventually she gets sleepy and lays her head on my lap and i end up falling asleep as well. 
All im worried about is her bragging to other people that i was practically her playground. (No nasty pun intended)",12Mar2018,1

72,"I’ve been at my company for some time. When I first started my salary was market value. Even with a promotion last march I’ve been feeling I’m no longer at market value. I asked for director level and was told that while the promotion was “long overdue” I was not at director level yet due to experience. 

Recently, my friend who works for a large accounting firm told me he thinks I’m underpaid. A colleague I work with said he was shocked when he found out I’m not at a director level. My other colleague said she was shocked at how much the company has me doing. 

When I look up director level for my position I meet all the responsibilities in my current position and some. I have the experience and can do the work I just don’t have the years a director usually has. It’s gotten to the point my boss is out of the loop and I run my entire function while consulting with him from time to time. 

Do I ask for a leveling? Game plan is to make a portfolio with  5 director level position descriptions and compare them to my current function so my manager has hard proof. Good way to go? ",12Mar2018,3
