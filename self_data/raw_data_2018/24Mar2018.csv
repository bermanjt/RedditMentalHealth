I’m using this app called Kwit to help me, it gives out little tidbits of motivation and advice, tracks my progress, and notifies me when I’ve passed milestones.

2,"My therapist set up an appointment with a psychiatrist (at the same facility) and I just don't want to go through with it. People have reminded me that nothing is set in stone. I might not even get prescribed anything at all. But I still feel pressured into it by my therapist who mentioned antidepressants during my first session. I don't know if that's normal or not. It could be because I was already diagnosed with depression, but was not prescribed anything. I also feel pressured by my mom who won't even have a conversation about it. She just cuts me off and says ""I really think you should give them a try"". ~sigh~

Whenever I ask people about antidepressants online or offline, people always make them out to be great. I ask if there are any downsides and people are just like ""they work wonders for me"". I don't doubt that they work, I just have a feeling that I don't need them. I don't want to disappoint my mom or my therapist though. Would saying no really be so bad?",24Mar2018,1

4,"I’ve always been pretty lonely through my life. I just never really connect deeply with anyone. Maybe I’m too guarded, maybe other people just don’t ‘get me’, I don’t really know. Like I’m friendly with almost everyone I meet, but it’s very rare for anyone to ‘click’ with me. It’s insanely rare for anyone to get past my kind of self-deprecating humorous side and actually get to know the real me. Nobody really tries. It bothered me through school, everyone had these really close friends and I just kind of didn’t. I tried to just keep my head down, and get good grades. And I did. But I completely missed the social side.  I’ve been friends with the same group of guys for years, and while I do enjoy going out with them and having fun, there’s just no deeper connection there. We’re all kind of friends out of necessity, even though we do like each other.

After school I realised it most; all the people I had been kinda friendly with in high school just didn’t keep in touch. I had like 3 or 4 guys who I only seen when we went out and got drunk/occasionally high at the weekend. And while these guys are fun, I’ve also watched them get a bit too reliant on alcohol/drugs for a good time. I’m not entirely against it myself, and I suppose in typical teenage style I’ve dabbled a bit, but some of my friends will go and out and snort coke almost every weekend. But they’re my friends, and they’re all I’ve got. And we do have good times. And they’re much more than that, even if I don’t have that deep connection really. For a year after high school this was my life; college, all week, and hollow partying at the weekend. It just reinforced how fucking lonely I’ve been, for so long I’ve just wanted a deeper connection than this stupid shit.

So when I met this girl a couple of years back at my first part time job who I genuinely, truly connected with, I was kind of floored. I found someone I could just be myself around. And who wanted to know me. And wanted to be my friend. We started out as work friends, but after a while we started hanging out outside of work, going to college together, planning our days around seeing each other, etc. It was amazing. I’ve never had someone actually push to hang out with me like that before. We ended up becoming best friends over the last couple of years. And we talked all day everyday. I was closer with her than I think I’ve ever been with anyone. I couldn’t believe I could mean so much to someone. She would tell me that I’m her best friend and that she can’t imagine not having me in her life, and that she’s so glad we met. I always felt the same about her. I’d share every mundane detail of my day with her, and she’d do the same with me. We’d support each other through our shitty moods, we’d have stupid inside jokes that we only really got cause we have the same stupid sense of humor, which sounds kinda cringy as I type it out, but it honestly felt so amazing.

After becoming close with her, I’ve really tried to get my act together; I still hang out with the guys at the weekend, but I don’t go near drugs, apart from very odd occasions when I just want to unwind. I started studying hard. I started reading. I started just trying to improve myself. It felt possible with her there that I could do more, be something more. It just felt so right.

Obviously from what I’m describing it had went beyond a friendship for me. I realised I was completely head over heels for this girl. And honestly even now I still think part of her felt the same. No point going into detail, but there were moments where we definitely crossed some sort of friendship barrier. But we worked together, and she had a boyfriend, and I knew it wasn’t gonna happen. But at the same time, how could I live with myself if I never tried? She is the one person I genuinely feel understands me, and I know she feels like I’m one of the only ones who understands her too. How could I let her just pass me by and not at least make my feelings known? It ate me up inside. I spent months agonising over what to do, but I just couldn’t keep it in anymore. My emotions got the better of me.

So I quit my part-time job. I told everyone it was to focus more on college, which is partly true, but the real reason was so I could come clean to her. I waited a few weeks after, and one day after hanging out all day I told her how I feel. It went about as well as you’d expect. She thanked me for telling her, but told me she had never even thought of me in that way and that she felt like this complicates our friendship too much. Like I mentioned earlier, I don’t think she was telling the complete truth here, but she made sure to tell me her boyfriend is her priortity, so obviously if she’s committed to him then it’s best if we just ignore whatever there was between us. I’m not gonna keep chasing after someone who’s made their decision, I genuinely want her to be happy with him if that’s what she’s decided is best for her. Regardless of my thoughts on it though, we both agreed we should probably have some space form each other, and she said that while she feels really sad about it, she knows I can’t help how I feel. After that we haven’t talked for couple of weeks. I bumped into her boyfriend, who was actually understanding about it all, but told me that she’s pretty upset about it and that he doesn’t know if she will ever talk to me again, and that if she does he wants me to know it can’t be more than friends at all. I think that hurt the most; knowing that by telling her how I feel, I had  fucked up the friendship irreversibly and made her feel shitty about it all.  I know we both want to talk to each other, but we also both know it’s best if we don’t.

So obviously I’m reeling from that, but to top it off further I found out some college results today that basically put me in the position where unless I completely ace all my exams (which the odds of happening are astronomical), I’m gonna be kicked out. I’ve studied so fucking hard all year for nothing. I felt like I was making progress, I’ve been working so damn hard, and even then it’s just not enough. It just feels like my life is falling apart at the seams man. Like I’ve tried to go for the things I want and improve my life, and it’s like I’m being brutally reminded that shit just isn’t meant to work out for me. A few weeks ago I had a job, I had someone who genuinely cared about me, I thought my grades were gonna be looking up, I felt pretty content. And now in the space of a couple of weeks it’s all went to shit. I could be facing the prospect of getting to summer and being an unemployed college dropout with nobody around him who really, truly cares. Hell, even all my guy friends I mentioned earlier at least have steady jobs and fulfilling relationships. I have fucking nothing at all, and I honestly feel so fucking low.",24Mar2018,1

Of the 23 of their children who landed in my class, 6 have killed themselves and 4 are now estranged from their families.

8,"I swear if people don't stop complaining about female character design in video games I think I'm going to take a shit on the Mona Lisa. If you think it's sexist and it bothers you that much then stop playing the games and stop telling creators how to redesign beloved characters that have had an iconic image for almost twenty years. It's their creation, and they can do whatever they very damn well please with it, they learned how to design and program games, they've earned the right to produce their art in whatever style they please.

 If you want a flat chested, bland, boring, frumpy, and completely ""realistic"" (whatever the fuck that means) female character then why don't you make your own game? I mean go for it. Why don't you go ahead and write your own story and universe, then design, program and edit your own game? Oh yeah that's right, you have neither the skills nor the talent, so shut your fucking mouth. Christ! I read an article about Ivy from Soulcaliber, my favorite character from the series btw for more reasons than the one your thinking about (her gameplay, her backstory, and the irony of her goal), and holy shit did it make me mad, and I just needed to vent somewhere. Stop trying to shit on everything I love, you god damn SJWs! I don't want Ivy, Chun Li, and Mai Shiranui to look ""normal"" nor do I want their designs to be changed towards any hint of ""realism"" to appease your ridiculously uneducated criticisms (fucking assholes acting like they're long-time fans of the games and their plots or something so that they can make a point and push their stupid gender politics onto yet another unique modern sub-culture). The whole point of the games is to escape reality, I want it to be fantastic, and when you the developers bow to the minority's demands to make the characters look more realistic you're messing with a character that your fans have come to love over almost two decades. And NO, they are not the same characters just with altered designs, if you were to take away Chun Li's thighs, Mai's ass and tits as well as her slutty ninja outfit, and give Ivy a normal rack with a ""practical"" outfit then you wouldn't have Chun Li, Mai, and Ivy anymore! You'd have the equivalent of cheap blatant ripoffs of the characters with the same names just with different in-game models. This sounds ridiculous but if the tits on Ivy's in-game model get smaller one more fucking time, i'm not buying the game. I want Ivy, not her cheap knock-off with ""realistic"" proportions because I'm playing the game to forget about my real life problems for an hour and want my favorite character to do nothing but assist in that escape.

This isn't about my perversions, nor do I deny having them, but this is about people complaining about not being able to relate to someone else's art. I hate to break it to you, but most artists don't care about relating to you, they only care about expressing their creativity and imagination because its the only way they can satisfy their urge to create; if you are cultured at all you'd learn to appreciate its expression regardless of your personal connection to the subject matter. I don't relate to classic art, but I still appreciate the work and skill that went into the Mona Lisa. If I wanted to see just how life-like I could draw lets say an angel and the quality was on par with the Mona Lisa, then someone complained about how human she looked and how angels should have an appearance ""like lightning"" with raiments ""white as snow"" (according to Matthew: 23) I'd probably break their nose. 

Much like conventional art, the games are not meant to represent reality unless that is the goal of the artist/developer and the core of the game's appeal; for games with these over-the-top themes, characters, and premises it isn't.",24Mar2018,0

22,"TL:DR 
I feel as if I’ve been in a toxic friend/family extinguishing mode for several months now. I have started to realize the fat in my life needs to be cut in order for me to grow. I can’t live a life built on fake friendships/relationships regardless of who you are to me on paper. I’m sure some of you may have gone through or are going through the same. Embrace your success, happiness, and growth without negative energy in your life!!!

Realized that you lose friends/family growing up, and it’s usually for the better.

So I woke up this morning and I began to really think long and hard about those who are no longer in my life... 

I’m a 29 yo male who is newly married to my gf of 8 years. We moved on our own and we are both medical students. She is the most amazing women I can ever ask for! 

She has never been the social type, so she doesn’t really have that many friends to lose. However, I have always been social, and I’ve had many people I considered close. I guess that’s why I now notice how empty those friendships really were. 

I can trace the death of those relationships to just a few very pivotal events and ALL of them involve some form of jealousy or social competitiveness. Obviously a doctor makes a lot of money, but we’re both not even there yet! Most of these people have started their careers and moved on to bigger and better things (in my eyes). I may be just assuming here, but whenever I run across some of those old friends, they have to taught some element of their career bringing them joy, happiness, financial fruits, etc... I don’t really give a shit what they do, but why is everything a fucking competition?! Why can’t we just hang out and be about just enjoying each other’s company?! 

About a month ago, I found myself going through Facebook friends and deleting those people who routinely are not involved in my life. I did this because I felt they were almost ‘bad juju’ spies, waiting for an opportunity to relish in my misfortune. May seem a bit far fetched, but some of these people don’t even approach me in public anymore, why should I be your friend on Facebook if you’re not my friend in real life?!

This doesn’t just apply to friends, but also family. My one and only brother is the definition of fucking prick. A narcissistic individual who has the most volatile relationships in his life. He can’t hold down a steady relationship for more than a few months. He has always blamed me for choosing medical school over helping out the family with bills (which I still did while in school). A month back, I trashed him from my life. I got into a physical altercation with him and said don’t contact me again, and I meant it.  I have no feelings of love for him, the same way I have no feelings of love towards any of those ‘former friends.’ 

I know some of you may be experiencing the same sort of thing in your life, and I’m here to say that it’s okay. You’re not here to please everyone, but you are here to please yourself. Put your self above all, but consider those close to you who support you. Then those people will start earning a priority in your life, which is the way it’s supposed to be. Be mindful of those who wish to fill your life with negativity, and remove them before they destroy you! 

Life goes on! ",24Mar2018,3
23,"Hello again. There is much to get to. Let me apologize up front, the more difficult the subject matter the more tendency to give into tangents. So for those -just tell me the answer types- my bad.  I want to say God bless the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students and those who have chosen to be activists. Understand, the devil knows the jig is about up and is throwing everything he's got at us now.  It's about to get hectic. But we all should try to walk in the shadow of the example these brave, strong and purposeful young people.  We can not afford to allow ourselves to be deceived into believing we can negotiate with a terrorist.  The devil is a terrorist and therefore there can only ever be one response, remind the devil that God's gonna cut you down.

Now, at this critical juncture in our stand we need to talk about how to heal from trauma and how to manage fear. People are in fear of traumatic events not just because of the occurrence of the event itself but what you experience in the aftermath. Everyone works incredibly hard to avoid trauma. So many of us design our lives to minimize risk and avoid pain and still like some heat seeking missile it seems to find us and destroy whatever sense of safety and security we have built. I will refer to trauma as “the event” from here on out and the real problem comes in trying to heal. The main reason is because, humans are social creatures and therefore need others to help in healing. Unfortunately, psychologically there are certain animalistic or herd behaviors that are so deeply ingrained -prime responses that we behave out of irrational self preservation. A traumatic event is like playing hot potato to not only the survivor(s) but to the larger group's psyche. The ego only has one function to protect, defend and perpetuate it's own self image. The psyche or Id goes holy shit trauma has occurred in the proximity -will it get me too and then the ego goes hell to the naw, I'm shut that mutha down and I'm a shut it out and I will never even let you hear that it's a possibility- chill I got this. Now as a survivor if you go to your friend and say I need help to heal, this is the event. That person's ego has already made this promise between their id and ego. The reaction will be rejection. This manifests often in these two ways:

A) In an event where the situation is active; a person is hurting others- the tendency is to try blame the person(s) for a perceived or identifiable weakness (anything we can find that identifies that person as different from ourselves), silence (so we can abdicate our responsibilities as a group member without shame or guilt) and/or ignore (the acuteness of the pain being caused because we may already be sensitized or previously exposed and don't want to accept further psychic damage to ourselves) and therefore don't act to stop the event or worst pile on. These behaviors are ego protective induced fear responses. 

B) After the occurrence of the event and a person is trying to heal by reaching out for help they will often experience: Apathy (be told well the event happened to you and now that's what you are; More than likely the event will just keep happening to you now. There's nothing you can do. It's all over now- accept it.) This is usually followed very quickly by rejection sometimes with a qualifier. (I can't listen to this! If you don't shut up and get over it we can't have a relationship. Sure it was bad but you're still here, it could always be worst!) And my least favorite, I am trying to help you but this is costing me so much- I use to be so carefree and now you're bringing the bummer brigade down on my formerly happy little world. I mean, there are other things in life! These behaviors are ego protective induced fear responses. 

The complication is that humans are about society and community and love. The people in your life want to love you but people have to understand healing doesn't occur in a bubble. What have we been talking about? Love is work. The event, whether death, rape, violence, financial instability, health problems or some other calamity really is like the ring in Lord of The Rings, it shows you how people really value their relationship to you. To heal requires a strength of will because you have to advocate for yourself. You have to be patient but persistent with those around you. You have to sometimes field the fear, resentment and anger and show that you can accept that they aren't perfect but they are still qualified to help you. We have to confront the weaknesses in yourselves and in others, the very thing we all try so hard to pretend doesn't exist. We have this fantasy that if we are perceived as strong nothing will ever dare test our resolve. I have to tell you as someone who has worked many years as a security guard, in reality the visibly tough looking security guards are the ones who get tested the most. 

Pop quiz hot shot. Now you know we're going to explore the theme of healing and fear through the rose colored glasses of pop culture.  I bet you know where I'm going to pull from? Umm yes, the eighties! I am of course, baby Gen X reporting for duty. Gen X and Silent Generation share the distinction of being post or near post-war babies born in-between cataclysmic shifts in our respective societies and world that we didn't actually participate in. What separates us Gen X'ers from the Silent Generation then? Well, while the Greatest Generation sacrifice was a net positive and big win for the ideals even if not necessarily the reality of the U.S. Identity as moral, familial and a union - Baby Boomers found after their sacrifice of their youth to be losers-mind- to no fault of their own really. Vietnam destroyed our belief in our military as a moral and superior agent of peace. Our politicians became celebrities and lost their nobility. Baby Boomers discovered you fight the good fight but just end up broke and over corrected their way into dangerous and destructive greedy wealth accumulation and dissipation. While the women's lib, civil rights and later in the generation LGBTQ battles made significant and unprecedented changes- they also can't be marked under mission accomplished. These fights continues on. What I am saying is that Baby Boomers were a uniquely traumatized within the context of the U.S. Philosophy and Myth generation.  And also remember I had a Silent Generation father, I know what Baby Boomers were taught and what they weren't taught; Which was how to cope (manage fear) and how to heal (together). Lastly remember, I was raised by MTV, I learned how to live not from either of these two generations but from older Gen X'ers and my own peers. My Silent Dad was just like don't die and sssshhhhh. 

Life requires regardless of any other factors, just as is - an incredible amount of bravery. Now, you should understand fear is not in and of itself the enemy. Fear is a necessary and helpful emotional response that you can find yourself in just as much trouble if you disregard. Fear is also an incredibly easy to induce and manipulate emotion. You see for example, there's something all of us women share regardless of socioeconomic, racial, class or age factors. You will or have or currently possibly are menstruating. You might not be regular, but somewhere between 28 days or so and for a large percentage of your life - you betcha. I have and have always had incredibly painful and heavy menstrual cramps. I shake, I sweat and I puke. And you see right there, your response is an irrational fear response guys! While my experience may be difficult, it is still a perfectly natural biological process that we all as adults and humans understand takes place. Now men, you know perfectly well that acknowledging menstruation will not induce you to menstruate, right? You don't have a uterus. What are you responding to? Data in exclusion to information. Why have I shared this? Because I am trying to demonstrate the difference between men and women in how they deal with fear. What I am actually talking about is pain. Men are distinctly afraid of pain in a way women are not. As a woman, this one event is a guaranteed once a month (even if not every month) proving ground on how to manage pain. I can not afford to fear this process because I still have go to work and fulfill whatever other obligations I am committed to. 

What happens when we are afraid? It's a chemical reaction to stimulation that induces one of either two neural pathways determining either a fight or flight response. I personally would make a case for including a freeze response. What is the determining factor in which one you will chose- pain. I often find as a woman, when I most need a man's help he will refuse and when I don't really need the help he falls all over himself to offer his help. Pain. Men see pain as something that can be avoided whereas women accept that there will be pain and hope to lessen the experience of it.  That's why it's especially hard to help men who experience trauma because they are so much more afraid of pain. The fear is inducing the fight or flight response internally or against themselves. The ego can not fight itself. The ego can be broken down and/or rebuilt which is also very difficult and upsetting events but this one thing it simply can not and will not do, instead the ego will induce a suicide response. For men, to save their life they will carry trauma regardless of this basic truth, you simply must heal in order to live not just survive. I am going to hit this point hard, let me write it another way because I'm not sure if you heard her right the first time she said it. Man, woman or child, Beyonce said, “Slay trick or you get eliminated.” Life will continue on as long as you wake up every day but it's a trick to believe you can just go; “I'm strong! I put that trauma in a box and put it away and why can't everyone else? Nope, everyone else is just weak and that's why they want to keep talking about things that keeps reminding me of that trauma box I thought I had almost forgotten about...” You must confront trauma in order to heal, there is no other way but through. Understand this because it is critically important, it becomes harder not easier with the passage of time to confront trauma because the fear grows. 

Women you will have to learn to advocate for yourself. So much of being a woman is based in a social construct of being available to facilitate what others need you to be in relation to themselves. Sometimes in the name of peace, love or request we allow ourselves to be mirrors instead of unique, differentiated individuals. Clearly, relationships you have of this variety which you may not even be conscious of will be the first to go. That's why rape is so especially debilitating because most women process by committee. You get cut off at the knees. Hot potato. That's also why it is so important to keep de-stigmatizing sexual assault by talking about it, dealing with it and challenging ourselves and each other. We are made to stand together in good times but also and especially in bad, that's the responsibility of membership in the human family. Healing is hard because it's an internalized process but not just for the survivor but for those who love and care about the survivor as well. There is psychic damage. There is a loss of innocence. There is a sense of vulnerability and weakness. The ripping away of the veil of safety and security. It can feel insurmountable when you're in the thick of it. But you have to have faith in such moments that there is a way out and you will find it if you look for it. Let's see what a Nightmare On Elm St. can teach us about fear and healing.

Yes, A Nightmare On Elm St.


Chill this is not a film review. First, the question is what are we doing here? What is the meaning of life? I write about purpose well what is the purpose of suffering, fear, death and destruction? I'm the judge aka leader. I'm not very leader-y about my judgeship. Why? My theory is because the old ways are being cast aside. God is trying to bring us all back together again. And I do mean ALL. I think the differences in religion, sexuality, race and gender should be an obvious clue. Humanity is the only creation under God that was given free will. We are supposed to be shepherds of all under our domain, our dear Earth, this planet and each other. You do know that more than likely angels aren't the cute little cherubs popular in our imaginations. Cherubim angels have cloven feet and four heads, one a man's, one's an ox, one's an eagle and one's a lion. If you got a problem with someone being black and want to kill them for their physical appearance I don't know what you going do with that- I just know you ain't going to win that match-up!

 As I have said before, we all stand here and now stand for all who have come and who will ever be. I believe that each one of us here stand for our various family lines. There's a statement I want to bring up, John 20:16 “So the last will be first, and the first will be last.”... that those who come at the end shall inherit as fair a share as those that were there from the very beginning.  What is the stand? It's humanity undertaking The Passion. Jesus Christ came and showed us how it is done and now it's our turn to show what we've learned. There's a certain phenomenon I will call psychic damage inheritance. There's certain themes that seem to repeat specific to one's family. There's families who entire or most of the males have served in the military.  There's families where all the women are exceptionally skilled at arts and crafts. There's families where man or woman they are incorrigible flirts. I didn't want to focus on negative traits, but, there's a possibility this occurs because each subsequent generations job has been to try to correct, refine or redeem various elements of the family line until right here and right now. Where we are now has given us the unique skills and character to stand for our individual family lines and humanity as a whole. Trauma informs this. Faith ensures that we believe that all that God has promised us will be realized. I'm saying what we have lost will be restored. WHAT WE HAVE LOST IN THIS LIFE WILL BE RESTORED. 

O.k. I am going to reference A Nightmare on Elm St. to the Dream Child installment. I'm leaving out Freddy's Dead even though it is a very personal favorite of mine because I need to stay on topic. I believe Robert Englund has said that his interpretation of the character, Freddy Krueger, is that he is the epitome or personification of adult neglect and how it can effect children and young adults fatally. It truly is an exceptional meditation on the themes of the cost of responsibility children inherit from the decisions and debts of their parents. A truthful if surreal depiction of how various persons deal with and  are vulnerable/susceptible to fear. A time capsule of the psychic animus and challenges of the eighties. And even though I don't think it has ever been critically analyzed a strange sort of how to guide to healing. Let me explain. 

Freddy Krueger, our villain

Freddy Krueger (remember what we're talking about here—m'kay) starts off as more of a fantastical night stalker and evolves into a wise cracking even quite personable killer who tailor fits the nightmare to the idiosyncrasies and quirks of his victims. With each installment or generation (if you will) he adapts to exploit that age's particular fear. Check. Freddy Krueger is most effective when he is able to isolate his mark, by either those in his grasp trying to pretend their experiences aren't real and not speaking out. Or not believing in each other or not believing in themselves. Umm hmm. Their parents, don't tell them what they've done or who he is. Many die in the dark.  Freddy Krueger likes the rules, knows the rules and wants you to follow the rules in his domain but our heroes are not helpless. He is eternal. Each movie is just a battle but he is always trying to win the war. 

Dream Masters and Dream Warriors, our heroes

In The Nightmare on Elm St. franchise there are whom I would deem three dream masters represented and then dream warriors. In my personal opinion, Nancy, Jesse and Alice are the dream masters. And of course, Kristen, Phillip, Kincaid, Jennifer, Will, Taryn and Joey are our dream warriors. I swear I am not reviewing the movies, but if the question is how to heal or maybe really why one should take on the work of healing – that's how they beat Freddy (hem hem). They learn to overcome their individual fear(s) in the face of acute and exceptional trauma and assume their rightful power. On the other side of fear is mastery. You can not prevent fear and should never fear fear. You must learn how to cope. You must also understand, everyone has their weaknesses. That's why it's fear itself you must confront and not what makes you afraid necessarily. Once you learn how to heal, you won't fear being afraid. Which is different than trying to avoid fear. 

How to heal: Nancy Thompson

How does Nancy defeat Krueger in the first installment. Nancy is Gen X old guard. Her parents are shell shocked, separated, angry and hopeless, but they love her truly. In their love they eventually tell her the truth and she uses the truth to fight. She knows herself and uses her anger to fuel her battle. Nancy is terrified but determined. With her understanding of the conventions and rules she devises a plan to subvert Krueger's rules and lays traps to take him on in her own (the physical) world. She masters herself by coping with her fear. She takes the power back. She eventually relies on medication to prevent REM dreaming and escapes Krueger. 

Interestingly enough in the third installment, Nancy defeats Krueger even though she dies by passing on her skills by encouraging and nurturing learning amongst the dream warriors. By Nancy saying, I believe you to Kristen and later to the rest of the remaining Elm St. kids; She short tracks the dream warriors road to healing. That's also why Krueger's kill count is the fastest in the series. He rushes to knock them out before they become empowered. Unlike Nancy in the first installment they are not ready for their battle but they choose to accept the match and work together. Also, “the adults” Nancy's father and Dr. Neil Gordon fight against Freddy in the physical world. 

How to heal: Jesse

Freddy's Revenge, is amazing to me. I am going to classify Jesse as a dream master but he does not master himself. Jesse is afraid of himself, his sexuality and his transfer from childhood to adulthood. Jesse is a dream master because he did the most important thing you can do and should do - he learned to identify someone dependable and reliable and asked for help. Jesse actually loses to Freddy and is overwhelmed and taken by Krueger but is saved by the bravery of his girlfriend Lisa. He accepts his weakness, but doing so doesn't close his heart instead it expands. There are many different ways to fight. There is no male or female way to fight, there is just choices and decisions. 

How to heal: Alice

Alice is both the definitive and titular Dream Master. Alice goes further than all others before her. Battling Freddy on his home turf in his dream (spiritual) world, a church, between the gateways of good and bad dreams. Alice becomes more of an avatar by her battle than just herself. She carries the powers of the fallen within her and is battling to set their souls free. Alice is not just the master of herself but becomes the master of the gateway. She does this by accepting herself just as she is. Though she defeats Freddy he remains secretly biding his time until circumstances and events provide him with an advantage.

The Dream Child makes an important notation to Alice. She is made vulnerable again when she becomes pregnant. But she doesn't lose her power because she has learned how to cope and adjusts. She accepts her changed role to mother and receives help from Krueger's mother. Alice is overwhelmed but saved by her unborn son and the spirit of Krueger's mother. 

A final thought on the discussion. As human beings, it's very hard to learn without some sort of example to imprint from. It's very hard to be brave if you don't see bravery. It's very hard to heal because it isn't something you can see without intimate observation. Which I think warrants a discussion of the topic of loyalty. Loyalty is the exchange of trust and acceptance for responsibility and consideration. If all four isn't present then that's you're experiencing exploitation or malfeasance. Think of healing as an investment in your future. Invest wisely. There is nothing more edifying than the structure and stability of familiarity but sometimes as painful as it is experiencing an event provides the opportunity to clear the board and reset the game in a way more beneficial to you. There's no such thing as a bad friend, bad parent, bad teacher, bad cop, bad politician or bad whatever. I suggest you call that person exactly what they are and do what you need to do to set yourself free.",24Mar2018,1

29,"My local little Caesars pizza moved to another location. I never went there often before it moved. Maybe once every four months or so. Well, I've been there a few times after they moved and they keep the  dipping sauces behind the counter (under it) in a box. Completely out of view. Instead of on the counter in a little holder like they used to. I thought they didnt offer them anymore so I never bothered buying one. I sometimes buy the jalepeno cheese one to dip my pizza into.

30,"I oppose any regulation on firearms which:

* inconveniences, criminalizes, and/or endangers law-abiding gun owners,
* while criminals can ignore it, with no benefit to public safety.

I think this is a reasonable position to hold. Firearm regulations should have some benefit to public safety. If they do not then it is legislation for the sake of legislation, and people attempting to make their fears and feelings a matter of public policy. We have a right to real safety, not perceived safety.

Here is a simple example. In Canada, where I live, you need a permit to transport a restricted firearm (a legal classification comprising most handguns, and a few rifles like the AR15 because they look scary) anywhere but a few common places like gun ranges. Does this inconvenience and criminalize law-abiding gun owners? Yes, because you need permission from the government to take your gun to your friend's house, something that hurts no one, and you can be sent to prison for forgetting a piece of paper. Can criminals ignore it, with no benefit to public safety? Absolutely; if a gangster wants to shoot someone they will not ask for a permit. Thus we can conclude that this regulation should be thrown out.

Let's apply these criteria to a few common firearm regulations.

### Registration.

In itself this is not terrible, but its consequences are. Too often, people register legal firearms, only to have them declared illegal and confiscated because the government knew exactly who had them. This results in guns being taken from law-abiding citizens who are willing to tell the government what guns they own. Criminals are not so nice.

### Magazine capacity restrictions.

The reason I need 30 rounds is my self-defense tools should have their full potential. No one will ever complain of having too many rounds in a gunfight. If I die because 10 rounds weren't enough to stop my attacker(s), that is an example of gun laws making me less safe. See [this video by Colion Noir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQiVBvy0m0) and [this other video by him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgGj5lBBaWI) for more. Endangerment to gun owners: check.

Did you know that, in most cases, low-capacity magazines are adapted from a standard magazine by drilling a rivet into the side? You can easily take that rivet out and restore the magazine to its original status! Naturally, your response is ""ban all magazines greater than *x* rounds from import and confiscate existing ones"". In the past this might have worked (ignoring the huge impracticality of door-to-door confiscation), but now you can 3D print magazines. And of course, a criminal will not reconsider a mass shooting because high-capacity magazines are illegal. If criminals can get illegal guns, do you think they can't get illegal magazines? Easily ignored by criminals: huge check.

### Banning the carrying of firearms.

The vast majority of countries ban civilians from carrying firearms, issuing permits to do so only when one's life is in danger. [I did my research, and found only seven countries besides the United States that allow it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CCW/comments/7pmv8t/other_countries_that_allow_civilian_concealed/) This ignores that [concealed carriers kill at a much lower rate than the police](https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/01/new-york-times-concealed-handgun-crime-numbers-are-bogus/). Mass shootings are not committed by people who whip out their defensive pistol. I've covered the reason why this is ineffective for public safety in the introduction; a criminal does not ask for a permit and will carry their gun regardless of the laws.

The police will not always be there for you. They do not prevent crime most of the time, they respond to crime and put an end to it after it has happened. Disarming the populace like this turns them into meek lambs who must submit to a beating/mugging/rape and pray the special armed men save them in time.

This is a clear example of legislation based on feelings. ""Guns are scary, so we must ban them from public places."" All you are doing is removing from public places the guns of people who would protect you, and leaving them in the hands of criminals. By your emotional reactions you have made us *less* safe.

### Banning suppressors (AKA silencers).

I will make this very clear.

* **Suppressors do not make firearms silent.** They reduce a 160-200 dB noise by 35 dB; by comparison, a jet plane taking off is 120 dB. ""Silencer"" is a misnomer.
* **Criminals do not use suppressors.** According to [a 10-year study](http://soundmoderatorscanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Western-Criminology-Review.pdf), only 2 out of 75,000 murder cases involved a suppressor.
* **The suppressor itself is not dangerous.** A criminal would still need a gun to shoot someone.
* **Suppressors are essential for preserving the hearing of shooting enthusiasts.** Many find that their hearing wanes late in life despite using full hearing protection.

Honestly, if you oppose suppressors, you are an idiot. I can't put it any other way. You are uninformed on firearms and should be excluded from the debate.

---

Gun owners take this obstinate stance because gun control is just as obstinate. Once we lose a gun or type of gun to the law, we won't get it back for a very long time if ever. The United Kingdom banned handguns in 1997. Do you think the British government will say ""we made a mistake, people can own handguns again"" in the next century? Gun control is like mold, always taking a little more space, never retreating, until inevitably it has covered the whole food and all guns are banned.",24Mar2018,0

I got very lucky recently and met someone through work who actually works for the very company I've been aspiring to work at since I was a teenager. This connection got me a reference letter and an interview for an amazing position within this company and I couldn't be more excited. I actually got to meet the Vice President of the company just last week and had a great chat with her, I was starstruck! She introduced me to some other important figures within the company and I was so giddy.

Last night it was my sister's birthday. As we do every year, we got absolutely wasted, of course I saw no harm in that - it's my sister's birthday and a Friday night! We went to a bar, got many drinks down, and had a great time. About halfway through the night I was walking to the bar for another drink and who do I see? The Vice President of the aforementioned company along with those other important figures I met having a work event. The VP recognized me and waved to me, so I had to walk (stumble) over to say hi. I didn't want to be awkward so I struck up a conversation, thinking I could suppress my drunkenness, but then I realized that the VP was talking to me like I'm a little kid or like I have something wrong with me, I then realized I was just completely not making sense. I was so embarrassed and I'm still cringing over it.

Hopefully I can still get the job!

33,"i've done some internet research on the concept of trypophobia to find out why commonly used pictures are unsettling even to people who have no corresponding life events.

i have some phobias myself but they all make sense in a biological context, they mainly involve not wanting to deal with any more needles for the rest of my life (because when i was born, extremely prematurely, i was so dehydrated that doctors had such a hard time getting an iv into me to get me fluids that my actual mom, an rn who had given birth moments prior, eventually had to dress them down and make them put the iv in my scalp where the blood vessels would be easier to find). this applies to bees too (i make the connection between stinger and needle).

as far as my deal with phones, that's just because i've had some real bad calls come in from perfectly reasonable customers who nonetheless have a cell phone from 1992 or whatever and i have to try eight times to get them to repeat what they're saying before i can understand a single word.

but trypophobia is nearly universal, i've noticed -- it doesn't need life events to trigger it. the core behind it is the concept that something could be living in those holes. danger insects such as bees and some types of wasps build honeycombs or paper nests with a hexagonal repeating structure. meanwhile, the human botfly will inject its larva into a human, causing substantial pain at every stage in the process, and these sites are a common trigger for trypophobia. 

a related but less-known consideration is the class of trypophobia triggers that simulate an open wound, with a characteristic ""pointy oval"" shape known mathematically as a lens. open wounds are disturbing to any reasonable person, so it makes sense that an image that does not contain one, but contains a bunch of things that look like one (including eyes), would be unsettling for even a normal person.

as i mentioned before, something with many eyes can be a common trypophobia trigger, but it doesn't fall into the danger category, rather it's just unsettling for someone to see that many eyes without the context of a face (see also: description of a seraphim, who ""had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within"" (revelation 6:8, kjv), clearly meant to be unsettling because of the concept of many eyes without matching faces).

there are plenty of trypophobia related pictures that aren't directly caused by these categories above. arguably the whole point of trypophobia is that a nest of dangerous insects is actually a very common appearance in nature -- if you're interested, there's the 100% safe lotus seed pod, which is nonetheless unsettling to look at because it looks like a beehive or a botfly injection site.

in summary, trypophobia is, in my opinion, not irrational, because there are rational reasons to be unsettled by something simulating:

1. a nest of dangerous insects

2. the injection site of botflies

3. eyes where there's no matching face",24Mar2018,5

39,"I am a 25F who lives in France at her parents' ; I have been looking for a job since last November since I got my diploma in political communications. 

I have been dealing with depression for over a year and I go to the therapist twice a week since then. 

All around me, people seem to find happiness and a relative stability : all of my close friends have a very interesting job, that takes up time but that motivates them everyday, from which they get good money.
With a good job and good money, plans for the foreseeable future are easier to make and they're all planning their future with their SO. 

They're mostly all in serious relationship with someone they love and who loves them back. It's insane, I have never seen my friends this happy in love, and don't get me wrong, I am psyched for them. They totally deserve it! 
I don't even care that we get to spend less time together because of this (and their job), because we still maintain an healthy communication line. 
But this seemingly happiness is a painful reminder that I'm not there yet ; not even close, not even in one category. 

Everyone around me, close friends or not, has a lot going on : good health, a committed and healthy relationship, an interesting job, plans for the future.

Meanwhile I am here, I have been looking for a job for five months, I've been to at least 20 interviews, I was even a finalist to my dream job at a very prestigious survey institute in my country.

I am single and I can't see a relationship happening anytime soon for many, personal reasons. The girl I loved is still with her girlfriend, even though she kept telling me she'd break up with her for months. 
I don't even mind being single, but seeing everyone around me in a relationship is making me feel uncomfortable, like a social/peer pressure that tells me I have a hole in my life because I am single or something. 

I am still living at my parents' house and even though I am grateful to have a roof over my head, it's getting crowded. I am now a 25yo only child who has NEVER lived anywhere else besides next to my parents. 
Most of the friends my age are at least planning to leave in the next few months. 

Now, when we talk, they're all sharing this super important new steps they're taking (a loan, a new apartment, a new anniversary trip with their SO, a promotion etc) and I have nothing to say for myself except ""well I had another job interview..."" it makes me feel so lame

I feel alone, lonely, stuck. It's like everyone around me is finding happiness, stability, or at least something to hold on to, something that makes days seem lighter, brighter, while I'm at the same place I was a year ago, two years ago, three years ago. 

What's wrong with me ? 
I went to a prestigious school, I read a lot, I'm a curious, smart girl. I busted my ass through every job interview I went to, I have been to therapy consistently for a year, I'm on antidepressants, I have made drastic changes in my life over the last three years (sleep, food, no social media as it induces a lot of anxiety). 
Why am I still stuck while everyone moves on with their life ? 
Why can't I move ? 
Why am I still there ? 

It's like we're all running track and I can't even get my feet up. they're all so far away from me it's like they're little dots on a line. 


TL;DR : all of the people around me seem very happy with a good job, a committed serious relationship and they all start to plan their future together. Meanwhile, I've been dealing with depression for over a year and I can't seem to move forward with my life. I feel stuck, like everyone is moving on with their lives except me. ",24Mar2018,12

A new girl started in the same school and programme as I last year and she seems to be funny, caring and cool(also she seems to share some of the same interests).

For a long time I wanted to talk with her.

Later on it turns out that she finds me interesting and asked me if I wanted to go out(on Valentines Day :I...). I said ""No, thank you"" and nothing more, which made me feel like an ass. This has hapenned to me before, somehow, but this time it's a bit annoying. Not only because she shares half of my classes but because I feel like we definitely could've been friends.
