2,"I could have been born a Black woman in some other country where I would not have access to the things many Americans take for granted. Such as an education, career opportunities, healthcare, excellent housing, plentiful food, and decent people. 

Sure, there's institutional racism, bigots, crime, etc, but that's all over the world. I have been to Europe several times and I can tell you, I would not want to be a Black woman in any of the countries I visited (other than England). 

Blacks in this country truly don't realize how good they have it. I do, and I damn sure appreciate it. ",04Oct2018,1

5,"So I was walking around those alleyways where I met officer Bertie and it turns out he must live REALLY close to that area because I just bumped into him on my way to the convenience store! He was still in his uniform which is how I recognized him!

I yelled to him *''Hey, officer Bertie!''* and he immediately swung his head to me and gave me a stern frown. I KNEW he was going to play hard to get so I just pranced (literally **PRANCED** like the flamboyantly gay man I am) towards him while he was just standing there with a stink eye. He told me to fuck off and that I'm a stupid dumb ex inmate but he was getting me so turned on. Those giant glasses of his were glinting with angry sadism and I knew shit was about to go down.

I told him that I will continue to worship his thighs. I also told him I shit my bed last night because I was having withdrawl symptoms and had to resort to printing out dozens of naked nerd pictures so I could masturbate myself to sleep, but shit myself due to a combination of blue balls and sensory overload..

I grabbed Bertie's waist and shoved my neck in between his thighs. I demanded that he pull his pants down so I could run my hands down his muscular, hairless thighs that were so pale you'd think they were made of feta cheese. I didn't just want to touch them, I wanted to *smell* them as well.

He let out a yelp as I succeeded in pulling his pants down revealing a set of thick, pasty thighs that looked smoother than a baby dolphin. 

I instantly dove my nose into his inner thigh, and to my surprise (or perhaps lack therof) his thighs smelled like a combination of luxurious vanilla and feta cheese, with a slight *cheddar* aroma! My dick became INSTANTLY errect and I *splooged all over officer Bertie's prison uniform.*

 He then got pissed and ended up *SMOOSHING* my face between his thighs. I still have the bruises on my face! I swear I thought the bones in my face were gonna snap under the pressure! I was almost passed out when he suddenly released me, and I saw him running away in a nerdy manner without his pants on. Apparently he'd abandoned them because my cum got all over them and he's now going to work in a prison in Florida. 

I haven't stopped smelling his pants the moment I got them!",04Oct2018,1

8,"I was playing Morrowind on my computer for what seemed like not too long, but it was likely about 3-4 hours. And even before then, I was still sitting down in my chair doing other things like watching YouTube, etc. After i stood up when I stopped playing, I had worst light headedness that I've ever experienced. 

First, I was leaning against a wall so I wouldn't fall down, and i was beginning to think it was over, so i pushed away and stood up straight, but I immediately figured out it was just getting started. I swear, I must have passed out while i was standing, because I lost control of my fucking legs, and I kept spinning in circles. Meanwhile, I didn't know what i was experiencing and I felt like I wasn't even seeing things with my own two eyes.

After like 5 seconds of uncontrollably spinning, I gain back control, and I just realized I was spinning. I swear, my body must have hit the wall and my desk a few times, because i felt very minor pain on my arms and the back of my head, but I didn't remember hitting anything.

I ask for sex and the dude declines. Always declines. Unless it‚Äôs when he wants it, then I‚Äôm supposed to oblige. 

My ex and I had a completely dead bedroom. But I knew deep down it‚Äôs because I‚Äôd gained weight. 

I just moved in with my LDR boyfriend of a year, and I really expected the first two weeks to be passionate. I expected to have to sit slowly, to be knocked off my feet, to have a Years worth of frustrations released. 

I know now that my expectations were too high. But we‚Äôve had sex twice in two weeks. I just moved in! I expected some kind of honeymoon phase, i honestly expected he wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep his hands off me.

And here I am, I threw away my life to move to his city. It was my own choice, and I wouldn‚Äôt ever hold my decision over his head, but he chose this city for use to close the gap. He could have a little bit of sympathy for my homesickness. 

On Saturday he got crazy mean drunk and walked out on me. He came back at 4am with no idea where he went. But with the other circumstances, I just can‚Äôt help but wonder if there was more he wanted to come back to in this city. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong. I ask him coyly if he wants to come to bed. I‚Äôve asked point blank if he wants to fuck. It has to be me. There has to just be something wrong with me. ",04Oct2018,1
15,"I work at a Dunkin donuts and it's fucking hell. Like it's not that hard, but I tend to only work the register and grab doughnuts for people.

The people aren't the problem, the fucking co workers are. Look I get that I'm not the best looking dude in your group that I've all if a sudden invaded, or I'm that I have stomach issues that require me to go to the bathroom.

Or the fact that I have fucking back problems out the ass and I almost overdose my self on ibuprofen and wear in soles because that's all I can do to stem the pain.

Look, I was never fucking taught how to make a macchiato or one of those fucking frozen drinks you guys always make. And then call me annoying when I'm in fucking pain over the headset when you think I don't hear it.

It really disheartens me and it kind of hurts. Look, I can get that I'm clumsy and can some times come off as annoying, but I don't need to be constantly reminded that I suck.

I can't quit because I already quit my last job and my family doesn't want someone who can't hold down a job. I'm already getting threatened to be booted out if I don't have one.

I actually dread going in tomorrow because I'll have to put up with it again. 

I make mistakes and I'll own up to those mistakes, but when you tell me I shouldn't be drinking a coffee that I clearly made and was clearly allowed to make because I do it during slow hours and then go into a rant about how I'm a shitty worker, then yeah, I'll be annoyed.

Or when you roll your eyes at me for simply being there.

I busted my ass the other day trying to work as hard as I possibly could and they still gave me shit.

I'm sorry for the rant and bad language, but if you have any advice, id be absolutely thrilled to hear it.

17,"I'm not afraid of doing those things. I dread them. 

But when I put my past experience in things when I do things unexpectedly it's not that bad but if I think about them  now I dread them.

I dread hiking a steep hill with dangerous ridges and steps without any safety nets, I would die but yet when I did it, I didn't. I lived just fine. I thought nothing of it, it wasn't scary, it wasn't dreadful. Because I didn't think about its implications of death at the time, I was there to explore and others were doing it with me so I did it and felt invincible and fine.

Now I dread heading to the gym, dread heading to school, dread heading to work but really when I do them, there was nothing to fear or dread of. 

This epiphany just came to me and I feel like an idiot for having put things off for so long. Here's hoping I make it through life fine and the way I want to and not from being directed by what I dread.

18,I was picking my nose when suddenly I noticed the smell of pool water.  This was peculiar because I have not swam in a pool in years and worrisome because the last time I smelled something strange it was because I left the stove on.

19,"I've lived in constant awareness of my mind being read. Rationally, I know that's not true. But it doesn't stop me from self-censoring or burying deeper issues for fear that the day will come when ""they"" come out of hiding, sit me down, and play my most embarassing thoughts in front of my friends and family. Moments too. Not only are they listening, they're watching. Behind closed doors, I act in a way that I wouldn't be embarrassed if people saw me. You can imagine how that would be stifling. 

When I became a teenager, I started developing new fears. I can't stand to have people read my writing, so I write personal notes in Korean. Except when I'm around my friend that can read Korean. Then I write in Japanese. The notes are completely mundane too. ""Math homework."" ""Don't forget to charge your headphones."" Amd when people grab my hand to try to read off of it, my heart rate increases and I feel anxious. I feel the same way about people grabbing my wrists, but for separate reasons. 

As I started college, I developed a fear of people knowing things about me. They might use them as weapons, find my contradictions and expose me. I don't know what I expect to happen if they do, because rational me doesn't try to please people. 

Thank you if you read this far. I haven't been able to share this with my family in any way. And I cant find resources online because I dont know what to call it. ""Paranoia"" doesn't exactly fit, because there's no conspiracy, no people lurking around corners waiting to harm me. Besides that, I have no reason to have paranoia. I'm a 19 year old girl with a pretty normal background. ""Anxiety"" is a slightly better match, but I cant find any mention of people experiencing the same kind of irrational fear and behavior. I'm just lost. What would you call it if it were you? ",04Oct2018,1

24,"I was crazy about this girl. I asked her on a date nearly 3 years ago now. When she said no, she asked to stay friends. I agreed because I just wanted her around. A week later, she stared to date my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who would harass me and physically abuse me. I was afraid of confronting him and loosing her and my other friends. She occasionally told him to lay off me but not often, and I wasn‚Äôt angry because he mistreated her too. But when they started having problems, she‚Äôd compare him to me, such as‚Äúgratefuldeadslayer wouldn‚Äôt have treated me like this‚Äù, which made me more of a target.

She and I stayed friends until I worked up the strength to stick up to the guy. I ended up with all my friends at my side. But she stuck by him. When she texted me saying I ‚Äújust didn‚Äôt understand how he is‚Äù I blew up. I told her that if she really respected herself, she‚Äôd have left him after he cheated. I told her exactly how I thought their relationship would end, by him cheating again and her finally realizing she deserved better. Then I blocked them both on everything. I found out later that when I asked her out all that time ago, she was into me and the other guy, and knew we were both planning to make a move, but she knew she had to choose, so she chose him because he was an athlete and I ‚Äújust‚Äù write music and play guitar.

They‚Äôve been broken up for several months now, and it happened the same way I predicted in that last text, not that that feels good.

I‚Äôm doing really well for myself. I‚Äôve had lots of personal growth. I‚Äôm the one that everyone wants to know. The musician who cares about the people around him. I‚Äôve lost nearly 20 lbs and I get braces next week. Everyone I know looks at me like some kind of invincible leading force. Someone special. I still don‚Äôt see it.

I don‚Äôt think about everything that happened too much, but after seeing a picture of her for the first time in months, I got hit with all this pain. How I shouldn‚Äôt have judged her relationship. How I may never speak to her again. How she must hate me. And that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt see how poorly she‚Äôs treated me, I just wish we could talk it out. I‚Äôve heard countless people say she‚Äôs not worth it, that she was never good to me. But I swear, I felt the connection. Whatever it was, it was real, and now it‚Äôs gone.",04Oct2018,1
26,"Legit nothing but me venting some feels. It's been going on for around two weeks and its eating me up quite a bit.

Due to changing locations of living due to jobs over the last four years, I don't have many friends in town these days, and I separated from my GF of around a year about 3 months ago. It's been weird and there wasnt really emotional closure, but little things have been getting to me.

My main group of online friends just havent been around due to school and work, so I haven't really gotten to talk to any of my friends during the day. Ex calls me just about daily wanting to just talk because she wants to be friends, but I just cant handle it. Too fresh with a lot of confliction for me since I'm the one who broke it off.

The hardest part has been how empty my bed has felt. Even though it was longish distance, so we would only spent physical time once or twice a month, my own bed has felt more and more empty and lonely. I find myself holding a pillow instinctively and curling up next to it almost rocking to sleep. I had some spotty tear sessions on Tuesday and idk why, just thinking about how separated I felt got me going with no warning.

27,"I am a freshman in college. I have been with my current girlfriend for nearly 6 months. I met her through a local meetup for my college and I began to bond with her and soon enough we were dating. In the first few months of knowing her and dating her, I was just completely enamored with her. Prior to her, I was in a relationship that turned terribly toxic and ended with me getting cheated on. 
            

Our relationship really was amazing in my eyes. She really felt like the perfect match for me and I felt so lucky. As our relationship progressed and I got to see her more I got to learn more of her issues. She has suffered through a terrible divorce and that helped bring out many of her mental troubles. I got to see these troubles and I got to trying my best to help. Things were still good but there were some things that we wouldn't bring up due to making her upset. 

One of our biggest issues is our varying levels of love. My girlfriend absolutley is in love with me. I am in love with her, but I just don't think I am capable of the anything close to the feelings that she has for me. She will put me ahead of her in literally everything. She will often neglect her own happiness for me. This is so hard for me because I see her suffering and upset about things and this makes me sad or upset and she just tries to hide it so I'm not upset. 

Recently she has been having lots of issues with socializing with people at our college. We go to a rather large university in the south and we are both from the same state up north. There are a lot of differences in how people are and just life in general. My girlfriend is someone who really does despise drinking and drugs. this was not something I knew at the beginning of the relationship. She struggles because she can't find many people who never drink or go out to party. This is tough at our university, which has a heavy party scene. 

Overall this has somewhat lead to her getting upset and sad, to the point where she has told me she wants to go home. I try to spend as much time with her as I can, but I have been doing better socially and I have many people wanting to see me. I understand that can sound somewhat shallow but I will go over to see her and for the hours that I'm there I am consoling her as she cries about things that she is upset about. The relationship with her has become a bit draining for me. I still love her and when she is happy I am incredibly happy but that is so few and far between. I rarely get that anymore. 

My girlfriend is terrified that she is going to ruin us. I know she is trying so I am trying to help her as much as I can. I just don't know exactly what I want. I don't know if I still really want this relationship. I am unsure If I am just staying in it because I care about her and just want her happy. I don't know if maybe I am looking for a reason out because I want more freedom in my college experience. This could be tied to me developing some feelings for this girl I met at college. These are not feelings I would ever act on but they are there. I don't think its even really the feelings for this individual but the fact that I do have feelings is a bad thing. I want to do the right thing. I don't want my girlfriend unhappy but I want for myself to be happy. I know she has considered transferring because as she puts it I am the only thing making her happy now. This is just so much pressure on me. I want her happy but I can't handle being her happiness. I need her to be able to find it for herself. I just don't know what it is that I really want. I just feel lost and I am constantly trying to figure out what I should do.",04Oct2018,1

In terms of silicon valley culture, everything is 'casual dress', just wear whatever you want but there are still millions of vague, unclear implicit rules. Are distressed jeans ok? Are jeans that are old and naturally worn ok? Are polos too formal? Which brands of hoodies are still 'cool'?   
And then there's this weird arms-race of casualness where people start trying to look homeless in an effort to be more and more 'casual'. It's bizarre, and a lot to keep up with. At least on the east-coast I wore anything with a collar, and I could say I've dressed appropriately for work.

47,"I'm 22 years old and recently graduated from a well-respected university with a Bachelors degree. I've always struggled to figure out what direction I wanted to take following graduation, and I'm afraid I've made no progress. My degree doesn't qualify me for much (global studies) and most job listings I find that I'm interested in, I don't seem qualified for. Most of those listings are for basic marketing jobs that I feel I can perform in, however I'm not all that excited about. The vast majority of jobs I apply for, I never hear back. And if I do, I discover via research that the company is a scam or a terrible place to work.

That is certainly an option, but I still don't know what masters program I would want to apply to, considering I don't know what type of job I want in the end.

I had an appendix surgery a few months ago and in a 'world first' the surgeons operated on a patient using no water based products. Top immunologists have diagnosed me with an allergy to the water molecule. Not to things IN the water but to H2O itself. My immune cells (mast cells) see H2O molecules as foreign, in the same way a person allergic to peanuts has immune cells that go beserk if they see peanut proteins. I have to carry epi pens on me 24/7 in case say a drop of rain lands in my mouth, or I accidentally eat something that has bits of water in it.

I'm currently writing a book about my life struggles, entitled ''It's Only Water''. I've been writing it since I was 10 years old and I'm 32 now. Still looking for publishers.

BTW, I know people are gonna ask, ''what do you drink?'' I drink a special substitute mixture made of pure orange juice and whole milk.

55,"So yeah. As the title says, my mom has the genetic disorder known as Huntington's Disease. As it is a genetic disorder, it is hereditary. Meaning I have a 100% chance of carrying the gene and a 50% chance of the symptoms popping up. My mom has been dealing with HD for about 10 years now, only the last 4 have gotten significantly worse, to the point of me having to quit my job and stay at home full time to help my dad provide for her. I am 24 years old, male, and will be 25 in November. I've been helping take care of my mom for the last 3 years as it has been increasingly difficult for my dad to take care of her.  My mom is 48 and my dad is 58. Huntington's disease can strike at any time in your life and it happened that my mom's symptoms were dormant for 30+ years but have fully manifested now.   


She went from a healthy weight of maybe 150lbs to only being maybe 90lbs in the span of 3 years. She is slowly losing motor functions and has become increasingly more and more difficult to handle on our own. We've talked about nursing/retirement homes, but I honestly can't stand the thought of leaving her in one of those places.  I know that not every single 'home' is bad but at the same time, I feel like I hear so much shit about shit going down in nursing homes that I would be more worried about her being there than at home with me. 

However; due to the nature of the disease and the fact that there is no cure as of yet, there will come a time where I have to bite the bullet and put her in a nursing home. That is clear to me, but I don't have to like it. 

For the last few years things have been stable enough. My dad had a decent job as a golf course superintendant, while I worked at the same golf course, on the inside as staff of the country club. That is until May of this year. 

In May of 2018 I quit my job of 3 years to stay at home to help take care of my mom. It was at this time that she began to rapidly decrease in physical and mental health. During the months of May, June, July, and most of August, I was the sole provider of care for my mom. My dad had a job in a city 120 miles away.  He had a job closer to home, but an opportunity that seemed to good to let go came up and thats how he got the job further away. It paid better, had more benefits, and was closer to his hometown growing up. All seemed well.  Not even 80 days after getting the job he is given the option to quit or be fired because of in-house troubles at the country club. Rumors fly as to why he was let go, those rumors spread fast in a small area, where we are from. 

Now, it is October 2018 and my dad has been jobless for 3 months and I have been jobless since May.  My mom does get SSI but it's only $1000 a month. 

We have put in dozens of applications in various states relatively close to where we live, in the hopes of my dad getting a new job, but nothing has turned out for us. 

It seems like we are in the worst rough patch we've faced and it all seems to be too much at times. Both my dad and I jokingly say when asked for dinner that ""tide pods and bleach sounds great.""  I know that I would never kill myself and I'd like to think that my dad wouldn't either but the stress of having to take care of not only my mom but the family is weighing on both of us heavily. 

I have a sister and a brother. My sister is younger than me and currently attending her last year of college. She has said multiple times that she would drop out to come home and help and each time I tell her that I can handle it and she needs to graduate.  My brother is older than me by a few years but he hasn't been any real help.  I insisted on him moving in with us, when he was in trouble of his own, and in repayment he stole pills from my mom and many other random items such as my DS and a few other non-essential items. 

Basically it's been just me and my dad taking care of my disabled mom for the last few years and only recently has it become to difficult I felt the need to come here and just vent. 

I'm not sure if this is the proper place to post this sort of stuff, if it isn't feel free to do what you need to do mods. 

I need some help. Any kind of help. 

I am not religious, so please, don't ask to pray for me, or bring up god or the devil or demons or other bs like that.

I have no problem whatsoever with you believing in whatever you'd like to believe in, but I do not believe and I would appreciate not having people say that the devil has control over my mom or some shit like that. As crazy as it is, there has been some who have seen us out in public and came forward saying that they'll pray for us and that the devil is weak in gods land and shit like that. And that's fine if they want to believe that, but after living with someone who has Huntington's Disease and knowing that I have a chance of showing symptoms, as well as my sister or my brother or his daughter, my niece, showing symptoms of this awful disease. It burns me up inside when people say anything about god giving us only what we can handle or other apologetic type stuff. Again, you're free to believe whatever you like, just my thoughts on the matter.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to get on a rant about religion so I'll stop there. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:  My mom has Huntington's Disease, I don't have a job, my dad lost his job, and we're living off a credit card hoping that someday we'll hear back from any of the places we applied for jobs. Not asking for handouts or anything just needed a place to vent and to get this off my chest. Thank you for taking the time to read this. ",04Oct2018,1

69,"So I live in a smallish city (200k metro area), and our public transit isn't great, and we're getting a lot of sprawl from low-density housing. The prevailing opinion here is that living in apartments is for students, poor people, and short-term living while finding a house with a nice big yard. So we have a lot of suburbs, and while the apartments are there around downtown and other nice places, they're usually filled with recent transplants, young professionals, people who haven't settled down, etc. People who use the bus are considered young, poor, students, etc. so having your own car is a big deal. I even get some flak for biking two miles to work instead of driving.

As a result, our public transit is hard to do because there's too few people in too big of a space to make it efficient.

So if you live in a place where the housing is more dense, which I would assume means more apartments/condos, is there a stigma to people who live in apartments or use public transit? Is living in an apartment longer, even into middle age or older, a big deal?",04Oct2018,1
70,"So basically to cut a very long story short I had a massive thing for my best friend for about a year. Despite her having a boyfriend I always felt like things could have been more, and I still really do think under different circumstances something might have happened between us. While I felt like a complete dick for putting her in that situation, I eventually told her how I feel. She was super nice about it, but also said that we probably should distance ourselves from each other cause her boyfriend was her first priority. I agreed fully, cause there was no way I could get over her with how close we were. We didn‚Äôt talk for months, which was so fucking hard, but one day she messaged me saying she missed me a shit ton and she‚Äôs sorry for how things ended between us. I told her not to worry about it, and we started talking again. She told me she was splitting up with her boyfriend, and cause I still had feelings for her at this point, I got my hopes up and thought maybe she‚Äôd changed her mind. I still don‚Äôt know if she did reach out to me at that moment because I was her backup plan after her break up or if she just needed a friend, but it doesn‚Äôt really matter cause she got back with her boyfriend anyway. At this point I still liked her, and while we were kinda friends again that whole scenario made me realise I had to still be careful about limiting how much we talk. That being said, my feelings were bit more manageable and I was able to talk to her a little here and there while still getting over her.

It‚Äôs been like half a year since we started talking again, and while I think I‚Äôll always have a little soft spot for her, I‚Äôm pretty much over her. I‚Äôve had crushes here and there on girls who aren‚Äôt her, which would have seemed impossible to me before, and I can see a lot of flaws in her and things that annoy me about her that I was completely blinded to before. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm still happy she‚Äôs in my life, I‚Äôm just not completely head over heels for her like I was one time. Things have generally been pretty good between us too, and while we‚Äôve never brought up how I feel again, we still talk a lot and things aren‚Äôt awkward between us. It‚Äôs always hanging over us a little though, like I can‚Äôt see us ever being quite as close as before without some questions being asked. I think we‚Äôre both kinda trying to keep a respectable distance, we‚Äôre good friends still though.

So about a week ago we were hanging out and I told her about this girl I have a bit of a thing for and wanted her advice on what to do, etc. like friends tend to do. I genuinely did want her advice, and a girl‚Äôs input makes a difference from the generic advice my guy pals would give me, but I was also kinda trying to tell her subtly that I‚Äôm over her, and that she doesn‚Äôt have to worry about that anymore. 

After that conversation she didn‚Äôt talk to me all week. At first I didn‚Äôt even really notice, but when I tried to talk to her she would just hit me with one word replies, or outright ignore me. I walked by her at college one day and she just completely blanked me. I can tell when she‚Äôs in a weird mood about something, and there was definitely something up. I feel like just by mentioning me liking another girl she‚Äôs got a little jealous or something, which is just bizarre really. Even if she does have more feelings going on on her end than she‚Äôs letting on, she has a fucking boyfriend and we‚Äôve agreed to just be friends. If I can manage my emotions without treating her like shit surely she can do the same. I feel like it‚Äôs pretty shitty to just give me the cold shoulder cause I‚Äôm moving on with my life. I decided to just not contact her for a bit, and after a few days she ended up messaging me while she was out drunk. Nothing too wild, just her talking shit, but it just feels a little weird to me she‚Äôs been blanking me all the time and is only now messaging me when she‚Äôs drunk. Like doesn‚Äôt that suggest that she‚Äôs trying not to talk to me for some reason sober and just can‚Äôt help herself when her guard is down? It‚Äôs just really odd.

Honestly I‚Äôm trying not to think about it too much. I have far more shit going on in my life than just her, but she‚Äôs just acting so weird recently that I had to get a second opinion. Anyone able to shed some light on what‚Äôs maybe going on in her head? I really do want to be friends with her cause at our best I don‚Äôt think I have a better friend in my life, but it feels like we have a lot of shit still left unsaid and unresolved between us and I think until we address it (which is probably too hard to do) shit like this is always gonna happen. 

**TL;DR:** Used to like my friend. I told her how I feel, we stopped talking while I got over her. Now we‚Äôre kind back to normal, but when I told her I have a thing for some other girl, she started blanking me and only messaged me once she was drunk. Why the hell is she acting so weird.

71,"So a little background. I have two long term health conditions- one I will have for the rest of my life as it‚Äôs genetic and there is no cure. One causes ongoing pain, fatigue, stomach issues, dislocations and can cause muscle and organ prolapse. I‚Äôve pretty much been told that if I don‚Äôt look after myself I will be wheelchair bound. The other causes blackouts, fainting, sickness and headaches. I‚Äôm legally disabled. To put it bluntly, I‚Äôm always in pain and I‚Äôm always tired.

Now I don‚Äôt want this to hold me back- so I put my all into my job. I‚Äôm working 40 plus hours every week (full time in my country is 37.5) and I physically cannot do it anymore. The lack of support from my job and the amount of work they expect from me is making me physically ill. I honestly don‚Äôt think someone who was well could cope. I get in work for 6am, a few days a week I don‚Äôt even get a break and I leave at 4pm and go straight to bed. I don‚Äôt have the will power to eat or shower. I barely exist.

I genuinely believe I‚Äôm becoming depressed. Lately I‚Äôve been having thoughts when crossing the road that I would rather the car speed up instead of slow down or hope I get into an accident on my way to work so I don‚Äôt have to go. I cry there on a daily basis and constantly feel like I can‚Äôt do anything right. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs linked to how I feel about my illness but I feel like I‚Äôm being swallowed.

It blew up today- with problems I‚Äôm having with my doctors office- I just burst and couldn‚Äôt stop crying. My partner had to pick me up from work. Besides being upset I felt physically sick and drained. I don‚Äôt want to go back.
