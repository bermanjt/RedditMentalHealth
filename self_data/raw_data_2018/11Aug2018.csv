2,I finished college last year and decided to stick around at my maintenance job. The pay wasn’t great but it never felt like I was working. I loved what I did and loved who I worked with. I start my new job Monday in the public sector. Everyone was sad to see me go and the fact of me actually leaving has finally hit me. Bittersweet I guess. ,11Aug2018,2
4,"I havent posted in two weeks after some stuff happened in my life. But things so far are getting better. There is some interesting stuff coming up in the future. But what surprised me the most from leaving Reddit was.......

I was more happier. I felt better, more confident, less negative by not using Reddit. I believe thats a testament to how people act on this site.

In the past I used to comment about 400 times a day. Thats not happening anymore. But I will be in a few comment threads here and there along the way. 

So maybe everyone should try logging off of Reddit for a few weeks and see if they are more positive and have more energy. ",11Aug2018,10

6,"So my wife just gave birth to our son after struggling through 3hr and 15 min of pushing and finally getting a C-section. We were at the hospital from 3am at 2cm 8/9 went home and came back at 7pm until she was fully dilated at 7:00 am 8/10 though they didn't check her until 7:15. (She was at 9 cm from 5:35 until 6:35 so I'm pretty sure she was fully dilated by then) There was a shift change at 7 am so we couldn't get the doctor we wanted.

The doctor who checked us at 7:15 told us we had to wait for another doctor to come and it would be shortly and walks out. My wife was having contractions every minute or two by then. We asked the nurse where's our doctor and if my wife could push. They told us the doctor is on her way with no ETA. The other doctor was helping someone  push and couldn't help us. The nurse said the doctor on the way didn't want my wife to push. We felt we missed a golden opportunity to push and really regret listening to the nurse and doctor as she was drained completely by those contractions. We didn't start pushing until 8:02 am without the doctor. Our doctor didn't arrive until 8:45am and by then she criticized my wife's lack of energy to push and lack of progress, refused to let us do a vacuum and kept her pushing for 3hrs before trying to vac, leading to a C-section. The doctor was not there for the majority of the pushing anyway, though she did a good job on the surgery...

We felt neglected, abused emotionally and physically. The nurse was so helpful, but felt her hand was tied by the doctor. Even told us to ignore the doctor's rough comments. 

We are still pissed at the doctor for being an hour and 30 min late while being on call and dealing with us in that way.

 What can we do about our situation so it can be known and won't happen to anyone else?

10,"I don’t know why, but I just go through times where I believe the weirdest things. I told my best friend today that the reason I only ate dark chocolate almonds and green tea for three months a few years ago was because I thought I had a brain tumor and I would die if I didn’t. Which I know logically is not true, but it feels like it was true and now is not. I do it all the time apparently. She said she had noticed I do this but doesn’t ever bring it up because it’s not worth upsetting me. Like how I thought I had an autoimmune disease for almost a year. It was really embarrassing and I’ve thought about bringing this up with my psych but I don’t want to just be thinking that I’m delusional when I’m really not if that makes sense. Like I wouldn’t say I believed I was put into a different body very similar to my real one because like I might realize that it’s not really happening. I don’t know.

33,"I hope this is the right sub for this. If not, tell me, I have been looking but this seemed best. I need some advice. Or at least, I really need to drop my story. It's a long read. 

Some backstory: I'm a 20y/o(m). More than a year ago, I came out of an unhealthy relationship with suicidal, depressed girl. That has left marks on me, and two months ago, I had to stop with my semester due to a burnout. The GP concluded there was a beginning burnout indeed, and some signs of depression. I didn't buy the depression part until like everyone I talk to (I'm an introvert programming student, so that's not too many people) agreed on it. 

Then there is this girl. When I broke up, and during the 6 months of constant problems before that, she was one of the closest - if not the closest - friends I had, and helped me a lot. I talked with her quite a lot, and I enjoyed the attention I got from her. My now-ex might have been kinda over attached, which left a large attention gap for me. I noticed I started to get a lot of meaning out of the relationship that was growing with this friend, even though I initially wanted to dispose it as a rebound. This girl was pretty, and quite popular as well, so I knew I did not even have to try anything, also fearing that this bond would be ended if I brought it up so soon. On top of that, a friend of mine hinted that he liked her, but a week later she messaged me that she had told him she wouldn't date him. I was confused, why would she tell me this? Taunting me, or just because he probably told her that I knew? 

It only got worse, as in, I started to like her more and more and she could easily make me happy with things she said, which was a pretty big thing given my depressed state of mind at that point. Yet the closer we got, the more I felt I had to lose if the talk went wrong. 

Not directly related, but I had a difficult decision to make about accepting a time consuming but prestigious position that would allow me to pursue some ambitions, or not. Downside being that I am still recovering a bit from the burnout. Everyone I spoke to was positive however and think I am capable of it, though probably many of them didn't know of my situation. The only one saying that I shouldn't, was she. 

So that has been going on for more than a year now. At this moment, I am on my way home from a holiday with a rather large group of people, most of them some sort of friends, a few really good friends, amongst whom this girl, and my best friend, who happens to be my roommate.

At a certain moment, me and her had an individual talk about something I still had to tell her. After a certain question, I don't remember it, the honest answer would trigger 'the talk' and reveal everything. So while she thought I was thinking what to say, I was thinking whether I was gonna tell her. Surprise, I didn't. I told her I didn't know, and she seemed to buy it. 

A few days ago, I noticed that my best friend and this girl were suddenly kinda sticking together a lot. They know each other as long as I know them, but didn't ever get along before. Now, me and my friend have a habit of sharing what he calls our 'projects', and thus he kind of knew my situation. Last I knew about him was he was still into a girl he tried to date before, and it happens she was there as well. When asking him about it, he said there were two new factors. ""two?"" I asked, mimicking breasts with my hands. He laughed, but answered that the factors formed a problem, and that with one of the factors, you would get the other as well. Now this girl had a 'bff' who also was a good friend of ours, so I instantly thought of her, not seeing another option. It did not take long however to realize I was the other factor, the problem, and what he was trying to say.

Later that evening in a pub, I saw him struggle to start talking to me, and he asked the usual question how my project was going. I took him apart, knowing that it was gonna be a difficult talk. He confirmed my fears and all sorts of thoughts spooked through my head. He isn't the most subtle guy while flirting, so I obviously guessed a lot of this already. This talk was like him 'asking permission'. I told him I didn't mind it, if he did. He didn't believe me and continued pushing me. Finally I admitted it would hurt me,  yet that I wouldn't stop him or judge him. That I have had my chance, and knew it wouldn't work anyways, like I told him sometimes before. He asked me if he should try to hide it from me. I answered that it would only hurt more if I found out then, and that I wanted him to talk to me about it. 
Then dick mode turned on, and I told him of some previous guys she'd dated I knew about. (and we both knew them all), I don't know why, maybe to try to convince him to back away or so. 
I also jokingly said he wouldn't manage so this talk was unnecessary

Oh boy.

We went to a disco later that night. At a certain point I needed to take a breath, so I walked out. I found one of my friends smoking there, so I sat next to him. A few minutes later, two people walked by, holding hands, and disappearing behind a shelter. ""Was that.."" ""yup"", completed my friend. They obviously didn't note us. I went back inside, and after a while they returned, apart from each other. He took me apart and told me 'he did it', and they planned some dates. I joined in on the first van leaving to the place we were staying after that, feeling an urge to cry but except from a staggering breath, nothing came out.

I didn't really avoid them on purpose, yet I did not really speak with both of them for two days, until yesterday evening, the last evening. One time I had eye contact with the girl, yet there was a strange, unfamiliar look in her eyes. I also noticed the way she looked at my friend, with a twinkling in her eyes that made me feel jealous.   I had messaged the girl about the hard decision I had to make, that I would do it. Don't know why I suddenly made the decision, but it might have to do with the fact that she advised the opposite. She messaged me quite a lot later that she wanted to talk to me about that, in person, but that she failed to do that before. 
So, my friend asked me if we could talk, and we went for a walk. He told me more details, how they did things the last few days, and that he still felt bad about it because of me. I told him that I had always known there would be a moment that she would get someone, and that I probably wouldn't be that someone. But that it hurt that that someone had to be my best friend, and that I was kind of forced to see it all evolve. I also told him that I wasn't mad at him. That if someone deserved this perfect girl, it would be him. And I try to believe that is true.
I told him that I was not jealous that 'he her', but that 'she him', not knowing how to coin it, but he got it.
He also told me that he had talked with her about me. That she understood it, but had no idea of it. That she saw me as a good friend. That he had convinced her to go talk to me, but that she found that difficult. I scowled in myself. So she knew. I checked the time stamp of her reply to my message, it corresponded with his story. Should have known it was about something else than she said. Suddenly, the unfamiliar look feel into place as well.
I told him - a bit agitated - that I didn't want him to talk to her about this. That the main reason that I never told her, was my fear of having 'the talk', the fear of damaging the friendship we established, if the talk went in the unfavorable direction. But that I now didn't even get a chance for the favorable direction, but still had to have the talk, with all risks involved. He told me that he had to, that I otherwise forced him to choose between us. He probably had a point, I might be too selfish on that one.

She is gone for another week, so it will take a while before we have the possibility to talk, although part of me wants to handle this through messaging, I know that we need to have a face to face talk, in which I have to do a hellish lot of explaining.

So the talk is coming, and I'm afraid of it,and angry on myself. How could I be so stupid never to tell, it only became harder all the time. Oh, how I wish now I gave the honest answer on the question mentioned before. I only have so many people I really consider friends, I don't even need my full hand to count them. I'm afraid of the gap that might be created. Afraid of talking at all. Afraid of looking into her eyes. What should I say? How must I react, how will she react, what do I have to do if it indeed goes wrong? ",11Aug2018,1

So recently my boyfriend was suffering of deep depression. it had a strain on our relationship as I thought he wasent happy anymore and I felt like a pathetic girlfriend. However he just been suffering personally. He began self harming regularly. I didnt feel safe leaving the house as I thought he would relapse. 

One night I went out for an hour and when i came back he hurt himself. (Self harm, suicidal). I felt at an end I was  crying in his arms telling him that I cared deeply for him and I didn't know how to help but I didnt judge him i just wanted to support him through this. With the lights off I began kissing his cuts and telling him how much I loved him. The next morning the deepest cuts were completely healed. (They were quite deep and spread quite far). 

I'm not a skeptical human being. It was overwhelming and I dont believe I healed it. It was just beautiful and powerful. My boyfriend is not depressed he seems happy. He also hasent self harmed since the event. Were overall happy again as a couple. But more importantly him.

Just thought I would share the experience. If you have an ideas where to post it just comment below. I'm not sure if this is the right place. ",11Aug2018,1

I'm embarrassed by admitting this confession. It is a big deal and matters to me because of the Holy Bible. In Genesis Elohim creates a man and a woman as partners for each other.
