1,"I’m frustrated at her behavior, but I can’t ultimately do anything about it. 

My wife works as an IT admin at a large non profit and is responsible for maintaining their cloud services for other offices around the world. 

She has told me plenty of times that she knows that learning new languages and technologies is part of her job, and comes with the field of work. 

When she was out on maternity leave, her company hired a consultant to cover for her while she was away (she took 6 months off).  

While she was gone, this guy busted ass, and implemented cost cutting and time saving ideas.

Part of what he did to solve many of the problems that were ongoing was to use APIs, Github, JavaScript, and lots of other stuff I don’t know, but my wife has told me. (This is not my field.) 

They continued to renew his contract...

Fast forward  several months, and the company is slimming the budget. They lay him off, and mostly everyone is bummed about it ...except my wife. 
She was relieved because he was so dynamic in his approach, and (through conversation with her I understand) she is not and doesn’t *want* to be. 

Today, she comes downstairs (she works a couple of days from home) and tells me that she’s angry because her company is laying off a long-timer IT person and they are probably going to hire the consultant that had covered for her. 

Now she’s upstairs talking to her boss and having a conversation as to why she doesn’t think they should hire him back. It really all comes down to her being intimidated by this guy’s knowledge and work ethic.

2,"Hello everyone,

I feel like something in my head is wrong. I am m20 and have always had less emotions than others, i cant remember the last time i was sad and had to cry or was angry for example, i am just neutral, and up until a few months ago that was ok for me. I also dont feel empathy like at all, i know if something is wrong or right, i know some stuff makes people sad, but i dont care.

About 2 years ago my grandmother died and i was ok with it, she was old and had lived a long and happy life, so why be sad? I noticed that everyone else was sad, but didnt think twice about it.

Then, 3 Months ago my father died in an accident and again, i just felt nothing. He was my dad, i loved him, but i just didnt feel anything while my family was devestated. I had to control myself not to randomly smile or laugh at the funeral and cant tell anyone about my feelings (or more like their absence). 

This is when i started thinking that something is seriously wrong with me.

A little while after that i stumbled on some videos from syria of executions (one guy got his arms cut off with a machete, a woman and her two children were executed by headshots and some more) because i am very interested in war and was doing some research, and again i just felt nothing. I wasent shocked, i didnt feel sorry for them or anything like that, for me these videos were like any video on youtube. 

I really dont know how i should feel about that. Its weird to not understand the emotions of other people (i am totally overwhelmed when someone cries infront of me, i just dont know what to do), but its also great to not be burdened by emotions. I guess if i cant feel anything, nothing can ever hurt me.

Anyway, i thought about seeing a psychologist, because i am really interested about what he would have to say, but then again, i dont think its a bad thing, so why treat it?

Im out, cheers.",20Jul2018,2

6,"Dear friend,

I’m sorry for doing this now. I should’ve done it sooner. I should’ve done it in real life. I always thought that I should give you another chance, that I shouldn’t end our friendship right before I transferred to another college. But you never stopped making me feel miserable about myself. You always made me feel small and insignificant. You made me feel like I was your inferior. And maybe it wasn’t intentional and that’s why I kept forgiving you. 

But you know when you really lost me? When you said that I should get me a best friend like “Z” (Z being her new best friend). That’s when you really ended this friendship. And you never stopped there. You kept talking about how amazing he was. And deep inside I always envied him, hated him for taking you from me. But now I know that it wasn’t his fault. You were the one who took yourself away from me. YOU stole my best friend.

And last week, after you saying that “Z serves all purposes” and that “he makes everyone seem like a shitty person in comparison”, I finally decided to end this. You always keep telling me that I should distance myself from toxic friends and stop trying to keep unhealthy friendships alive. And I guess you’re right. I shouldn’t stay friends with you. 

I’ve always tried to be there for you. All the time. I never even once complained about the things you talked to me about. I never said your life and issues were “negativity”. YOU were the toxic one. You never listened to my issues. You said you didn’t want negativity in your life. 

I’d also like to let you know that you can’t mold people into the characters you want them to play in your life. I was willing to change anything about myself to keep our friendship alive. But you took advantage of that, and tried fo change the person you became friends with in the first place.

Our friendship was like a walking on a minefield. You’d explode even when I was walking at my normal steady pace. And you would always justify your explosions. But you CAN’T justify random explosions, and you shouldn’t explode randomly.

So I’m sorry for ending this, I hope you understand. I really love you for the person you once were. And I want to remember you as that fun and amazing person. Which is why I’m ending this. ",20Jul2018,5

14,"I got to know a guy over the internet and he happened to attend an event near where I live so I showed him around the city. After the fun outing he texted me as he was going back and asked me for a dinner date sometime in the future. It felt like I knew him for a long time even though that's the first time we met so I said yes.

That was like a month ago and now in the present my parents are pretty against me going out on a date with the guy for a number of reasons, one of which is long distance and being a stranger online. (My mom is in particular weirdly strict about these things apparently so it would get really rough for me if I don't respect it... maybe even get disowned?). So I gotta tell him that I won't be able to go on a date with him.

Now I'm in my early 20s and I know what you're thinking, I should meet whoever I want to meet. Understand that it's not like I'm obediently following my parents' wishes despite meeting the love of my life or anything. I never dated anyone mostly stemming from insecurities and I value my relationship with my parents much higher than a possible romantic relationship with a guy I just met, that's all. Not to mention my grandma (who I love) wants me to get a boyfriend and I kind hope they can communicate at least (she doesnt speak english). I also trust my parents' instinct more than mine due to my lack of experience (but I take that with a grain of salt since generation difference and all). So it's not up for debate whether or not I'm going on a date with him.

Now here's what I'm having trouble with. It's eating me up inside knowing that I gave the dude ""yes"" but now I gotta take it back. I'm afraid he's gonna think I'm acting like a kid asking my parents for permission. I really felt like we could be a close friend, it felt like there was a click from the get go. So I don't want to screw this up. At the same time I totally get it if he doesnt wanna stay as a friend and will respect it. I've been meaning to talk to him about it but I tend to ghost for a while when I need to do something stressful. So I didn't want my first thing after week of silence to be ""sorry my mom said we can't go out"". Now he's on a vacation and so I want to wait until he's back in states to ruin a good mood. At the same time I know it's not anything serious. Still I've never told a guy I'm interested in staying connected that I gotta reject his date on hindsight so I'm getting anxious about not wanting to mess up.

(Tl;dr: I said yes to a date with a guy I met for the first time irl after some online interaction and now I gotta cancel it since my parents aren't happy with it. And at the present, my priority is family &gt; romantic partner.)

What should I say? Am I overreacting? Thanks in advance.",20Jul2018,2
15,"Hello. I was initially going to write this post on my alt account since this one is being stalked but I decided against it because I want this post to always stay up as a reminder to myself. 

I’m on mobile, sorry for formatting. 

I’m not your average teenager and we’re not your average family. Today I have finally accepted the fact that I have lost. I’ve lost an 11-15 year war and I’ve finally given up. 

When I was little we were a very happy family of 4. We were really poor but happy. I was an outgoing kid, I always smiled, always happy in general. When I was in 3rd grade my older brother bullied me in school after a few months I finally built up the courage to tell my mom about it. When I told her she was in the kitchen chopping carrots. She got down on her knees, grabbed my arms and shook me. She yelled at me to never say such bullshit lies about my brother. She said I was only lying because I was jealous of him. 

Days, weeks, months, years passed by and things never returned to the happy family we were. My mother clearly had favoritism for him and she grew to be an abusive mother. For years she abused me mentally, physically, and emotionally. My father never did anything to stop it because he didn’t want confrontations. For years I shut down. I was just going on a constant cycle without ever thinking or even having emotions at all. 

Around high school I finally got out of that cycle. Life wasn’t good but I had finally broken free of the cycle. I did everything on my power to fix this family but no one ever even tried. No one was even interested at all. I tried speaking with dad multiple times and he agreed but again, he didn’t want confrontations so he didn’t do anything. I tried going with my sisters and nope. I even tried forgiving my brother and talking 1 on 1 with him but wasn’t interested. 

No one was interested in fixing this so I also tried so many times to just live. I tired to spectate myself from them as much as I could until I could get out of this house but that didn’t work. 

My mother constantly tells me to take my shit out of the bathroom, then the kitchen, then the other bathroom. I have even told dad that mom doesn’t even let me live in my own damn house. I can’t walk to the kitchen without mom going up to me and yelling at me for some stupid reason. If it’s not “YOUR STUPID PROTIEN JAR IS ON THE TABLE!!!” It’s “YOU STEPPED ON THE TRASH!!” Or my personal favorite “YOURE BROPPING BREAD CRUMBS ALL OVER THE FLOOR!!” When I ask her to point them out she points at the floor so I ask to pick one up and she can’t find any. Point is I can’t breathe here without bothering her. 

Today I have given up. I’m not going to try to fix this anymore. I’m not even going to try to just live until I can get out. 

Do you have kids? How would you feel if you slowly saw any trace of them disappear? 

That’s what I’m planning. I have changed my legal name. Both first and last name. Today, I stopped talking to everyone in my family. I have decided that I’m going to live in my room and only go out of these 4 walls when it’s absolutely necessary. I have already taken my legal documents from them. 

Slowly, I’m going to start disappearing from this house until there’s nothing left of me or even reminders that I ever lived in this house. One by one, each picture contacting my face is going to be shredded. If it has my name it’s going too. 

I have been working my butt off to be able to join the USMC. Hopefully I will be soon, at which point I will probably have a talk with my dad. I plan on taking a drive with him, telling him about all the times mom abused me and all the times I tried to fix this family. Im going to tell him about how his wife, my blood and flesh, doesn’t want me in this house, how she always tried to take anything that belonged to me and throw it out. But mostly, I’m going to tell him that he didn’t have enough balls to stand up to his wife and because of that, he lost his son. 

The day I ship out to USMC basic training. I’m going to tell dad to go back to his family and to tell them (himself included) to never even try to contact me again. Ever. 

We have different surnames. Your wife doesn’t want me, your kids abuse me. And you, yourself stand there looking at everything that has been going on and never moved a finger to stop it. We are no longer father and son. We are no longer family. 

Hopefully, this will happen by September. I’ll probably crosspost to r/raisedbynarcissist this seems like a good last post to the subreddit, thanks for all of your support. ",20Jul2018,13
16,"I met a fellow redditor at a bar last night. We had a jolly good time discussing all things nostalgia and posts from reddit and many other redditors who have stood out. He didn't tell me his username, I didn't ask. A certain confidence in his voice had me mirin him but he had a ring on his finger... 

I digress.  

Been a lurker since 2015. I'm a socially awkward programmer and gamer. I like to gamble, a lot. Gacha machines, UFO catchers, and anything that involves randomness are my addictions. I was in therapy a couple of times when I started spending all my paycheck on tokens, games, cash shop, micro-transactions, etc.

I moved back into my parents house because I could no longer sustain my addiction and put a roof above my head. I'm trying to be more social these days, put myself out there, and dance with the wolves (or get eaten by them); well at-least I can cry ಥ﹏ಥ or rage t(-\_-t)and no one will ever know.

I code in R, Go, Python, Dart, and Javascript. I'm currently playing sdorica, Monster Hunter Double Cross, waiting for Warframe and Honor of Kings/Arena of Valor. I recently got back into No Man's sky and used to play DoTA2, League of Legends, Blade and Soul, and many other MMORPG. I dream of playing Star Citizen but I'll possibly be dead before that goes live.

Also, finally decided to join hoping I would bump into this mysterious reddittor one day and continue the conversation where we left off. I'm also a (creepy?) hopeless romantic.

18,"I’m approachable and great at making first impressions and I tend to share too much information about myself and secrets in a short period of time, causing the confusion for others to see me as open and confident. Once I feel uncomfortable or I overthink, then I’ll distance myself from everyone. A lot of people I’d met would label me as that type of person with a kind and friendly face. Some people would even tell me, I don’t know if it’s a compliment or criticism “You look so much younger than your age, you look so naive.” So I look younger because I don’t have the marks on my face not that I don’t feel stressed out but when severely depressed I feel apathy.

These moments of apathy makes me feel an invisible distance from everyone, as if I’m watching everything unfold from a TV screen. An observer of the world, I’m not being dramatic. I just felt like an outsider disassociated with everything and everyone. I have moments where I feel my body isn’t mine, I’ll look at my arm and get the feeling it’s an object. At this comfort zone I am able to quite down my thoughts then I get used to it and distance myself further from everyone. Everyone I think could never understand to eliminate the thoughts of being a burden. 

You know the feeling that you’ll never find a place where you belong. You’ll find others like you it’s easy to spot them and you feel at home around these people who’s not related to you, not by blood. I consider myself an empathy because it’s easy for me to catch these vibes and I feel comfortable and can be myself around these group of people. This sense of feeling of being an outsider of never going to be good enough, feeling like a fraud an inferior entity as outlandish as this sounds. Feeling like there’s need of space and once the space is established people get confused with this sudden change in your behavior and then the next thing you realize you’re left with a handful of people who understands.

I think about peoples faces and maybe they didn’t know they were making that face, but I saw it and now I have a hundred different reasons in my mind of why they thought some kind of negative way about me and will think about for years to come until there is some sort of confirmation that they did not think that way, but after years and years, they probably don’t remember, but the issues is that I do and cannot forget and will be lying in bed years later cringing and stressing  about that one insignificant moment that happened years and years ago about a person I will never see again in my life time and what face they made and what their opinion of me could possibly be.

28,"So my friend is a psychology student at a large UK university and recently went back home to stay with her family in Romania, and also to do an internship there for her degree (she's due to come back in September).

The person she's doing her internship with is an internationally renowned ex-nato psychologist.

Her mother advised that she take advantage of this opportunity and to have some therapy with him as well for some other unresolved issues she's been experiencing.

After her first sessions she messaged me saying that he very quickly diagnosed her with borderline personality disorder, told her that sex was at the centre of life, that she needed to have sex that week and that she should send him a picture of her genitals. Keep in mind that she was abused by a friend when she was 5 also - she told him about this, and his response was, ""you enjoyed it"" and that ""now you have this big libido that you have to satisfy"", and ""if you'd let yourself do it you'd fuck and scream"".

When she told me this I was shocked,especially as she couldn't see what was going on - we tried to tell her but she is under the spell and is convinced there is something wrong with her.

She tried to seek help from her parents but her mother didn't seem to be concerned (!!!) and her father thought that maybe it was some kind of shock therapy. Her parents are very strict and she is obedient, clearly if there is a problem it’s always her fault and no one else’s in their eyes.

We tried to convince her to go to another session and to secretly record him saying all of this crazy stuff then to show her parents and go to the police but she can't find the courage to do it, since she still believes it's her fault, and her parents have discouraged her from going to the police (they still really want her to do this internship with this guy).

She's also said that she wants to continue seeing him for the internship despite all of the above, no doubt because of the pressure from her parents to take advantage of this ""great"" opportunity.

There's nothing we can do where we are here in he U.K. We were thinking that maybe we could call her university here and speak to the head of the psychology department, explain to them what's happened and see if they'll intervene in any way.

We feel helpless right now and that's all we have.

Now you may be asking, /u/treewittaface, what does this have to do with Cannabis? So let me get down to the THC crystals of my little write-up here.

I think it's clear in Cannabis' intention that it wants to be a star. It wants us to use it, as all of God's good herbs want to be used by us. It wants abundance and joy, for itself and others. The question is, does it--nay, *should* it--make the cut and win our respects, not only in our joints or our hospitals or stoner shops or dispensaries, but in our salads and our restaurants, our family BBQs, our picnics, our school lunches, and our McDonalds and other fast food chains?

This question, I believe, is such an important question which must be answered with the utmost care, which leads us right in to a second question: What man among us can we *trust* to answer this question righteously and justly?

Myself, I don't have an answer for the first question, but I believe I have found a suitable answer to the latter. And that is as follows.

No man or woman of our society is suitable to answer the foremost question. The only mortal being alive fit to answer that question, is not an animal, but a fellow herb like Cannabis. An herb which has rightfully and justly won the place being taken under consideration by Cannabis. An herb which will be asked to step aside in the salad bowl, and make room for its sister in the vegetable kingdom should it allow it to pass through.

My friends, let there be no more debate on this topic. Lettuce put the question to The Lettuce.

41,"Let  me start off by saying that I am neither involved with nor interested  in any internet cultures. I just think that the term ""manlet"" is quite  fitting, even though my interpretation of it will be somewhat different  from the common usage.

Im tiny. Im short  (which by itself isnt too bad in my opinion. I know that it bothers a  lot of people, but not me) but Im also skinny, have a small frame and a  boyish face.

How do men cope with that  kind of situation? Is a good job/an extraordinary talent/skill the only  way to become happy? Because it certainly looks like it.

The  only two guys i knew, who had similar issues, killed themselves before  age 25. Im not doing that. Not now at age 25 and not when im older  either. And all other men who are in the same situation were either  heavily depressed OR told me that the only thing that they could get  self-confidence from was their job.

I  dont have any of that. I dont have the perspective of ever getting a  decent, let alone ""good"" job and I lack knowledge, talent and skills as  well. That by itself is an issue already. But I know that I could  improve myself or at least couldve done so in the past if I was just a  regular man.

But as a manlet? Whar are  you gonna do? Whenever you go outside you get insulted and teased.  Nothing is fun if people around you constantly mock you. I stopped going  out with friends a long time ago, because no matter where we went,  strangers would embarrass me in front of them. People have zero respect  for tiny guys. You wouldnt believe some of the things that have happened  to me. Strangers take pictures and post them online, pick me up and  turn me upside down and tell me that im not even a human being.

Just  this morning an old woman walked past me and casually told me that im  ""a fa%got"" (or rather the equivalent of that term in my language, which  is less of a slur against people with certain sexual orientations, but  more an insult against weak/pathetic looking people). It just left me  speechless. At first I couldnt even believe that she said that. How dare  she say that? A tiny, out of shape (to me, this is relevant in this  case. It just adds to the injury. People can be out of shape. I dont  care. So am I afterall. It's just the audacity of her feeling superior,  even though she simply is not) old woman. She wouldnt have dared to say  that to an average man, because she wouldve been scared of getting  punched. Like I couldnt do that..I wouldnt, because im not violent. But  of course I could.

People who got bullied  get a lot of sympathy. Im getting bullied each and every day and nobody  cares. Society doesnt care. It is an issue that everybody seems to be  fine with. Bully someone in public and people are outraged (rightfully  so). Bully a weak guy in public and people join in on the ""fun"".

It has been almost a year since we talked and although she became toxic towards the end of our friendship, I miss having someone who was so constant in my life, having that level of intimacy with another person. 
Now, when I see her on my college campus, we don't even acknowledge each other and that hurts a little bit.

51,"This is a post I don’t know how to make. Or if I even should be making it but posts like these are like throwing a stone into a still lake, throw, and then watch the ripples do the rest of the work for you. See; I’ve started. I’ve typed already. 

I’ve been binge watching Queer Eye on Netflix, and Bobby, that precious bright soul that he is, says to that week’s victim “when you’re feeling buried you’re actually just planted,” or words to that effect, and pats the mound of earth he has just placed seeds in to finish.  It hit me, hit me hard. People often say they feel their blood run cold, or the wind was knocked out of them, and I understand both those feelings. Only, this was more like he’d reached into the very fibres of my being, and plucked them as if he were running his fingers over a harp he’d passed. The first, tiny vibrations. No way near enough to coax music, but enough, just enough. 

I struggle to take pride in myself. For those of you who will doubtless stalk my post history, will discover aside from all the reality TV subreddits I am subscribed to, that I posted I was incredibly suicidal a few weeks back. That post was an off the cuff, spur of the moment, ‘why am I doing this?’ post that I had no real thought behind. I cannot even begin to describe how many messages I received because of it. I expected none of those. The upvotes scared me. 

I feel buried. The realities of my life are… I guess typically millennial. All my money goes on rent; I cannot afford food, clothes, fun… but I have to find a way. The irony of being malnourished and its effect on mental health is not lost on me. I have been conditioned by parents who had me for no other reason than ‘that is what you do when you get married and get older’, to never ask for help. It didn’t surprise me when going through school; I could never find help even when I asked for it, trembling with fear that my parents would discover my transgression. The trend continues even now. 

The truth, the one I struggle to admit, is that I am buried.
 
When I was born, my parents happily heaped on the soil. Don’t ask for help. Why would we love you? Why would we feed you? The emotional abandonment became the concrete over the soil. 

So here, here is my admission. I cannot love myself. I am buried.
 
A wonderful user responded to my suicidal comment with a list of reasons to live for. One of them was to smell the earth after rain. It’s raining. Plants need water. So I shall go outside, and sit, in the rain, and soak in the smell. Maybe it will be enough to get the first tendril of the seed that is me to sprout. Perhaps not. 

But for now; it will be enough.

My concern is when I dont want to have sex, we have sex anyway...I feel so used afterwards and just super bummed that he feels fine continuing even though I'm laying there like a dead fish bc i told him i didnt feel like it and would rather we waited until x time.  He really seems to think my vagina is it's own entity and when he uses it and I'm not in the mood it's like ""oh I'll be done in just a couple minutes &amp; you can go back to sleep.""... Like he doesnt care if I enjoy it every time, like he thinks if i enjoy it when i want to that's great and if i dont enjoy it when he is the only one that wants to that's okay too, like hes just borrowing my vagina and later we can both be present at heart &amp; do it again and hes okay with me just lending it to him.  

We've gotten to this point bc in the past when I really put my foot down and actually said no he throws a little baby tantrum and stomps off and slams the door and is all bitten hurt.  I'd rather just take the 4 minutes of unwanted sex than deal with that confrontation.  I keep thinking ""he will see I'm not into and feel bad and stop"" but he doesnt.

i suffer from irritable bowel syndrome and it was hell to sit around all day at school. i also got bullied by the others for several reasons but i pulled through.

my current boss wanted me to apply to another year in apprenticeship so he can take advantage of me with a low salary. so i got accepted in the new apprenticeship. 

however i just got notified i did not pass this year. i got an overall average of 11.5/20 BUT got a 9.95/20 average in a test when the passing grade is 10/20. the lady said they couldn't do anything for me to retake the test. i just lost a year over .05 points AND a global average of 11.5/20.

i called the second apprenticeship and they reassured me i was still accepted since i already have two masters under my belt. 

i am ashamed of what my boss and colleagues will say because they WILL talk about it. huge blabbermouths. also i have no idea what to put on my resume. i decided  to search for work in the meantime since they won't ask right away for the diploma. i also feel like a failure because i already have a two freaking masters and i couldn't find work at all. and now i may be trapped to spend ANOTHER year in school at fucking 29, go through 3h exams, write another thesis, present it once again to a jury. i am just so over studies. i am just really over it. i have two coworkers one year younger than me who have their permanent contracts, living comfortably with a good salary, no worry in the world, and i am struggling to even make ends meet and land a stable job.

57,"I'm still trying to improve myself but I'm doing way better than I was last year and the years prior. I had a lot going on for the past few years. And it just affected me so much, these were very depressing times for me. When I was 13 I had this thing called urticaria. It was hell to deal with, basically whenever I got nervous, hot, excited, these red bumps will rise from under my skin and cause so much pain, most of the time it'll just happen out of nowhere. I stopped my social life due to this, I stayed home as much as I could because the pain was just unbearable. I became depressed and honestly, I didn't know what to do with myself. I thought ""If I can't even deal with going outside how will I ever get a job and live a life?"". I felt like I was worthless. Last month I figured out the cause of it and I'm feeling so much better. I'm starting to socialize again and I feel like the social anxiety that was developed while staying in my house all the time disappearing. 

I had some things going on with my family (I've already made two different posts about what was going on), some of it still happens today but I've learned how to keep that from affecting my way of thinking and living life.  School was terrible for me, I'm homeschooled and I do my school work online. The school I'm with is very terrible though, its really a poorly organized school with some of the worst teachers I've ever had. But this week is my last week having to work with them.

62,"In the last year or so I've changed a lot due to various reasons. Looks, interests, my entire behaviour. They are not bad changes at all. In fact, what's actually happening is probably that I'm 'maturing' and finding out who I actually am.

But this has actually made me unhappier. I realise I used to be a bit naive before and had really low expectations. I used to be pretty happy most of the time, just needed to be left alone and have some fun now and then. I didn't really need much and barely thought about the future. 

Well now I do, I realise I am slowly but surely getting older, if I want something I have to move my ass and actually work towards it etc.. I see everything in a different light and more critical. My relationships to other people have changed as well. Sometimes I can look in the mirror and feel like a stranger to myself. I still like who I am, objectively - actually like it more than what I used to be like - but it doesn't feel like 'me'. It's like I've lost the old 'me'. 

Idk. It's just so hugely confusing, and I am still not done changing. I just want to feel secure in something again, instead I'm constantly overthinking and being pretty critical about my life. I do think this process is necessary, and I hope it will eventually lead towards being happy again. But it's been over a year now and I still feel so lost and confused.  ",20Jul2018,52

66,"I'm terrible at keeping diaries, and especially at writing things by hand, so this is where I write my thoughts.


I was accepted to my ideal graduate program at a university in Sweden in February, and I'll move there in a month to pursue my masters. I think reddit and liberal/progressive thinkers have always held Sweden and the other Scandinavian countries up as exemplary societies because of their mostly successful social programs, gender equality, and generally good quality of life. Being a liberal in the South, this all sounds very appealing to me. I'm ecstatic to get out of Trump Country. I'm tired of hearing people unironically using [insert epithet here] to describe black people, Mexican people, gay people, etc. I'm fucking tired of the gender roles here, and especially the tension and taboo attitude surrounding sex and sexuality. I'm so fucking tired of hearing about the god damn Second Amendment. I don't really talk publicly about this sort of thing because it's not my interest, but the feelings are still there, and I'm sure the feelings of political unease are weighing on pretty much everyone in the US right now. But it feels like when I leave here there's going to be a massive weight lifted. When I read about Swedish attitudes towards these things (aside from maybe the right-wing backlash towards immigration from the Middle East etc), they all seem to make much more sense to me than the attitudes of most of the people in Louisiana.


But then again, it all seems a bit naive. Sweden seems to be painted as a paradise, and then you hear about the apparently massive problems of immigration and excessive refugee acceptance, rape, and other violent crime that unfortunately seems to coincide with immigration. I've traveled to enough places to know that every single society ever has its problems. And maybe I'll find the problems of Sweden to be more significant than the problems of Louisiana, who knows?


Even if it's not a perfect country though, it *has* to be better than Louisiana, right? When has anyone put Louisiana on a pedestal for anything other than debauchery (New Orleans), slavery, and rednecks? Well, maybe food. We have some damn good food. But like we also have huge prevalence of HIV, human trafficking, racism, sexism, violence, riots, you name it.

67,On July 1st my wife and I woke up to a 98 degree apartment and a broken AC.  On July 2nd I submitted a maintenance request and the apartment was notified.  It has been 90+ degrees in our unit for 18 days now.  They brought us a window cooler but it does not even cool half of the room they put it in rendering 80% of our apartment unlivable.  I tour 3-4 days a week for my job and when I'm home I have to get as much done in my studio as possible.  I've had to move my studio out of my apartment and into a spare bedroom at a friends house because I have been unable to work in these conditions.  Last weekend I got home from touring and my wife had passed out in the heat.  We stayed in a hotel for 2 nights after that.  Last night I sent an email to the apartment manager explaining all of this and asked for a discounted rent rate this month.  Today she called my wife and ended up yelling at her and hanging up on her.

  Haunted Hotel Rooms


   Perhaps those empty rooms aren't vacant


   instead they're filled with clumsy ghosts who glide from side to side,


   donning capes and drapes


   haunting clueless people who now reside


   where spirits linger in the beds


   where they were sacrificed


   no one lives to tell the tale


   of what went down that night


   that left a gory crime scene,


   such a horrid sight


   was it a gruesome accident


   or a twisted tale


   of a wicked evil guy whose head


   clouded with ideas formed from many years of malintent society had failed


   he lacked conviction and a voice of reason, those two things he desperately needed


   with reality shattered and so elusive, the bathroom he rarely visits,


   now a long times passed since he's bathed or showered his pants covered in god knows what are dirty, ripped and tattered,


   maybe with a priest's or pastor's power with the help of God they could clean up this mess of a man this witching hour


   the town was silent and no soul in sight could save him from him and his worst nightmares running rampant


   he grabbed an axe, a pack of matches and some stale tobacco poorly rolled,


   he slammed the wooden door, stepped off his porch, away from the light and towards the whispering pines


  with a limp walking in pain from his injured shin, he crept off into the streets to carry out his evil deeds


   and the moon just a sliver smiling shining illuminating trees.",20Jul2018,1

So we talked for a few days, again still seems like she has an awesome personality and I enjoyed talking to her. Tuesday night rolls around and it's her good friends birthday ... and my 10 pin bowling league night. Shes out for her friends birthday and drinking, im bowling and also drinking. She texts me and says she wants to come over tonight and stay the night. Well, we haven't met yet so that should have put up a red flag for me. But i'm like 5 Jack and Cokes and a shot down already so im like what the hell right? come on over when I get home.

11 PM now, she gets to my house for the first time. She's sobered up by this point, I wasn't -- I couldn't even drive home from bowling and had to uber. She knocks on my door and I open it..........and this is where the horror starts. She's literally two times as large as she was in her pictures, I dont know if it was some photoshop kung fu, or a few year old pictures or what -- but this isn't what I signed up for. But again, wasted, so im like lets do this.

So she comes in, we sit on my couch and start kissing and she is literally the WORST kisser I have ever even imagined. She's like literally JABBING me with her tongue like Mike Tyson in Ip Man 3(great movie, except for Iron Mike BTW.) But Jack tells me its ok, so I keep going with it. Clothes come off, and instantly adds another like 30 lbs. But whatever, I am this deep just gonna go for it now. So I try to finger bang her but literally can't find it because the fupa is too strong. Eventually I get there, but it wasn't pleasant.

This is where it gets interesting, she looks at me and says i want to 69. I'm like SHIT, this won't go over well. But again, Jack encourages it and I say lets go. So she hops on, but her stomach is so large that literally I couldnt extend my neck and tongue long enough to reach.... so I am just sitting there while she is throating my meat hammer with this giant ass in my face.

So then it comes time to fuck, I don't have a small peter but we tried like 3 different positions and I couldn't even reach it...and i dont know if you have ever happen but that is a knock on your confidence! So I tell her this isn't going to work, but I still want to nut so I let her go back to giving me a BJ.. and let me tell you, this is her calling. I'm pretty sure she sucked jesus out of me.

So now she wants to stay the night, and im like whatever. She asks for one of my shirts, and I give her my favorite shirt WHY?!) .. and we are laying there in my bed and im like I can't do this, I need to find a way to get her to go home. So light bulb goes off, I have a work cell phone and a personal cell. I grab my work phone and low key dial my other cell phones number. She tells me my phone is ringing and I grab it. I talk to this fake person for about 5 minutes about how our VPN at work isn't working, and I fake troubleshoot with him. Eventually me and my fake self come to the conclusion that I have to go to my office and send her on her way.

I feel defeated.

TL/DR --- I invited a big girl over, she was twice as big as her pictures. She jabbed me with her tongue, then my dick couldn't reach.

For discussion -- She's still texting me, how do I let her down without hurting her feelings or self esteem. She's a cool girl, but physically we can't work out together. Help Reddit!!!! ",20Jul2018,231
