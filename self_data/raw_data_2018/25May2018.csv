1,"So I guess this is becoming my piss pants story alt account. Fuck, I started it to get out of pissing myself, and subsequently failed. I’ve had a tiny bladder my entire life, I’ve actually seriously peed myself at least a few times a year every year since forever. My family doesn’t care, so that’s good. But it’s only because my sisters also piss themselves all the time too, and so does my mom. She’s worse though, anytime she goes out drinking with her friends she’ll probably pee herself and pretty much always wets the bed afterwards, and she doesn’t even get drunk. Me or my sisters aren’t there (yet), but none of us have even had children yet either.

But that’s their problems. Mine was last night I went and saw A Quiet Place at the movies, and went to the bathroom afterwards. The line was huge because of Avengers letting out. As the line went on, everybody else could tell that I had to go, NOW. I asked if I could go ahead when I knew I couldn’t wait anymore, but that bitch was acting like I was trying to screw her and said no. But I made it! To the stall that is... because after that my bladder was like “eh...close enough” and released. So I was the lucky winner that got to leave with a big wet pee stain running down my butt and crotch.

So what’s the point to this description of my lovely life? Nothing, just need to vent. I’m not even resentful, just want to put it out there.",25May2018,24

At first the sketch he’d sent me looks kinda cute and bubbly and then we stopped talking for about month after an argument and after I did not get any drawing from him. I chose report him to PayPal about not getting a drawing I paid for, to which he refuted that I owed him money even though I’d paid the full amount. Which made me furious, but thanks to PayPal taking my side I got a drawing.

When I reported him to PayPal I wanted him to at least send a drawing or give me back my money, it is to be fair and kind of out of spite because if I’m not angry I would have let it go. Yesterday I received an e-mail from him titled ‘Thanks for the commission’ and two drawings of myself as a she-devil.

10,"Hi ya'll:

First time poster to this sub, but figured it couldn't hurt to reach out and receive some advice from a different perspective.

I'm a 24-year-old male who just recently graduated college. When I was 18, I became heavily involved with a girl who I would continue to date for three years. We'd attend community college together; we'd move cross state with one another to attend the same university; we'd move in with one another -- twice. It was near the end of the relationship that we became slightly distant due to the cumbersome schedules we suffered from being full-time students and employees simultaneously. After three months in a single bedroom apartment, we ended things. What seemingly began as a respectful and somber split quickly became toxic as another man entered the equation no less than days after the relationship's conclusion. 

I'll be blunt when I say even three years after the end, I still think she's the perfect person for me. I can't (and won't, due to keeping your already unwavering attention to this borderline sob story) go on enough about how much I KNOW she's the one that I'll forever hold myself accountable for missing out on. Now, to the question:

It's been three years. I haven't had a single relationship since. I am constantly struggling with life balances and for the past three years, it's been completing my degree and finding a job. Now that I'm there, I want to broaden my horizons and continue into a relationship. How can I work to regain my confidence and emotion and strive towards an environment that will offer new opportunities in my relationship life?

I just left a time in my life (college) that will exclusively offer the highest concentrated group of people similar to my age I'll ever experience. I'm now another cog in the machine. With a deadly recipe of lifetime ""I-met-her-in-high-school-or-college"" relationships mixed with an unconcerned effort to attempt finding ""love"" after a relationship spun me so sideways that I still am progressing towards recovery -- I've found myself in what some would call a clusterfuck.

I'm frankly tired of the cliches: ""try a dating app,"" ""don't worry: what you're looking for will come, be patient"" and ""when you find the one, you'll know"" are driving me up a wall. I'm a patient person, but how I am going to find somebody when I honestly don't even have swear one? I need to re-experience the feeling. 
Where do I go? What do I do? How can I rekindle my emotions? What worked for you?

Going in here a bit blind, so if you have any questions or discussion points, I'm looking forward to participating.

Thanks, Reddit. ",25May2018,16

12,"I came down to support my aunt today, she had an MRI today. 5 hours later - she has a tumour in her right frontal lobe.

Now it’s like that all over again; but quicker , if that is they don’t shrink it. When my nana was in palliative care I was down for weeks at a time, going home only for more clothes and such, it’ll be like this again. I’m so heart broken right now, she was my midwife, and caught my baby girl a day before my nana died - same hospital one floor up.

18,"So, I had class with a guy whose in two classes of mine last semester. I thought he was cute but scary. He was relatively quiet and I only spoke to him briefly when he had complimented my art in our shared art class. 

There were a few occasions where we had awkward eye contact, in art and in my other class. I figured he just thought I was staring because of the angles of my seats in both those classes. One being at a U shaped table where I faced the opposite wall rather than the front of the class and he sat in a seat just in front of me that was in the middle of the U. 

I didn’t start thinking about these things being possible signs (really could just be me over thinking and I need people to talk me out of a crush?) after he passed by in his car and made eye contact, then I looked away, quickly looked back and saw he had waved at me. Is this too little to go on or could he be just as awkward as me?

It’s because I reported him to PayPal for not sending the drawing. If I did not do this he’ll continue to ignore me after I’d changed my mind on wanting the drawing which I had paid in full amount. If I don’t care about him I would have let it go. It is a crappy drawing but I’m satisfied I got under his skin, the artwork only slightly resembles me and I don’t mind the yellow eyes anymore I initially regretted the purchase I’d made but come to think of it, it’s totally worth it.

I am largely an analog person. 

- I hate how in university nowadays they make us buy simulators. It’s mostly in my business related courses. I never know how to work the damn things. I almost failed a class (Professional Communications) because of the stupid simulator. Luckily my letter writing skills compensated for it and I ended with a B-.
- One of the many reasons I bullet journal is cuz I can’t be bothered to learn Google Calendar. 
- I prefer the paper book to the eBook (nothing against eBooks though). 
- I also love flipping through catalogs and flyers, and I love magazines
- First person video games give me mad motion sickness so I gave up on trying to get into them, and don’t even get me started on VR! 
- The photography module in my program got my head spinning
- I avoided drive-thru at my fast food job for the longest time cuz I was scared I’d fuck up with the system, and I did fuck up when I finally tried it (I actually like it now though!)

I am not technophobic. Just technophobic for a young person. I love Reddit and social media like any other teenager. I also am a huge supporter of smart home technology. We don’t have it in our house right now and we might not ever, but when I have my own home I want some Phillips Hue lights and etc so bad. I am also in favor of self-driving cars. I just think the term ‘technophobe’ is used to describe old people 99% of the time. Technology is advancing but it’s not advancing that fast that every Gen Z / young person is tech-literate. I sure as hell am not and people need to stop assuming that.

And another thing: I am not proud to be technophobic. I wish I were as good at technology as everyone in my program. I wish I could play games and try out VR without being completely sick. And getting into eBooks could save me a pretty penny. It really is to my disadvantage, especially in an age where everyone else is good at that stuff. ",25May2018,4
23,"So to give some context, I've fantasized about sucking dick for a couple years now. I've been in a long distance relationship for 2 1/2 years.

Anyway, I told my significant other about ALL of my fantasies she's been cool, understanding, accepting and honestly excited about most to all of them. 

So today at work (I work in a food service industry.) I served a customer and a younger guy came in who I thought was rather cute. After serving him I stared at him in a corner for a bit and thought he look rather hot in this pink long sleeve dress shirt and wondered if he was gay/bi and if he was how I would of approached him to get what I want. (Which is to suck his dick) Then I couldn't help but think about it and wished it was easy as walking up and simply asking ""Hey can I blow you?"" So after fantasizing about giving him head he left and I went on with my day.

I came home and told my SO about what had happened today and she gave me permission to do anything I want with a guy as long as a girl isn't involved. 

So my question is how would I go about finding a guy to fool around with discreetly. (I'm not sure if I'm fully bi.. I just know I've always found blowjobs overwhelming sexy and wanted to try doing it myself to someone.) I don't want any friends or family to find out if I did get the opportunity and did it. Like what would be the best way for me to find what I'm looking for? Something like Tinder? As I don't exactly want to just start getting close to strangers that I find cute and become friends with them just to ultimatlely ask if I could blow them and risk having them expose me. (Note even using a throwaway account knowing no one close to me knows my main Reddit account or how often I use the site.)

I was living overseas for the past seven and a half years. I moved away by myself when I was 19. I had the most incredible time, I can't even explain how exciting it was. Of course, there were ups and downs, that's normal. I missed my family. The country I moved to is famous for its beautiful weather and more relaxed lifestyle. I was so incredibly happy. I met my fiance, we have cats, I had a great job. Life was perfect. We were on our way to apply for a partnership visa, we were going to apply in July, on our second year anniversary. We lived together. 

I always had a recurring nightmare that if I visited home, I'd get stuck there. I used to wake up and breathe a sigh of relief when I woke up and realised I was still in the same country I'd fallen asleep in. I loved my job and felt like I was OK at what I did. I'd had a few years of struggling, where I worked cash in hand jobs while trying to balance studying and work. But when I finished my studies, I managed to find a job that changed everything for me. 

My cat was the light of my life. I adopted her five years ago. It was love at first sight. She moved states with me a couple of times and I adored her. She'd sleep in between my legs at night time. I didn't even mind as the weather got cooler because she'd cuddle up to me more. And when I met my fiance, he already had cats - seven in fact. I loved each and every one of them.

I was diagnosed with bipolar a couple of months ago, but didn't do anything about it as I couldn't afford the therapy sessions. I'd have long drawn out periods where I couldn't even look at another person when I wasn't at work. I would lay in bed and was often frustrated at even the sight of another human being. My fiance was so kind and lovely and supportive. All he ever wanted was the best for me. I wanted the best for him too but didn't feel like I was even close to the best for him. 

My dad got sick recently and had a heart attack and major surgery. He was in hospital for a month. He lives in my home country. Of course I had to do the right thing and come home. I discussed it with my fiance, who had been sick the same way himself a few years previously, and we agreed I'd have to visit home for a few months. I quit my job and booked a flight.

Here I am, I don't know. I was living on the other side of the world. I just feel like nothing I'm doing to help my dad is good enough. Obviously I'm trying to help as much as I can with his recovery. I'm stressing about finding a job and trying to get everything right. I got told off just now because I washed my glass after I'd had some juice because of 'wasting water'. All of a sudden I just felt like exploding. I feel so selfish. But I feel like I would have gotten in trouble if I didn't wash the glass for 'leaving a mess'. The whole time I can just picture my sweet fiances face. He is still in his home country. He can't come for a few months due to work. I KNOW I needed to do the right thing by coming here and helping with my dads recovery. I just feel like screaming. I don't have a visa to go back to anymore. To go back will cost me about 7k to reapply for a new visa. I need to work in order to earn that money, of course, but how can I go to work when I need to look after my dad? I feel like my relationship will slip away from me completely. I miss my cats. I just want a cat cuddle. I left my home country because it made me miserable. I'm so scared. I know it's selfish of me to feel this way. Obviously I want to be here to help. But I wish things could have been different. I hate myself for feeling like this. I think I'm going to end up having to stay here forever. I am trying my best to help out as much as possible and I just feel so empty and pointless all over again. It's not a burden, not at all, but I gave up everything and then I get told off for washing a glass and that I should go back to Australia. I wish I could and I hate myself for feeling that way. 

My original plan was to be here for a couple of months. It doesn't look like that will be able to happen. Sometimes I wish I could just live completely alone and lay down and never get up again. ",25May2018,2

And that girl just laughed at it, after that I always wore shorts under my skirt, although now I'm over it and I just don't care anymore, I don't have enough shorts to do that and nobody would want to look at that)
I don't remember much from those days. It was mostly _that_, guys asking me out as a prank, I don't know, I was just an easy prey, I was skinny and naive. I didn't know much about friendships, I had a lot of fears. Girls excluded me and boys were a no. In 7th grade it got much worse, out group was mixed so the girls started to hang out together, my old group of friends was there but they finally kicked me out and were like ""what are you doing here?"" Although it wasn't the typical physical bullying, whatever they were doing got worse. My class was the worst, I was the girl prey and there was also a male pray (who's one of my friends now, he's really cool) I remember once they said something and I started to cry, I thought I was kind of getting along well with the girl next to me but she told everyone I was crying. Afterwards some seniors saw me crying and they helped me, some girls from the other class also tried to comfort me but I just didn't feel comfortable with that because they were friends with those girls.

In 7th I finally joined the online community and I made a fanpage, actually, a lot of these groups were formed by fangirls of stuff like 1D, etc. but I had no way to know new music, my brothers didn't listen to music, at most some classical music
So it wasn't until 7th grade that I made my first fanpage, I made some online friends and I started to like more and more stuff.

In 8th I got the opportunity to transfer to another school so I accepted and went there. By then I had kind of left the naive me behind, now I had a pretty shitty taste but oh well, I had something (youtubers and magcon) I made some friends there, I was new at that so I fear I was actually a bit toxic, a girl left our group of friends because I was mean to her but I was just imitating what I saw others doing. I'm still learning. I wasn't serious but nobody ever gets what I'm trying to say. I occasionally talk with my friends from that school but we all went our own way, the only person I often talk with is a senior I had there who was like my bestie although we didn't hang out a lot back then, we just texted. I haven't seen him in years though. 

In 9th I moved back to my old school and I just kind of forced my way into the other class, it was a really great class, I don't know how they managed to put all the crappy people in the other class, by then I was already in a kind of modern ""emo"" phase. (Not really emo, it was just the typical bands (p!atd, fob, mcr)+ phan + tøp)
I guess I was finally ""strong"" mentally, I wouldn't have let others bully me but again, I was lucky that my new class was nice, thanks to my cousin I met some guys from the grade below me so I would mostly hang out with them and talk about memes and stuff.
We had a lunch break and a recess so sometimes we would just hang out in one of them, I was still unsure if I should always approach them and I still struggle with approaching people. One day when I was alone in the hallway reading or sleeping a guy approached me asking if I was a foreigner (I'm not, I just had short hair), and then we kind of became friends although it was just the ocasional chat, his best friend was playing so sometimes he came and we talked about anime, that guy too is one of my friends now, but he was a year below me too and tbh we didn't become close until a bit more than a year ago. Oh and I also had my friends from 7th grade, I actually became kind of influential in those kids, I felt like a trend setter or something. 

Then this girl who actually used to be in my old group of friends was moved to my class, she showed me the joy of kpop and I showed her tøp, we kind of exchanged tastes although she still likes kpop but only BTS. She became my best friend and I was glad I finally had a friend in my year. Then we graduated yay.
So on my first day of classes this friend came and then told me she wouldn't go to high school. Perfect, now I didn't have any friends because they all were a year or two below me.

So I started high school and it wasn't easy, I made some friends and then we all went on our own way, I slowly started making friends but I would still hide in our lunch break to read or just do whatever online. And yeah, I somehow became what I am. Now I do have friends but I don't know well when I became close with them. (Well I actually asked one of them if we could be friends so I only know about that) Now my juniors are in high school but I don't talk with my old group of friends, maybe the ocasional hello. I talk with other juniors though and we sometimes hang out but now I'm mostly with my friends from my grade,
Oh and I skipped a part, some months ago I actually didn't really have like people I could hang out with but again, I moved to another class and  yeah, now I'm kind of doing fine.
Last week though we went to some activity of my year and I felt really lonely when we arrived, my close friend hadn't arrived, I didn't have my juniors, the girls I talk with were in some benches and I can't approach them like that, my guy friends were busy talking, ah... after all I'm still the same person. Now I only have a few weeks left of high school, most of my friends are leaving the state. I wonder how my college life will be like. Although at this point I regret leaving my studies for fandoms, now I'm just an average student and I can't focus, I don't care if I don't have a great social life in college, I just want to do well academically. I'm happy the way I am now though, although I feel quite toxic.",25May2018,1

44,"At the start of the month, my dad was working on redoing our floors using floor stain and polyurethane. He's a bit of a hobbyist handyman and was tackling the whole project by himself.


Long story short, some floor stain rags were improperly stored on the deck by accident. I was sitting in my room while he was laying down the last of the polyurethane. The fumes are pretty bad to breathe so I had my window opened. I thought I heard a fly banging against my window screen so I put down my phone and went over to find it. A faint whiff of smoke came through and I realized something was burning. What had happened was that the stain rags spontaneously combusted.


The fire was right outside the window my dad was working by but he wouldn't have been able to notice it with his face mask and the fumes. If I didn't get up to check on this ""fly,"" we probably would have lost the whole house.


It took 3 fire extinguishers to put out and left a burn mark about 6 feet in diameter. The damage included wooden deck boards had to be replaced, a screen door half incinerated, and a melted door frame.


I'm glad that we put it out and my parents were saying I saved our home, but the thought of another fire starting at any moment is stuck with me. Anytime I hear the slightest crackling noise, my heart starts racing. It's a stupid fear but I just can't seem to get over it.


TL;DR: Spontaneous combustion, by chance I heard the sound of crackling wood, other crackling sounds since then are putting me on edge.",25May2018,1
45,"It seems like 3 out of every 4 posts I make on Reddit are censored by the tyranny of automods.

I despise automods.  They are symbolic of laziness and people who do not want to give up 'power' and I use this term as loosely as possible.  The thing is some of these subreddits have millions of people but rather than take on a slew of ready willing and able moderators they turn to robots.  

They absolutely suck.  The worst is explainitlikeimfive.  Your post automatically gets removed and you have to fill out an asinine form and hope the moderator is in a good mood.

I had a question about all these privacy policy updates.  If you actually read them you'll see they all invariably promise never to sell your data yet they say they share it with advertisers and third parties.

I had asked a question if these people are getting anything of value from these third parties and how that transaction doesn't constitute a sale.  It just doesn't make sense to me to give away something of value without getting anything in return.

My question got instantly modded and the automod gave the reason as ""this question has already been asked"" and it linked me to a previous submission.

The question it linked however was ""why do big companies like Coke and McDonald's still advertise?""  This question has absolutely nothing to do with my question so I filed a dispute.

Well it's been 12 hours and a moderator determined that the automod was correct and my post never saw the light of day.

I just want to thank this subreddit for not being lazy... Please don't change.",25May2018,1

47,"So the other day I was smoking a zoot and I really got to think about my finals which I’m doing at the moment. Lately I’ve been slacking in terms of never paying attention in class and treating school as something to put up with until 3pm instead of a chance to learn. I’ve done terribly in my finals so far, can’t imagine how I can get more than a C, if that, in the majority of my subjects.
I guess I was just recalling how when I was young I imagined myself working hard to get into university, how I was so judgemental of the people in class who were always way too absorbed in their phones than paying attention to lessons. I’ve since had bad problems socially and mentally, attempting suicide and having to take a full term off of school, how I thought somehow I’d get by without actually having any dreams or inspirations other than video games and the internet. I guess I’ve matured since then, kind of realised what it truly means to have a life, how others will move forward in life while I will always be the same.
I guess it’s just ridiculous thinking how I expected so much of myself and I only come to let myself down, I don’t know if I think I can recover in time to actually get my life back on track.",25May2018,1

I've been working for a large healthcare company in a call center for about 2 years. In the past 2 years I was promoted to a leadership position. Money was great, the hours were long, and my wife was happy with all the money. All of that sounds great, right? No.
I took more than I could handle. My time with my family stared to disappear, my life as I knew it was no more. In March, I decided that I was going to drive my truck into a pole before work... 

One morning, on the way to work I was looking at each pole thinking ""will this be the one?"". As cliche as this may sound, the song One More Light by Linkin Park came on. I stopped my truck and just sobbed. I cried. I ugly cried and I just couldn't get myself to physically stop. 

All I could think about was my family. Instead of doing something I couldn't take back, I did something else. 

I looked for a job in an industry that I'm interested in. After much searching and interviewing, I've finally found a job that I think I'll really be able to enjoy. If anything, I've got a new lease on life. I am happy to be here and I'm happy that I'm making a positive change in my life. Today, I walk out the doors with a fresh start.

57,"So this ones a fun one. About 3 weeks ago I (m18) broke up with ny ex (f17) Reasons: I couldnt be myself without her judging me. Wanted to see a movie she didnt like im ""weird"" or ""trashy"" want to have a night out with friends, she gets moody, want to spend a day with my brothers, she gets moody. Want to listen to music that she doesnt like im a ""chav"" or ""trashy"".

She sucked the life out of me. I was truly miserable. I was with her 2 years, i had felt like i loved her, but ended up hating her for about 8 months before i finally broke up with her.

If i said or did anything she didnt like, shed threaten to break up, but never did. Always to keep me in check.

So when it was my turn and i try to in a respectful, calm and polite way, break up with her, she threatens to blackmail me by sending my parents a text (i live with them) about how i once did LSD and was breaking up with her to do it again (wasnt true). 
She constantly asked if there was anyone else. No there wasnt.
She said she wanted to be friends. So i knew that she knew, if she sent that message, i wouldnt be friends with her and in her life, so instantly i knew she was bluffing in a way to manipulate me into staying with her.

I try to be friends with her for a few days. She calls me one day and tries to have a go at me about how unhappy iv made her and how im ruining my life by ending it with her. I told her to ""get the fuck off my back and harrass someone else"". Prior to this in our ""friends"" period, she constantly made digs at me about how i would become a drug addict or alcoholic for one time trying lsd. And how i had nothing planned for next year (this is my last year in college), so how i was going to fail in life. She had access to my netflix and facebook.

So facebook. I had messaged someone, she quoted what i said, in full phrases. When i clocked on she was reading my facebook messages, i checked active devices and there it was ""Iphone 6S Plus: active 9 minutes ago"" her phone. I screenshot it, sent it to her and confronted her. She straight up lied and accused me of making false accusations against her. I told her to never contact me again. Blocked her on everything.

But netflix. She changed the email to hers, and the password, and kept my card as the payment method. I found out, called netflix and got it resolved. Kicked her off the account. She had left a present. She had deleted my profile and replaced it with one called ""acid lover"".

I then changed my name and passwords on everything. Because fuck this bitch.



3 weeks later. We are here. She messaged me yesterday morning. I had blocked her number but android shows them in junkmail on the OnePlus 5t. 
They said ""something urgent has happened""
""And it involves you""

I hesitantly unblock her, ask her what it is, and she says she had missed a period.
She says how last time we had sex, she was on her period, not about to have it, or coming off it. She was in the midst of it. She takes leostrin 20 i think its called, that controls her period into having it every 4 weeks. And is also a contraceptive pill. The last time we had sex was the 10 of may, and she said she was already due on now but hadnt come on. It hasnt even been 4 weeks. I go along w it and say ""get a test, see what it says, double test, if its positive make a doctors appointment"". She replies with ""oh but i have to tell my mum to make an appointment"" she completely avoided the tests statement i made. So i replied ""well see if you need to make an appointment first by doing a test, and surely you can make an appointment in agreement of its privacy away from your mum"" at this point im very skeptical this is legitimate and shes not trying to manipulate me.

She replies ""no i have to be 20 to make an appointment myself"" i dont know about this, what laws are like in the UK for this. 

And i tell her to take a test, straight up.

She replies ""STOP GETTING PISSY I ALREADY HAVE ONE""
and i said ""good, take it""

""Stop being so childish and a prick"" 

I told her clearly that i didnt want a kid, and if she goes through and has one, I'm not going to be there. I dont care if i come across as a dick, but im not in the position to, and fuck having anything whatsoever to do with miss psycho. 

She said ""theres something wrong and i dont know what, it hurts really bad but i dont feel like im coming onto my period"" and i said ""so test, see what the fuck is going on""

Shes not taking a test, and shes being rude and shit while all this happening. Making digs at .""the father going backwards in life"" 

Your thoughts? What should i do to deter if shes really pregnant or bullshitting me?
If shes bullshitting me, what are her intentions in doing this 3 weeks after breaking up with me?
This putting a lot of stress on me and i can feel my patience leaving whenever i talk to her. I think its bullshit, butt a part of me is worried she isnt bullshitting and that she might be pregnant? That part of me is probably being irrational, its that fear of having to pay child benefits for the next 18 years and having to deal with her bullshit any longer.

Whats sad is that iv been really happy and upbeat with her out my life, and these past two days has been some of the most stressful.
