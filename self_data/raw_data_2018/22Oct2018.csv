We live on our own and barely scrape by as it is. I always wanted to wait to have kids so I would be able to properly support them. I have no idea what our living situation is going to turn into now. I don’t feel ready to have a child, I still feel too young. I’m dreading having to tell my parents, I already know how disappointed they’re going to be.

10,Ever since I was a little girl I loved stories where the characters get magically shrunken. I've always imagined myself shrinking too. I love the idea that you could shrink and become so cute and teeny tiny. Shrinking will make your whole life a totally cute itty bitty adventure. Imagine that one day you shrank. It would be like you had a totally different body and life. It would be like you became a so much cuter version of yourself. Your friend could put you in her pocket and take care of you forever. You would literally be by her side forever from then on. It would be like you exist to make her happy and be her friend 24/7. Every meal would be like tea time with the doll. So cute! You will wear super cute doll clothes from now on and every time you change it would be like playing dress up with the doll. I would love to get shrunken so much that I really would do it in real life if it was possible.,22Oct2018,1
11,"So, I watch this web-show called RWBY. (If you don’t know what it is, don’t worry about it.) I will go over my history with it.

I really like this show. I’ve been watching for over 4 years now. I wasn’t there since season 1, but I picked it up early season 2. It was started by a company, Rooster Teeth, with, at the time, not much experience in fully animated shows. So, in the beginning the show did not come off as being very well made to some. To others, at least in my case, the show seemed to have a really cool concept. Not to mention, this kind of stuff I was seeing was really fresh and new to me at the time. Even today, this show still gives off so much charm. Despite how it started, it received great reviews. 

Anyways, this show has improved SO much over time. The story has gotten deeper and more enjoyable and the choreography and animation has had updates and the creators continue to use to it’s potential. Honestly, I love this show and I see it going great places. At least, that’s how I see it.

I am subscribed to r/RWBY and it’s meme page,     r/fnki. I also am a well known member of a rather small (I guess you could say cozier?) sub-community for it on a remote social app called Quiz Up.

The people in these communities have made great creations from fan-art to cosplay. Just, a lot of passion put into projects over this little show that became rather huge. I love that stuff. I even got to sort of know a few through online and I can call them friend, at the very least.

But, people have been complaining. For over the past few years. I personally started noticing complaints after a certain person, Monty Oum, suddenly died in an accident. This was during season 2.

Rooster Teeth produced this show. But the idea came from Monty who was employed by RT before RWBY to work on animated sequences for a show called Red vs Blue. Monty was apparently a huge add on to the team because he is considered a wiz at choreography and 3D animation.

He was also a person with a lot of heart and motivation. Those that knew him at Rooster Teeth, as well as others, wept for him. Personally, I hardly knew enough about him before he died for me to gain an affection for him due to my timing in getting into the show. But, he seemed like a pretty cool guy. 

I can see how his image and message has been hugely implemented to the background of the show due to how influential he was. You can see it in a dialogue option here and there, as well as some songs in the soundtrack.

I have read many arguments that state that without him, the show has taken a bit of a dive in quality. The reasoning I heard typically went along the lines of “the animation and choreography is awful now” and “the writers do not know what they’re doing”

As far as the writing complaints, they mostly started in season 3 when some characters died. This was the first time the show started feeling tense. Before then, it was very happy go lucky.

Many welcomed this darker turn the show was taking. But, there were some that state that the writers only killed off these characters for shock factor and that it made no sense for the plot.

This goes into Monty dying meaning the show is dying. But, the writers have said during Q&amp;As how Monty actually left a lot to work with and that most, at least, all of season 3, was planned. Not to mention, it’s not like the writers are running out of material to work with. They were there with Monty from the beginning. They are writing this story now, but Monty is absolutely on their minds while doing so. This story is just as much their’s as it was his.

Despite this, some claim that they lied about it being planned. Others claim that it was still bad even if planned. 

Throughout seasons 4 and 5 people have continued to complain about the writing among other choices made by the people at Rooster Teeth.

I could honestly hold arguments I feel confident in about why I disagree with all these things and more that I hear and read.

But, the point is that I hate seeing all these complaints that I just can’t fall behind.

Do I have things I would change? Sure. A dialogue option here, a little extra fill in there.

But I still like the show. I like it a lot. I understand that I have opinions just like everyone else. But, I have just felt lately that the community feels a lot less like “we enjoy this show” and more like “we want to enjoy this show”

It just feels kind of toxic what with it being on top of a very similar situation I have to deal with irl (differing world views with the person I live with)

Idk, I guess I’m just kind of sad about it and there’s nothing I can do. :(

12,I used to picture myself lying on the sidewalk in front of the building I worked in but I would take up the whole block. I would still be human but just totally another scale. It wasn’t because I wanted to do destructive things it was more because I felt so overwhelmed and exhausted from being sexualized. I don’t know if that makes sense. At the time it was a fantasy that comforted me. I needed that job but I was sexually harassed every day while I worked there. ,22Oct2018,1
14,"24 F here and my life just feels like it's getting worse. I can barely sleep due to nightmares and I also don't have the energy to get up and do anything. I haven't done laundry in like a month and I'm just crying over everything all the fucking time.

I'm also in the military. I've been in for four years and my depression is getting in the way of my work ethic but no one understands that. I recently started seeing a therapist and I kind of sugarcoated how I'm feeling because I don't want to get kicked out. I told him about my nightmares and depression but I conveniently skipped the part where I constantly have extremely invasive thoughts of suicide and I'm also bulimic.

I just feel really fucked up in the head and I don't know what to do. I've already seen two of my buddies get kicked out for depression and I don't want to be next. Is there a way that I can get better on my own? I feel like I have no drive to do anything and I just hate this so much. ",22Oct2018,1
15,"My 25th birthday recently passed and I have to say that I did feel disappointed about being a kissing virgin, much less about being even a never-had-sex-virgin. I've never bee in a relationship and sometimes I wonder where I'm going wrong or if being alone is just something I have to make peace with.

A few years ago I did meet one guy who did express sexual interest in me, and whose said that their standard for a partner was that they just had to be female. Well, I guess I passed that requirement, but I didn't want to have sex with a guy who conversations with increasingly would include sexual references, even when I expressed my disapproval.

I have tried to put myself out there twice recently, too, but I think I came off as too desperate and awkward. One guy at the gym I tried to give my number, but I bumbled, blushed, panicked, and in the end was rejected. It was bad. And very embarrassing. But also strangely rewarding to have made the attempt in the first place. And it's good to be rejected every once in a while, since it motivates you to reflect on where you can improve.

The other guy seemed nice enough, but our small talk was dry if not friendly, and then he ghosted me. Oh well.

I think to myself that life is just a numbers game, and that it takes risk and a lot of attempts before one success comes. But I also think that, well, what if I don't have much to offer? I might have had a decent looking face, but years of stress, depression (I've since climbed out of that hole), and difficulties in life have left their marks. Do I have time or energy for someone else in my life? Am I still just not worthy to be in a relationship with someone who I respect? Do I need to keep working on myself? Will I always just have to keep working on myself by myself?

Sometimes I just want someone who I can rely on to hold me and to lean on for a little bit. Just for a little.

But maybe some things aren't meant to be for some people. I don't mind being alone for the most part. I feel like I've endured too many things on my own and for too long to mind being alone. For the most part.

But I get wistful sometimes about whether things could be different.

But life moves on and the years will just keep passing by.",22Oct2018,1
16,"I live in the basement of a house and the only other rental space in the building in empty and has been for quite some time.  I was just getting out of the bathroom when a crash that sounded like it came from above me made me leap out of my skin.  Oddly enough I sat down in my living room, literally shaking and just carried on with my morning like nothing happened.  That sounds dumb I know but a random bang isn't cause enough to call authorities (it turned out a picture had fallen off the wall in my own apartment) and I have no means to defend myself so if I went looking for a possible intruder I'd be walking into my death.

So what do I actually do if this happens in the future?",22Oct2018,1
17,"I want to watch Infinity War at the moment but since I haven't seen every marvel movie since 2008 I feel like I'll be missing out on valuable plot points.

I'm sure they made it so that it's still somewhat entertaining and interesting to someone who hasn't seen every marvel movie since that is probably a good portion of the films audience anyway.

Still, it really bugs me so I can't decide whether to watch it or not.

I'm sure I'll get around to seeing them all at some stage but I feel like watching infinity war right now since it's the newest and I am not currently in the mood to binge every Marvel film I haven't seen yet...

While I'm on the topic of franchises, does Fantastic Beasts fall under the same umbrella with the Harry Potter franchise or is it pretty much a completely separate story?

18,"This could be a long post, so I’m sorry in advance.

A little over two years ago, I told a boy liked him for the first time. I’m also a guy, so yeah. I was in denial about liking guys for almost 8 years at that point and that was the first time I had ever admitted it to myself or anyone else. 

Fast forward a month, and we got together. He was my first relationship. I fell in love pretty quickly. He was great, you know? Now, fast forward 3 months. One night he told me he was talking to someone about life, and I told him he could talk to me about life. I wanted to be there for him. So a few days later he told me he smoked weed regularly with one of my friends. That hurt, really bad. Now at this time i was pretty sheltered. I hated the fact he was doing that, and at the time, I thought it was the fact he was smoking weed but the more I think about it now, I think it’s cause he lied so long. Anyways three months later, even though I showed my disgust for it, he didn’t even slow down. So I asked him to stop. I just wanted to see if he cared enough about my feelings to stop. Then three months later I found out he was smoking, again, without telling me. Then another three months later, I find out, through a friend, that he is smoking tobacco. So it was constant lying and me finding out through other people..that’s what hurt. Then we broke up. A month later we got back together, and it felt good. Then I found out he was vaping with nicotine, again, without telling me. All I wanted him to do was tell me. But he continuously lied. Then a couple months later, I found out from a friend that he had gotten completely wasted the night before without telling me about it. At this point I was done. It wasn’t the fact he was smoking or drinking, I’m cool with that now and I was cool with it at that point. It’s that he kept lying to me.

I didn’t feel like his best friend because of all of this lying. I wasn’t happy. I tried breaking up with him and he wouldn’t let me, he was manipulative. And he was my first. So it was hard to let go. I started talking to a guy, platonically, but it turned into a lot more. He gave me that emotional fulfillment that i needed. I liked him so much. I was still with my ex though. Then one night, my ex found out about him and read our messages. He made me quit talking to him, which I get. I would have done the same. But then I finally broke up with my ex, and now I’m talking to that guy again.

That guy really liked me, and I really hurt him cause I lied to him about having a boyfriend. And i hurt my ex, really badly. I know what I did was wrong. I’m not denying that. I know it’s wrong, and I would do anything to change it. I’ve worked really hard to come to terms with it, but i still hate myself for what I did. That’s what I’m struggling with. I legitimately hate myself for what I did and I can’t seem to shake it. The guy I’m talking to keeps telling me it’s okay and that he forgives me..but I can’t forgive myself for what I did. I can’t believe I hurt both of them as much as I did. It’s almost unbearable. How do i quit feeling so bad about it? I know i need to feel bad for it. But it’s to the point it’s fueling my depression pretty bad, and I have got to figure out how to get a hold of it. 

The guy I’m talking to keeps telling me it’s fine, and that I have got to move past it. I’m not even a victim in it, if the victims have moved past it, shouldn’t I have moved past it by now? I am just still really really guilty and I feel so awful. I don’t know what to do.",22Oct2018,1
19,"I find this incredibly frustrating and hilarious at the same time. 

Dad has always been a “frugal “ person. (Nice way of saying he’s so cheap.. I mean it) 

Okay so he has always been so cheap and this always happens and yet he does it over again. It’s like he never learns. 

Here is the most recent example. My dad always wants to buy old crappy cars. His I guess life motto is “good, nice, and cheap” or something like that. What he means by this in car context is that he wants cars to be 2015 and up, low miles, and cheap. I’m like bruh that impossible-.- but he never listens. It’s like talking to someone on  r/choosingbeggars 

Okay so he bought this 2006 Prius a while ago. He got it for 6k and at the time it was a good deal but my brother put on so many miles on it. Me and my brother have repeatedly told him to sell it while it’s still worth something. He tried to sell it for 5k (had 150k miles at the time) and I’m like bruh... 

Okay so tonight I took the Prius. I got home got on the driveway and it wouldn’t turn off. I took the key out of the car went inside etc and it wouldn’t turn off. Like wtf. I then went to get dad and apparently it had happened before so he knew how to fix it. He needed to get in the trunk tho so he tried and guess what? THE TRUNK WOUSLNT OPEN

21,"I’ve had my cat for 14 years. She’s my pet, yes, but she’s also more than that. She’s my best friend, my comfort, my reason to keep pushing on. Is it stupid to put so much of my emotional well-being on a pet? Is it pathetic? I don’t know. But I don’t care. Pets are more than that, they’re family, friends. She has helped me through a decade of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I don’t think I’d be alive today if I hadn’t had her walk in on me tying the noose. But she did. And I realized I didn’t want to die. I want to spend as much time with her as possible because she’s my cat. My friend. She brings me so much joy.  
But now, she has kidney failure. It’s still in the early stages. And she’s otherwise healthy. But still, I now KNOW her death is inevitable. I knew she would die eventually. But I guess it never really sunk in because there was no clear “when” she would die. But now, “when”, isn’t a far-off thought. It’s now. It’s happening. She IS dying. Right now. Slowly. But surely. Her kidneys are slowly shutting down and as more time passes, the closer it’ll be. I don’t want her to die. I always felt I’d have her around forever. A stupid fantasy world looming at the back of my mind. In forty years I’d still be snuggling her and playing with her. 
I won’t be. I know. I always knew. But now I know for sure. It’s set in stone. Soon she will be gone and I will feel more empty and lonely and depressed than I ever have before. ",22Oct2018,1
22,"Feel like r/self is my diary since I post so much here 😐 

I’m so nervous. On Friday I got some news that has been so idk “significant “? Idk the right word lmao but yeah. On Friday I was told I might be shipping off to boot camp on Monday (this Monday). Ever since I got that news so much has changed, in a good way. 

Background: 

My parents have always been abusive. I tried to get away so many times but living in California has made it nearly impossible. 

I have always wanted to get In the marines. I don’t know why but I always have. At some point it wasn’t even possible. One year into college and it was finally possible. It took a little longer than expected but I finally made it in. 

So, so much has changed since I was told. I had always planned to cut my parents out of my life once I left. Since I was told on Friday I’ve been thinking and thinking about it, trying to idk.. “feel bad” or find a reason not to but it’s been 3 days and I don’t even feel a little remorse for what I’m about to do. Feeling this way just makes me want to go even more. 

I have also struggled with extreme insomnia for the majority of my life. I take cocktails of sleep aids on a daily basis to be able to sleep. On Thursday my melatonin ran out and I had a hard time sleeping. (Didn’t sleep at all) then Friday night when I was told I slept so well. Last night I would’ve normally taken an extra dose to be able to sleep but I didn’t. I knocked out almost instantly though. I also napped for 2 hours in the day which would’ve made sleeping impossible but I did sleep. I was so excited that I might be leaving that I guess that took my insomnia away? Idk.

My coworker didn't understand why I found that so interesting but it instantly made me remember using that phrase just days earlier. Shortly after the call the man did show up and even had his name badge on from the motorcycle shop he evidently works at which showed his name as indeed being Happy so it wasn't an odd joke or anything.

24,"Hi, my name is Alex…

I have never posted within /self before, and wanted to get some things off my chest with the idea and hopes of getting some feedback, or advice regarding my “emotions”. Now, I don’t really have the available funds to go and seek professional help, and I do believe I might need it regarding on how I feel, but sadly not within the cards at the very moment. 

I have been struggling for a while now I would say, if I had to put a number on my “dark passenger”, would be around 8 years give, or take. Nonetheless, I have been struggling with expressing or providing any kind of emotion towards others. Let me make it clear, I understand emotion, I can process it, and can clearly read people and understand them, but I can’t show any empathy towards anyone, not even my family. I actually, get to a point within my mental breakdown when it feels like I want to cry, or express tears, but simply can not. 

Family wise, I been told my whole life I am destined for greatness, something big and world-changing, but just doesn’t feel it, nor seems like it. I feel like I am just either growing, or just stuck in between like I simply don’t belong to anything, or anyone. I grew up most my life hearing, and being compared to other kids, and “why can’t you be like John”(example, no idea who John is tbh xD), or kids your age have A’s, and manage a job. Moreover, my mom always finds a way to blame me for everything in her life without even putting the idea in the table, I really didn’t do anything. Always to blame. However, my father is a little different for several reasons. Before I get into it, I would say I live my life in my own bubble, I don’t enjoy bothering people with my life, or talking too most. My good day would be like hitting the gym, watching a history movie and having a nice cup of tea or wine without anyone. I keep most things inside me, and guess use humor, or even dark humor to hide and conceal everything as a mask. Now, towards my father, I have opened up to him about my issues, feelings and how I felt I was drowning. Which he replied with, “you are being delusional, and everything you are saying about abuse, is fake” stop seeking attention from others. Now, I have never wanted, nor cared about attention, but those words hit me hard. Like a hard punch to the stomach hard. 

After that day, I been called a failure, a rotten apple, and ungrateful beast with no remorse, or care for anyone but himself. 

I have been compared to others my whole life, physically and mentally abused throughout my whole childhood, and teen-hood. I really do not know what to do...I just feel day by day, night by night, this dark hole inside of me, that is eating me draining me alive is getting bigger and bigger and slowly I’ll just disappear. 

I feel angry inside, and I really want to take it all out, but I feel like I’ll be proving them a point, I just don’t know how to manage myself, nor my emotions. I simply do not feel, nor care about anything. No motivation, nor interest in living, just wanted to get this off my chest and hope for something…

27,"So essentially speaking I spend a lot more of my phone time browsing reddit, Either it be scrolling for an hour and a half or refreshing every 10 minutes, I spend most my time on reddit.
Why is that? It’s because regardless all the social media apps I have on my phone, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat Etc, I never feel much connection with anyone because no matter how many I try to reach out to, talk to, ask how their going, at least 1-2 out of 10 people will reply back and on the off chance they do, the texts just seem... Dry, There’s no emotion, no feeling, Just no connection.
So for a long while I’ve always never enjoyed social media’s, mainly for the reason that for apps that meant to keep people connected and entertained, I rarely get that feeling.

Where as with reddit, It’s a Whole community, People all over the world sharing close to the same personalities, emotions, laughs Etc.
Reddit has this incredible ability to make anyone on here to feel that even though you have no idea who/what the other person is going through, you feel a connection when you interact with their comments/posts.
A lot of my internet happiness comes from reddit, Even though I know not any of you, But because I know some of us are all connected with the same problems.

28,"This goes back many years to my Jr. High and High School days, but for some reason I was thinking about it yesterday. 

There was a girl who lived two doors down. We'll call her Sarah. We met in Jr. High, which for me was two years of sheer hell. I was pretty awkward back then, definitely not a cool kid. 

But Sarah was cool (or so I thought). She would come over to my house before we headed off to school. She'd come over early enough to put on her makeup, because her mom was super strict about that. We'd walk to another friend's house and get a ride (but honestly? I was never invited to hang out with them beyond that but was too clueless to catch on). We maybe hung out a few times here and there. In High School we drifted apart, but that happens. Then she disappeared halfway into the senior year. Turned out she was pregnant. But she graduated. After that I completely lost touch with her. 

Okay, it's been years since I've thought of Sarah. But in my thinking yesterday (which was triggered by a Twitter conversation I was having with some other people, of all things) it finally hit me. She was constantly putting me down, picking on me, teasing me, really subtle cruel shit. And not so subtle. Once in the locker room after gym she loudly teased me about the underwear I was wearing (it was cute, not dirty, torn or anything) and that caused the a lot of the other girls to start teasing me about them too. 

Sarah was a fucking bully.

1- What am I going to miss out on?

33,"Using a throwaway cuz friends know my real account.

So 5 years ago my family decided to move to a different country which i didnt even know existed back then. The first year we went to a private school because i understood english and not the native language + my dads job paid for it (one of the reasons parents took the offer). It was already scary since i’ve been with the same class/friends since age 2. When we started i couldnt speak english whatsoever since i only ever had to read/write or rarely talk.

So i got thrown into EAL (forgot the meaning). it was a program for people like me who werent the best at english.

Now even when i was a small kid i was thiccer/fatter(muscular?) and parents used to buy sweets often since we didn’t really know the “dangers” of it. So i became a sugar addict and i got/still am a fat fuck.

My hometown friends never gave a fuck so i never even noticed how fat i was. As soon as we moved here i was self conscious of everything about me; my weight (obviously), height (was the tallest guy), the way i spoke, the way i was sitting...

At the end of the year my dad got fired and we had to switch schools just as i was starting to “calm down” . we went to a different private school that was paid for by my dads new job and i was there for 2 years. 

This school was much bigger than the previous one and everyone there was a hardcore extrovert, so i never even made a friend.

In those 2 years i got signed up for this country’s language lessons which i had 2 times a week.

After those 2 years I transferred to a normal school since i had some knowledge of the language. There was a small problem with this though, it was the last year before high school (European school system). So it was already hard for me, and just to make things worse the country decided to introduce government tests for the final exams.

So the year ends i fail the first round of exams and am in the top 10% for the second round since those were just the regular school tests. Again i made bo friends in that year and i already got used to that, but the hardest part was keeping my grades just above a fail.

Highschool starts and it’s even harder than the final year of school. My grades got worse because the school was oriented into subjects i was bad at or i despised. I started skipping some of the lessons because it was already too much for me to have to sit in the first row and be so self conscious about myself + a lot of the teachers were stricts snd didnt care i barley spoke the language.

I finish the year with bad grades and i had to have fix up(?) tests at the end of summer or i would repeat the class so i never even got a break.

Now i’m in the 2nd grade and im already getting shit grades, and they replaced all the good and nice teachers because parents were complaining that the teachers were giving out free good grades to help the students (was a lie btw). So now in subjects i did ok in last year im struggling even more. 

I thought about suicide ever since i found out about it. Usually i think about it at least 5 times a week, i’ve formulated a lot of plans on how to do it but i dont want to give up on life just yet.

I’ve been thinking of dropping out (legal to do at age 16 here) and just working in construction for a few years then maybe become a truck driver or something like that. i was always good at some technical things and carrying/moving heavier things. Even now when im a fatass im still better than 1/3 of the class in PE, obviously my cardio is bad so i cant do it for long but im still working on that. 

I don’t know what i should do because i definitely wasnt buit for being smart, or if i was then my chance at that is long gone.

34,"I was fired three days ago (the reason being kinda sketchy and when I asked for specifics my manager couldn’t provide any but that’s not what I wanna get into) I was fired and the first thing I needed was a cigarette. So I smoked while I sat in my car crying. This was my first job, that I only picked up a few months ago. I felt like an absolute failure. I somehow managed to graduate high school but I was always holding off on my plans for the future. As all my friends were in college, here I was being fired from a pizza place. A complete failure, sitting alone in my room, wallowing and smoking cigarettes. I’ve been smoking for well over a year, and at this point I got nothing out of it. That fuzzy, disorienting yet comforting feeling that nicotine gave me was gone. I only smoked out of habit. A habit I’ve been meaning to quit for a long time.

35,"I've been sick for the past couple of weeks but have also been on holiday in a Pacific island; I didn't want to cancel my holiday just because I was sick. However, it was a borderline call, as I felt pretty crap right up until and after I left my country.

I've had some cool experiences during this trip, but the cloud of sickness has hung over the whole thing. I had a sinus thing and now also have a very bad throat infection which I've seen two different doctors here on the islands about. I'm getting the swab back tomorrow, but am already on antibiotics and have been for over a week. Now have switched to another one. Nada so far.

I wouldn't wish this level of throat pain on my worst enemy. It feels like I'm swallowing broken glass. It takes two classes of painkillers and a vinegar water gargle for a mild respite. The sinus pain has cleared up somewhat but was horrendous at times until the last couple of days, particularly on flights (due to change in air pressure I guess). This holiday has been pretty bleak at times due to my sickness, even as it has been punctuated by moments of beauty and wonder. 

What is my point here? That I've realised something - I'm sick of sickness. Now, and in general. I'm sick of pain and illness that drags on for weeks, despite the forces of modern medicine, and serves no purpose but to make existence miserable. The fact that religion exists in the face of such arbitrary and pointless physical misery irritates me from time to time, too. 

I like seeing people who are healthy. I like myself when I am healthy. I like seeing the body as it is meant to be - in good form, free of the ravages of random illness and disease. But sickness is so pervasive - it seems like everyone has something all the time. Sometimes I wish nothing more than to be completely free of physical symptoms for a while, just to feel that feeling. 

Anyway, I've ranted enough. You're probably as sick of my ramblings on sickness as I am of sickness itself. But this holiday has been a real existential challenge, and I needed to get this off my chest (like a respiratory tract infection :p) ",22Oct2018,1
36,"I may have ran back to what broke me in life and now I want to get out of it because I'm living a lie. Basically I'm not being true to myself and the people who I live with don't want to move forward with their lives.

What do I do?

Do I risk some of my finances for my mental freedom, because I can't even study within this environment and even If I go out there in the world, when I think about doing something positive then I just start thinking about those negative thoughts that I'm stupid (Because I'm living with a stupid person or somebody who doesn't care about progressing in life but wants to live off others).

Do I go abroad and travel and then end it?

Do I find and rent my own place and continue my passion or art (music)?

Do I find my own place and go back to school?

Hence since where I live affects my ability to study and think positively because I feel like I'm becoming like the person whom I live with.

Do I go away and find a path that's different?

I have limited funds I guess and no assets and looking to find a loan but It's hard since I don't have a job or any qualifications. Feels like my peers are passing me by and moving to jobs and graduating with degrees etc. I'm just sitting in one place and...

I don't know, what am I doing wrong.

Procrastination?

No goals? They're there but I keep on making excuses

I need money for schools since I don't want to study locally - only about $20 - $30K

in bank and my life is shit.

Where abroad can I study?

Or what can I do ?

I love music but it's been five months since I haven't touched it at all, well I have but I didn't complete it.

Do I get a apartment and become a YouTuber and try to make music online and see if it will work.

I like electronic music hence this is why I need a loan to study abroad since it's popular there and the environment will be alright.

37,"I'm making a mini Halloween party and invited people from a group (3 other people are in the group) to it.  
Person 1 is a good friend and it was his idea initially, so I know that he'll come.
Person 2 even said she had a costume and was wondering if she could get a day off (initially it was planned on the weekdays, I changed it to the weekend tho later).   
Person 3 never replied to that. I already assumed that person 3 won't come. We never really did much together, the only thing connecting us is person 1 mainly. So basically I think he isn't fond of me. So I already expected him not to come.  

Anyway, so person 1 wrote me a few days ago saying that person 3 won't come. He copied the reason, too, to me it sounded like an excuse, but maybe that's just the demon behind me saying that. He wrote that halloween isn't his thing, so he the party wouldn't be his thing either.   

I also started to wonder, like a few weeks ago, that person 2 also won't be coming. Also got the nagging feeling, that she isn't fond of me. I can imagine she also doesn't want to go ""alone"". She and person 3 are dating. (which is funny, they're only dating because I made an event and invited them, where they met).   

So, today, person 1 writes me he has bad news, person 2 won't be coming either. Yeah, I told him I saw that one coming. But what annoys me is, that she did not tell me or wrote it in the group. Instead she told it person 1? That's what annoys me. I don't mind if it is being cancelled, what I mind if you dance around it and don't just tell me.   

Another thing that was also happening. I was wondering if I should invite person 4. I was being polite and asked the group before inviting him. The group said they didn't liked him that much. Bummed, I say OK.   
Days passed and I pumped myself up, telling myself ""ya know what, I get to decide who I want there. I'll probably have more fun with him then with them (2 and 3). He at least understands fun the way I do. They just wanna sit around...   
So I invited him. So now 2 and 3 won't be coming and I'll be surrounded by people that actually like me and will have fun with.",22Oct2018,1

45,"I’m 25. I’ve never felt like this as intensely as I do now, and it’s been going on for more or less 2 years.

This wasn’t an issue during my youth, and my first job was so entertaining most of the time that I didn’t get bored either. Plus, for that job I moved into a big city for the first time in my life, and the new location, experiencing big city nightlife + awesome coworkers that partied a lot made it impossible to feel bored.

Well now I’ve been in a more ‚normal‘ job for 2 years and though it’s not bad, I feel kinda meh about it. I am looking for something else but not quite sure yet what exactly I want. Basically I’ve just felt like my life was mostly boring and uneventful since I left my first exciting job. Way less partying, older and more ‚boring‘ coworkers. I feel like I should find a way to compensate for that in my free time, since I can’t rely on my job always being super interesting. I do try new hobbies occasionally, I travel when possible (restricted by money and vacation days, obviously) and I meet friends and do my hobbies regularly (weekly). And yet I still feel bored like it’s not enough, and sometimes on ‚bad days‘ I can feel like I’m not fully alive or like I’m not entirely in my body. 

What helps is exercise, which I do regularly, and things like concerts/parties, basically anything that gives me new and intense sensory input. But still there’s this boredom and being stuck in a rut in the back of my mind. Like I need a bigger ‚change‘.

The past 2 years I was ill and nobody believed me until I had proof, I lost all my friends during that time as I couldnt see anyone, got debt because I couldn't do a job anymore, had to give up the place I had fought for in an art school, I ate only toast and bananas in that time and even that gave me terrible stomach problems, leading to me getting severely underweight. My mother is a narcissist so that made it even harder, as she tried to hide me and blamed me for it, not listening or now acknowledging when I told her I was in pain or didnt feel good.

I always pulled myself back out of the mud, I managed to power myelf with hope and motivation, still, it was pulling me down into a depression, I stopped brushing my teeth at some point when I didn't expect to live much longer.

I fought and found my diagnosis, had surgery 6 weeks ago, it was a huge and complex procedure and pretty risky, especially with my weight, I now have 3 scars, one across my entire abdomen, one across most of my left thigh and one small on my stomach because of a second surgery I had on the day after the major one to suck out blood from an internal bleeding. 

I am eating a lot more than before surgery already, but I am still nauseaus a lot and have stomach cramps every day... the doctors said it would take 6 weeks minimum for the GI problems o get better, but I am so afraid it will stay like this or get even worse again... 
Everything hurts, I can barely even take a shit as it feels like my insides are tearing apart, my leg is swollen due to the fistula and I havent gained any weight so far, I can't even escape into sleep as I keep waking up after just 4-6 hours, my body aches and is tired, but I cannot rest.

I have nobody I could talk to or with, here at home I am looked down upon, my mothers boyfriend dislikes me and laughs about me every opportunity he gets, my mother talks shit about me behind my back with him and my sister, gaslights and manipulates me constantly, I am the crazy person in the family everyone wants to get rid of. They urge me to get a job and do this and do that now that I had surgery and pay rent to her boyfriend. I have the least rights in this house and whenever there is a problem, it's always me who gets the blame, I even get my internet blocked every evening until next morning by her boyfriend, while my little sister is free to use it all she wants.

I have no bit of money, everything is I get is from fucking surveys and that I use to buy my meds and stuff I REALLY need as I dont want to piss off my mother even more as she already gets annoyed by buying me food.

I keep wanting to draw, thinking, I have time after all, but each day passes and I dont get anything done, I just sit here and think, I cant think of anything I would want to draw and if I do it just seems undoable, ""just try then"" I think, but I never do, I just waste my time, despite wanting to create, wanting to do so much and try out. 

Not even my future looks promising, even if I were to recover completely, the education as game designer I aspire, costs so much, but now that I turn 21 in november... I dont want to waste more time doing something I dont like to get somewhere else. I wasted so much time already.



I am stuck here, in this body, in this family, wanted by nobody, just endured by everyone.

Nobody else to reach out to, nowhere else I could go, nothing to relieve my pain.

I thought I would feel better, happier, but so far, I just seem to feel worse,  I dont know what I expected, a more loving family, to be stronger, to have my body recover better..? 



I don't know anymore, I just want to finally be able to sleep and wake up from this nightmare.

Why not give 1 week of reddit premium for the user who made the post/comment? It doesn't need to be 1 month. Let this for the gold tier.

But no. It is just a different like button. A fancy up arrow. What is the point?

I understand people want to give rewards to other, this seems to be an integral part to Reddit. But why play with people giving nothing in return even after they help paying your services after they bought your coins?

58,"Hi, this is embarrassing and trivial to admit out loud to a therapist or anyone so here goes. I graduated college a year ago, but cannot help but feel that my depression during the time over there and pretty much my entire life holds me back from enjoying things and experiencing things, which ends up making me feel even more depressed. I've thought about applying to grad schools to experience the things that I did not get to when I was in undergrad such as joining a sorority, becoming a member of a group, starting an organization, and even getting on the dean's list. At the moment, I just got employed by another sales company (that's work from home, but at least it's not another outside sales job). Do you think it's dumb to actively try to look for grad schools that will provide me these things, and go for my master's or do you think it would be a waste of time, even if I was looking to do something specifically with that master's degree? I ideally wanted to work as a public relations specialist or content writer of some sort in a big city with pay affordable for living, but I feel like I've been idealizing that for too long and it's just not gonna happen. I wanted to be one of those people who went out to different places and travel and stuff also, but again realistically living in places like New York is expensive as hell and not many entry level jobs will be able to support that kind of lifestyle. I was doing freelance writing on the side, but I don't want to only work from home in the suburbs. I don't really mind it, but it's what I've been doing for a while since being laid off from my old job before I was able to get this new sales job I have now. I have a couple interviews also lined up for places in-house locally to me, but I just feel the need to escape somewhere for a while or do something different I haven't done before. I think I'm also resenting a lot of the past and feel like it's the reason why I'm feeling alone and just being swept up by waves now in the present. I'm afraid of further drowning in the future though things happen, I somewhat feel a sense of nostalgia over things for no reason, even if I didn't experience it or only mildly was involved in it.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: I grew up in a neglectful household. We were incredibly poor, food-insecure, and would regularly go days to weeks with one of our utilities cut off. My siblings and I had an emotionally and verbally abusive stepdad, and a mother who was emotionally checked-out.  I truly believe that my mother did the best that she knew how to do, but it honestly wasn't enough. Being the oldest, I ended up taking on a large portion of my family's burdens. I started working when I was 14 so that I could provide clothes, school lunches, and school supplies for myself. At 16, my mom finally left my stepdad, which meant that I had to start contributing financially to the household. I began working full-time while going to high school so that I could help feed my siblings. At 17, my home life became incredibly unstable and so I began moving in with various friends for a few months at a time until I was old enough to get a place of my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite all this, I graduated high school with a 3.7 GPA.  I got my own apartment at 18, enrolled in college full-time, and continued working full-time so that I could support myself. I had no support whatsoever beyond being gifted some starter furniture by some work friends when I first moved out. To say I worked my ass off is an understatement. For 5 years my life consisted of nothing but work, school, and sleep. I had zero free time for fun or relaxation. I also felt an immense amount of pressure to succeed in school and break the cycle of poverty that I was born into. I felt like any failure would immediately send me right back to where I started. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last year I graduated college with a good GPA and got a job that I absolutely love making a nice salary. I am in a happy committed relationship, live in a nice home, and have a dog that I adore. I feel like I could not ask for more out of my life right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I feel like the last 10 years of my life have completely drained me all of youth, optimism, and general enthusiasm for life. I am just so tired. All of my hard work has paid off for sure, and I am incredibly grateful for what I have, but damn. I feel like I am 50 years old on the inside. I am planning on applying to grad school next year, and cannot find any motivation to study for the GRE/build my resume. When I get home, all I want to do is relax and indulge in all of the laziness that I've missed out on over the last decade of my life. I figured that after a few months of resting and recharging, I would begin to feel like a normal 24 year old who is excited to get out and see the world, but it has been a year and a half and I feel just as exhausted as the day I graduated college. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me or anything like that. I guess I am just curious if anyone else has had a similar life experience and found themselves feeling similar to how I do? If so, how did you redefine your life and find your enthusiasm again? I don't want my past to define me or my worldview forever. I guess I am just waiting to magically feel recharged again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel I should add that I generally take good care of myself and am in good health. I eat well and manage to exercise occasionally. I am not (completely) wasting away on my couch. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I had a very rough upbringing that has left me feeling absolutely drained in my mid-twenties. ",22Oct2018,1

9 years ago, I met my dream girl. We were together for 8 years, and the last two were horrible. I suffer from bipolar pretty severely. I literally did nothing but drink and cash unployment checks for 9 months. I was the worst kind of boyfriend. I offers nothing in the relationship and took all that I could. 

We had a terrible breakup. I moved out and stayed with my mother. I was 35. This tore me up inside. My ex and I messaged eachother every single day, that we were apartand i would drive to help her if she needed anything. 

We each had flings and S/O others during our two year breakup. I surfed couches and even lived in my car at a walmart parlking lot. I was in shambles. I was finally able to receive medical care and meds for bipolar. These meds have been amazing. I feel like what I imagine normal people feel like.

After a short stay in a psych ward, my ex messaged me telling me she was pregnant, and the guy who knocked her up wanted nothing to do with her. He is 40, has 5 kids already and works as a fast food employee. Worthless as tits on a skateboard. I promised her that id anything happened i'd come back and help her. She refused all my help and insisted she could do it on her own. I was already living with a girl, was a terrible alcoholic. One night after a bender, she attacked me amd called the cops on me. Tried to have me arrested. Needless to say I bailed. 

My ex fiancee, now 9 months pregnant opened her hom to me again, she couldnt handle seeing me homeless. Ive been staying with her and her disabled mom for a month now. Ive been paying for everything, cooking, cleaning etc.  Her and i share a bed, and ive made it very clear that I would do anything to help. We don't act like we are together, its strictly platonic. She knows how much I love her, but I won't ask her to make lide decisions when her hormones are going ape shit.

Last night she went into contractions, we took her to the hospital and 3 hours later she gave birth to a healthy baby girl. I couldn't be happier for her, and I really feel like a father to the baby, even though im just a friend now. 

She texted ger babies father, and he couldn't bother to respond. So if you see headlines of a dead beat dad with drill holes to the back of his knees, hashtag me.

Sorry for the excessively long post ",22Oct2018,1
64,"I take medications because of which I can't drink or take drugs, also I can't have sex because of two distinct problems. One is I get some weird side effect from the medication which causes all kinds of symptoms during sex, and the other that I have an extremely low sex drive, probably due to autoimmune disease which isn't being treated effectively. Also when I could drink I would drink alot and never feel any good feelings, just emptiness. Probably because I was depressed at the time. I hope that's the cause and not that my body is an anti-party machine. Also the medications I take aren't no picnic either, they cause depression on top of my current feelings. I just don't understand why it's like this. Everyone else is having sex, drinking and doing drugs and having the time of their lives, except me. I feel like I'll never be happy again. It's so futile yet I get up every morning and act like nothing's wrong. Shitty way of life..",22Oct2018,1
65,"I asked her if she was dating anyone, how far away she lived from me, if she liked the school we were going to, and then I said bye. ughghh She probably thinks I'm a total ass lol. I should've made some conversation or something. I could tell she liked me too because I always catch her staring at me constantly, which is why I approached her at all. 

I never want to see or talk to this girl again, way too awkward now. I'll just learn from this and move on. ",22Oct2018,1

68,"High school was a weird phase for me. I was so depressed and I had a bunch of other things going on. I was so fat and I didn’t care about my appearance. I also had selective mutism and really bad anxiety. I never said a word throughout high school. My teachers would act like me saying “yes” or “no” was a huge deal because it was. 

The last teacher I saw I went to ask for a recommendation to enlist in the marines. He didn’t recognize me at all. I had to tell him who I was for him to recognize me and even then he was so shocked at my appearance and the fact that I was actually talking.. 

Today I saw my PE teacher at my sisters meeting. I was translating for her. I walked in and they all were like “hi, nice to meet you. “ and proceeded to introduce themselves. My PE teacher was there and was like “hi, nice to meet you” and I’m like staring at her surprised at how she looked (she started wearing make up) and she noticed I was looking and just looked away. One of the other teachers was talking and while I was translating I heard my PE teacher “OHH THATS (my name)!! HE GRADUATED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO!” Lmfao. 

My teachers always wondered why I never said a beep throughout high school. It’s a secret I’ve been holding on to for so many years but I’m so glad I finally got out of it. 

I can’t decide if seeing her and her reaction to me makes me happy or if it’s just depressing. Sure she was very shocked at my appearance and how much I have changed but what’s that worth if I can’t say why I never talked and why I was the way I was? 🤷‍♂️",22Oct2018,1
69,"The way my middle school works is that 8th graders eat lunch last. I was hungry and had a headache which caused me to be nauseous. We were watching a video in social studies and all of a sudden, vomit just spewed from my mouth, all over my hair, shirt, jacket, desk, and the floor. I sit in the back corner and the room was dark and everyone was focused on the video that no one noticed until I walked up to the teacher covered in vomit. Anyone have a similar story? :/",22Oct2018,1

Walking home at 3am, recently.  A car pulls up ahead of me, in a small car park strip.  At first I thought that this person was going to burglarize the shop.  A guy gets out and opens his boot, looks, then shuts it. I think I saw this guy holding a Corona, he was definitely holding a glass bottle.  
As I passed, I smiled and waved, he waved back. I saw he was smoking.
 I continued up the road and turned down a street.  A few minutes up the street I see headlights and I am 90% sure it was the guy but just assumed he was going home. 

I cut across a park and see a car pulled up ahead of me.  I walked up and crossed the road.  I hear him say ""hey"".  I stop and have a conversation with him.  Didn't think it would be too bad because I am a guy and I was in a relatively safe neighborhood with lots of streetlights.

The conversation was mostly innocent, however another red flag that caught my attention was that this guy changed the subject to my sexuality and previous experiences, I didn't feel comfortable, so I alluded to having experimented.  In hindsight, this is where I should of ceased contact and run.  But instead I returned the question.  He then asked if I needed a lift.  And when I declined, he asked if I am looking to have some fun.  He asked a few times.  

I said no, goodbye and have a nice night, walked a few blocks and turned.  As I watch the  guy in the car turn up the street I was on.  I dialed 000.  When he pulled up and I sternly told him I was on the phone with police and he should leave.   Thankfully he did.  

Big thanks to the person on the other end, who stayed on the line until I got home.  


tl;dr
Walking home late at night, see a guy, think nothing of it, until after he follows me and asks about my sexuality.  Say goodbye and walk away, call triple 0 because he followed me further.  When he pulled up, told him to fuck off and he did.


I am curious about how sinster this guys intention was.  I doubt he was desperate, his actions seem to suggest he was trying to gauge how vulnerable I was. 
 Also, what's the likelihood of this guy coming to this neighborhood again?",22Oct2018,1
71,"I know that is something many people experience, after all, r/aww is one of the biggest subreddits for a reason, but for me it is a bit different. 

I never was a dog person until my family got a pup last year. This sweet sweet girl made me sometimes experience ""shots"" of sincere and positive emotions, almost crying. Dogs always give you their love and it makes you overall happy. Sometimes I find a touching story about a dog being a good boy/girl and it just fucking destroys me. For example [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/9qfcuf/dogs_are_angels/). I know it has been said by everyone everywhere on reddit but we really do not deserve dogs.

I am not sure there is a point for this post, maybe I just wanted to share something unique that I have started experiencing ",22Oct2018,1
