0,"My [20F] self esteem has spiraled down once again, which is just confirmed by the fact I’m on reddit. Whenever I post, it’s usually becauseI have things I can’t talk about with anyone else and the responses I get make me feel good. 

I’ve started to fight with my boyfriend [21M] again, which I can acknowledge is caused by his miscommunication and my hot temper working together. He says the cause of this on his end is his mental illness; he’s not in control of himself when he’s manic, and he hardly even remembers the conversations later. I just get really angry when he disrespects/disregards me, and that causes me to blow up. I’ve always had anger problems and I’ve been doing better with controlling it, but I 100% will not allow myself to be disrespected. 

I’m deeply ashamed of how I get when I’m angry, and I’m working on it no matter what, but I’m unsettled by how we chose to move forward. His solution, until he gets help, was to tell me that I had to be more patient and lenient with him for the time being. To me, that basically says “I’ll do or say whatever, but don’t yell at me for what I do to you because it’s not my fault.” I hate that. 

I love him a lot and I want him to get better, but I hate that he asked this of me. I feel like it would be stripping myself of dignity and willpower to just shrug my shoulders and move on whenever I feel like he’s mistreated me. That doesn’t feel healthy for me. 

We’ve mostly worked past this, but now I’m going over to his place this weekend and he mentioned that he probably wouldn’t feel like being intimate. There’s another hit to my self esteem. Everything I’ve ever done wrong is crashing down around my ears as a possible reason or explanation for why he doesn’t want to be intimate with me, when he never would have missed the chance before; especially since we’re living pretty far apart now. I feel like I did a good job of standing up for myself, but I feel myself compelled to stop, to make myself more desirable and wanted. I feel dejected, and I want to feel loved and paid attention to because that seems to me to be the natural cure. 

Tldr I’m just sad and I want my boyfriend that I’ve fought with to know that I love him, but I have to take care of myself, and I wish that taking care of myself didn’t seem like it was directly counter to him desiring me. ",03Aug2018,1
1,"Alright, so I’m 16, and I’m starting to think about my future seriously, as in how I’m gonna be able to survive outside my house with my parents support. And I have realized, how the hell am I gonna be able to afford anything??

I have a job, and with minimum wage, by the end of summer, I should be able to save around $2000. I want to be able to buy myself a car since my parents won’t be able to afford me one, but I just looked it up and found that the average used car today is $20,000! And that’s the car alone, if I get a car I’ll have to get insurance, gas money, extra money in case something happens to it, etc. Not to mention all those expenses are just for having a car alone, what about all the expenses for living alone, going to school, etc. The kind of minimum wage job I have now is obviously not gonna cut it with the living expenses. 

Obviously, I’m not expecting to move out anytime soon, but I was hoping to a little after I turn 18. But now seeing these calculations, I just don’t know how. So I want to ask for advice. All of you guys who were able to move out early, how did you do it? Is there some kind of monthly payment plan for example, in getting a car if you can’t afford to just slap down $20,000? Is the trick just saving up as much money as you can from whatever job you can get? 

If there’s any books for teens to learn about finances you can advise, that’ll be great too. I have soooo many more questions about credit, bank accounts, taxes, ect. that I can’t ask here at once. Please help!!",03Aug2018,4

3,"i’ve [17F] recently noticed that i become very attached to my my male friends. 
I’ve been best friends with these two guys, both during different times of my life. I had strong feelings for both of these guys... getting upset when i don’t hear from them, wanting to hangout a lot, etc. 
I found out today that my ex best friend said to one of my other friends a while ago that the she thinks the reason i get attached to guys so easily is because my dad isn’t in my life. 
To clarify, my dad is in my life, he just doesn’t live with me &amp; we don’t have a strong relationship. 
I’ve been thinking about it and maybe that is the reason I grow attached to my guy best friends like this, it never happens with my female best friends. ",03Aug2018,0

I posted a video on my story at a concert and she messaged me saying she loved the band, and we talked a little bit about music.

The next morning i saw i lost a follower and it was her and now i cant see her profile at all

6,"This is going to be cheesy as fuck to are with my cringy story.

I just went out on a coffee date with a girl I met on bumble. The date was lame. And I think she was uncomfortable at the end because I think she thought I was following her when I was just walking to my car. I couldn't really get her to talk to much about herself and I avoided talking about myself. We just rolled over the same subject over and over again. She was nice but we didn't mesh well. This date was a blessing in disguise.

The reason I say it's a blessing is because of this other girl. I have feelings for her. I've known her for a long time. I guess part of the reason I went on this date was to be sure that this other girl is the right person to be with. The hard part is that I now I have to ask her out on a date. This terrifies me but I can't wait because I don't want to miss out and miss any chance I have left to be with her.

12,"I gotta be honest, I have never had a decent title.  I gotta let this out because I feel so depressed right now.  I hate posting at all because you get the worst advice, but I need to talk.  


My SO and I have been together for a long time.  On Friday of last week he had off and so we needed to do some chores.  He never wants to do any chores.  Never.  He always gets angry and raging when he has to do chores.  At work he works so hard that he has got two promotions, but at home, he doesn't want to lift a finger except to cook which he loves.  But he won't clean up.  So I end up feeling like the maid.  We had to do some paperwork, some of which is his last Friday.  He didn't want to do it.  I had asked him on my birthday for him to do it because it is too emotional for me to do.  He said yes on my birthday.  But a week later when it came time to do it.  He mocked my feelings and kept insulting me and degrading me to the point that I said something angry in return.  He throws something at me and starts to stomp away.  I get up and ask him to stay.  He says more insulting degrading stuff and I give up.  I text him some angry texts because he hurt me.  He didn't come back and hasn't talked to me since Saturday.  It is Wednesday and I finally saw him today and he was still raging.  This all isn't new for him.  He loves to rage and throw temper tantrums and stomp off and be cruel.  I wish he would calm down so we could get back to normal.

13,"Like the title says. First I go to chance for a group bicycle ride with coworkers after telling them I was going to, and when I come back downstairs they've left without me.

Next I go with some other coworkers to a bar, and the lyft starts to drive away as I'm trying to get into the fucking car, almost leaving me behind.

Then, I get back to work and go upstairs to get my things, and they forget I'm in there and almost lock me in the building.

To add salt, I find out the coworker I've got a crush on is seeing someone, and they might even swing the other way, or both ways, I don't even fucking know.

I got the hint the universe kept dropping me and said fuck it and rode my bike home still pretty tipsy (stupid) instead of the work party celebrating the anniversary of our launch.

So here I am, two beers in and drunk as fuck because I rarely drink and haven't eaten anything since this afternoon, ranting to strangers on the internet because I don't have anyone in real life to talk to. I don't even like the feeling of being drunk either ugh.

15,"Maybe it’s because I’m just around the fitness community too much, or maybe it’s because I’ve had to go on very heavy medication for my depression and anxiety, but man, I hate how now that gut health is a thing that’s come into focus, people are saying that if you have either disorder, it’s just due to bad bacteria in your gut. 

Yes, gut health is important, and yes, there are studies that suggest that it functions very similarly to the brain, but fucking hell, if one more person tells me that my mental health issues can be cured by drinking ACV and taking probiotics, I’m going to flip a table. 

Definitely not discounting the fact that in some people this can be true, but the more of these “natural remedies” there are (especially ones punted by fitness/health influencers) the less likely people who may need medical help are going to seek it.

Certain blindly optimistic elasticity in the eyes starts to sag. (not that there was ever a child at home.) And BAM! ""There's my nose. You can see it in the lights. Right there by itself!""

19,"So i've been thinking lately that people really seem to tune out invitations a lot these days. I'm talking not bothering to reply or forgetting to reply. Especially if the invite comes from a person you actually consider a friend, it's pretty rude to not care about saying a simple yes or no and leave the person hanging. Or, deliberately saying nothing waiting for a better plan to roll along. People don't seem to appreciate that planning and organising an event takes effort and preparation. 

Recently I quit a lot of social media because that way I wouldn't get an invite on say FB and not notice it, appearing rude. There's just too much going on there, people can message my phone and I will for sure let them know if I can make it. Plus with so many options for people these days it just encourages one to gloss over everything.

I would love to plan something where friends can come together, and i'm even happy to provide food, drink and a guest room, etc. but despite that I have a feeling only 5% of the invited people will actually reply me back. Yeah, I know people have jobs and lives these days but people throughout history have had jobs and lives. I would say there are more distractions these days leading to more superficial connections between people. This post is to hopefully try and inspire people to value people trying to reach out to others. If you get an invite, it's probably because your company is valued.",03Aug2018,2

22,"I used to have a lot of friends. I'm 17, went into ind. study my senior year, graduated back in May. Had a lot of friends, everyone at my old school knew me. I had a lot of extracurricular activities going on - snowboard team, track and football, drama, all of that fun high school stuff. Girls would show interest in me, guys would want to be my friend, like it was genuinely a good time.

I lost a lot of friends when I went on ind. study just because I wasn't seeing them every day. As well as that, I dropped everyone close to me, created a lot of distance. Broke up with my long term girlfriend, outcast myself from my regular social circles. It's been a year since all of that happened, and I feel so lonely.

My newly adopted hobbies (writing, music, fashion) doesn't have a lot of pull in my city (Redding, small norcal city), and they're not exactly social activities. I don't really have my old conventional methods of creating friendships and networking socially. On top of that, I'm leaving for the Navy in November, and everyone knows that. Girls hardly ever want to commit romantically to me despite mutual attraction and physical interactions due to that, and people don't want to get close to me. Only people I've seemed to touch base with and sort of get to know are people who don't know that, and as soon as they figure it out or I disclose it they get distant. 

How the fuck do I make friends? Like I get it's not super easy, *but it's not hard*. I used to do it all the time, like my social media used to be popping, people would constantly come to me just to chat and shit. The only sort of social interaction I get nowadays are the ones I force out of people. Even my parents hardly talk to me anymore. 

I'm not exactly ready to accept that it's *me* that's the problem yet, but I've entertained the idea that it's a possibility. I'm not really here for a psychoanalysis though, I guess I was just wondering how to network? how to reach out to people and make friends. Am I just romanticising high school because I subconsciously miss it? is it even worth it to try and make new friends? I'm gone in 3 months, should I just sit in my room and work and shit until I'm gone? Would that just be easier? ",03Aug2018,1

30,"I'm watching Terminator 2. 

I love it! I've loved it for a long time. Of course it's an objectively good movie, but my love stems from the nostalgia derived from it. For the same reason any emotional catalyst in this manner, it conjures up familiar comforting feelings paired with a yearning for the past, but it also because it reminds me of an earlier time in my life. A time in which my brother and I chose to watch it over and over again when we stayed at your place every second weekend.   

In all honesty, I don't think about you too much, and when I do, I don't pay the thought too much attention. For around 15 years now, and it's hard to recall my feelings exactly throughout this time, but as far back as I can recall, considering your existence and role in my life hasn't bothered me too much.   
All of a sudden we no longer stayed with you, and we no longer saw you, and that was that.  

When I have thought about you, it has been purely in the realm of mind as opposed to the realm of the heart. In other words, I haven't felt sadness, or anger, or anything other than curiosity as to what the fuck happened and why, and that state of mind is almost emotionless as far as I can tell.   
I've often questioned ""Should I feel upset that you were willing to cut contact with your own children over seemingly *nothing*?"", or ""Should I feel angry for the same reason, and because you foisted the financial burden entirely onto the mother of your children?"", and although I have felt righteous indignation for the latter reason in recent years, for the most part, I'm emotionally numb in this regard.   

But watching Terminator 2... Well I began to feel something, and I'm not even sure how to explain it. It's not a singular definable emotion, but it did initially seem like sadness. I cried, perhaps largely due to the effect that nostalgia has on me period, but I don't think that was it. Although now, as I write this, as I crystalise my thoughts, I begin to feel anger swelling up inside of me.
My mother, the woman you married, picked up all the weight you dropped and more. She sacrificed whatever she could for us. She played video games with us. She cooked for us. She put us through school. She was there for us. She loved us. She gave a shit, and has not relented in giving a shit, and you said ""Fuck her and fuck her chilrden"". You, shortly after leaving, ceased paying child support, and she is not a wealthy woman. You fucking colossal cunt. You heartless, spineless, human sack of fucking shit. You cowardly, childish, selfish excuse for a father.

I imagine how I'd react if you were diagnosed with a terminal illness, and in your realisation that time is finite, you feel the unquestionable *need* to finally explain yourself and reach out. I imagine... How would I deal with this? I might not have to, and you may just evaporate from this earthly realm leaving us in the same situation you have for 15 years, but if you did... How would I react and proceed. You of course wouldn't know this, but I've come to believe forgiveness is a great virtue, but you pose the greatest challenge to this line of thinking. My perspective oscillates between ""You're just as clueless as the rest of us humans navigating this subjective experience, and you made mistakes, but shouldn't go to the grave holding onto that regret"" (*if* you regret it), and ""You don't deserve a fuckin' ounce of my attention, you made this bed, so sleep in it eternally"".

Ultimately, here we are, and I feel as if I've developed into a relatively intelligent, compassionate, healthy adult, and although you weren't there to see it, I've done well without you. But I do wonder about you. I wonder where you've been and what kind of person you are today. I wonder how you were emotionally able to withdraw so readily. But above all else...

...I wonder why.",03Aug2018,1

The drunkard wrecked his flat, punched a hole in one of his neighbours' door, and bent his old lady neighbour's mailbox with his big head.

To call him visibly drunk would be an understatement. Before coming home he parked his car in a way that blocked an entire lane. After his violent rampage was over he made his way back to the car.

The cops were already at the scene of the crime. Did they apprehend him? Did they try to stop him from driving away and causing more carnage? Of course they fucking didn't. After all how could two highly trained first responders possible stop an old drunkard?

They let him drive off, bumping into a lamppost and damaging it. Afterwards he almost hit a young lady with two kids who were crossing the road.

33,"For example they say we're 60% water by mass, and 98% of our molecules are water molecules. There's a few major issues with this -

1. If we were mostly water, we'd die of suffocation since water interferes with oxygen, water being around cells would drown the cell.

2. People allergic to the H2O molecule cannot drink water obviously, but they rely on things that aren't water like milk or orange juice, and they're perfectly healthy despite going years or even their entire lifetime having not drunk any water.

3. Water dissolves living flesh, just put your hands in a sink for a while and see how the skin turns white and starts pruning up? If our bodies were so watery we would have turned into mush on the inside.

4. Just because there's a clear liquid in our bodies doesn't mean its water. For example acetone is a clear liquid that looks just like water but it's a completely different chemical.

5. People's flesh can catch on fire. Ever try lighting a water soaked towel on fire? You can't do it.

I woke up at 7, my stomach was killing me. I’m so anxious that my stomach started hurting then I got uhh.... starts with d ends with a lmao.. so I took pepto. I’m still so sleepy but can’t sleep anymore 🤷‍♂️

Yesterday I met with my recruiter. I so so nervous to even call him but I did. We did the prescreening questions over the phone and I qualified, great. I went in, took the little test and I thought I was going to fuck it up and get an amazingly low score but it was actually really high. I expressed to him that I was interested in enlisting as fast as possible and he made it happen. I’m taking the PiCAT today at 11am, after that he’s sending me to MEPS within the week. 

I’m so terrified of failing or getting disqualified on the medical exam. I’ve always wanted this so badly and I have worked my butt off for months to make this possible. ",03Aug2018,1

42,"“*You will never change your life until you change something you do daily*” \~ Mike Murdock

Think about this. You are the product of what you repeatedly do. Each small action is telling of who you are. 

**Consistent small action over time develops into a habit**. Habits can MAKE or BREAK you. This means you need to be aware of everything you do. If you put thought and intent into your actions, you can develop good habits that will put you on the path to success. 

**I know this is true because I experienced both the good and bad sides of habits.** 

I used to be weak and pathetic. I was unable to handle stress - with my mind and body working against me. I thought it would *magically* change one day. That I would wake up and everything would be better. After years of thinking like this, I learned the hard truth. It was not going to change unless I made it change. It took time and effort, but I learned how habits could make or break success. After trial and error, I have developed habits that work best for where I want to go in life.

My misfortune was the result of falling into bad habits. Without consciously being aware, my mind programmed itself to crave poor performance and ill health. My biggest problem was the tunnel vision that came with it. For the longest time, **I was not aware of the mental prison I subconsciously built by adopting bad habits.**

Below you will find 5 habits that made **great** change in my life. The results I have gotten in adopting these habits would seem **unachievable** to my former self.

These 5 habits are:

1. Eliminate Escapism
2. Dedicate Time to Personal Growth
3. Stop Comparing Yourself to Others
4. Consistent Sleep Schedule
5. Outline Daily Goals

Each habit is outlined with a 3 step approach. 

1. **Problem:** This is how I **was** living my life. A description of the troubles and pains I experienced without any **structure** and **discipline** in my life.
2. **Motivation:** This is a general outline of *what* the habit is *and why* you should adopt it.
3. **Result:** This is a testimonial of how my life changed as a result of adopting the habit.
4. **Consistent Sleep Schedule**

### 1. Eliminate Escapism

**Problem:** I spent more energy in video games than I did anything else. I would spend entire days playing video games. If I was not gaming, I was watching YouTube videos. The fact of the matter: I was wasting my time. My grades were not too awful; however, these distractions were not helping them. I had little motivation to do anything more than play video games. I actually viewed it as a purpose in life. While I will touch more on this in the **motivation** section, my video game *friends* viewed me as the leader of the group.  As such, I felt an obligation to these friends. I saw it as a duty to be the best. This evolved into a *cult of personality*. My friends viewed me as an unstoppable, infallible force to be reckoned with. They wanted to be just like me, which inflated my ego.

The game I drained countless hours into was *Left 4 Dead 2* from 2009.

When asking myself why I was so addicted to this game, I found four answers.

1. **Simulation of Competition**: My friends and I would queue up and play against other teams. We played to win. Though the game is almost 10 years old, we took the game VERY seriously. So much so, that we would be very nasty toward new players. 
2. **Simulation of Friends:** The guys I played with had similar interests to me - something I could not find in real life. We were in similar life situations. The most important detail is: we had mutual music interests. Pink Floyd, Alice in Chains, Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix. **We were more interested in depressing music**(Pink Floyd).
3. **Simulation of Skills:** I was acclaimed to be one of the best players around. I had been playing this game since its release in 2009. I felt that I put so much time into the game, I should not squander my skills by quitting. On the contrary, I had few real world skills. This was one of few places I felt I offered value to someone
4. **Simulation of Adventure:** For many, it feels like *everything has already been done*. The world has been explored and there is not much for one to discover. A man was already to the moon. Just about any useful form of technology has already been invented(and you would need millions, if not billions, to compete in that market). And, there is no more originality in creativity
5. . Without much more thought, I decided to give up on real-world motivations. I had this interesting video game world that offered me new, exciting experiences for hours on end!

**Motivation:** **Video games KILL your motivation**! But, it is not video games alone that do this.

Social media, TV &amp; movies, and drugs &amp; alcohol can all have have the same effects if they are indulged in too often.

These are forms of escapism. They offer the user a substitute for experiences they are lacking in real life.

Here is how each form of escapism acts as a substitute:

1. **Video Games**: Video games offer the player adventure and excitement. The most popular of video games such as Fortnite are enjoyed by groups of friends who compete with other groups of friends. This simulates group-oriented conflict. I believe conflict to be especially important in the bonding of men. They suffer together. They grow together. I believe this is why video games are mostly played by men.
2. **Social Media**: Social media offers the user access to all the people they know at a click of a button. This works well for people who want to connect but are uncomfortable to meet in person. They can hide behind the image of their Facebook profile and have discrete conversations with friends. **This makes it especially easy for those who are insecure to hide behind ambiguous text and lack of emotional expression in voice and body language which you would get with an in-person conversation.**
3. **TV &amp; Movies**: TV &amp; Movies are driven through story. While these stories are often fiction, they are written to be emotionally relatable. They give the viewer an emotional experience. These are often emotions that the viewer is lacking in their own lives. For instance, in watching *The Wolf of Wall Street*, the viewer cannot help but feel the excitement in Jordan Belfort’s claim to wealth and power. This type of lifestyle is especially coveted by young men between the ages of 20 to 35 - **the movie’s target audience**. Surely, if the viewer were as wealthy and as powerful as Jordan, they would be spending their money on huge parties instead of watching that movie.
4. **Drugs &amp; Alcohol**: Substance abuse usually stems from the inability to cope with certain emotions. For instance, alcohol, colloquially known as “liquid courage”, suppresses anxiety, giving the user *courage*(ignorance of anxiety) they previously did not have. While the user does not forget about their troubles, they no longer feel the negative emotions associated with them.

**Result:** It was difficult to believe video games were ruining my life. **I experienced feelings similar to that of one with stockholm syndrome**. I wanted to leave, but at the same time I enjoyed comfort in my virtual captor. Breaking free was **painful, but worth it.**

When I became aware of **why I was addicted**, I found my problem easier to fix. I attacked each contributing factor individually. 

1. **Competition**: I learned to compete with myself(*such as developing these 5 habits*). This gave me the drive to win over myself. These were real-world victories that made real-world change in my life. There was no longer a virtual abstraction that made my efforts realistically pointless.
2. **Friends:** As I developed who I was and what I wanted in life, I naturally began to attract similar minded people with my words and actions. This has turned into a mastermind group of people guiding each other to greater success. It is important to note that there is NO leader. Before, my ego was in love with the idea of being the leader. Video games were so narrow in the skills required to compete, one could master them and be the elite. **But, in the real world, there is so much to know and understand, you would be stupid to think you can master it all by yourself.** You need high quality friends that not only offer experience and fun, but that also offer you an opportunity to grow.
3. **Skills**: Having established a group of friends whom I grow with, I began to specialize in skills that offered them greater value. I have friends who are knowledgeable on fitness, business, and finance. In turn, I found a liking for media and entertainment. I spent about a year consuming as much information as possible on how media is designed and how I can make my own. With this knowledge, I gave my friends insight on how they can market their businesses and themselves.
4. **Adventure**: I learned to enjoy the journey of life. I began to enjoy simple trips to the grocery store. A walk through a park. Or, a conversation with friends. Each day became a new adventure full of new people to meet and new things to learn.

### 2. Dedicate Time to Personal Growth

**Problem:** Once I eliminated escapist habits, I needed something to fill my time with. Video games were taking 6 to 8 hours of my time each day. This time needed to be repurposed. I wanted to be a better version of myself but I was not sure as to how. **Where do I start?**  

**Motivation:** Your thoughts are where change begins. You must consistently feed your thoughts new perspectives in order to grow. New perspective is a seed that can be planted in your mind. It germinates in your thoughts and experiences, and blossoms into a greater understanding of yourself.

There are multiple sources of new perspective. Here are what I have found to be **most** useful:

1. Books / audiobooks
2. TED Talks
3. Podcasts
4. Conversations (especially with new people)

**Result:** I believe dedicating time to personal growth was the best thing I could do. I viewed each new idea as a tool to be added to a mental toolkit. 

For instance, after learning about habits and how they work in the mind, I have become more aware of how I can maintain good habits. 

Here is what I learned:

*By giving into a bad habit, your mind releases dopamine which reinforces that action - further ingraining that behavior into the subconscious mind. This makes it more difficult to break the habit. But, by replacing a bad habit with a good one, your brain develops neurological systems that mute it and promote the good habit. While the good habit can grow to be stronger than the bad, it must be maintained through* ***consistent action****, or else the mind will retrogress back to the bad.*

**Knowledge such as this has made me more effective in maintaining the 5 habits spoken about in this post.**

### 3. Stop Comparing Yourself to Others

**Problem:** This was my biggest problem in high school. Majority of my peers were on a school team. They were strong, fit, and healthy. I was the tall, skinny guy with acne. I felt my scrawny frame paled in comparison to the testosterone pumping physiques of the football players. This is where I began to hate my physical appearance. My voice was too high pitched. My legs were too skinny. And, . . .my hair was just . . . wtf I had no idea how to style it.

Needless to say, I had no self-confidence or self-esteem. The most I had going for me was academics, but even there I felt I was inferior. 

I was the designated Math and Science nerd. I always carried my Calculus and Physics books with me and I enjoyed tutoring others during study halls. I genuinely helped others get As. It was an amazing feeling to help others achieve their own successes! 

But, the sensation would not last for long because I felt I was failing in my own studies. This was due to competition with another classmate.

In my Calculus class, there was a guy who did not try at all and performed MUCH better than me. While I was at home studying hard for a test, he was goofing off, getting high with his cousin. He put barely any effort in and did better than me. **This boiled my blood.** But, I did not let it get the best of me. Instead, I started to study with him. Although he was goofing off, he still put an amount of effort in - though minimal as it was. I saw this as an opportunity to learn something new. 

But, in the end, I got a B and he got an A. I was devastated. Of what esteem I had, it was destroyed. I would tell myself: “It’s not fair!”. 

**But, out of this misery, I learned a valuable lesson.** I will tell you about it in the *result* section.

**Motivation: You cannot compare yourself to others!** Everyone has different experiences, culture, perceptions, perspectives, and so on! It is apples and oranges!

“Don’t compare your Chapter 1 to someone else’s Chapter 20”. You and I, we are in different places in life. There is no universal solution to everyone’s problems. You must look inward to find your solutions. Use this as an opportunity to challenge yourself! Evaluate your current situation and challenge yourself to be better.

It is important to note that there is a difference in learning from others and comparing yourself to them. When dealing with my academic problem, I decided to see what I could learn from the guy in my Calculus class. This proved to be fruitful in the long run. 

When you are stuck, maybe you are missing part of the puzzle - something your mind is not aware of. Inspiration helps to solve this problem. Look at those who have succeeded in your area of struggle. Take the time to understand their thought processes and habits.

**I guarantee you: your biggest struggle is in your mind.** 

**Result:** Before I knew it, my life was completely different.

Physically, I have become an avid gym goer. I do full body workouts 3 times a week. I have done the research and designed a meal plan that suits my *hard-gainer* body type. In the past ten months, **I gained 20 lbs of muscle.**

Academically, I have maintained a 4.0 in college. This is something I swore I would maintain without fail. I am in competition with my high school academics. Where I got a 3.98, **0.02 shy of a 4.0**, I will get a perfect GPA in a more difficult curriculum.

Reflecting back on studying with the guy in my Calculus class, I learned to *work smart not hard*. He was able to condense my 8 hours of studying into about 30 minutes of effort **by being smart**. His biggest crutch was his connections. He was friends with people who took the class the year before. They gave him old tests, which he used to study. The tests had the same exact questions just different numbers! He had such an advantage!

This inspired me to be more social - which rings true to the idea of: “**It’s not what you know, it’s who you know**”. In college, I found friends who specialized each in particular subjects. For instance, if I needed help with a math problem, I would ask my friend who is a math major. I created a mastermind group for college subjects. This worked best because I understood I cannot be a jack of all trades - something I aspired to be when I compared myself to others.

# 4. Consistent Sleep Schedule

**Problem:** In the past, I was an anxious, fidgety mess. I would bite my fingernails, bounce my knees up and down, and was unable to sit still in lectures. My mind was foggy and I never had energy to do anything. Mentally, I was incoherent and dull. Mornings were the most difficult part of the day for me - with falling asleep being the second. Some days I had so little sleep that I started to lose my mind. So much so, that I tried to develop an online persona of being INSANE(What the f\*ck!?). That’s right! This was a BIG problem! My lack of sleep was starting to negatively affect my subconscious mind. 

**Motivation:** In order to perform your very best, you need to be well rested. There is no substitute for good rest. You want to aim for 6 hours and 30 minutes to 8 hours of rest every night. This is the general amount of recommended sleep for adults. You may require more, so it is best to experiment. I am no expert on the intricacies of sleep; however I know your mind rests in 90 minute cycles. You want to set your sleep schedule to align with a whole-number of sleep cycles. If you wake up in the middle of a cycle, you will feel very drowsy - **making it much more difficult to get out of bed**.

Most importantly, you need to be consistent with your bedtime. In time, your mind will adapt to this time. On the first day, you may find it difficult to fall asleep. But, a few weeks from now, you will naturally be tired at bedtime.

**Result:** My quality of life greatly increased. With enough rest, I had energy to handle so much more. My patience and tolerance grew substantially. Without any thought, I was able to keep still. I no longer dreaded remaining in the same position for 2 hour lectures or 6 to 8 hour work shifts.

Here’s an example of my previous thought process:

*I will sleep after one more game of Left 4 Dead. \[finishes game Maybe one more? Yeah, I can skip my morning routine to add in another game and still get 8 hours of sleep.*

**This type of sleep “schedule” was as consistent as picking a spot on the wall, closing your eyes, and landing a dart on that spot after being spun around before each attempt.**

On the contrary, by having a set bedtime, I felt accountable to be ready for bed 30 minutes before sleeping. As a result of a consistent schedule, I had more time to function each day, because sleeping was no longer a guessing game. This improved my time management and allowed for me to accomplish more in a single day.

I chose to go the extra mile. **I wake up at 4:30 AM everyday.** The mornings are for getting ahead. Waking up early has given me more time to focus on developing myself. Because, after I go to work or school, I am drained of my energy.  But, by being awake early in the morning, I am able to focus all my energy on building myself.

My mornings are for: going to the gym, writing posts like this, meal prepping, and reading.

This is the thought process that drives my sleeping habit:

*Do not devote all your energy to building someone else’s dream.* ***Devote your energy to building YOUR dream.***

### 5. Outline Daily Goals

**Problem:** When I tried to be productive with my time, I always felt a burden of “*how much is enough?*”. I was unsure as to how many things I should do in one day or how much time I should devote to each task. This often left me lying in bed unable to sleep because I felt dissatisfied with my efforts.

**Motivation:** You can only do so much in one day. Without a definite plan, you will likely go through the day either aimlessly or not optimally productive.

Remember: **Time is a precious resource. You only get 24 hours in a day. It is in your best interest to make the most of each moment.** 

Statistically speaking, you are more likely to meet a goal if you **write it down**. If you want to achieve something **every day**, you need to **outline your day**.

**Result:** At first, I started with college-ruled loose leaf paper. I bulleted tasks such as: gym: leg day, physics homework, 3 meals and 2 snacks(for mass gaining), meet dad for lunch, and so on. After completing a task, I felt an immense amount of satisfaction checking it off the list. Not only did this help me organize my efforts, but it gave me a measurable feeling of accomplishment. With completing a day’s worth of tasks, I would retire to bed without the anxiety of underachieving. Having escaped this anxiety, I felt I had more time to enjoy my life. Where I was previously rushing my workout to get home and do homework, I was now stopping to enjoy a conversation with friends at the gym because **I knew I had the time**.

As I grew more sophisticated in my outlining, I bought a **Bullet Journal**. This is a useful tool for determining if a task is worth your time. I use this more for *advanced planning*. That is: being overwhelmed with tasks and having to determine what is really worth my time. It helps you prioritize tasks. You should totally Google it!

 Pro Tip: **Outline your day the night before, so you can wake up with your goals for the day already in mind.** 

## Conclusion

Much of your misfortune may be linked to a subconscious habit. You could be driving yourself to failure without even knowing! 

Your mind develops habits as a result of energy efficiency. A new experience overwhelms your mind with new sensory stimulations. But, as this experience becomes common place, your mind develops shortcuts, requiring less energy to perform the same operations.

This is where discipline comes in. In order to develop a new habit, you must discipline yourself to perform it. It is mentally difficult in the beginning. But, as you do it more and more, your mind adapts. You will be able to perform the same action with a fraction of the effort!

**Discipline yourself today, so your mind will discipline you tomorrow**. ",03Aug2018,96
43,"Right now I’m taking electrical engineering and I absolutely dread it. I was kind of pushed into it by my dad and I’m really only in it to make him proud and also so that he doesn’t kick me out for not being in school. The problem is like I mentioned earlier, I hate it. I want to drop this but if I did, I don’t know what else I would do! I don’t have many interests and all throughout high school I worried about what I’d do in college because I honestly never had a clue. I don’t know what I like and all the courses I’ve taken are related to electrical so I don’t really get a good idea of what my other options are like. I wanna make money but I also wanna be happy doing so. I’m not sure where to go, I’m only 19 and I feel like I’m wasting my time. Before you go “anything you learn in school is never a waste of your time”, hold it. I get that what I learn may help in the future but it’s not something I want in my career.

44,"Sorry for formatting I’m on mobile, also I’m 21:

I guess I have been feeling this way for a long time, at least 7 years.  I am an only child and my parents both have good jobs.  They aren’t the 1% or anything but they make more than enough to provide me with reasonable luxuries like a car that won’t break down and yearly vacations, an iPhone etc.

In high school it wasn’t so bad.  I lived in a south suburb of Chicago but I went to a local private catholic school.  So my friends who lived around me were always poor while the people I knew at school were way more wealthy.  I’m made friends with both and it wasn’t really an issue that I had more than them, maybe we were just too young to notice or care.

In the last half of high school I started a band with my friends and we have found a moderate amount of success (at least for the local music scene). This is when I started to feel it.  I made a ton of friends in the music scene here in Chicago.  A lot of them fall under the “starving artist” stereotype.  They live in shitty apartments with more people than the landlord is supposed to allow because they can’t afford rent.  They either don’t go to college or they are up to their eyeballs in debt of degrees in psychology or music theory or music marketing.  Don’t get me wrong, they are some of the nicest and most genuine people I have ever met.  I always just kinda didn’t let on that I didn’t have those problems, and no one has ever been rude about it, I really feel like it’s all in my head honestly.

Recently it has hit a high.  I go college in Chicago, and colleges there don’t provide a lot of housing.  What they do provide they prioritize for the younger students, so now that I am a junior there is no room for me.  Luckily I have a wonderful girlfriend I have been dating for many years so we decided to live together and split rent for a one bedroom which makes rent easier.  We valued location over just about anything else, and ended up with an apartment in Gold Coast.  It’s known as a place where all the people with fuck you money are.  I’m talking the “old money” people who are 90 but probably haven’t ever had to work.  But it isn’t all porcelain mansions.  It’s honestly the shittiest apartment in Gold Coast and the rent isn’t too bad especially because I’m splitting a one bedroom.  I’m able to afford it because my parents help me out, and I have a good internship in software development.  But now when someone asks where I live, I reluctantly have to say Gold Coast and hear the inevitable “ooo Gold Coast that’s fancy, how can you afford that??”  We also have a door man which sound so snooty but he’s literally like security that’s it.

I know I should feel proud of myself.  I mean I am able to be a relatively successful musician while working a 9-5.  During the year I don’t work full time but my grades are good.  But I don’t, I actually feel shitty.  Like “why should I have more than any of them.”  I feel like I can’t really be an artist if I’m not scraping by at my part time coffee shop job.  None of them make me feel that way, no one even brings it up, but I feel like in the back of their heads I’m not one of them because I’m not struggling.

Man this has to be one of the biggest “first-world problems” huh?  I’m too fortunate let me whine about it.

Anyway, anyone else feel like this or am I just an asshole who should shut up?

Well, we called it putting her to sleep, but the reality of the situation rattles around in my mind and begs to be let free. I can’t hide from the truth in my own mind; I know that I killed you, but I think that it was the right thing to do. 

Your last years were marked by degradation and depression. Your eyes grew rheumy and her vision deteriorated. Your ears were plagued with constant, treatment-resistant infections which eventually resulted in a loss of hearing and constant stench. Your joints failed to such a degree that I stopped walking you out of sympathy, and even climbing the porch steps to see the yard became painful. On top of that, your bladder and bowel control worsened so that cleaning up accidents on pee pads became a common occurrence. 

I tried to make you happy, feeding you treats and giving you attention, but I fear that my frustration at your situation seeped into the masterly bond. I could see the sadness in your eyes, and died a little every time I thought on what must be done.

I still remember when we first got you; an early present from “Santa.” I was so scared of you at first, but soon came to love my dopey little girl. I’ll never forget the time we had together, and all the walks we took. My Dad and I would walk you almost every night when he got home from work, and spend half an hour talking, just he and I. At the time, I had an irrational fear that manhole covers would fall through if one walked over them, and taught you to avoid them as well. That habit remained even years later when I lost that fear. You were such an obedient girl.

I apologize for not walking you much after Dad left. I let my rage at the situation get the better of me, and you were the relationship I most regret neglecting. Still, I hope you enjoyed the walks we took later in life when you and I went on our walks alone. I only wish I could have taken you on more.

It seems so unfair that I couldn’t even communicate to you what was about to happen, and I wanted to rage that your lifespan was so short. I will have a relatively healthy life span of potentially more than 70 years, and you only got just over 12. If there existed a machine by which I could transfer some of my worthless years of health unto you, then I would have done it in an instant.
I hope you enjoyed the hamburger I fed you, and that your last thoughts were not fearful. 

I don’t know if I believe in heaven, but if it exists, then I hope the old saying rings true. With you dies the last connection to the relative happiness of my childhood, and my world is worse off for it. 

Goodbye, my love.",03Aug2018,13

50,"Some days, my job isn't too bad. But on others I have to ask myself what the fuck I'm doing. Especially just for 13/hr. Some days I feel I should make 50/hr.

Some background: The hospital in which I work just reopened the ortho/spine unit (I was told patients pay more to be on dedicated ortho units and so they reopened) , and it has been awful so far.


 The RNs typically run with much fewer patients  on this unit (3-4), and it's assumed that they need to help the nurse's aides because of this, but even when they see me running around like a chicken with its head cut off, they don't. One of the nurses called me while I was taking a patient to the bathroom and had to respond to 2 other bathroom calls to ask if I'd gotten one of her patients vitals. I told her no, I haven't had the time, and she responds back kind of bitchy. I can't remember what she said, but it was moreso the tone she used - disrespectful. This is compounded by my stress. My feet also feel like they're about to fall off because I also worked a 12 yesterday, and took a long walk with my dog the day before. But that's ok. I am moreso just wanting some respect. I'm a 32 year old woman with a BA in journalism and a bunch of experience in it and yet I'm working this job because I hate office type jobs and wanted to work with my hands and help people, and get some experience in a hospital before becoming an RN myself. 


Dear RNs: I just want some understanding. That's all I'm asking for. I don't mind being busy as fuck and doing all the dirty work, I just need you to understand that I have a million things to do, especially the first thing in the morning. If you could take some of the load off and you have the time, could you help me a little and get those vitals? If you don't have time, just please wait for me. I can't control patients bladders when they first wake up, or how slowly granny walks to the bathroom. I can only do my best. Thank you.

Dear patients: I'm sorry I didn't get to your call light within a minute or two. That is sometimes impossible. I know you feel like your bladder is full or feel dirty, but I can't make your neighbor walk any faster. They've gotten a new knee and are in a lot of pain just like you.  Also, the dementia patient next to you keeps jumping out of bed and I have to run in there to make sure she doesn't fall out of bed.

51,"I’ve had a past life full of stressors and unfortunate events. It’s turned me into a very pessimistic person. Most of my stressors are gone and my life is much better.

However, I find myself obsessing and catastrophizing over every little thing. Even the littlest problem is a big deal. I basically live from stressor to stressor. I can’t stop thinking about my stressful event until it happens. Then the next one comes in and I think about that. There is no theme, it can be anything. Every single time, things go as planned and I was scared for nothing.

Anyone I meet, I start complaining to them about my life and reciting my life story. I become the center of attention. I’m starting to realize that complaining about what makes me angry doesn’t make me feel better, it makes me angrier.

When I hold it in, I have nothing else to talk about. I’m familiar with a lot of subjects that can stimulate people but I don’t feel interested. I go to several meetups but I end up talking about my problems rather than the subject of the meetup.

I don’t really have an excuse to whine anymore but I have to giant urge to do so. I honestly can’t really afford a therapist or counselor. I tend to prefer anecdotes anyways since I find it easier to relate to.

52,"For 3-4 months my drain has been getting increasingly slower at flushing the water down. Gave vinegar + baking soda a couple of tries but it never changed anything. Three weeks ago it became fully blocked. I mustered the courage just an hour ago to grab a pair of pliers and unscrew the P-trap. Besides the horrible smell, it turns out there was no blockage in the P-trap. I ended up shoving a wire coat hanger up the drain from below (since I couldn't remove the drain stopper) and fished out a massive ball of hair and other shit that made me jump backwards.

After cleaning up I'm happy about managing to do something by myself for once without asking for help, besides a few Youtube videos.",03Aug2018,8
53,"I graduated high school 2 months ago and now I’m preparing for college. I’ve just met some of my future classmates on a whatsapp group and I tried to say something to get noticed (I really hate that moment when someone asks you “why don’t you say anything”), but everyone seems to ignore me. I sent a “hellooo, kids” message and nobody even replied...Was I weird? 

I’ve never been able to be sociable, to be natural when surrounded by people. I cried a lot at the beginning of high school, when I also had problems with fitting in and I used to stay alone during breaks and nobody wanted to be my deskmate. 

Now I’m afraid it’ll be just the same. ",03Aug2018,1
55,"The subject came up in another thread, and it's mildly interesting, but this is the closest sub for the subject matter.  

I once saw in full color.  

First, I'm color blind.  Not fully OMG-everything-is-black-and-white color blind, but I have a particular deficiency in my retinal cones (the bits that see color) where I can't differentiate between blues and greens that well.  

This is a common phenomena, and about 1 in 10 men have it to some degree.  Often, people discover it when joining the armed forces, having lived their first 18 years or so with the condition and never realizing it until they are given a test at MEPS (the military in-processing station and discover their dreams of being a pilot/analyst/whatever are dashed.  

I discovered in middle school when my class was given the test.  

As an aside, I did later join the army, and knowing that being color blind relegates you to shitty jobs like ""cook"" or ""laundry technician"", so I cheated during in processing by memorizing the test beforehand.  

But on to seeing color.  

When I was in undergrad, I stopped by a table in the student center where they were recruiting color blind people for a paid study.   What starving undergrad doesn't like a bit of extra cash for beer?  They gave me a quick test, confirmed I was indeed color blind, and had me come in on a Saturday for a three hour session.  Unlike the standard Ishihara colorblindness test (the one with the dots) I took in middle school and later memorized for the Army, I sat in front of a computer and had a battery of tests that took almost the entire three hours.  They drilled down the precise nature and extent of my color blindness to an exacting degree.  

They then sat me down and let me watch a video that was color-corrected to compensate for my exact type of cone deficiency, allowing me to see-- for the first and only time in my life-- color as normal visioned people perceive it.  

It was fucking horrible.  It was garish and tacky, like a badly colorized 1930s film.  

So I saw color, but I'm good the way I am.   ",03Aug2018,53

58,"***LONG*** I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls (only 2 of them are in this , a blonde girl and a brunette girl) were there for a few hours in the night at the end before closing time the blonde girl in the   group walked up stairs with some other girl to the toilet she kept looking back at me down the stairs and laughing bit couldn’t make it out fully. a while later I walked around the corner towards by where they were sitting one of them (that same blonde girl) was looking at me and I looked up at her and she didn’t look away and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say whisper to her friend the brunette girl 'that lads just been staring at me'. another while later I was cleaning a table (they were the last customers left in there it was late before closing) and the brunette girl asked over at me ‘excuse me’ twice then I looked and then she asked ‘how do you get a job in here?’ I answered and walked towards her because she asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) I said yes and she was saying he’s not her friend they don’t know her that well and said she’s weird (but the other girls were disagreeing saying she’s being harsh) the brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit....’ and then looked at me then grew a smile and said 'she likes you' and they all burst out laughing I just walked away. I then went back to finish cleaning the table and then the same brunette girl asked ‘excuse me’ I looked then she looked tipsy as she asked pointing at me 'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she said 'have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her and their was a pause then the blonde girl then said 'aww leave him alone...he’s dead cute' while looking over at me smiling (idk if she said it like puppy dog cute is that bad?) and then said “he probably has” (probably has a gf) the brunette asked me it again saying ‘have you, have you got a gf’ nicely and I blanked her and then the blonde girl said “aww leave him alone now hes fumin” . On their way out by the door when I was cleaning other tables the brown girl looked a bit drunk and the blonde girl who seemed normal said ‘byyeee’ smiling politely idk they looked like pleasant well spoken girls not loud drunk girls",03Aug2018,1
