3,"I told my girlfriend of 1.5 years today that we are breaking up. 

We had been fighting so frequently and she would say she will break up with me almost after every fight. Last weekend she said that something was off about our relationship from the beginning and she ignored it, and that we don't suit and are not like...and she 'broke up' with me again.

Problem is after every 'break up' she tells me she didn't mean it, and that she wants things to get better. I got tired of the constant stress, the frustration, the anger I've been experiencing so much over the past year, the anxiety, and the doubts, and I decided to call things off and to focus on ourselves instead and on medical school (we have less than 2 years left). 

Yet I feel awful. I cried so much. I tried to explain to her my reasoning but her replies only made me feel more guilty. I am worried I made a mistake. Idk what I'll do from here. Idk if I should ask for her to come back. Idk what the right thing is",29Nov2018,1

5,"I feel empty, i have no idea why, but i just do, when i'm with my friend i ""feel"" happy i guess? like a smiles on my face i just don't really feel anything, and anytime i'm finished hanging out or talking to friends, it goes form 100 to 0, just numb, ya know? I don't have any motivation to do anything(except take car of my dogs, for some reason), to be anything, i look and explore career paths, and i just don't feel anything, just numb, i think i wasn't like this as a young kid (i am 16 now) but honestly i just cant remember. I feel like i go just day in day out, i feel like leaving, not something like to killing myself, but just hopping in a car and leaving not to be seen again, and i think about it a lot. I try to pay attention in class but everything just leaves my brain. I feel a lot of anger, and sometimes sadness, but happiness just does not feel like its there, i was told my dog might day in the early next year, tears came down my face, but i didn't really feel sad, just really numb. I have a huge problem with procrastination, sometimes just not even doing assignments at all, like how i'm procrastinating on now, that was  due not the Tuesday that was yesterday but the week before that, and i have to due a presentation on it this Friday. I am shit at commitment and avoid it like the plague, i just have no idea why, maybe i know i wont follow through? I just don't have any idea why. I don't have any motivation to exercise or eat healthy, mostly because i do not like the taste of any fruit or vegetable, but the exercise, well, to put it bluntly, i am a fatass, i know i am, and i don't really want to be anymore, but i have no motivation to go and work out and change that.

Sorry if seemed like this was just a bunch of jumbles up thoughts, well it's cause it kinda was, i just felt like a needed to put a ""pen to the paper"" so to speak.",29Nov2018,1

10,"I am self pitying myself right now. I can barely look at the screen on my phone due to extreme dry eyes pain. Done 3.5 months ago for $3.5CAD.... customized lasik on already dry eyes but almost asymptomatic. I kind of new about it because they told me. Anyways... just wondering because first 3 weeks postop almost no pain then when it hit me I had to go on sick leave. Lasted in horrible pain for a few weeks and it got so much better that I even kept forgetting to put the drops in. Now back to the horrible pain I think even worse that the 3 weeks postop one. I am shocked that eyes can hurt so much. I never even needed the drops. So I blame myself for being so stupid and trusting the surgeon. I wanted to have a good vision so badly. I needed new glasses every year. I was not a good candidate! Although they made me believe I was. They told me I could experience more dryness but it will pass. Now they say I might live a year in misery. I just don't understand how come it got so much better and all of the sudden so bad I have to skip work and stay home since all motivation lost due to pain.
I've read so much now that I don't know what to think. Last thing is to be negative and lose hope. I don't want to hear about life dry eyes syndrome. It is so scary. The decision made sense then. I was confident I will be a happy camper like all my friends who did it. I have not heard any bad story in real life. Only the internet horrors and refused to read it. Even going for minor cosmetic improvement you get horrible side effects. I am looking for someone like me who fought with dryness for months but it got better or gone. I am back to glasses. -0.75 right eye and 0.75 astygnatyzm left one. I had less astygnatyzm before lasik. So my vision sucks especially on the computer. Never expected this in my worst nightmare. I just wished I was better informed. If my surgeon said I might be left with a possible year in misery no way I would have done it. He said that only after I came back with the problem. He actually offered me a refund meaning they would get rid of me. He blamed it on me that I wanted it!?!?! So disappointed and living a miserable life because a medical professional should have known better and discouraged me!",29Nov2018,1

14,"When I'm working this hard to avoid writing, I guess I have to start. I think I kind of want to talk stupid. I also think I want to make that stupid talk analogize to movies and songs. (Neither of which I ended up doing?...)

I've been thinking a lot about relationships. I glance at my blogger page and see the tag “relationships” is 8th from the top of 427 tags I managed to pull out as mild coherence reference points in my usual blog soup. They mean a lot to me, but apparently not as much as Jordan Peterson, though they're tied with Obama.

For the longest time, every single conception I had of a relationship was about what I could get out of it. Maybe I wanted to be friends with dickhead kids because I wanted their power. I could play the ethical know-it-all in school because of the attention and accolades. I would garner a certain type of crowd to create a certain kind of fun or that could be controlled in specific ways. Basically, I didn't simply “not understand” relationships, I didn't have any.

That isn't to say people didn't try to relate to me. My general nonplussed demeanor or mild excitement at mostly-playful delinquency many depressed and “finding themselves” people are consistently drawn to. It's easy not to judge someone you're not invested in. And people, whether they're comfortable admitting it or not, like when the confident person filled with praises and gifts for them shits on everyone besides them.

That was a big part of my dialogue in my romance language regarding friends. They were “different” because of some ill-defined disposition that could tolerate me for longer periods than most. To be sure, I still think this speaks volumes, but I think I was willing to give out too much credit, and I was doing it at an unfair expense to my own self-conception. I wanted actual relationships. As such, I allowed other people's *stuff* into and onto mine.

Other people, for as much as I don't generally like them, can be something of a huge motivation. There's people who self-sacrifice in extremely unhealthy ways, and people who do for others out of loads of guilt or fear of themselves. I genuinely want to reward people I consider persistently better than me in some aspect of their life I'm not doing terribly well at improving. Perhaps even better said, there are people with qualities I find as equally valid and important as and I hold, but I want nothing to do with behaving like them. Arguably, given how actively I've sought to cultivate my crowds, words, and direction in life, that's basically everyone.

Here is where I think the word “unconditional” comes up. This is around the space people start to throw out the stupid love word. Unconditional, of course, doesn't really mean unconditional as much as it signifies a kind of persistence and determination through what are hopefully healthy and manageable levels of shit. It's the divine standard by which to set your own inadequacy watch. It's the kind of irrational place a parent may occupy in service to their serial murderer son or wife's devotion thrice beaten a day year after year.

That kind of place seems to pair well with irrational pride. The more you are unduly boastful about something you don't understand or don't deserve, the likelier it seems you'll go down with it. To simply call it “ignorant” betrays the very real motivated energy it conjures in you. The “deeply personal” feeling is everyone's scream for things to matter in a way that transcends the ups and downs of their emotions or tumultuous lives.

In that sense, it's not “irrational” for your stomach to drop when you look at a picture of someone you care about who's gone. They were more real to you than you have the words for. Their impact could have made you feel in ways you'll never experience on your own. Sure, those feelings are playing on survival instincts and deep-rooted fears about the tribe abandoning you, but we're also intelligent enough to extract a greater ethos and example who's death we're allowed to mourn as well.

That's the “heartbreak.” It's not any one person and what you did or didn't say or the details of some regrettable fight. It's the timeless example you thought meant something “special” proving otherwise. Or the proud presumption you have the capacity and wisdom to know what example that relationship was really setting. Or the selfish resentment you have for the work it takes to remain vulnerable and honest. Or the pain of knowing you were working hard, unsure of towards what, to death, conscripted into a cultural fairy-tale.

I miss my relationships that went bad to the extent I allow myself to forget what got them started to begin with. I long for days of old when I pretend I made the mistake of pulling a trigger I never intended. Relationships need people willing to discuss and respect each others' decisions. This is as true between you and every insane-but-savable Trump voter as it is you and those difficult friendships or relationships that blew up for, probably, wholly ridiculous and nonsensical reasons. Check the record, I've never said, “I'm done talking about this.”

My best relationships aren't just time spent, but people who seem to respect that the time we have is limited, and the person in front of you is all you're going to get of them. My deepest sense of connection is when I allow that sentiment to embed itself into my moment. When people talk about things like “no expectations,” the wrong and lazy way to understand that is as the shirking of responsibility. No expectations needs to be making a plan, while knowing you can't control the weather. It needs to be something akin to that AA mantra about having the wisdom to tell the difference between things you can and cannot change, and then drilling down on how or if you really want to. It's me knowing I could blow thousands of dollars getting nowhere trying to create and be independently wealthy, and can only expect from myself to act as well as I can to the extent of my knowledge and ability.

That's the kind of leeway it gets easier to grant when you're older. I'm still a top-notch shit-talker, but if my first impulse was to roast everyone at the office, dear god. As life has felt both more and less in my control, I'm not so quick to throw people's baggage into their face. I still think I prefer to relate in that kind of “mean because I like you” space, but I understand I live in the wrong place for too much of that. I want room to “fail as a person” as much as anyone else. I'm significantly less apologetic or insecure than what's normal, statistically, but I don't want to believe in lost causes, thinking we'll cobble together some misshapen gluey Popsicle stick existence together.

I'm not sad people who want to leave, leave. My first drunk instinct isn't to blow up ex's phones. I don't think I'll create the same (it'll only get better) magic of parties. It bugs me to think that I didn't matter to them as much as they did to me. That my kind of “fucked up” is “too,” but what I accepted as them presumably only someone better than me could really understand or they could bother with in perpetuity. The things I like about them seem to lose out to the things I hate. It's parts of them I think they hate as well, but only they're allowed to suffer them on their own. Their depression wins. Their insecurity reigns. Their conspiratorial gossipy child runs amok. I don't end friendships in screaming and pissing matches inventing a dozen explicitly untrue things to say about you before never talking again.

The things people use to lament me are the things I take pride in. I like having worked for my views and methodical needling down on things. I like being sexual and fighting jealous impulses. I like cussing, and being blunt, and “rough” messy friendships where everything is at once a crisis and immediate celebration that it will all still be over soon enough, so relax. I like knowing what part of the imperfect whole I'm getting more comfortable accepting, and discussing what needs to change. There's a gigantic hole at the center of how we conceive of each other as “right” or “the one” or “best.” This isn't to dismiss people who's styles and experiences mesh more than others, but it's to allude to a lost spirit of entanglement. The kind that happens when “what if you can't get divorced” or “this child is yours forever” enters the picture.

I'm still celebrating. Every forgotten name from my parties frequently lives on in the spirit they conjured in me. Every lost friend or girlfriend occupies at least words on the page, even if the swirl of their influence will never fit neatly into a waffle cone. And I'm still working to create even better and refined circumstances to build the fleetingly small amount of relationships with impacts worth considering and preserving indefinitely. That's the kind of friend I want to be, and misfired regrets over people less willing than me serve no one and never recognized me to begin with. And I'm just the smallest part of everything else we're missing.",29Nov2018,1
15,"Crypto was made with the intention of being a currency, but people treat it as an investment. Crypto's value is highly speculative and based on public perception.

Reddit is as if you gave every user a hint of anonymous moderator powers over the entire website.

Reddit &amp; cryptocurrency go together like the words ""conflict of interest"". Crypto subreddits are a game of Upvote Clicker, where people (believe they) get real money every time they push their coin through the Reddit Machine. People (believe they) save themselves from losing money every time they sort facts, analysis, and opinions under the rug that discredit whatever coin they are holding. If you dare post a coin that is not one of the accepted few, then the collective lizard brain will identify you as a threat to be dealt with.

No matter the nuance of your financial situation or coin performance, here is the depth of investment advice that is accepted on crypto subreddits:

* hodl
* 800-273-8255
* buy the dip

The first is a meme where you are advised to never sell no matter how high or low the price gets. The second is a suicide hotline. The third is to always buy more. Every sentiment, every story, every upvote pushes a constructed reality for only other people to believe. Even the comments in the suicide hotline posts simply tell people to buy more. These subreddits are systematic in pushing deceit for personal gain. 

In their aims to construct a post-truth reality, crypto subs celebrate spamming blogs and fringe websites for their news. Subreddits for individual coins remove the controversial tab from view, just another strategy to fine-tune the reddit system to output what they want. 

If you sort the cryptocurrency subreddit by controversial of all time, you'll see pages of temporarily successful or failed market manipulation. If you sort by the top of all time, you will see pages of successful market manipulation, laughably editorialized titles, rallying cries of desperation, and memes.

Social media use is linked to adverse mental health. I think this is due to a literal metric for success, there's a pressure to gamify and manipulate the system. The more time you spend doing this the more warped your reality becomes. Tie money into the system and it amplifies the most demeaning and tribalistic of Reddit - ""The home to authentic human connection"".",29Nov2018,1

26,"hey,

I'm still scared of what the future might bring.  I don't really know what direction or path I am taking, and I don't really know where I'm going to end up.  I struggled so much these past few years, but I can tell you now that I'm finally going to bloom like a flower. Life has never been better for me.  I smile all the time - I feel radiant, I'm glowing, and I see it in other people when they look at me.  I wonder if my smile makes other people feel happy even if only just a second when they see me.   You were wrong.  You said I needed you.  You said I'd break without you being the glue to my pieces. But, I'm like a perennial. You can tear off my flower buds, rip apart my leaves, cut off my stems, but my seed, the core of my being, you can't touch.  You might have broken me, but I'll still heal myself.  I'll just grow a new, happier me when the weather is a little nicer and things are better.  I never needed you as much as you thought I did.  You're like a weed, stopping me from shining to my full potential, sucking the life out of me.  I'm just so glad we don't talk anymore.

hello, 

We struggle similarly, maybe things haven't been the greatest to us.  I just wish you could see how much you shine.  You don't think much of yourself.  I just want you to know I think a lot of you.  It's funny, because we both feel the same way, trying to convince each other that we're really great and awesome, but not being able to believe it ourselves.  Maybe we're just naturally too critical of ourselves - maybe this self-criticism keeps us wanting to grow as a person and hopefully escape this crutch.  Maybe all the times we've been knocked down, the isolation we faced, has ultimately convinced us that we're just not worth being around.  I like your energy, though.  You're warm, positive, and all around lovely.  If I could describe it... it sounds silly, but do you know those little heat lamps you find at bus stops and train stations during the winter to keep travelers warm? Standing under them, I somehow feel like I'm wrapped up in a little blanket of warmth in the midst of the freezing wind, and that's how you make me feel.  When everything else is blistering cold, you just make me feel warm.  And appreciated.  

You said that you haven't had a good hug in a long, long time.  You said that when we finally meet, the first thing you want from me is a long hug.  I kind of can't wait.  Sometimes when we talk, I feel helpless because you sometimes seem to really need one. I just want to wrap my arms around you, pull your head in, and just make it all better.",29Nov2018,1

28,"So generally my life is ok now. 
I have gone through therapy for my bfrb, ocd and anxiety and it was quite successful. Still I engage in my damaging behaviour but it’s a lot better now and I stand up in the morning. I take more care of myself. University is alright, I don’t procrastinate that much anymore and I enjoy what I learn. my weed consumption is balanced. I stopped drinking alcohol because it was mainly the coping mechanism I used when I was kindof suicidal. It just brings back the shitty thoughts and bad memories. 
There is still something one thoughg or wish that makes my life hard and is ome of the triggers pullimg my back into my bfrb. I have been thinking about why there is this fundamental unhappiness in me. and going on exchange made me realize even more that I don’t have ‘a best friend’ or never make one whereever I go and I feel lonely af.  Everyone around me has found one person they hang around with most of the time, talks about everything without getting bored, one that makes you a little gift, that ask you how you’re really doing, they can text, they do sports with, study, I don’t know etc. You might think “yea but on exchange there you don’t make real friends” 
However, also back home in my life I miss this one best friend, too. one that texts me and let’s me know first about shit, hangs out with me or just appears in front of my room, we study, and that person respects my needs as well, and supports the ideas I have to do sth, etc. It’s not like I don’t have any friends, I do, but they all have their best friend they do that stuff with, never me. The last person I had this friendship with, disappeared one day just out of the blue when I was 16 (8years ago).  Changed his phone number, moved out from his dads, never replied my text on fb... Just to discover that he was still being friends with our other friends. I never got an explanation. From neither of them. 
I seem always to put more meaning in my friendships and then I get hurt when they tell me that for them I was just “a friend I saw when x and time y.” Even if those friendships were longterm. 
I don’t know what I should do about this. I don’t know if it’s my fault because of who I am. how I behave. Do I do it wrong? I don’t even know if I lost faith in those kind of friendships, but I try and try, but there is never one person for me to be best friends with. they always have somebody.

29,"So basically, I let my cat out every morning and he comes back by noon to eat. If not noon, then at some other time of day but bottomline, he comes back. Aways. Except this time. About two days ago, I let him out in the morning and he didn't come back, so I waited 12 hours and he still didn't come back. I left the door open all day and night and he still didn't come back inside. What's even more worrisome is that it rained that day. Usually when it rains, he runs inside. But that day it rained and he STILL didn't come back inside. So its been almost three days and he still hasn't come back and I'm really worried because it's extremely cold out and he hasn't eaten in 2-3 day. My mind is going to the worst of places. What if some sick person kidnapped and is now torturing him in all kinds of horrific ways? What if he's injured? He's probably so scared and hungry. What if someone snatched him? What if his collar came off and he gets mistaken for a stray and gets euthanized? What if he's injured? What if he starves to death? What if he freezes to death? I'm so worried. What should I do? Anyone have this happen to them? I'd love to hear your stories and any advice you might have. Everything helps. How do I find him?",29Nov2018,1
30,"Hey guys, I wasn’t sure where to post this, but I really wanted to tell someone about it. I’ve posted it in a couple places but I’m pretty excited, sorry.

For a very long time, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. As a kid I wanted to be a firefighter, or a pilot. I always told my mom I was going to take her up in an SR-71 Blackbird. But... I grew older. I lost track of my dreams and had to get real jobs. I dropped out of college to support my girlfriend at the time and we thought we were going to start a family, but that only lasted s few years. As highschool sweethearts we inevitably grew apart, and splitting up sent me into a pretty crazy, spiraling depression. I quit my job, went to therapy, moved, the whole deal. I got a few side jobs here and there but I STILL felt so lost and alone my depression grew worse. I decided to move back home just to have a “solid” foot hold on something in my life again... I thought the next best step was to go back to school. So I enrolled in college again! I was so excited! My life finally had a meaning again... I wasn’t a failure... but what was I going to study? I had no clue, so I took dozens of major/career/placement quizzes to see what my personality was and to try and get a clue of what I wanted to study. I ended up choosing General Science with a minor in Business Management. And I felt... okay about it, but still wasn’t sure. So I enrolled, and started taking all these science and business classes.

Growing up I have always been a musician. I’ve always been into acting and reading and filming. I was the artsy kid, I was always terrible at sports, so to make up for it I was REALLY good at drumming. It’s all I lived and dreamt about. I did it all through grade school, middle school, highschool, and even college before I dropped out the first time. I even did a little DCI for a few months (before I got cut). But that didn’t stop me. I was in love with the presentation, and making people ‘feel’ something. Getting a reaction through comedy, or a great drum solo, was the only goal I had in life. Some people get terrible stage fright, or have trouble talking in front of crowds but I get a high from it. The rush of making a crowd stand up and cheer for you is a feeling I can’t put into words. I always just kind of have a knack for things like that, getting up and presenting. Losing my artsy side of myself once I dropped out pretty much killed the “me” in my soul.

My academic advisor told me I needed an art credit for my degree. Just 3 credits out of 144 needed to be an art credit. I was so excited! I get to take a fun, artsy class and get to present and be myself!? Yes please! So I scanned all the electives and came across “voice diction, and interpretation”. My advisor told me it was basically to help prepare for job interviews and to grow a more mature voice. It sounded great to me, so I signed up. One of the first things my professor made us do in this class was get on our backs and just focus on breathing and projecting my voice. I immediately fell in love with it. Throughout the semester I was reciting famous speeches and sonnets and monologues, I was addicted. I was finally having fun again. Half way through the semester my professor had me come to her office so she could speak to me privately. She mentioned that I was pretty good at this for a beginner and maybe I should think about expanding my horizons. I agreed and changed my major the same day. It was the best decision I’ve ever made.

Since then all I do is write scripts for my schools podcast, read and write speeches, and continue to work on my voice. My mental health has improved so much... I’m just... blown away. I’ve been going to the gym, I’ve made so many new awesome friends, I’ve started playing DnD, and other new hobbies... I’m just so happy. My professor is honestly such a good influence, I don’t know.

Anyway, for my finals coming up these next few weeks, I need to read a speech. It seems simple, but I chose to challenge myself. I decided to read a children’s book, but make entertaining to adults with just my voice. It’s been a long process of finding what works and what doesn’t but after lots of practice I’m very close to making it less of a kids book and more a dramatic growing up story for adults to feel nostalgic. For practice I’ve been reading it in front of mirrors, recording it and listening to it, and telling it to anyone that’ll lend me an ear just to hear some different feedback. It’s great, I love it, even though people get annoyed of my children’s reading after the 10th time, lol. But, tonight, I read it to my mom for the first time... and not to brag... but I nailed every second of it... and I finish, and my mom was crying.

31,"Ok I was wondering if there is any way I can get compensation for a negligent neurologist? 

To explain about 9 and a half years ago I was taken off a medication called Dilantin I had been on it for at least 4 years prior. It was the last medication that neurologist put me on and even though the med wasn't controlling my seizures he just continued to up it till I was taking the maximum amount I could and just kept it at that amount for years. 

The medication is known for destroying people's teeth they even have a medical diagnosis for what Dilantin does. I was one of the unlucky people and it ate my teeth from the inside out. 

The neurologist didn't tell me that this could be a side effect from the med if I would've known I wouldn't of taken it because I cherished my teeth. 

I started seeing a different neurologist and found out that out of all the medications I was put on only one was for my type of epilepsy but I had an allergic reaction to it so I couldn't take it. 

My teeth are so bad that numerous need to be pulled the nerves on my front teeth and others are exposed to the point I cannot even brush my teeth without passing out from pain I can't even use a water pick! 

After seeing the new neurologist I was told he should have known what type of medication to put me on from all the EEGs and the MRI scan I had an EEG every time I had an appointment and I had an MRI scan when I was first diagnosed. 

The new neurologist told me he was just tossing meds at me upped the dosage until it maxed and then changed it he wasn't doing his actual job. 

I can prove it was the medication that caused the damage and I can also prove he was being negligent. 

But the main question is, is it too late to even try to get compensated? 

Thanks for any help.",29Nov2018,1

As a student i was bullied by classmates and professors. I struggled every single day: Am i a failure? Will i ever be understood? Will i ever accomplish my life goals?

Each time i met new people, i tried to express my ideas, and they hated me for being different. I didn't know what was wrong.

The world is so big, but it can also be so small when it comes to find the people who truly love you.

I believe a new social platform is needed to connect deep and creative thinkers, without endlessly being bullied. I believe this is an essential step to build a stronger and aware humanity.

33,"This has bothered me for a while now. When I was a child, I cry through fights and arguments and lost of loved ones among other things. It is not entirely on purpose but something I simply DO when I am upset.

As I approach adulthood, I learn to restrain myself. I reframe myself from crying to maintain professionalism at work, or to allow other people to go through their points in an argument, or simply worry that the my red nose and red eyes will flag up someone else’s attention.

I still cry from movie or book. But when I begin to cry from my own emotion, I stop myself even in my private moments.

Last time I cried, genuinely cried, I completely lost control and ended up hiding under a desk at work until I stopped shaking. And this is not what I want.

I feel like a ballon that is close to its limit. I miss those moments when I can let myself cry and slowly recover from it. I wish I can just find a way to let go again, and to control when I can let go.

36,"A little over a year ago, I was going through a very bad depressive episode and I needed someone to talk to, but I had no one, so I texted a girl I had talked to earlier in an online group chat. I told her what was bothering me and she was really supportive and helpful. 
We started talking and developed what I thought was a great friendship. We would text each other all day and I just loved talking to her, and felt like I could share my problems with her without any judgement. After a few months of this, I started feeling things for her. It was very weird and she was the first person I had ever had feelings for. I managed to gather the courage to tell her this and honestly expected her to get mad at me but she said ""Yeah, I know that. I thought that was mutual."" That was probably the first time I had felt genuinely happy in months and it was the most amazing feeling. She went to a camp for a month and got to use a computer once a week and I would send her super long emails telling her about my week and about how much I missed her and she would reply telling me about hers, and she said that she thought about me more than she thought about her friends she had known for way longer. All of this meant the world to me. Just knowing that I wasn't alone and that I wasn't the most unlikable person on the planet because someone as awesome as her cared for me was wonderful and made me want to keep on living.

I haven't had a will to live since my brother's death, when I was in 9th grade, but talking to her about my problems gave me hope, and made me feel like I wasn't alone. I have a lot of friends irl, and I love them all, but she was special. 
I never really did anything about the fact that I liked her, because we live so far away, but I remember us talking about how great it would be if we were neighbours. 

She got into the college that was her top choice (not surprising, she's probably the smartest person my age that I know) and I was so happy for her 

A few months ago, she moved to college, and I knew that we would have less time together, but I was fine with that. She said she had kept her afternoons free so that we could talk. 

Everything was going great until I fucked it up. I got really, really depressed and instinctively went to her for support, but this time, she wasn't as available because she had college to handle and couldn't handle my shit as an extra curricular activity, so instead of being considerate and understanding like I should have been, I started feeling like I was a burden on her and that we should stop talking. She hated this and after a few weeks of this, she told me that we weren't talking anymore. 
I don't think she did anything wrong here and take full blame for this. I brought it upon myself. 
I do however wish she had communicated and said ""Yeah man you fucked up, now let's try to fix this."" instead of just dumping me. 
Then this, coupled with the depression, made me really really fucked up and suicidal. She had told me in the past that if I was ever going to actually kill myself she wanted to know as she wouldn't like being stuck thinking about what happened to me and not knowing. So I texted her and told her this. 

She thought I was threatening her with suicide. 

That was not what I was doing but it was stupid of me to even tell her this at all. I had gone to the roof of a really tall building and planned to jump but when I actually got to the edge, I wasn't able to. I froze and was too afraid to do anything. 

The next day, she sent me a video of herself playing an instrument and then we started talking again. I tried to make our conversations better but she seemed uninterested, as if it was a chore to talk to me. 
On the 7th of november she told me she wanted to stop talking again. I asked her if we were ever going to talk again and she said she didn't know if she wanted to talk again. 
But then we did talk again, every once in a while. It felt like cheating but I loved it when we did that. 
I asked her again if we would ever go back to normal and she said there was a 50% chance. 
I said I wanted a conclusive answer, and since she wasn't giving me one, I told her that I didn't want to talk to her anymore, eventho I really did. 


I ended up texting her again and then for a few days, we were doing great. But then she tells me she wants to cut communications once more. 

This time I can't even blame myself for it. She has hurt me enough and doesn't seem to care enough to at least explain what went wrong. She told me she barely knows me and doesn't even think of me as a friend. 
I stopped feeling for her romantically a long time ago, but what does she mean by saying she barely knows me? We've talked so much and I've never even been a friend? What made her start talking to me last time? Because she really didn't have to and maybe then we wouldn't have done this again. She get my hopes up and I think that maybe things will get better between us but then she do this shit again and again. 

I don't know what to do. I feel irritated by her and I wish I didn't feel like this but I think it's her fault I'm hurting. Maybe I'm being stupid and it is my fault. Probably that's the case. 


I'd just like some advice about what to do. When the pain and contempt subsides, I'll have a hard time not texting her.

42,"So I deleted twitter about 3 months ago and I’m ashamed to admit this but at the time it was because a relationship ended between me and this guy who I’d known my whole life.

I wanted a break from seeing his posts and his likes/retweets which just bothered me at the time bc I was really in love with him.. ANYWAY, me and him became friends again and I was genuinely over what had happened between us. I noticed once I got over it that I didn’t care to go back to social media.

I still had snapchat and Instagram and decided to delete my instagram as well. I still have snapchat but I limit my use and it’s mostly just to talk to people who reach out to me who don’t have my number. It’s less personal. I stopped watching snapchat stories bc personally I am not very strong minded. I can admit, I compare myself to others a lot in many ways. Once I got rid of social media I started accomplishing a lot more. I got a new job. I feel more confident and focused now that I don’t see what hundreds of my acquaintances are up to these days. I love my life. I always have but like I said I was never a super confident girl when it came to things such as looks. 

I started writing and just doing more outside of my phone with the people in my life and it feels good not feeling the need to plaster my face on 4 different things for some validation. I have an Instagram account with a minimal following of close friends and family and post pictures there. I use reddit to read and talk to others with similar interests and for advice with things and I have a tumblr for my photography and writing.

I am not just comparing myself to others. Just by seeing so many different people at a time and what they are up to and what they’re complaining about for the day and their shallowness and facades, genuinely drained me. I had accounts with a follower count of a couple thousand. I was very social throughout high school and just over the years just gained and followed people who I didn’t even know who appealed to me at the time. 

 I realized people can live a whole different life through these things that are very far from what really goes on and a thing like that having so much power over me really rubbed me the wrong way. That is just one thing about today that I feel I can live without. Sorry for the messy writing xoxx ",29Nov2018,1

Mechanic friend tried to fix it but said honestly, he can but its going to take a lot and a decent amountnof cash even if were buying from a junkyard. My husband and him tried to put in the new radiator, only to have about a million things break. 

Its understandable. Its a 2003 Chevy Trailblazer. It wasnt taken care of and the person (ex friend) who sold it to us lied about so much with it, but knew we were desperate. So I got a POS but hey, it ran! Now it doesn't. 

We knew we'd have to get a new car eventually. We were hoping tax return time to put money down on a nice used vehicle. Maybe a mini-van like a Honda. In the mean time we were also saving up, because we knew wed have to put a lot down because we both have terrible credit. 

We had about 800 saved up, until my mom got sick and I had to use that plus a loan to go see her before she died. I had to rent a car and stay in a hotel (which really wasnt bad! Cheap and decent). I dont regret it and given the same circumstances id do it again. It was the last time I saw my mom face to face. I couldn't even afford to go to her funeral. All this in August (she died on my wedding anniversary.) 

But we couldnt save up because of a loan payment. Its over in another 3 months though. We have enough for every day things, and thanks to Reddit we can give my 3yo a great Christmas. Thibgs were fine until the POS died. My husband has a ride to work eevery morning and a ride back home, and the same guy has taken me grocery shopping. I feed him when he doesn't want DFAS food. Good kid. 

Well i fibd a nice used car. Its about 10k with sales tax, a little Hyundai sedan. Its nice, nothing fancy, but perfect. We can probably get 300 from a junkyard for the POS, scrap metal and all, but we probably need another 700+ for a down payment. The people said that we could probably do a small down payment (this is carmax). But i have a feeling it would he a lot more. A whole lot more. And I'm just at a loss on how to get the other 700+.

 We cant take out another loan, and waiting until march is...not possible. I cant work, and I'm working on trying to get disability but its very difficult.

Cohen’s attorney, Lanny Davis, was not present in court on Thursday. Instead, he was represented by attorneys Guy Petrillo and Amy Lusker.

Thursday marked the first time Mueller’s team charged Cohen as part of its investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election.

“Cohen made the false statements to minimize links between the Moscow Project and Individual 1 [Trump] and give the false impression that the Moscow Project ended before ‘the Iowa caucus … the very first primary,’ in hopes of limiting the ongoing Russia investigations,” Mueller wrote Thursday.

“Cohen did recall that in or around January 2016, Cohen received a response from the office of Russian Official 1, the Press Secretary for the President of Russia, and spoke to a member of that office about the Moscow Project,” Mueller added.",29Nov2018,1

74,"Hi, this is gonna be long and I hope I portray the feelings and situation correctly. I appreciate all feedback.

I (19 F) am from Los Angeles and I received a softball scholarship out of high school to attend a small D2 school in Philadelphia. I was really excited to live away from home and experience a new city. Now, finishing the fall semester of my sophomore year, I feel so unhappy and depressed. 

When I got home for summer break after my freshman year at the college, my uncle (my moms younger brother and my aunts older brother) suddenly passed away and it took a huge toll on my family mentally, emotionally, and financially. I stayed home and watched my 5 year old cousin all day while the rest of the family was the hospital saying their goodbyes as I am the eldest grandchild in my immediate family. I also wrote the obituary because my mom and aunt could not do it. This was a hard time for me but I was constantly surrounded by family and friends. 

When I got back to school, I was so stressed out about leaving my family back home. I also felt very isolated and lonely without being constantly surrounded by friends and family. I was okay with these facts and figured this was normal after a tragic loss. 

Now, I have a boyfriend here in PA, and he’s great. We have been together since October of my first year and do everything together. I stayed with his family in summer and I love all of them and feel like i have a home in PA with them, and he visited LA in the summer and went on vacation with my family and he loved them too. We then roadtripped my car back to PA together and it was amazing. He goes to a different school in the area and our class and schedules are so busy that we see each other 2 or 3 times a week. This was fine and I am usually independent but I just started to feel more isolated and alone at school with my teammates. 

They all go out every weekend and I don’t like drinking because it makes my pre-existing back problems worse and I get major anxiety when I throw up. I do smoke but I don’t like doing that in crowds of people. I began to feel uncomfortable and like I didnt connect with anyone. Everyone seemed different than how people were back home and I hated going back to my dorm after hanging out with my boyfriend because I felt so alone and uncomfortable. I would have panic attacks and cry. 

During this time, I started going to counseling the school offers once a week and tried going to new club meetings but still felt not okay. 

I started just to become generally sad, I feel like for the past 4 months ive just been going through the motions. My boyfriends makes me incredibly happy and he supports me in everyway, I just want to be happier in my environment. 

I started to have panic attacks almost daily about wanting to go home and the possibility of transferring. I pushed the feelings aside for a month and just kinda came to decision that I would stick out one more semester and play softball and then figure out if I want to transfer or not. 

Last week, I stayed with my boyfriend and his family during thanksgiving break because I could not go home and it was great. Although, Sunday night when I hadd to go back to school, I felt overwhelmingly sad. Monday morning, I woke up and had a panic attack and just felt like I needed to go home and i started to make plans to go home and stay home. I applied to a community college for next semester and then hope to apply to UCLA to get a degree in digital media. 

Although I thought I came to the decision, I still felt so scared that I was going to make the wrong one. Yes, I am worried about long distance with my boyfriend but he reassured me and I feel better. I am however, petrified of going back home, living with my parents and being stuck. This is a conversation I had with my aunt last night: 






aunt: “look i know youre not a pennsylvania girl and ur roommates are fucking weird but i think its good for you to be away with all the shit going on at home” 

aunt: “but maybe youve felt how ive felt *starts crying* ever since (uncle) died i havent felt myself and i feel completely lost ive been producing for 12 years and idk if im good at it i feel like im just going through the motions” 

me: “i mean yeah thats kind of what i’ve been feeling” (as I had just come from talking to my boyfriend about my sadness and telling him I felt like I was going through the motions” 

and then she jut went on saying that i would have more opportunities at home career wise but I cant not have a plan and just go home and focus more on my mom and her health and what she needs and run errands for her like u did all summer and i was like fuck. 

Now, I am currently working on finding new information as far as: 
-i wanna know if i could make the decision after break but thatd be more expensive and an extra flight
-i wanna know if i could move off campus possible and live on my own in an apartment but thatd be expensive also 
commuting to and from practice all the time because softball pays for school 
           •i was also wondering if i would be happier if i moved off campus and got an apartment 
          •i wish i could like stay and do my own thing without being stressed about people and softball but still get a degree 
-or just go home and work really really hard and move out 

All of this has been so stressful as the semester is ending in less than 2 weeks and I OVERTHINK everything. 

Please give me feedback, I feel so lost.

75,"Also I don't know if I should call him that. I was raised by grandparents because he was absent for most of my early childhood. He would spend the day with me on my birthdays though. When I was 7, my mom got sent to prison and I have 0 memory of him ever helping me through that. That was all my grandparents. (She got out when I was 10 though) When I was around 11 he got a court order and I had to see him every other weekend. He tried to get me to move with him but I refused because I had friends here and didn't know him that well. I just moved out for university this year, and planned to cut him out completely because thinking about him hurts me. But costs are expensive, my mom is currently unemployed and my grandparents don't have a lot of money, and he offered to help me so I took it.

77,"It's been 15 years since I  started having dreams and ideas of another world in my mind. At first I thought it might just be my subconscious spitting out remixed content of what I'd already read.  I gorged on sci-fi and fantasy in my youth I eventually reached a point where it felt as if I'd consumed every available piece of literature in these categories. I read everything I wanted in my elementary school years, as I started reaching middle school and high school my local and school libraries combined with brick and mortar books stores didn't have enough supply to keep up pace.  I stopped reading what I wanted and started targeting series or books of the largest size/volume. It reached a point in my early 20's when I began systematically reading genre sections shelf by shelf, book by book. 

As someone that has the very earliest inklings of a larger story I'd like to bring to bring to life and all the stars aligning in life to give it a shot I find myself stumbling over thoughts of unoriginality which act as fuel for excessive consuming. It's been about 10 year's since I OD'd on books. These days it's a healthier pace but I still read more than anyone I know.  Anytime I try to start I  have the urge instead to read one more book or watch one more show to make sure my ideas are unique.

Speaking from personal experience most fantasy/sci-fi is good if it does a fantastic job of immersing you in it's world. To me the most impactful, well written stories tell the observations, life lessons and wisdom of the authors themselves. Great fantasy manages to do both, Sir Terry Pratchett is a fine example.

The fantasy worlds we create and build in our minds are influenced by the world we interact with in our every day life, the way we view the past, present, and future. Our hopes and dreams and life lessons, the key elements that build a sense of our human commonality, but also shared wonderful uniqueness, our imaginations. It's not so much that books contain all of life's answers, far from it. But they are away for us to find someone else that shares or understands a similar life experience.

Concern of being unoriginal is an excuse I use to consume instead of create but the true fear that stops me in my tracks is what if I create and it never connects with someone else. How do you prepare and survive striking out in search in the best of humanity while risking being disappointed with the results? What if I'm truly alone...

78,"I started masturbating at a very young age. I think I was around 9. I remember once in 7th grade I was extremely horny so I lied to my mom and said I was sick so I could stay home and masturbate all day.

I lost my virginity at 16. I was never really that into sex (until recently) but I still loved masturbating. 

Recently, I found out why I wouldn't enjoy sex as much as masturbating. I just couldn't get out of my own head and enjoy it. Last week, I solved that issue and I had the best sex of my life with my boyfriend (21M). It was, no joke, life changing for me.

Now all I want to do is have sex. I don't really want to put in too much effort into getting my partner off because it's what I've been doing my whole life, only thinking about the pleasure my partner will get. I want to act out all of my fetish and kinks but some of them include more than just one partner. I'm afraid of turning into a selfish bastard who only wants to be pleasured and turned on and not pay the favor back.

83,"When I'm working this hard to avoid writing, I guess I have to start. I think I kind of want to talk stupid. I also think I want to make that stupid talk analogize to movies and songs. (Neither of which I ended up doing?...)

I've been thinking a lot about relationships. I glance at my blogger page and see the tag “relationships” is 8th from the top of 427 tags I managed to pull out as mild coherence reference points in my usual blog soup. They mean a lot to me, but apparently not as much as Jordan Peterson, though they're tied with Obama.

For the longest time, every single conception I had of a relationship was about what I could get out of it. Maybe I wanted to be friends with dickhead kids because I wanted their power. I could play the ethical know-it-all in school because of the attention and accolades. I would garner a certain type of crowd to create a certain kind of fun or that could be controlled in specific ways. Basically, I didn't simply “not understand” relationships, I didn't have any.

That isn't to say people didn't try to relate to me. My general nonplussed demeanor or mild excitement at mostly-playful delinquency many depressed and “finding themselves” people are consistently drawn to. It's easy not to judge someone you're not invested in. And people, whether they're comfortable admitting it or not, like when the confident person filled with praises and gifts for them shits on everyone besides them.

That was a big part of my dialogue in my romance language regarding friends. They were “different” because of some ill-defined disposition that could tolerate me for longer periods than most. To be sure, I still think this speaks volumes, but I think I was willing to give out too much credit, and I was doing it at an unfair expense to my own self-conception. I wanted actual relationships. As such, I allowed other people's *stuff* into and onto mine.

Other people, for as much as I don't generally like them, can be something of a huge motivation. There's people who self-sacrifice in extremely unhealthy ways, and people who do for others out of loads of guilt or fear of themselves. I genuinely want to reward people I consider persistently better than me in some aspect of their life I'm not doing terribly well at improving. Perhaps even better said, there are people with qualities I find as equally valid and important as and I hold, but I want nothing to do with behaving like them. Arguably, given how actively I've sought to cultivate my crowds, words, and direction in life, that's basically everyone.

Here is where I think the word “unconditional” comes up. This is around the space people start to throw out the stupid love word. Unconditional, of course, doesn't really mean unconditional as much as it signifies a kind of persistence and determination through what are hopefully healthy and manageable levels of shit. It's the divine standard by which to set your own inadequacy watch. It's the kind of irrational place a parent may occupy in service to their serial murderer son or wife's devotion thrice beaten a day year after year.

That kind of place seems to pair well with irrational pride. The more you are unduly boastful about something you don't understand or don't deserve, the likelier it seems you'll go down with it. To simply call it “ignorant” betrays the very real motivated energy it conjures in you. The “deeply personal” feeling is everyone's scream for things to matter in a way that transcends the ups and downs of their emotions or tumultuous lives.

In that sense, it's not “irrational” for your stomach to drop when you look at a picture of someone you care about who's gone. They were more real to you than you have the words for. Their impact could have made you feel in ways you'll never experience on your own. Sure, those feelings are playing on survival instincts and deep-rooted fears about the tribe abandoning you, but we're also intelligent enough to extract a greater ethos and example who's death we're allowed to mourn as well.

That's the “heartbreak.” It's not any one person and what you did or didn't say or the details of some regrettable fight. It's the timeless example you thought meant something “special” proving otherwise. Or the proud presumption you have the capacity and wisdom to know what example that relationship was really setting. Or the selfish resentment you have for the work it takes to remain vulnerable and honest. Or the pain of knowing you were working hard, unsure of towards what, to death, conscripted into a cultural fairy-tale.

I miss my relationships that went bad to the extent I allow myself to forget what got them started to begin with. I long for days of old when I pretend I made the mistake of pulling a trigger I never intended. Relationships need people willing to discuss and respect each others' decisions. This is as true between you and every insane-but-savable Trump voter as it is you and those difficult friendships or relationships that blew up for, probably, wholly ridiculous and nonsensical reasons. Check the record, I've never said, “I'm done talking about this.”

My best relationships aren't just time spent, but people who seem to respect that the time we have is limited, and the person in front of you is all you're going to get of them. My deepest sense of connection is when I allow that sentiment to embed itself into my moment. When people talk about things like “no expectations,” the wrong and lazy way to understand that is as the shirking of responsibility. No expectations needs to be making a plan, while knowing you can't control the weather. It needs to be something akin to that AA mantra about having the wisdom to tell the difference between things you can and cannot change, and then drilling down on how or if you really want to. It's me knowing I could blow thousands of dollars getting nowhere trying to create and be independently wealthy, and can only expect from myself to act as well as I can to the extent of my knowledge and ability.

That's the kind of leeway it gets easier to grant when you're older. I'm still a top-notch shit-talker, but if my first impulse was to roast everyone at the office, dear god. As life has felt both more and less in my control, I'm not so quick to throw people's baggage into their face. I still think I prefer to relate in that kind of “mean because I like you” space, but I understand I live in the wrong place for too much of that. I want room to “fail as a person” as much as anyone else. I'm significantly less apologetic or insecure than what's normal, statistically, but I don't want to believe in lost causes, thinking we'll cobble together some misshapen gluey Popsicle stick existence together.

I'm not sad people who want to leave, leave. My first drunk instinct isn't to blow up ex's phones. I don't think I'll create the same (it'll only get better) magic of parties. It bugs me to think that I didn't matter to them as much as they did to me. That my kind of “fucked up” is “too,” but what I accepted as them presumably only someone better than me could really understand or they could bother with in perpetuity. The things I like about them seem to lose out to the things I hate. It's parts of them I think they hate as well, but only they're allowed to suffer them on their own. Their depression wins. Their insecurity reigns. Their conspiratorial gossipy child runs amok. I don't end friendships in screaming and pissing matches inventing a dozen explicitly untrue things to say about you before never talking again.

The things people use to lament me are the things I take pride in. I like having worked for my views and methodical needling down on things. I like being sexual and fighting jealous impulses. I like cussing, and being blunt, and “rough” messy friendships where everything is at once a crisis and immediate celebration that it will all still be over soon enough, so relax. I like knowing what part of the imperfect whole I'm getting more comfortable accepting, and discussing what needs to change. There's a gigantic hole at the center of how we conceive of each other as “right” or “the one” or “best.” This isn't to dismiss people who's styles and experiences mesh more than others, but it's to allude to a lost spirit of entanglement. The kind that happens when “what if you can't get divorced” or “this child is yours forever” enters the picture.

I'm still celebrating. Every forgotten name from my parties frequently lives on in the spirit they conjured in me. Every lost friend or girlfriend occupies at least words on the page, even if the swirl of their influence will never fit neatly into a waffle cone. And I'm still working to create even better and refined circumstances to build the fleetingly small amount of relationships with impacts worth considering and preserving indefinitely. That's the kind of friend I want to be, and misfired regrets over people less willing than me serve no one and never recognized me to begin with. And I'm just the smallest part of everything else we're missing.",29Nov2018,1

95,"So I'm 22, male and would like some advice or comments on the situation please. I've had this friend since I was 13, he's 21 and we've been best friends all through school and after. 

Now in the past couple of years when I've been out with him, at a bar or just around him in general, his personality has started to get under my skin. He's quite aggressive, will look for an excuse to fight someone at a bar, thinks he's always right, often brags about how much money he will be earning next year, which started years ago, yet never happens... puts my achievements down, hangs round with other people who do drugs and whose lives revolve around drugs, etc. I'm the opposite, I'm friendly to everyone, don't care for fighting even though I feel confident in myself, don't do drugs, only drink occasionally because of horrendous hangovers, I try to bring people up and make them happy.

 These past couple of years ive distanced myself from him because I used to try so hard with him and he always picked other people over me and left me out constantly. Also he would always ask me for money, ask me to buy him drinks, fags etc. So I stopped trying. I genuinely didn't care anymore and walked away. 

Since I walked away he has always kept trying to come back. He would ring, text or occasionally knock on my door. And every time I go out with him its the same stuff. The put downs, the aggression, trying to start fights with people to prove that he can handle himself, talking about drama, constantly trying to one up me in everything, wanting us to go meet up with druggies and low life's that I've already got rid of. 

When he does get me out, which is rare because I no longer want to be friends with him, he tells me how he's the bestest friend I've had for still trying with me despite me not contacting him and how he's been so good to me. And I'm thinking ""WTF, you asked for money constantly, made me feel like shit, wanted me to hang around with drama filled people, druggies, took advantage of my kindness, start fights all the time and I'm the one who's lucky because you keep coming back despite me choosing to cut you out of my life for all of the above?"" 

Its like he plays the victim constantly. And I know if I said something to him about any of this he would get aggressive with me and probably end up fighting me. It's like we're different people now.

 I want a happy life that's purpose driven, drama free, drug free, and full of goodness. A relatively normal life. I'm not 17/18 years old anymore and only interested in parties and drinking. As ive got older I realised there's a lot more to life but he it seems doesn't see that and just wants to carry on the way he has. He wants to drink all the time, do drugs, smoke, fight, start drama, has no goals to achieve and it just doesn't feel the same anymore. The last few years I've always deep down felt this resentment feeling towards him, but managed to just brush it off and carry on. Now it's to the point where Its very strong and I don't even want to see him again really, as bad as it sounds. Do I just keep on cutting him out like I have been? Today was the first time in 3 months that he contacted me, and it's always been like this, months between his contact. Any advice? Thanks",29Nov2018,1

101,"For better or worse, social media has become an archive of our lives. My dad recently passed away after dealing with the ramifications of having a stroke 3 years ago. My dad was a part of me and my brother's life for quite a while until my parents seperated. After that, he kind of went his own way. He wasn't far, he just lived with my grandma, but my mom didn't want us to see him very often so we didn't. 

Now that he's passed, I've gone through his FB posts, pictures, etc. I've seen some of the girlfriends he's had and some of the really good friends he's drank with at the bar he loved going to. But above all I saw how confused and frustrated he was, all with an underlying sadness to it all. I could also tell that he still loved me and my two younger brothers very much. FB, just like to many others, was sort of an open journal for him so I got to see how he felt a little. I miss him everyday and it tears me up inside that he's gone. It tears me up inside that I didn't visit him for those 3 years that he was unable to walk and talk on his own, the years he spent at a care facility just waiting to see me and my brothers... but I always came up with an excuse to not see him. He was my dad and I didn't want to see him like that, which is very selfish of me. Now he's gone and I just wished I coudl've spent more time with him.

I wish I could still hear his voice, because I rarely heard it for the past three years and now I'll never hear it again. I hope to find some old homevideo where he speaks. When I was little, he used to ask me randomly ""What's on your mind?"" and I always felt embarrased because I didn't want to talk about feelings or whatever. But in on of his FB posts, he talks about how he wishes he didn't bottle up his emotions so much. Maybe he didn't want me to do the same so that's why he always asked me that. Nowadays, I wish I had someone who asked me that. He was my best friend growing up and I always loved what he loved and he always loved what me and my brothers loved, because he wanted to spend time with us.

This is just an little rant. Sometimes, I feel uncomfortable talking about this with friends and family so I resort to strangers. I miss my dad, he was still so young. I'm trying my best to look forward, understand that he still lives on within me and my brothers, and that though my dad had a hard life, it's up to me as the oldest son to take what he gave me and build something better with it and take care of my mom and siblings. I understand all of this but it's just so hard sometimes. 

Love ya dad

The date went so well to the extent that I thought I was dream. It was me, talking and dating a girl, something I thought I’d never do for the next 6 years. I know this sounds a bit far-fetched, but I really do feel like a whole new person after this. ",29Nov2018,1

107,"October ends and it’s Halloween. No invitation anywhere to friends to have fun with.

Then it’s November. My birthday is here but I don’t have any friends so I’m alone all day. Then comes Thanksgiving. I’ve never celebrated Thanksgiving dinner before because I don’t have any friends or family to celebrate with.

Christmas is what you can probably predict—it’s lonely. Nobody to celebrate with and no gifts. 

Then comes New Year’s, just another sad night alone. :-(",29Nov2018,1
108,"This time last year, or even until April this year, I was in a toxic dependent relationship I didn’t want to be in, had just left a horrible pub job which was awful for my self esteem. I had little money, my mum’s alcoholic and often abusive boyfriend was living with her, my (now) ex and my dad were at each others’ throats and refusing to back down, I was shielding myself from life and hiding at home because I was terrified of life, felt sick at the world and people and their selfishness, was hiding from years of emotional trauma which was coming out in low mood and crippling anxiety. I had lived in a horrible house the year before at uni, including with my ex in a toxic relationship and shitty other people, and was completely broken and traumatised, even if I didn’t want to admit it. I had so little confidence, so much mental baggage, and had never been open with my feelings and asserted myself, which had led to lots of my relationships (of all kinds) being unhealthy for me as I didn’t look after myself.

I am now happily single and have been in a job since October which although it’s tough work, has done absolute wonders for my self-esteem and self-confidence. I’ve been seeing a therapist at varying frequency since early this year and have had to confront a _lot_ of stuff: I bottled up my emotions and didn’t assert myself, meaning others often annoyed me without even knowing because I never told them, which damaged my relationships. I’ve for the first time ever realised how deep the negative and very abnormal thought patterns go which developed when I was about 14-15, and it’s going to take a while to build myself anew without these. But I have a job I enjoy surrounded by people I love and feel comfortable not inferior around, I have money, I’m learning more about getting with girls (I’m not bad at this, as such...I just have never really tried to chat girls up IRL much), I have career interests, I have home(s since my parents are divorced), I have the support of my therapist and family and some friends and am still yet to come to terms with the fact I’m not just going to slip back into a really bad state of mind, as it’s so ingrained that I will that it still hasn’t sunk in deep down that I won’t. I can continue thinking of myself more and realising how important communicating is in relationships and that it’s actually probably not going to upset the other person lots, in fact probably not at all. 

Long post sorry. I felt the need to say this.

110,"A little over a year ago, I was going through a very bad depressive episode and I needed someone to talk to, but I had no one, so I texted a girl I had talked to earlier in an online group chat. I told her what was bothering me and she was really supportive and helpful. 
We started talking and developed what I thought was a great friendship. We would text each other all day and I just loved talking to her, and felt like I could share my problems with her without any judgement. After a few months of this, I started feeling things for her. It was very weird and she was the first person I had ever had feelings for. I managed to gather the courage to tell her this and honestly expected her to get mad at me but she said ""Yeah, I know that. I thought that was mutual."" That was probably the first time I had felt genuinely happy in months and it was the most amazing feeling. She went to a camp for a month and got to use a computer once a week and I would send her super long emails telling her about my week and about how much I missed her and she would reply telling me about hers, and she said that she thought about me more than she thought about her friends she had known for way longer. All of this meant the world to me. Just knowing that I wasn't alone and that I wasn't the most unlikable person on the planet because someone as awesome as her cared for me was wonderful and made me want to keep on living.

I haven't had a will to live since my brother's death, when I was in 9th grade, but talking to her about my problems gave me hope, and made me feel like I wasn't alone. I have a lot of friends irl, and I love them all, but she was special. 
I never really did anything about the fact that I liked her, because we live so far away, but I remember us talking about how great it would be if we were neighbours. 

She got into the college that was her top choice (not surprising, she's probably the smartest person my age that I know) and I was so happy for her 

A few months ago, she moved to college, and I knew that we would have less time together, but I was fine with that. She said she had kept her afternoons free so that we could talk. 

Everything was going great until I fucked it up. I got really, really depressed and instinctively went to her for support, but this time, she wasn't as available because she had college to handle and couldn't handle my shit as an extra curricular activity, so instead of being considerate and understanding like I should have been, I started feeling like I was a burden on her and that we should stop talking. She hated this and after a few weeks of this, she told me that we weren't talking anymore. 
I don't think she did anything wrong here and take full blame for this. I brought it upon myself. 
I do however wish she had communicated and said ""Yeah man you fucked up, now let's try to fix this."" instead of just dumping me. 
Then this, coupled with the depression, made me really really fucked up and suicidal. She had told me in the past that if I was ever going to actually kill myself she wanted to know as she wouldn't like being stuck thinking about what happened to me and not knowing. So I texted her and told her this. 

She thought I was threatening her with suicide. 

That was not what I was doing but it was stupid of me to even tell her this at all. I had gone to the roof of a really tall building and planned to jump but when I actually got to the edge, I wasn't able to. I froze and was too afraid to do anything. 

The next day, she sent me a video of herself playing an instrument and then we started talking again. I tried to make our conversations better but she seemed uninterested, as if it was a chore to talk to me. 
On the 7th of november she told me she wanted to stop talking again. I asked her if we were ever going to talk again and she said she didn't know if she wanted to talk again. 
But then we did talk again, every once in a while. It felt like cheating but I loved it when we did that. 
I asked her again if we would ever go back to normal and she said there was a 50% chance. 
I said I wanted a conclusive answer, and since she wasn't giving me one, I told her that I didn't want to talk to her anymore, eventho I really did. 


I ended up texting her again and then for a few days, we were doing great. But then she tells me she wants to cut communications once more. 

This time I can't even blame myself for it. She has hurt me enough and doesn't seem to care enough to at least explain what went wrong. She told me she barely knows me and doesn't even think of me as a friend. 
I stopped feeling for her romantically a long time ago, but what does she mean by saying she barely knows me? We've talked so much and I've never even been a friend? What made her start talking to me last time? Because she really didn't have to and maybe then we wouldn't have done this again. She get my hopes up and I think that maybe things will get better between us but then she do this shit again and again. 

I don't know what to do. I feel irritated by her and I wish I didn't feel like this but I think it's her fault I'm hurting. Maybe I'm being stupid and it is my fault. Probably that's the case. 


I'd just like some advice about what to do. When the pain and contempt subsides, I'll have a hard time not texting her.
