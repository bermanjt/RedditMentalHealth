0,"I [17F] am a second semester senior and I go to a very competitive school where it‚Äôs kind of drilled into all of the kids a constant work-study-sleep-study-work mindset. I‚Äôve studied my ass off for the last four years of my life and never really had time to do anything I really liked. 

Now I‚Äôve gotten into college, my classes are easy, and I find myself with a ton of free time. The problem is, I don‚Äôt even remember what I like to do for fun. It seems like most of my friends are having this problem too. We‚Äôre used to moving around hours of homework and studying and extracurriculars, and it feels very lonely and odd to not have any hobbies. Whenever I had free time (which was rare), I would nap, or rest, because I was always tired. 

How do I figure out what I like to do? It sounds like a very basic and ironic question, but I really do want to know what I like to do.",04Feb2018,1
1,"Known her for this entire school year.  We've hung out on several occasions, mostly with other people, but never really text or talk beyond the few times we do hang out.  I snapchat her 2-3 times a day.  Sometimes more, sometimes less, but most of the time I don't get a reply, so I kind of feel like I'm annoying her.

I text even less, which I want to change. Usually we'll text to arrange to meet up or something, but nothing casual, which is what I'd like to start doing.  But like the title says, I'm really afraid I'm going to annoy her with bullshit conversations.  I just really would like to become better friends with her, but don't know how

3,"I want to have/do the following:
(listed in order of importance to me, from high to low)

- Fully study all the material in my courses. One week in advance of the planner.

- Work out in accordance with my schedule and eat/drink in accordance with my diet. (3.5k calories)

- Keep my friendships healthy by frequently visiting and talking to everyone.

- Keeping my volunteer job.

- Getting a stable girlfriend.

- Getting to diamond on League of Legends.

I want to try and get all of this together. I'm not sure if I have the time to do it, but it should be possible if I have the drive to do it.

If I sort the list to how hard it is for me, it looks a lot more different. Here's the list from easy to hard:

- Keeping my volunteer job

- Keeping my friendships healthy

- Getting to diamond on League of Legends 

- Fully study all the material in my courses.

- Getting a stable girlfriend

- Work out and eat 3.5k.

Now the league of the legends thing may be weird to some of you, but I really like the game so it's important to me. Obviously not as important as the rest though. 

To start of with the studying part: I can write assignments really quickly, but I find it difficult to read a lot. I was thinking about having one day a week to finish assignments and the other days just read an x amount of pages per course each day. 
Between this reading I can do a workout as a break. After reading I either visit a friend or play league. In the evening I prepare some high calorie food and watch my lost games to see what I did wrong while eating it. This way I both get in my food and develop more skill in league.  I will have to cut in my gaming to keep my volunteer job on Tuesday. Doing all this will make me very happy and I'll also become lean. This will make me more attractive, thus getting me closer to getting a stable gf. If I follow this all, I should be able to reach all my listed goals.

I mostly wrote this for myself to read back later, but if you have any thoughts, feel free to comment them :)",04Feb2018,1

10,"By ""zombie"" I don't mean human remains that shamble around trying to snack on your brain. I mean some social feature--an industry, a practice, a set of beliefs or attitudes, a subculture, or any number of other things--that are effectively dead but remain animated because they are deeply entrenched and continue to move around in their undeath as a result of infusions of money and simple habit.

Hardcopy print is dead--so dead that you probably don't know what ""hardcopy"" used to mean. It meant words printed on physical paper rather than in electronic form. The written word is carving out its own niche among the pics and emojis that dominate electronic media. There are even robust and exciting print magazines that have sprung up entirely online, without significant vestiges of their hardcopy ancestry. (Examples: Quillette, Medium, The Athletic.) But hardcopy continues to exist as a zombie only because of significant infrastructure, habit, employment numbers, pre-existing financial investment, and a habituated consumer base that is growing old and dying of old age without anyone replacing it. You can expect that decades more will pass with hardcopy books being published, hardcopy magazines and newspapers available for sale, hardcopy records maintained by government and large organizations, hardcopy legal requirements such as a signature handwritten in pen to turn a document into a legal instrument, etc. But those things will not be part of something living, merely of something dead that continues to move around because it's deeply entrenched.

There are many other examples of zombies in our society, but you're free to think of them for yourself. I'm looking forward to seeing whether anyone brings up anything I haven't said--or this gets downvoted into being hidden because it's too complex for Reddit.",04Feb2018,0

14,"I am wondering how I can get my parents to understand that I am busy and exhausted. 

I‚Äôm in my early 20s. I am a full time student with 5 classes this semester. 4 of those 5 classes are online, but require 6 hours a week. There‚Äôs 20 hours. I also am at the college on Tuesday‚Äôs for 1 hour and 15 minutes, and Thursday‚Äôs for 5 hours. In school work alone, that‚Äôs ~26 hours. 

I work a part time job that‚Äôs roughly 30 hours a week.

With just that, I‚Äôm up to 56 hours a week in work. 

I am working on getting a second job that‚Äôs at least 8 hours a week. 

Now we are at 64 hours a week. 

My parents are constantly asking me to wash clothes, wash dishes, clean. I have no problem doing these things when I have time, but it seems that they always ask me when I am doing my schoolwork. 

My parents excuse is that they are exhausted from working a 40 hour (or less) work week. 

They drive roughly an hour away from home to go to work, but so do I for school. On Thursdays I don‚Äôt eat all day because of my class. 

Then, when I tell them ‚Äúno‚Äù I get this huge lecture on how I live in the house rent free and that I need to respect them more...

I respect the hell out of them and am thankful that I live rent free, but I‚Äôm putting in almost 16 hours on top of their workweek in school and work. 

I do what I can for them. I help them with bills when I can. I help them around the house when I can. But it never seems like it‚Äôs enough. I‚Äôve attempted talking to them about it, and it almost always ends in an argument.

I want to move out, but I physically can‚Äôt. I have $700+ in bill a month currently and I don‚Äôt make enough money. I‚Äôm a full time student so a full time job is out of the question with my program.

18,"I tried really hard to avoid buying a MacBook, because I figured they're overrated, overpriced and restrictive. It seemed like for the same amount of money, you could always get better hardware with Windows. But my workplace pretty much runs exclusively on Mac (psychology lab) and I couldn't be on the same page as everyone else while running Windows or Linux. I was debating buying the Dell XPS 13, but I ended up going for a MacBook Air. 

It's been two weeks. I did not expect to like my MacBook so much, but I do. Everything just works! When I got it, I just turned it on and started using it. There's no bloatware and no tinkering with settings. With Windows, errors were always around the corner, making me waste another 10 minutes googling solutions, but I'm not holding my breath waiting for something to go wrong anymore and it's such a huge relief. It's like being in a freakin zen garden. 

Like, there are things that are annoying with the Mac. I still have trouble dealing with how the file-edit-view... options go on the top bar rather than staying with the window, and certain design choices feel restrictive. But these are things that I can get used to. I can see why my lab uses Macs--we can't afford to lose any time dealing with petty issues. The overall stability outweighs the price and the restrictions, at least for me.

26,"Ok, so I go to boarding school. And what I am about to tell you happened. So, a couple of my friends and I were planning to stay up all Saturday night and watch movies. So everything is fine. We are all drinking and eating and generally enjoying ourselves. However, at 2:00 AM some fucking crazy ass motherfucking shit happened. Like I can not ever explain this shit without breaking out in laughter, but this shit I am about to divulge actually occurred. So, the roommate of the friends whose room we were in (Lets call this aforementioned roommate, Person X), starts acting super weirdly all of a sudden. Like, before 2:00 AM he was fine, but then like outta nowhere his entire demeanor changed unprompted. He slammed his computer (I mean like SLAMMED) shut and started pounding the desk as if his fist was a hammer. He then proceeded to pound and kick the wall. HE did this with such force it started to shake. Person X than got up from his chair, and paced around the room for a little bit at which point he said (Albeit Slurred) that  he was hallucinating (He also had a red swollen lump under his eye, if that makes a difference. Earlier in the day, the lump was smaller and progressively got bigger as the day went on. He said it was stinging as well.). After Person X paces around for a little while longer, he exits the room. He enters again, and sits down at his desk, resting his head on the desk. Soon, again, he paces around the room, proclaims once again that he is hallucinating, proceeds to assault the wall again, exits to an undisclosed location, returns. We started to get concerned as his pupils where dilated and he was looking quite disheveled. His walking was more comparable with stumbling than with a normal, fluid walk. Then finally, we follow him to the bathroom to see what the hell is wrong with him. Person X stares at himself in the mirror, and mumbles some random unintelligible shit. Then, he goes into stall, a takes a nasty ass shit (Like it smelled worse than a New York City dumpster. You could hear interpolated farts as he was shitting, it was nasty). After 2 minutes of pure shitting (Yes he shat for 2 minutes), he pulled his pants up (There is no way one can shit like that and wipe in under 2 minutes. It is just not possible). Then, Person X goes to the sink. Only problem, HE DOES NOT EVERN USE SOAP!!!!!!!!! He just rinses his hands in cold water. As I then asked, why he used no soap, he just slowly turns his head in my direction super slowly (Like something you would see in the Shining), and mumbles some more unintelligible shit. However, I understood three words ""Hell, Anarchy, and Angel."". He then flicks his hand in my direction, with all that nasty water. I exit the bathroom and make my way to the vending machine, but Person X sure enough follows me. He then stares at me from a good 15 minutes, after which he approaches me slowly. Then, with this murderous look in his eyes, he runs at me full speed (Luckily I sprint as fast as a motherfucker. My 100 meter dash time is 10.47 seconds.). I am, obviously, concerned and I make my way to campus security to report all the fuckery that just occurred. They sit him down, and ask my friend and I questions about the night. He didnt have any of our snacks and drinks. Also, when we were asked if Person X took any drugs or drank any alcohol, we said no (At lest Not that I know of. He is kinda secretive, so who knows what the hell this kid did.). Security chats with him a while longer, and they send him to his room. I go to talk to my friend about this, when I see that Person X is just fine (He still smelled though lmao). When I asked him what he remembered, he said he did not remember anything. I have no idea what happened, and the entire situation is just kinda freaking me out. Well, that was my Saturday night. I hope y'all get some laughs from this.

Since I was born I was indoctrinated into the Christian religion by my family. I was never one for church or any kind of worship, and realized as I aged that I really didn't believe in Christianity.

I had an inner conflict, and had to decide right now whether I was religious or not, and I chose the ladder. 

That was a few months ago.

42,"Hello, everyone. I introduced myself before on these forums, and I want to give my warm appreciation for all the help and support that every one of you gives.

These days I've been thinking a lot, perhaps moreso than usual. A relative of mine passed away from cancer at the age of 30, and the suddenness of it made me really think about and examine my life.

I have been giving a lot of thought about what it is that is truly important. If I were to die tomorrow, what would I want people to remember me by? How would I want to be remembered?  This has made me reconsider a lot of things that I have traditionally been taught was important. 

I used to think that being wealthy and popular was the most important thing, that if I could accomplish this, all my problems could be solved. But then I look around me and see the people that have 1000s of followers on Facebook, Instagram, and the like, and they are lonelier than ever. It is an interesting paradox we live in that the world is more connected than ever before, yet people are more lonely than ever. It made me realize that it is not the quantity of people we have in our lives, but the quality. Being surrounded by just a handful of loving friends, family, and relatives who will support you for just being you is far more important than gaining the admiration of the manager of a company, the president of an organization, or any other position of authority who will likely only adore you for your accomplishments, not the kind of person that you were.

My rumination has also lead me to think about what I really value. What would I want to be true for myself no matter what?  I've come to the conclusion that justice and equity are the most important things to me. That's why I plan to attend a conference at my college regarding a controversial billboard that had very negative things to say about gay and lesbian people, which the university actually allowed. I understand that the need for free speech is important and is part of an ongoing debate on college campuses, but I don't believe that a place that bills itself as a ""safe space"" for such people should go and contradict those values by allowing such signs to be posted. Either way, I will go with an open mind and listen to both sides of the argument.

I have no qualifications that allow me to do this. I am not apart of a student union, but I believe that this doesn't matter in the long run. What matters is that individuals have the will to do what is right, credentials be damned. 

I think going through this process of rumination has allowed me to focus on what actually matters. I was confused for some time as to what a proper career path should be, but I realized now that if you don't have family and friends and colleagues that support you, it doesn't matter how wealthy you are, you will always be poor.

Does anyone else have some thoughts on what is truly important?

43,"That's how it is. I've got severe depression, but not in the sad way, so much as in the nothing interests me at all and I'm constantly bored way. I've spent over a year like this, where every day is the same, and occasionally I get the urge to do something productive. Make music, learn to draw - you know. Within a few days, though, my interest fizzles out 100%, and there's no reason to continue. Ordinarily, you keep going at this point for the joy of finally accomplishing that task. For me, though, I feel nothing when that happens. When I kill a hard boss in a video game, the only emotion I feel is relief that I no longer have to subject myself to it. To actually keep going with a hobby, I would have to work like a slave, since there's no real incentive to keep going.

But another part of me thinks: Perhaps I should force myself to do it. Put my teeth to the grindstone so that when I'm mentally healthy I'll have a leg-up on my old self.

Two years ago, I guess I would say I developed an unhealthy relationship with food. It really hit me out of nowhere. January 2016, I was killing it. I went from 207 lbs (my highest at the time) to 192 lbs (the lowest I've been since graduating high school). I felt amazing and was fairly active doing C25k and a couple of hikes that were thrown in every week or so. I've actually reached the point where I began to like myself. I have always struggled to lose weight after I started college, but that month had me convinced I had my life by the reigns. 


My birthday rolled around at the end of January that year, and somehow I just spiraled out of control. The occasional days I ate 2000+ calories became every day. By the end of 2016, I weighed 250 lbs. And even today, I struggle, weighing in even more at 260. I hate my body, I hate my lack of self control. 


Guys, I don't know what went wrong and how I can stop it. Every day, all day, I eat basically whatever I get my hands on. I get scared and even think about how I could die early to this habit, but it doesn't really stop me. I want to live now, but why can I not stop?

50,"I just switched over to Music Composition after being a mortuary science major for a year and a half. I played music all through junior high and high school, took theory in High School, was a state recognized drummer my junior year, and I had to force myself to go to school because I really didn't care about anything but music.

However, I lost interest in it my senior year. I just didn't have fun anymore, I was too hard on myself when I played badly, I couldn't accept complements because I felt I didn't deserve them, and I took criticism so hard that I would spiral myself into a terrible depressive state. I have bipolar disorder and the usual depression/anxiety bullshit, and it has been a reoccurring problem since my freshman year of high school. I decided to go to &lt;state university&gt; for sports broadcasting, and got a fair bit of money from them. I enjoyed the school, but didn't like what I was studying, and moved back home to start studying to be a funeral director.

Yeah, huge jump, right? Something about the funeral business felt so right to me, like I needed to be there. My biggest quality, at least that I see in myself, is that I am always trying to make people happy in any way I can. I felt that when people were at their lowest low, I could help them by arranging a beautiful service that would not only make them happy, but also relieved, knowing that their loved one was treasured by many, and will rest peacefully, wherever they end up.

Long story short, I wouldn't have been able to exactly start studying it for another year or two, and as somebody with depression, I couldn't have picked a more goddamn morbid job to reach for.

During all of this time, I didn't play music or study it at all. I listened to it a ton, and I've always wanted to create my own music, but I never made the effort back in the day, knowing that when senior year came around, I was going to give up on music and focus on something else.

So, I've come full circle. I guess the good news is that I'm playing again, in music classes, involved with bands on campus, and am starting to compose my own stuff. However, almost daily I freak myself out about money and buying equipment and having to learn so much that I freeze up. I know I want to be in music, I really really do. But I'm surrounded by people in my classes who are far more advanced than me, and I'm so behind anybody who is a music major at my age, considering I started so late. My girlfriend who is studying music education has been fantastic, helping me with whatever I need, but I'm also jealous of her! She's incredibly talented, she got a full ride to her university, and is a hell of a singer. 

I love her, and I respect those people in my classes, but I can't see myself getting to that level without a change of mindset. It doesn't help that I worry about everything under the fucking sun, and have little to no self-confidence.

I know I can do it. But my brain keeps telling me I can't.

I apologize for the sloppy writing. I wanted to get this up because I needed to, if anything else, just rant and type it out so I could see in front of me what I need to work on. 

If you have any advice, that would be awesome. Or, just a constructive comment. Seriously, anything would be incredibly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",04Feb2018,5
51,"Last night, I went out drinking with my friend. When we came back home, we brought liquor to our dorms. We went to my room to drink, and were soon joined by a few other friends and my girlfriend of 4 months. She watched (concerned) as I piled on the drinks, to finish off the night with a .17 BAC. (We keep a breathalyzer handy for these nights.)

My girlfriend has seen me drunk a countless number of times, a couple times to the point where I'm fully dependent on her to do things. It's not a great feeling.

This time was way worse, I don't remember much, but I remember breaking down in front of her for the first time. That amount of drinks can make you overly emotional, and I've also been feeling increasingly depressed over these past few weeks. But I can't formulate my feelings, nor would I dream of talking about how I feel when sober. I had always felt that I had to be ""the stable one"" in the relationship. Not that she is unstable -- I don't know if she is depressed (not for want of asking), but she often gets very sad too. I didn't ever want to display myself in a position of vulnerability; yet, last night, she held me for hours in private as I sobbed about hating my life and her deserving someone better than me, among quick commercial breaks of me running to the toilet to vomit a record number of times.

Then, she cried along with me. And I got sadder.

Today, I feel like shit. Both because I can't shake this post-hangover nausea (even though it's 5 PM), but also because I made her cry. 

And here's the soppy part: I'm overwhelmed because I love her to such an extent, and she knows it, and I can say without vainglory that she loves me too. She makes me so happy, even though I'm depressed. She's so kind and caring to me, in a way I couldn't be. I stand by what I said under the influence, she is too good for me, and god knows what would have happened had no one been there for me last night. But she's always here, and I simply feel inadequate.

An important thing I almost forgot: we both promised each other we would make time to actually talk about things: mostly, how we feel. I still suck at talking below surface-level conversation (I can't even explain why I'm depressed -- very few things in my life warrant the dose of self-loathing I inflict upon myself), but I will try.  

Today, I also decided I would stop drinking. This isn't my first time saying this, and I hope I can do it.",04Feb2018,1
52,"My girlfriend and I are both seniors this year, and we've been together for almost two years.  As of now, it's looking like we'll probably end up going to the same college.  I could probably change this and go to a better school, but put myself further away from home than I'd like and into a much more negative financial situation, so I'm leaning away from doing that.  

My question is, should we stay together?  We've got our ups and downs, like every relationship does.  I'd say we're pretty normal.  Maybe a bit more mature than your average high  school relationship, but at the same time, we're a high school relationship.   

We've discussed this a little bit, and of course we haven't made any serious decisions (still got several months until we actually need to know).  Right now, we're just on the side of ""if we're still happy and still love each other, why end it?"".  I agree with this, however I've also heard the whole ""don't do it, you'll hold each other back"".  

Really just looking for some feedback from other people who have been through this, and how you feel about your decision.  Thanks :)",04Feb2018,1
