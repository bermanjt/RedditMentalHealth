0,"Me and my boyfriend broke up nearly a year ago because he moved to another country on a working holiday visa. He had planned to do this with friends way before we got together so I would never want to stop him from doing this/ask him to stay with me. We just got on SO well and things escalated even though neither of us were looking for anything serious. We truly loved each other. We spoke quite a bit when he first went but obviously as time went on we spoke less and less. It got to the point where I was constantly checking his social media accounts to see what he was doing when we weren’t speaking and on maybe 3 different occasions said to him can we please not speak anymore because it’s truly heart breaking for me. He was very understanding and obliged and agreed to catch up in the future etc. However every time I did this I ended up messaging him some shit or the other because I hated not being able to speak to him. I eventually removed him on all my social media’s without telling him / giving pre warning because it was still so hard and I thought this would help massively. I also felt like I was annoying as fuck even though he had said multiple times I wasn’t (I think he was just being polite). Unfortunately, for some reason, I am still just as heart broken as I was the day he left. I think this is maybe because we did not break up for any reason other than him moving away. I haven’t spoken to him for several months now and yet I‘m still just as bothered as the day he left. Chances are he’s moved on completely so guys, any tips on how I can too? ",26Feb2018,1

5,"Last year I graduated from my undergrad, with two degrees: one in Electrical Engineering (major was actually Computer Engineering) with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics, and one degree in French with a minor in Arabic. I live in Louisiana and I want to get the fuck out of here. Last January I applied to a program in Sweden in Intelligent Embedded Systems which is like a mix of robotics and artificial intelligence. I applied late, but I was still accepted. I ultimately didn't go though, because I needed more time off school to collect myself and my emotions, and I wanted to do the Mongol Rally ([link for any people who are interested in traveling the world](http://www.theadventurists.com/mongol-rally)) which had been my dream for years. I don't regret taking a year off. But now I'm ready to go pursue my passions and I've re-applied to the program from last year, and to a second program in Norway. I don't need a scholarship to study in Norway but apparently they only accept like 5% of international applicants so I frankly don't expect to get accepted. I need a scholarship to study in Sweden, and I have applied for it. So I would either need to get accepted to the Norwegian university or get accepted to the Swedish university with a scholarship. Either of these possibilities would be fucking amazing. The only downside is that I would have to leave my current job and my boss has told me he wants to keep me. But I think he would be happy for me overall. I'm not really worried about that. What I'm worried about is the possibility of my not getting accepted at all. Then I would be stuck here in Louisiana. I'm good at my current job but it's so boring and I desperately want more excitement. If I don't get accepted then I have to fight it longer or find another job. And I really would like to get out of this state either way.


Last time I applied I got a score on my application of 998 out of a maximum 999. I got a rating of 935/999 on a separate application this year. While this is good, these ratings explicitly do not guarantee anything. And even if I get accepted to the Swedish university, but don't get the scholarship, I don't know if I can really justify going. But I have been feeling restless here for a few years now. I really have to get out of Louisiana.

8,"Hi guys, hope everyone that reads this is doing well.
(TLDR at the very bottom) 

It always takes a break up right? I'm not gonna say the girl was perfect, or that she was irreplaceable or one of a kind. What I can say is that it was the first ever relationship where I was really invested. We were together for almost two years. However, she abruptly broke up with me. It was difficult being with me I was always stressed and complaining (was too unattractive to be fair)

I took it pretty badly to be honest. She was my fourth girlfriend, but the others never lasted more than six months. I dreamt about her every single night for two months straight. I was aching physically! It was the first time a break up had taken this big a toll on me. Started developing anxiety, I was eventually diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder. Little by little everything started to go to shit. I did very bad in university, didn't pay much attention to my relationships with my friends, became bitter towards girls, smoked too much cigarettes and I generally became lost and aimless. I'd wake up watch series, eat a burger go meet the same group of people then sleep. I successfully became the person I DESPISE THE MOST! 

You can imagine what it's like. Here's what bugs me, I used to be extremely confident, to a point where I'm sometimes cocky (I was often told that even though I might go overboard with it, it sometimes was appealing in a way. I had a very strong presence). I used to think I'm very smart and would shoot for the moon whenever I could. I used to not care about what people think. Everything seemed to always fall into place somehow. I was somewhat fit or in better health than I am now. I was very sociable. I used to play the guitar. I mean everything was so easily attainable! Everything was in reach, nothing seemed impossible. NOTHING! 

Nonetheless, after my breakup I started to take medication for my anxiety, but I stopped because I want to do this without any medical help. I don't want to be dependent on them. Thankfully I'm not I was able to come off them. I'm over my ex now. My concern is who I've become and who I'll eventually become if I don't put an end to this. A sad, lonely, mediocre and uninteresting man.

I don't know why but I don't love myself like I used to anymore. I'm not capable of assessing myself from afar. I'm obsessed with trying to become a better person, a smarter person, a high achieving man but I sadly can't seem to put the slightest of effort into it. I read self help books like the 7 habits of highly effective People, think and grow rich and the like, but I don't really apply them. I'm always excited by the idea of a new tomorrow where I'll tear apart the day. Tomorrow comes and I do nothing.

I can plan my day sensibly, but I just don't do anything. For instance, I have a job application at a very big firm, I've been putting it off for a month now and I'm afraid I'll miss the opportunity. I know I'm one of there best candidates) 

I know this might sound like I'm a lazy, spoiled, self-involved asshole, but I'm coming to you for guidance. I hope someone who's been through this reads this and is able to help.


TLDR: I'm obsessed with doing more and becoming a better person. If I achieve what I have in mind I'll really be able to make a change in this world. I know what I should do, but I never do it. I just don't do anything. Hating the person I've become and I NEED to change, I just don't though. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I hope you guys can help me. Have a wonderful day. ",26Feb2018,2

I'm not really sure where to start and I don't know what people here will make of this because well...

Anyways, this has been bothering me for a while now and I really don't know what I'm doing and I feel like a horrible person I don't know

For context:

-F/gay in my early 20s

-I have a girlfriend of 6 years

I met someone online maybe 6 months ago and we've been talking casually (like the polite how are you's, etc.) up until December last year. THEN we started talking constantly, everyday, being clingy and all, and I'd enjoy talking so much I would stay up until dawn just texting to this person about everything. I'd get so anxious when they don't reply to me, and they'd act the same way about me.

When I asked a friend if feeling this attached to someone was normal she told me it was probably a platonic crush, and that I probably just wanted to be really good friends with them so bad, and I thought yeah sure it made sense. I made no further effort to think about it afterwards.

This person and I have this running joke that this was a ~no homo~ crush thing, but lately we've been calling each other love of my life (a common endearment term for online friends, so I've been told). Apart from this, we've been so vocal about how much we love each other (platonically......) for the time that we've been talking constantly.

I've even been told that I'm the most important person in their life and honestly, I feel guilty for saying this but I feel much the same way. I've never loved anyone as intensely as this. I even flew to their city last week to finally meet them in person, and I was with my girlfriend then. The whole time, though, I wanted to be alone with just this person, just talking and hanging out. I'd feel giddy each time they put their arm on my shoulder and I'd try and hold their hand when i'd drag them to go somewhere but I could only hold them by their wrist because I'd feel too shy and I didn't want to make it weird.

I'd wanted to just spend some time with them without them feeling too shy around my girlfriend so I bought us some time alone by these benches under the shade in the rain just sitting beside each other and making small talk because we were both so overwhelmed we were actually talking to each other in person. Honestly I'd just feel so happy just sitting beside them... just being with them and getting to see them smile. We'd even sdfjghfjfhfkjh said our I love you's in person although I was too shy to do it at first, but anyways...

AS MUCH as I'd like to think this is strictly platonic I'm starting to find this a little... strange. The friend I'd asked about this earlier even told me that we act like we're in a relationship just because we're REALLY affectionate and im starting to think this too because (1) we're technically not each other's best friend and (2) we're not each other's girlfriend but like I said we've both been so vocal about how much we love each other.

My friend keeps asking me if this was turning into something romantic and I honestly don't know myself anymore. For one, they're eight years younger than me. A whole teenager. I don't want anything sexual and I've always made sure not to say anything inappropriate.

On the other hand, we both have girlfriends. I don't know what her girlfriend thinks of this but mine had been so upset with me during the trip we took to this person's city. I found out she had looked at my phone and saw our texts, even taking photos of them to send to one of our old close friends just to ask for advice. The thing is I'd always been like this with my best friends from when I was younger. I was always affectionate and clingy and treated them the most important people in my life, and our friend had told her just the same.

Now I just feel guilty for this maybe because I've known this person for 6 months and already I feel like I love them more than my girlfriend of 6 YEARS.

I honestly don't know what to make of this. Whatever it is, I'm never acting on it for the obvious reasons. Although this situation very much reminds me of Call Me By Your Name, has anyone seen it?

I just feel devastated at the thought that one day we're bound to lose each other, just because whatever this relationship is remains unclear (to me). They don't find it weird at all nor do they seem as confused as I am. I don't know.

Just want to know what you guys think about this whole thing. Thanks for reading through this. Long post is long! ",26Feb2018,3
11,"I'm not sure where else to post, but I need help. I'm a 17 year old high school student, a bit of a nerd and somewhat socially awkward. In december, a really hot girl joined my robotics team. I immediately took an interest in her, and we started talking, and became friends. We got along really well and I could actually talk to her comfortably, which was unique from every other time I've liked a girl. Fast forward to a month ago. I decide to ask her out on a date, she says yes. I'm thrilled, this is the first time that's ever happened to me, it's kind of a big deal. We both have really busy and uncertain schedules, so a few days go by without being able to make a plan. One night, she messages me out of the blue with ""we're just going to hang out as friends, right?"" I'm devastated, I cry myself to sleep for the next 2 nights and don't pay attention or do any work in school for the next day (she sent the message on a thursday). I later find out that she hadn't even realized I was trying to ask her out.

Anyway, it's been a month. I've tried talking to other girls and asked one or two out (they said no) but I haven't moved on. I still have feelings for this girl, even though I know there's no possibility of us dating and, despite her telling me that she still really wanted to be friends, I have barely spoken to her since that day. I'm sad, and I can't seem to get rid of these feelings. What do I do?

TL;DR: Asked out girl I really liked, she said yes then it turned out she hadn't realized I was asking her out and didn't want to date me. Still haven't gotten over it even though it's been a month, not sure what to do.",26Feb2018,3

26,"I kept ignoring the signs that my heart kept giving me. Maybe I was hoping I could enjoy the simplicity of friendship and sex. Maybe I'm lying to myself that I don't want a committed relationship again. Maybe I just want a ethical non-monogamous relationship and a part of me was hoping it would turn into that.

I didn't let myself completely feel for him because I was worried this would happen. I could sense him being cold at times and distance, but I didn't listen to that. I've spent the past month avoiding people who are cold and distant, but his openness and honesty about sex and life is what caught me off guard.

She texted me a bunch of times while I was out, asking me if she could pray for my dad etc. We aren't friends and it just felt like she was making it about her somehow.  Apparently she also took it upon herself to text the link to my father's obituary to everyone else on my team while I was gone. Somehow that felt pretty invasive to me. I don't know.

Anyway, the first thing in my day was a meeting with my team. Sally came in and saw me and said ""Oh, you poor thing! Can I give you a hug?"" I am female but *not* really a touchy-feely person. I said ""Actually I'd prefer you didn't, I'm not really a hugger, thanks though."" She got all sadface and said ""Ohhhhhhh...well... I guess I'll just have to send you a virtual hug then..."" and then went on and on about how the death of a parent is SO HARD and THESE THINGS ARE JUST NEVER EASY JUST SO HARD and YOU POOR THING.

Writing it out, I know it doesn't sound like a big deal. Sally is just so good at passive aggression and then spreading around her own version of events. I am sure she decided I was HURTING TOO MUCH to ACCEPT LOVE AND KINDNESS etc. When really I just want to be able to turn down a hug sometimes.

33,"[Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/7xn71f/im_planning_on_telling_my_best_friend_how_i/)

Okay, maybe not the update people expected, and honestly I’m still unsure about what to do. But I think I’ve decided against letting her know and instead just trying to move on and remain friends for now. There’s a few reasons for this.

So when I told her I was gonna quit our work she told me that if I was leaving she was gonna start looking for a new job too. I handed in my resignation, and on my very last day she found out she got hired at a new place. We both left on the same day. I’m glad to be out of that job man, apart from working with her it was soul destroying, and even then we barely ever had the same shifts.

Anyway, the problem is she went to work with her boyfriend. She told me he was reluctant about working with her at first for some reason, but that if she thinks it will work then he’ll manage to get used to it. She asked me what she should do. I knew that if she goes to work there she’s gonna be closer to him, and I knew that if I told her how I feel after she accepts the job and works with him that I’m just gonna make her life and her new job harder and awkward. I still want to tell her so much, but I know how much she hates our job, and honestly she seemed so damn happy to be able to escape.

I knew deep down that she’s gonna be happier working with him at a new job. My choice was essentially tell her to stay, where she’ll be miserable but I can maybe let her know without awkwardness. Or I could tell her to go for it, make telling her much more complicated but let he be happy. So obviously I told her to go for it and take the chance. I couldn’t bring myself to ruin how happy she seemed to be for a new start. So she took the job. She starts in a week and she’s really excited. I’m honestly really happy for her, and I kinda think at this point telling her is just gonna make both our lives harder and weirder.

Anyway, today we were hanging out and somehow we got onto the topic of guys and girls and close friendships. She said that she doesn’t really think guys and girls are able to be ‘just friends’, cause if they get really close something always seems to happen between them. I kind of mind blanked and didn’t know what to say, so I just agreed. I mean I am her closest guy friend. Maybe I’m overthinking it, but was she trying to tell me something by bringing this up? Like she’s literally describing the exact situation I’m in.

I feel like maybe that was her way of letting me know indirectly she knows how I feel or whatever, and putting it down to a ‘maybe one day’ thing. I dunno though, I could be completely overthinking it. If I’m right though, she’s committed herself even more to her boyfriend and basically acknowledged to me that she knows how I feel. I feel like at his point telling her is just gonna cost me my best friend no matter what, and with no possible upside apart from making my life a little easier. I feel like it’s just not the right time to tell her.

Maybe I’m way off base and I should just let her know for my own peace of mind, but I just can’t see the benefit here. Anyway should I just try move on for now? Or should I still tell her regardless of all this? ",26Feb2018,4
34,"Hi Reddit,

I just got out of a toxic relationship. My e-bf was an alcoholic who had angry issues. By all means, he was not a good partner and I left before things escalated in the relationship.


I realized something today. Despite all the issues my ex had, I think I'm damaged too. I suffer from my depression and it has come back in full-force. I was so busy taking care of my ex that I almost forgot my own darkness. Now that he's gone, I'm looking at my depression right in the face.

My ex was my first serious boyfriend. I've lost a lot of friends over the years and it has been incredibly hard to reconnect with them again. No one knew about my depression but my ex boyfriend. Even though it was toxic, he did help me feel loved for the first time.

He's gone and I'm left picking up the pieces of my own life. I am not happy. I want to move forward but it feels impossible. I miss him. I am lonely.

On the outside, I appear normal. I'm cheerful, friendly, polite, and I am making plans to get a career going. On the inside, I feel lonely. I miss my ex, even though he hurts me.

I'm posting this here today because I know these thoughts are not normal, and they are miserable for anyone to hear. This is my cross to carry. I am sitting in an empty room and I wish these feelings pass.

I really need a hug right now. Thanks for reading my vent.

35,"It was only recently that America was wondering whether the frequent stories of teachers having sex with their students was approaching an epidemic crisis.

Today, America wants to arm its teachers?

Now that the fallacious argument of having a ""good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun"" was all that was needed to end all discussion of gun control, the new, new argument is to arm all teachers with guns.

A cowardly dotard in chief claiming they would rush in like some fictional superhero, even unarmed, to save children being shot up despite their choice decades ago to dodge the draft 5 times and instead pursue STDs which he later would call his own personal vietnam.
  
Last year it was teachers having bake sales to pay for school supplies, while ending their tax breaks for expenses. Now the NRA, president and GOP are opening claiming all teachers should carry weapons in their classrooms. Who pays for that? The county taxes for the already overtaxed residents of these counties? The states themselves?

What happened to the good guys with guns? Now the GOP and dotard shits all over police. Police who in reality failed in their jobs when they had the opportunity to actually kill someone versus the innocent lives they kill on a routine basis with applause from the authoritarian dotards in the US.

At what point will parents and teachers and American citizens say no. More guns and more militarization of our schools and educational establishments will never be the answer.

And what about convenience stores and movie theaters and malls? Militarization and rampant authoritarianism is the answer to the gun problem America is refusing to admit is killing its children?

Why not place armed active duty military at all schools? Just like at airports. Will that be enough to ensure authoritarian fear is maintained? Will that be enough for the dotard to declare that now, we are safe?
