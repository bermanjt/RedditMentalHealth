4,"Before I start, I should say that this may be a dense story, and also, one with an awkward writing (English is not my first language).

So, recently I've been facing some weird problems involving my family.
But before I start, I better give some context.

I'm currently 17 years old, and 12 years ago, my parents got divorced. I'm already used to the ""weekend with dad, weekdays with mom"" style, after all, my parents treat me very well, and I can't really complain about not having something I want. But this is now. Back when they divorced, things were way different. A 25-year-old version of my mother was emotionally unstable with the divorce, with nowhere to go (my parents lived with my dad's mom. I'm calling her Elza just for the sake of differentiating the grandmas), and me, a 5-year-old, that couldn't understand what was happening.
Anyways, my mother eventually moved back to my grandparent's house (Olaf and Mercedes, again, for the sake of clarity).
They received us very warmly, and things were going decently for the majority of the time.
Dad got me at the weekends, and mom got me at the weekdays. Nothing too scary. The only real problem was that my Dad enjoyed his friends too much, and ended up drinking with them the whole weekend. And my mom, which was at the end of her ""youth"", was trying to get over my dad, so she would just keep working, studying or going out with her friends. 
TL;DR: I barely got any attention from them. 
But that was fine. Grandma Elza (my grandpa, her husband, died before I was born), Grandma Mercedes and Grandpa Olaf were all I could ask. I just can't express how much I'm grateful for all the good moments I had with them.
Anyways, as I said, things were going really smoothly, with my parents giving me more and more attention every day. Both of them met their partner, and everything was starting to get to its place.
Then, grandpa Olaf had an incredibly violent stroke. In just one day, he lost all his leg movement and the ability to talk, and I lost my hero. He wasn't anymore the strong, ever-present symbol that everyone from our family treated him as. He couldn't be. This affected everyone. Including grandma Mercedes. But this didn't stop us. My mom, which was finally out of the party world, worked extra hard for the house, while my stepdad did his best to help us, too. So things carried on like this for some years, and the love for my family, especially for my grandparents never diminished. I still love them. Like, a lot.
Moving on, my mom finally got married to my stepdad, and they moved together to their apartment. Finally, they were independent. They took me, of course. But this meant that my grandma had to take care of my debilitated grandpa all by herself, and let me tell you, it was rough. The process itself was already rough, but the relationship between them started to decay REALLY quickly. Soon, they didn't love each other anymore, and both of them got more bitter with each passing day. Every time we would visit, my grandma and my mom fought for stupid reasons, and sometimes, they got physical. This occurred many times, even before we moved out. They didn't get along very well. On the other hand, Mercedes and I got along very well. It was an opposite relationship, and I always wished it could stay that way. Me and my grandma, always in terms with each other.
Some years later, 'pa Olaf had two more strokes, and eventually died from necrosis on his back (grandma wasn't really caring much for him after all those years). We all were waiting for it, yet, it was the saddest moment in my life (and probably in my mother's too). But grandma Mercedes was the one that didn't take this very well.
On the surface, she showed no affection towards him, yet, when he passed away, she started developing mental issues. She was all alone now. She gated taking care of my grandpa, but at the same time, she liked it. She liked the company. Now, she had only solitude. And it affected her really well. She was paranoid, and she could swear everyone was against her. She said my mother put cameras to watch her, but when asked, she couldn't say where the camera was. She just knew.
After seeing a psychiatrist, she got into some pills and started to go out more. She finally met John, an old guy (yet 10 years or so younger than her) that ""loved"" her. 
They got along really well, so we didn't try to stop it, after all, she needed some company.
It helped, and she finally got better. Finally, everything was okay again.
Until we discovered that John was abusing her financially. She would actually not pay her bills, just to give him money. It was unhealthy. The guy was a complete asshole. He would say shit about my grandpa, tell blatant lies, make personas toward different people, etc...
My uncle threatened him a lot, and after some weeks, he was gone. My uncle was very violent about it, so it kinda worked for a while.
I decided to take action and move in with her. For my whole life, I had to have ""two homes"". Another one wouldn't kill. So I did it. I was finally living with her again. After 7 years, I was back. But I was also different from before. This lead to one of my biggest fears: suddenly, we didn't get along very well. I moved on at the start of this year. But the story does not end here. I, despite all the fights, still loved her. And I still do. So I just overlooked all the times she accused me of "" following her in the city"", or ""taping everything she did and sent to my mom"" (yeah, she still saw my mom as a monster, and now I was working with mom, too). I can't say she was bitter all the time. She was just... ""Bipolar"". She was sweet as always, but suddenly, she would just look after things so she could yell at me. But I endured it. She needed my presence. She always said I was the favorite. So I stayed.
In the middle of the year, I discovered, on a day that I decided not to go to school, that John was back. He was talking with her through our gate (it may be kinda hard to picture, but we use a gate system in my country). He was, again, telling lies, tanking shit about Olaf, and this time, saying to her that he would take her to see the world. She was falling for it. So I called my violent uncle, and let's just say that it didn't end up too good for him. Uncle had scared him for good now - or so we thought -, and Mercedes realized he was an asshole. So, months passed, and this weekend, the guy came back. He dared, after all the threats, to come back for us. This time, he faked a kidnap. I was with mom at the time, so Mercedes was all alone. He started to call her at 2 a.m., in both her phones, so she couldn't call anybody else, and let three out of his "" goons""(I lack a better wording here) to put some fear on her. Two of them would just don't stop calling, threatening and demanding money. The other one (a woman), was mimicking my mom's voice. Grandma was desperate, and they demanded seven grand for her life. So she decided to do it. The thing is, she tried to get the money from an atm, so the thing didn't spit a single bill. She got more and more desperate until someone finally called mom. She got there and said everything was ok. My grandma's first reaction was to blame me. After all that time of enduring, trying to be as calm as possible (after the second incident with John, we didn't fight anymore), after all that time of me helping her with everything I could, after all the time I had to spend away from my mom, she just said that it was my fault. I was the one, with my friends, that called her. I wasn't there for her, I was there for her money. I didn't love her. I had to hear all of this, and it was heartbreaking. All of this happened on Saturday. I had an important and tiring exam on Sunday. Today, I finally decided to put an end to all of this. I'm tired of having to hear her blaming me for everything. Blaming my mother. Blaming my whole family. It was hard, but I endured it. However, this was the breaking point. I got home from school, packed everything I could take, called an Uber, and said farewell.

I love her, I love her so much... But I just can't live with her.  I had to experience her crying like a baby, while I walked through the door and the gate. I had to hear her crying again when I called her, a few minutes ago. I'm not proud of this. She needs me, but I can't live there anymore. Not with her. I was miserable there. So I decided to change. Yet, I feel like I just left her behind, like an ill animal, just to die.

It's hard to define it, really.

Just another of my many good days.
I went to work and time flew by,
I love my job; I’m respected and trusted.
I drive my great car home, which is full of trophies of my accomplishments, all testifying to the splendor of my life. 
The pictures on my walls all have people I still see regularly,
No one important to me has ever died.
And yet today, there was not one moment I didn’t feel deeply depressed. 

And to think, one or two generations ago, they just called this “the blues”. 

What a hardy group of people.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now 22 years old and facing something of an existential crisis. Here's I guess what you'd call my story:

&amp;#x200B;

I went to a pretty good university to major in Audio Engineering for two semesters right out of HS but didn't like the school and moved back to my home state to continue studying the same field at Community College and live with a couple friends. I'm currently working towards an Associates Degree in audio technology, but the progress has been painful and slow. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was pretty lazy at university and failed a couple courses my second semester, and after that just got worse. One semester earned all F's and D's, and have pretty much earned at least one D/F per semester since then, which has resulted in a ton of backtracking, a hideous college record and a 2.22 GPA at community college.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking back, this whole time I've just been a huge mess with a slew of little personal problems which I've been slowly reversing in attempt to move forward. These problems caused me to lose my only friends, and other serious repercussions. I'm working to slowly turn my habits and life around and have come a long way, but still struggle with apathy and laziness.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm almost through the program and considering pursuing a bachelor's degree in another but relevant field after this because I'm not confident the silly degree I'm studying will allow me a decent job since the music industry is dying fast and there is so much competition as an engineer. I just don't know if it's right for me to attend university, or even possible, given my history.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has a similar story that ended in success and wants to share that would be awesome. Or if anyone has any advice or encouragement regarding my education or life path I could probably use some. I get quite overwhelmed and scared for my future when I start taking stock of my life thus far. I need proof that this isn't the end of the world because my future looks grim from here and I'm feeling really lost. 

&amp;#x200B;

Either way I'm working to move forward and know things will probably fall into place if I continue to grow and make good choices every day, and work hard, I just want to know what you all think. I don't ever get to have discussions with anyone about stuff like this (or anything for that matter) so I'm turning to you guys.

13,"
I'm really frustrated with myself for how I'm thinking about other people at the moment. I was with a really close friend at dinner and accidentally called them someone else's name. We both laughed and shrugged it off, but when my friend told the person that I used their name by mistake they didn't take it well apparently. I don't understand why but now they've stopped acknowledging me, I thought they would take it as a compliment that I thought of them while with my really good friend. Trying to do everything I can for people close to me but then a lot of the time they seem to either take it the wrong way or not think anything of it. The whole situation makes me want to give up and stop being a friend to people that one word used on accident can adversely ruin what could have been a somewhat good friendship. It makes me think 'are they trying to use me by forcing me to work to get them back on my side', having had that happen to me in the past. They might have good intentions or something else is happening in their life, but it doesn't make sense. Should I try talking to them or just leave it? I don't enjoy having people mad at me for the most basic reasons.  

Either way, don't call people by the wrong name. Rip

[After hearing Jenny and Jimmy's story](https://flytofi.com/how-financial-independence-can-benefit-your-relationship-jenny-from-living-life-loving-us/) about how their pursuit of financial independence was actually strengthening their relationship, I knew that they had something special. This power couple figured out how to align their financial goals and ultimately create an even stronger bond through their personal finances.

Here are some of the key takeaways from the article:

* **Communicate openly and frequently** \- Don't hide anything from your significant other and be straightforward about your financial goals.
* **Cut expenses to increase your savings rate -** This allows you more time flexibility and the ability to pursue things you enjoy.
* **Focus on your values** \- Write down the things that truly bring you happiness with your partner. Often times, you'll find that these things don't cost money (e.g. enjoying each other's company, going on a walk, etc.)

My views-

Society wants to undue millions of years of male evolution and honestly I think it’s bullshit.

The people who shame older men for dating younger (legal) women are no different than those who slut shame women for having multiple sex partners. You’re shaming someone for legally acting on their natural instinct.

I have a older male coworker who’s 55. We’re going to call him Dave. Dave is engaged to a smoking hot 26 year old woman. We’re going to call her Sarah. Dave and Sarah have been dating on and off since Sarah was 19. Dave and Sarah also has 3 beautiful kids.

The women around the office (young and old) seem to have a problem with Dave’s life choices. They’re extremely judgmental and often refer to Dave as sleazy, and creepy, More often than not I find myself explaining to them that it is actually more normal for Dave to seek out a younger healthier partner of child bearing age, than it is for him to seek out a partner who is past her prime and can no longer produce children. But they don’t want to hear it. They are so bought into societal norms that they’ve completely abandoned the idea that human beings are the product of evolution and we are bound to our most primitive instincts.

Reproducing is one of man’s most primitive instincts. Eating, drinking, sleeping, and seeking shelter are the others. It is a our nature to seek out healthy women to reproduce with. It is not our nature to seek out women past their prime. If given a choice between a young 26 year old fit healthy looking child bearing woman, and a 56 year old less healthy looking woman past child bearing stage, 99.9% of men will pick the younger healthier woman. Not because we’re creepy but because it’s our natural instinct. Early man would have to breed with multiple younger partners just to produce a one or two healthy offspring because In that time most Offspring didn’t survive infancy. So shaming Dave because he’s dating some 26 and not 56 is quite ignorant and hypocritical.

Why should a man suppress his nature to conform to societal norms when women are literally starting movements to get away from societal norms? Why is it ok for women to be 100% in control of their own sexually, but men still have to seek social approval to date someone he’s legally allowed to date?

The real issue is that women enjoy a monopoly over human sexuality. It’s much easier for women to find sexual partners than men. By Dave dating someone much younger and hotter than himself, it undermines other women’s sexual authority and that’s their real issue with Dave. ",13Nov2018,1
27,"for the past year i’ve been really confused because i have no idea who i am at all. i used to think i knew, but a lot of the time i forget i exist or that i’m even a human being. to try and describe it, i feel like an abstract blob of consciousness just floating in all this space, but the blob doesn’t really have any personality traits because i have too many versions of myself that i don’t know which one is the “real” one compared to the others.

my friends and ex boyfriends have all told me i’m so bubbly, energetic, smiley. and maybe that’s how i am in a social setting when my social anxiety isn’t blowing through the roof. but i’m alone most of the time and i can only describe myself as nothingness. maybe the only adjective i could use to describe myself is ‘depressed’.

i forget a lot about my childhood. i forget so much and it feels like i was never even a child (i’m only 18) because i’m not a person. i forget what i did last month or last week even, for a while like the first 3 weeks that my boyfriend and i were dating, i couldn’t remember the sound of his voice or his face no matter how hard i tried, although i saw him every 2-3 days. is this a normal symptom of depression? 

sometimes it feels like i’m not even in my body, the times that i remember i have a body. it feels like i’m floating sometimes when i walk and i don’t even realize i’m walking. when i smoke marijuana i can remember things about my childhood, small minute details. it’s incredible. but when i’m high it’s like my thoughts/stream of consciousness are running because they come at me so fast. 

i don’t know. living is so strange. i forget that it’s happening. does anyone else feel this way ",13Nov2018,1

Bob and I found dozens of possible apartments and a realtor reached out to me and scheduled a prompt viewing of a couple places. 


Bob and I could make it to the viewing, but our third roomie.. Ed had a late class. He was cool with missing the viewing, we took pictures, sent him listing online and the address. Things move quickly after that, we all love the third place, immediately split the deposit and pay it. Then we all sign the lease, pay first and last months rent. All 3 of us pay everything without issue, this was wrapped up by Nov. 8th. 

Then on Nov. 10th, Ed texts me. asking ""the apartments in [suburb 45min outside the city], right?""


I honestly took it as a joke, a humorous way to ask for the address. I re-sent the full street address and said, ""uh? no. we're two blocks from campus. The leasing office is in that town tho.

Then today, he texted to ask for the realtor's number, and told us it was because he honestly thought we picked a place in this far away town. His dad was told this, and the plan was for us to take the train to school.

...All of our parents live only an hour from the city anyway. Why would we each pay hundreds of dollars a month to commute from nearly as far? This town doesn't even have a train station remotely near it. We all don't have cars with us, we've been exclusively around campus for the past 3 years. 

So Ed and his dad only found the place 2 days after he signed the lease. Now he's demanding out. It's too dangerous, but it's a block and a half from the art school. The entire block is student housing. There's blue lights and bike cops.

So I started senior year in my second year of English AP, and I’m still having fun.  I just love writing and the conversation, so it’s where I thrive the most.  So I met my new teacher who I’m not going to name (obviously) and she’s really cool and laid back, she genuinely seems like a cool person but she also has a solid way of explaining material.  That aside, my teacher introduced to us her student teacher who she was mentoring as part of a college program.  

God dammit, the things we want are always the things we just can’t fucking have.

This woman is first off only a couple years older than the rest of our class, and I’m 18 to put that into perspective.  She’s cute, geeky, has the same interest career-wise as me; and has a wonderful smile.  The way she dresses is fashionable but she has respect for herself— something which I admire immensely in women, especially considering how high school has not been that way when looking at the majority of “fish in the sea” pursuing the party life.  I mean it makes perfect sense for our ages, live it up while you can, it’s just not my cup of tea when it comes to relationships I guess.  

I find it hard and easy at the same time to talk to her because she makes the guy inside me lovestruck like Cupid stabbing my back Caesar-style, while the person inside me finds that respect for her pursuits so admirable that I just want to do MY best.

Maybe I’m hoping to get noticed later out of school by some stroke of luck, maybe I just want other people to hear my cry for attention, or maybe I just want responses from people that aren’t in my immediate friend circle— but it’s odd that I find more comfort in the Reddit’s anonymity then among those trusted. But maybe that’s just the inability all of you have to punish my thoughts.

Please respond with what your thoughts are, whether or not it’s what I should do or your opinion, even an anecdote you think applies, lemme know.",13Nov2018,1
35,"So tonight, my (21/m) fiance (21/f) and I were skyping since we are currently a few hundred miles apart. When I went to say goodnight, we got to that point where usually one of us says ""I love you"" without hesitation. We both seemed as if we were waiting for the other to say it. We don't put a lot of pressure on it but I will admit that I have grown up in a family that is very vocal about how they feel and that has influenced how much we say it. It's not like it's excessive and we don't really need to hear it know that we love each other--it's just nice to hear. 

Tonight, no one jumped to say it and we ended up having this long, awkward pause as if the other was supposed to say it. We discussed it and then hung up. After 30 seconds of being silent and looking at the other, I finally said it and we hung up. I got back on the phone and questioned why she didn't say it right away and she said it was because she thought I was going to say it. We then discussed how we are stubborn at times with simple stuff like this. We said we love each other and then went to bed. 

I've been up for a while thinking about this interaction nonstop. Is something like this normal? This definitely has happened to other couples before and is just normal, right?

Our relationship has been absolutely incredible and I'm beyond grateful for her. I am marrying this woman and I can't wait. I shouldn't be overthinking this as much as I am right? Right??",13Nov2018,1
36,"For the past three or so years or so, I’ve started to notice a pattern of what happens to me and the friendships I develop and I don’t know exactly why it happens. What happens is whenever I make a new friend, it starts off really good, and as I get to know people better the better we start to bond. For a while things are good and I get a new friend. But then something weird happens, it’s like all of a sudden the other person just gets more distant from me, like I hit a peak and then the friendship starts to go downhill. This seems to happen nearly every time I make a friend. some do it at a faster or slower rate, but the average is 2.5 to 3 months before it happens. 


This is something I really watched closely. at the beginning of the semester, I grew closer to this guy I’m in drum line with. As time went on I carefully watched what I did and said, but mostly acting like myself. I say we probably got close enough to the point where I would call us best friends, but out of nowhere about early October, he just became more distant.


Honestly I’m at a loss. I have no idea what causes it and I don’t have any ideas on how to fix it. But every day I just go along and try my best. That’s all I know to do at this point but I’m starting to accept it easier than I used to, but it’s still hard.",13Nov2018,1

I was thrilled and reflected that I was now seeing the scene that I missed at the harbor. As I walked past them Hsi Hsia [one of his ministers] pointed out a line of dragon flags between the Japanese ones and said that the men holding them were all Manchu ""bannermen"" who had been waiting for me to come for twenty years.

40,"High school is probably gonna be the best memories of my life. Because of the marching band. Not some average, halftime show marching band that doesn’t give a shit about anything. A big competitive band that was like a family. I met my best friends in that band that I still love today, and I’m never gonna have experiences like those again. Going to Disney with 150 of your other best friends. Winning a bands of America regional, which is like the marching band equivalent of winning the World Series, performing in the Macy’s parade, and most importantly, spending almost every day with my best friends having a great time in the band room. The old band room was like another dimension in my school. We could go there during lunch or study hall and do whatever we wanted to do. We watched movies, played baseball with a broken soprano sax, played cards, video games, and a ton of other memories I’ll carry through life. We didn’t know it back then that this would all be held so fondly. We just went there for an escape during the school day. 

Our old band director changed our whole lives. If it wasn’t for him, we would be music majors. I don’t know what I’d do without him. 

But now my friend and I are very sad to be gone from our old band room which we saw as a second home. There’s nothing like that in college. No escape where we could do whatever we wanted in a place like that. No more band director to talk to about life and advice for hours on end. No more stories from him. No more games. And most importantly, no more friends like in our old band. The people there were irreplaceable. No one shares the same bonds here because no one is around each other 40+ hours a week together. People have classes. Work. And other things now. 

My friend and I miss everything greatly. We are never gonna have those experiences again for our whole life. Even if we do become band directors one day. We can never experience it the same way again. We will be in charge. We will have to be the ones to clean up the mess of students. We won’t have a band director to look up to for wisdom and stories. It all went by so fast. We miss our old family. ",13Nov2018,1
41,"I   really don't have a prompt with this but I'm trying to create  something  that i can put down on paper (or e-paper) that marks what  happened in  my relationship with my Ex. This post may become convoluted  drivel so  I'm going to segment it into paragraphs so everyone can read  it better.

Who she is:

My  ex is the most beautiful person in my eyes to ever grace the universe.  I  know most guys say that but I just keep seeing it. She's a person  who  just wants to make the world a better place and is a romanticist,  the  kind that just wants to make everyone happy at the cost of herself

Why we broke up:

We  have been having mini fights for a long time and we both decided to   kind of give up at the same time. We had fights where I wasn't  compassionate enough to other things and people when I thought I was (I   wasn't ). She also wanted someone to enjoy more things with such as  plays or musicals (which I've come to the stunning realization I love   watching them too and would kill to watch many of them) That's a few   reasons and there's many more. And I do accept them all. 

Why I came to write all this down to get out of my head:

Ever   since I broke up with her my head has been swimming with things that I   wish I said or done before we broke up. I even started hating myself   because I didn't ask her to come back fast enough. Though again I think   it was for the best. After the breakup, my emotional shell finally,   finally broke and I was in extreme sadness and other emotions that I   haven't since felt since my first ex which wound up putting a shell on me to block most of the emotions. And which I have my ex to thank for breaking me out.

But  the reason why I  wanted to post this was that I am afraid for the  future. Every time I  wake up I fall more in love with my ex for the things that she did and the kind of person that she is and I'm now  trying to become. But I fall  more in love because of it and I think she  doesn't know the kind of  changes that are happening and it scares me to  the supreme. So I wanted  to post this so maybe she could find it and  see. because we're still  on talking terms but things are hard and yeah. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Hope for the Future:

The   reasoning I want her to see this is because I came to the realization  that she is my soulmate, my galaxy. I think breaking up is the best  thing now cause I know I could not have found these problems myself at   the time and I think we both needed to find each other. But I hope in   the future that we can talk again and start a relationship again and she   can learn how compassionate I can be. How much I know I do want to  cuddle nonstop and talk to her instead of video games, how I want to  live with her now and share a space. I don't even want to travel to japan anymore, not really. I want to leave and then come back and start a life.

I   don't know what the future could actually hold. We could move on stay  friends or any other number of scenarios. I just want her to know the   way I'm feeling and hopefully, she feels the same. This is not about us  getting back together this is more like a proclamation so you can see and read it. 

This is about moving on and most important, about me growing as a person.

And most importantly I appreciate our relationship and all you did for me  and I hope in the future that I can do that back to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Advice:

If   anyone has a compassionate girlfriend. Show that back to her. open  your  heart and let it flow let her take off the shell that someone else  put  on you or yourself put on.

Thank you, for everyone Reading this

To, F

TL;DR

Be good to your GF and treat everyone with compassion.

And  if anyone wants to give it. Advice to go past this is helpful. Putting  it down on paper is great sense I have somewhere. But I keep building  up. But most of the build up was the inability to say something about  the above materiel.

42,"I'm not sure if this is really a rant or what. I'm mostly just disappointed. 

My sister has never been very easy to get along with. She's oversensitive to any criticism or advice. Always looking to be validated on social media. She has never been without a boyfriend since she started dating at 13/14; she's in her 20s now. 

She was in an abusive relationship a few years ago. He was emotionally abusive, always finding some way to put her down or give backhand 'compliments'. I assume he was physically abusive at some points, though she never (and would never) outright said so.

Things eventually came to a head and she left him. Though he never left her alone, always trying to contact her in various ways, with various phone numbers, you name it. My whole family was relieved that he seemed to be in the past. She was never happy during her time with him and more depressed than usual. Soon after, she started seeing another guy. He was more stable, had a steady job, my family liked him, and she was happier. 

Now it seems their relationship may have run its course for any number of reasons. And because she can't be alone or maybe doesn't know how to be alone, she's allowed this douche canoe back into her life. He's a master manipulator, so he's already got her running his errands and doing whatever else. 

I wish I could help her see how unhealthy this is. Or maybe she does and just doesn't care? I don't know. And despite never having a great relationship with her, she's still my sister and I want the best for her. 

I left out lots of detail for anonymity sake, so I hope she doesn't recognize this. But if you're reading this and relate to it at all, please know there is a better life for you. Please don't be afraid to ask for help. If you don't have someone in your life you feel comfortable speaking to, a counselor or therapist will be able to give you an honest, unbiased opinion and will be able to offer you assistance or give you access to resources that can help. 
While I've never been in this situation personally, I can still see how difficult it can be to leave an abuser. Don't give up hope. You're worth more than your abuser would have you believe. ",13Nov2018,1

45,"Hello, I'm posting this the day before my 24th birthday, and I don't feel happy about it. I can't admit I don't feel happy about it because I don't want to be put on mind numbing medication that's going to thesably change how I think and who I am as an person. I'm not in the best shape, and I accept that don't get me wrong, but things just seem to not be falling into place.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have something called NLD(Non-Verbal Learning Disorder) and was one of the first cases in my school district of it. I was diagnosed super young as well luckily. Most of my non social deficits are gone now, but I'm barely able to write,use chopsticks or tie my shoes due to my motor skill issues. I also have balance issues, I've been unable to ride a bike since I first tried trying. I have major social anxiety either as a part of this or on top of this. I don't like going out, my legs hurt after a while and I can't talk to people my age. I have however lost my virginity...by sheer luck.  


I work at a job that only hires autistic folks like me as a software tester. I can't get into what I test as that's under a non-disclosure. But I'm clearly not enjoying myself. I don't see myself as fit to hold any job because it either scares me or I'm too freaked out that no one gives a shit about who I am and my ideals.  


I still live at home, and I worry I won't escape this place until I'm dead. I don't like it here, too many bad memories of being bullied for who I am and how different I am. I fell in love with some chick in middle school and the fact that she ended up using my interest in her against me and stabbed me in the back fucked me up hard. I still feel her ghost almost 10 years later. My parents also divorced the same year and my stepmom, who I had issues with when I was younger, blatantly wants nothing to do with me because as much as I've told my dad I want to apologize and supposedly she feels ""horrible"" over the situation, she has never reached out. I never see my dad anymore either. Just either like once or twice a month with a call every week because he's devoted to his job and uses work(just like his dad) to cover up his insecurities   


I don't want to go back to therapy, I've been in and out for years because of my issues and I feel like I've become numb to  all the advice. About half a year ago, I was considering taking my own life...I'd never do it mind you, I'm too much of an anxious wreck as you can tell to try to even go for it. But still, those thoughts entered my head. They are gone now though.

&amp;#x200B;

All my IRL friends have left me behind, or I left them behind, to pursue their dreams while I dropped out of college because what I was pursuing there wasn't fitting my needs. I only have online friends now, girls who claim to be interested in me and yet I don't get contacted. I mean, I've been told I've saved people from their insecurities, and that makes me feel good. But sometimes I feel like that's all I'm good for. I don't want to be everyone's therapist. I feel trapped, I keep wanting to date women who have issues as well because I don't feel like I deserve better than what I have. I just want to feel alive again. I feel lost, scared and alone and I have no one to tell this to.  


That's all I want to say though. I may just be looking for someone to sympathize. I may just of wanted to blab and rant about  things that are out of my control. It's just all crashing down on me and I don't have anyone to turn to. My mom wants to medicate my problems, my dad wants to find solutions. I'm honestly just scared about my future.",13Nov2018,1

48,"As the title suggests, I'm not very thrilled about the holiday season. It's a time of year where my narcissistic family reminds me of how few shits they give about me. When my psycho alt-right older brother plays his A-game of redpill emotional manipulation. When I may or may not be getting along with my bipolar sister, depending on her mood. And when my drunk sister-in-law is feeling happy drunk, or asshole drunk, depending on what time of the evening it is.

&amp;nbsp;

The holidays are also when I have to negotiate with my partner about whether I want to spend Christmas, or New Year's with him, because whichever one I pick, means he goes out of town to visit his family for the other. And they're unaware that their son is gay. I've accepted ten years ago, when I got with him, that he doesn't want them to know; it's his right, and his life and his business. But it means a part of my holiday is always spent alone, and I end up spending time with aforementioned family and feeling miserable.

Not sure what I'm aiming for here, but it felt good to type all of that out. This time of year already sucks ass, I see less and less daylight and everything becomes gloomy. So I'm already prone to SAD. The family situation used to be better, when we all lived further apart and appreciated time spent together.

51,"When I got out of high school my life was honestly at an all time high, and then I got to college and I learned the fun had just begun.  However, I’m a sophomore right now nearing the ends of the first semester. I joined a fraternity and I have experienced more fun with my friends than I ever have and I have done some in-house positions.  Yet since I started college I really let myself go in many ways. I’ve become a borderline alcoholic, binge drinking and smoking probably 5 days a week, not working out anymore, becoming rather complacent in terms of not doing anything and becoming messy. I stopped talking to my family and started only partying. I started skipping classes and went from having above a 4.0 at an above average high school in my state to dropping down to a 2.5 in college.  About 2 weeks ago I realized how much I let go of things I really needed to focus on, and I’ve started maintaining a cleaner lifestyle, I’ve started waking up earlier and going to bed sooner instead of binging stimulants drugs and alcohol and sleeping from 8 am til 6 pm.  Ive been going to class, but I’m worried that my grades in college might be hard to bring up.  I used to love music and finding new artists and I let that go but I’ve started to get back into it finding many artists I really enjoy. I’ve been talking to girls more and trying to start a relationship with my crush. I’m proud that I’ve started but I have a long way to go. In high school I went from 250 to 180 and since college I’ve probably let myself go back to about 230.  I want to continue building on what I’ve been doing but the one thing I need to do most is start working on exercising again and get back in shape.

52," Some  claim that the Cheka, the commission of the Bolshevik revolution  established to suppress counter-revolutionary activity, and which  counted among its members not only Bolsheviks but all supporters of the  revolution, supported torture, or had no qualm with cruel treatment. The  truth is that it did not. This does not mean that local units did not  sometimes engage in it -- inevitable given the instability of the  situation, prevalent confusion and hatred, de-sensitization to violence  due to the war, great extent of the country and necessity of the  Bolsheviks to rely on even unreliable supporters, poor communication  between areas and the Bolsheviks' lack of strong centralized control of  even friendly areas, despite their will to establish it --, but it did  not, in its principles, in its top political leadership, tolerate it. It  explicitly opposed it, and *aimed* to never let it occur.

When  it comes to suppressing counter-revolutionary activity, the Bolsheviks  made use of shooting, but opposed any sort of cruel treatment. This was  held to be an intolerable violation of human dignity which could not be  squared with the most basic communist principles.

British  agents were planning counter-revolutionary sabotage which put innocent  lives at risk. The Cheka caught the perpetrators, but let them return  freely to Britain. In the summer of 1918, a small local Moscow newspaper  of some Cheka supporters published an article, ""Why the kid gloves?"".  The article claimed that the Cheka should have used torture to extract  more information from the agents, instead of letting them go free,  arguing that torture was necessary to prevent future sabotage and thus  save innocent lives.

Local  people sent the newspapers letters of protest that such a thing was  being suggested. The Bolshevik party members were, in general, outraged.  Sverdlov, of the top Bolshevik leadership, read the article. He  instantly burned with rage at the idea that someone would even suggest  torture as tolerable.

The  matter was brought up to the All-Russian Central Executive Committee --  the most powerful political organ in the country --, which adopted the  resolution that brutal treatment of people, such as torture, which  disregarded human dignity, was directly opposed to communist principle  and can never be tolerated for any reason whatsoever, despite the fact  that there was a violent struggle for power going on.

&gt;The  Presidium of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, having  discussed the article ""Why the Kid Gloves?"" which appeared in the third  issue of the Cheka Weekly, has taken note that the thoughts expressed in  it on the struggle with the counterrevolution are in gross  contradiction with the policy and the tasks of the Soviet regime.  Although the Soviet regime resorts of necessity to the most drastic  measures of conflict with the counterrevolutionary movement, and  remembers that the conflict with the counterrevolution has taken the  form of open armed conflict, in which the proletariat and poor peasants  cannot renounce the use of terror, the Soviet regime fundamentally  rejects the measures advocated in the indicated article, as despicable,  dangerous and contrary to the interests of the struggle for Communism.  The Presidium of the Central Executive Committee most severely censures  both the authors of the article and the editors of the Cheka Weekly who  printed the article and provided it with commentary.

The  newspaper which printed the article was closed down, and the authors  were dismissed, and forbidden from holding any office in the Soviet  government.

53,"It appears I am in the middle of a great musical depression. What a shame. What pity. What sadness, anger, exasperation. Energy depletion. 

As I type these words, I sit in a practice room on the 3rd floor of the music building. An old out-of-tune piano sits in front of me, a saxophone to my left. 

I had 3 objectives in mind here. The first was to just come in and play. Improvise on the piano, which I’ve been doing almost every day for the past 2 years or so. I just play what I feel for 15 or so minutes, although sometimes it can go on for an hour. The thing is, I have minimal piano training. I can play basic jazz chords and such but I always end up at the same keys, I always play the same phrases, and when I try to experiment, I get dissonance more often than not. Sometimes I hit a gold mine, like yesterday, when I played this exciting riff and smiled and laughed and found happiness. A few days ago I discovered the practical use of the tritone in major keys, say putting a B on top of an F major 7 chord, and it sounds incredible. But today, I played and I just felt…. 

Novice. Like a fake. 

Afterwards I tried to arrange. I re-hashed this old piece from earlier this year that I used for some classes. It sounds incredible, and I know it would sound better in a live, organic sound setting, like a jazz band. But fuck dude, Sibelius has been murdering me. There’s nothing I find more difficult than Sibelius. It exhausts me to use it sometimes. It frustrates me to the point where I just give up for that session. Even if I do finish in the long run, the piece will look so cheap and novice and horrible. I can’t get this music to look good. I can’t get it to come out from my head and onto conventional sheet music. 

I moved on to practicing saxophone. I am a cheap improviser. I just fake solos over changes. I know just a baseline understanding of theory, I don’t have licks memorized or know about specific changes or harmonic relationships. I just play what I want, how I feel. It’s fake. It doesn’t fit. It doesn’t sound good. I have a great tone, I sound very good, I can play any piece you put in front of me, but I cannot improvise for the fucking life of me. 

I just want to give up. Scream sometimes. It sounds conceited I know, but theres so much beauty I hear in my head, so much incredible melodies and harmonies and ideas that are just bouncing around waiting to burst out into the real world. But I can’t find the means to let them go. Whether it be through the fingers hitting the keys of my saxophone, the keys of my laptop, the keys of a piano. It just doesn’t come out and it makes me frustrated and hopeless and depressed. 

I want to just do handwritten stuff. Handwrite this entire piece. But that’ll be a hassle. It’ll take time. And I’m willing to bet I’ll just find another roadblock that’ll make me depressed again. It’s a big cycle and I don’t know how to get out. I want to scream. Both in anger, and in art. I want to just let everything go and put everything on the plate that I can offer artistically. I want FREEDOM. COMPLETE FREEDOM. I WANT TO SING.",13Nov2018,1
54,"Victoria’s Secret sucks.

As someone who has spent over half her life fighting anorexia, I know how damaging the media and its messages can be. Women are constantly told by the world that looking, appearing, even *being* a certain way will make them happy, accepted, and worthwhile. It’s often hard to grasp just how toxic this is - our culture is so permeated by these messages, we often just accept them as fact. How many times have you heard or thought, “I’ll feel better about myself once I lose ten pounds,” or, “I’m unhappy because I don’t look good?” Society is constantly hammering girls with this idea that our worth is determined by our looks, and unless you look the way you’re “supposed to,” you’re worthless.

That’s my beef with Victoria’s Secret. As an iconic lingerie brand, many women look to them (consciously or subconsciously) to define what is attractive and sexy. And Victoria’s Secret thinks they’ve got that down pat. Tall, skinny girls strut down the runway of the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show with their hair done in beachy waves and their ribs jutting out. The exact same body adorns every single VS advertisement, complete with a thigh gap and perky double D’s. How are we supposed to feel about our own bodies when this impossible standard of “attractive” is constantly being shoved in our faces?

You might say that I’m projecting, that that’s not what the advertisers are trying to do. Maybe they’re just following suit with every other fashion brand, or maybe they think that having women with different body types would distract from the clothes themselves. 

That’s not the case.

The marketers at Victoria’s Secret know exactly what they are doing. When asked why the brand did not include plus-size models in its eponymous annual fashion show, their president of marketing defended their lack of body diversity by describing the show as a “fantasy.” A fantasy of what? How the world would be if only the people they deemed attractive existed? He went on to say, “We’re nobody’s third love. We’re their first love.” Great. Good to know that every single person’s first choice is that hot Victoria’s Secret model. The other 99% of us will be sitting here in the Ugly Dumpster, getting told to hate ourselves because we’re not pretty. 

Okay, so what? Maybe people do think Victoria’s Secret models are hot. If you really want to look hot, why don’t you just try to look like them?

*Because it’s terrible for your short and long term health*. 

Let’s talk diet first. VS model meal plans tend to average about 1000 to 1300 calories a day, and it’s common to cut out liquids, sugars, and carbohydrates leading up to a runway show. For reference, the average sedentary 20 year old woman needs about 2000 calories a day to *maintain* her weight. Undereating can cause fatigue, dizziness, and irritability. Undereating to the point that you’re underweight causes hair loss, weakens your bones, screws with your hormone levels, and weakens your vital organs. And rest assured, VS models are underweight, most with a BMI between 16 and 17 (while BMI can be useless when you’re a bodybuilder, medical consensus is that women need a BMI of around 19 to maintain healthy body functions). 

As far as exercise goes - VS models work out a normal amount, sure, if they were healthy people otherwise. A short toning routine every day seems fine to the majority of us, hell, it might even be a good idea if we started doing it ourselves. However, for these women, most doctors wouldn’t even sanction exercise in the first place, especially when their daily workouts burn around 25% of their already negligible caloric intake. Intense workouts place a lot of stress on your body, and when your heart is already struggling to function from its lack of nutrition, it’s like playing Russian roulette.

I know this stuff, because I’ve spent the past ten years having it harped at me by every doctor, dietician, therapist, and specialist I’ve ever interacted with. But most girls don’t. Most girls don’t know that looking - or even *trying* to look - like a Victoria’s Secret model isn’t healthy, especially when countless marketers, magazines, and blogs talk incessantly about how “fit” VS models are. You know who’s actually fit? Serena Williams. Simone Biles. Ronda Rousey. Women who are strong, powerful, and capable. Not women who spend the vast majority of their lives restricting food and obsessively exercising to maintain an “ideal” body. That ain’t fit, and it ain’t healthy either.

So. I am sick and tired of Victoria’s Secret telling women that their natural, healthy bodies are not attractive or sexy. I’m tired of society telling women that their worth as a person is based on their measurements or their BMI. I am livid that people continue to uphold unrealistic body standards as the epitome of what a woman should look like, and I am heartbroken that women feel pressured to change their body to fit other people’s standards, especially when those standards are warped and terribly unhealthy. 

Every body is beautiful, and what’s even more important than bodies are the brains that they carry around.

Disclaimers:

* I am also aware of the transphobic comments made by VS marketers recently and am just as pissed off about them. Your gender is your gender regardless of genitals and I would absolutely love to see more trans and gender nonconforming people in mainstream fashion.
* I am not “skinny-shaming.” I do understand that a very *very* small portion of the population is naturally “between 5’8 and 6’0, with 34”-24”-34” measurements, full lips, a small nose, high cheekbones and chiseled features,” but it’s ridiculous and damaging to suggest that this standard is healthily attainable for the vast majority of us.",13Nov2018,1

57,"Hello, I'd like to preface this with some information about myself. I'm a person who's likely been unknowingly living with autism my entire life. I had countless issues growing up and I've been misdiagnosed and left to float through life with no direction, no real diagnosis, and consequently no real aid. I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) when I was 21 years old, and for a long time I thought that was what was wrong with me because it's what a psychologist told me. Only, after numerous sessions with other psychologists, they've all said that I don't have borderline personality disorder. Even the psychiatrist that worked in tandem with the psychologist who diagnosed me with BPD said he wasn't certain of the diagnosis, and he prescribed me SSRIs to deal with my problems. I was on the SSRIs for a couple of years, but the side effects were too great, so I had to stop taking them. Uncontrollable emotions, akathisia, violent outbursts that haven't since been rivaled, etc. I've battled depression, anxiety, feelings of emptiness, sadness, rage, and general hopelessness for my entire life. Only recently have I considered that I am very likely autistic. I have an aptitude for practically anything, crippling social anxiety, and an extremely obsessive personality that makes me think about things way too fucking much. For example, -- I've spent night after night obsessing over whether I've done the perfect series of actions in a video game, only to come to the conclusion of what was perfect, yet still obsess over it. I recently had to quit that game because the obsession was just so exhausting because I couldn't stop thinking about it. I had to take up meditating in order to even make the decision to stop playing so that I could relax. 

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot hold a job for more than a few months at a time. I've tried job after job after job, and it always ends with an emotional exodus, often followed by extreme guilt, feelings of worthlessness, and self-loathing. This compounds my depression and makes my aversion behavior my only behavior. I will not go outside for months after this happens. So, as you can imagine, I am unemployed. I have no real life skills because I've never developed any of them. Anything I pick up, I'm objectively proficient at in a short period of time because of the obsessive approach to learning that I have. I haven't mentioned my ego yet. It's uncontrollably in the fucking way. I know that I don't know anything, but there's this ridiculous idea in my head that I must be the best at whatever I do, no matter what it is, or I should just quit. I am essentially a child. It makes me feel like a moron, and I see no path from here to what I perceive as a normal adult life. It feels like I'm being stretched from reality to perceived reality.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, at the age of 28, I've just had an argument with my mother. One that exists in a long line of past arguments and punched holes in walls, a behavior I learned from my father to cope with my aggression toward others. He destroyed a poster with Darth Maul's face on it when I was around 10 years old in front me while he was arguing on the phone with my divorced mother, and it seemed like a great way to get anger out without hurting anyone but myself. Since then, I've dealt with his death. A total of 17 holes were punched into the walls of this house dealing with his 3-month battle with pancreatic cancer. I spent all of the money that he left me on trying to buy happiness for myself and others to not feel so lonely and I tried to cure my depression with unhealthy food. That didn't fucking work out, but tell that to 24 year old me, stuffing my fat face with sandwich after sandwich, 32 oz cup after 32 oz cup of diet soda while choking back tears and having uncontrollable fits of laughter. That was 4 years ago. Today, I am completely dependent on my mother, and it disgusts me to be a person who cannot provide for himself because of a mental illness, or whatever the fuck this is that locks me into a perpetual state of limbo. I've considered suicide thousands upon thousands of times, and the answer is always no, so I still have my breath. After considering it so thoroughly, anyone concerned can rest assured that I am either too much of a coward to not do it, or not enough of a coward to do it. Either way, I'm going to be alive for the foreseeable future, and I have to deal with that.

&amp;#x200B;

The argument took place tonight because my mother had spent the entire day dealing with my autistic nephew at his monthly check up. He is basically just a mini version of me. She was tired, and I asked her an innocent question, and she snapped at me. She told me not to take it personally, but it was too late. I slammed the stairs with both of my fists as I walked up the stairs, abandoning my dinner to a now beeping microwave. I avoided putting a hole in the wall. She said, ""I TOLD YOU NOT TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY"", and flung some other hateful verbal shit at me, and i flung it right back, trying to cut as deep as I could. She tried to manipulate me into feeling bad about the situation by saying that she's having chest pains, and that she's going to have to go to the hospital if they don't stop. Well, it fucking worked. I feel like the worst person, and there's nothing I can do to not. You can probably imagine that I've apologized quite a bit in my life. Too much. I know that apologizing is just a way to make yourself feel better. It doesn't do anything to fix the situation, and it certainly doesn't make another person feel good. I know that we're both at fault here. It might be remedied with time, but in the case that it isn't, I need to have a path. She's said that on December 1st, her and the two children - my niece and nephew - are moving to another state. Why my niece and nephew are with my mother is another story. However, this leaves my half-brother and I without a home. He is able to work, but he's in a very similar spot to where I was when I was his age. He has depression and anxiety and he doesn't have a fucking clue about the world. It's likely that he will be exactly like me when he is my age.

&amp;#x200B;

So, with all of this information - what can I do to avoid being homeless? I have no money, and no means of making money currently. Going to live with family is not an option that I want on the table because I will just end up in the exact same spot in a short time. History has proven this. I don't want to be whatever the fuck I am that makes me this way, but I am, and I have to deal with it. I have accepted that I will probably never work a normal job again in my life, but that doesn't mean I need to give up on being able to provide for myself one way or another. I would appreciate any advice. My username was just something stupid I came up with to avoid being identified. I'm not sure if this is even the subreddit this post belongs in. If I need to post it somewhere else, please tell me. Anyways, thanks for reading.

I know that there are successful people who have dropped out, but I know those are exceptions to the rule rather than normal cases.

75,"So backstory. I grew up in a very chaotic household. My parents would scream at each other 24/7 over stupid b.s.. I was physically abused: beat with a metal stud belt, dragged through the house by my hair, slapped across the face. The chaos of my home and the bullying at school led me down a one track path at being institutionalized at the age of 12 for suicidal ideation.

Fast forward 10 years.. Not much has changed. I've been physically assaulted (leaving bleeding and bruising) by my mother twice this year. I have a tracker on my phone. My bank account is locked and I cannot access it. I'm not allowed to go out and when I do I'm faced with fury. My only connection to the outside world is school and my boyfriend. I just now got a license because I wasn't allowed to drive for years. I've been pushed to over 4 mental breakdowns this year. They are in denial that they ever abuse me and will call my doctor to change my medications. Again. Even though I'm fine when I'm not around them. 

I hate my parents so much that I will go out of my way to do things they don't want me to do. I scheduled a tattoo appointment and getting the biggest, most colorful one across my upper back. I don't do anything they tell me to. My dad got pissed off at me for being 5 minutes late to class. Well I feel pressure to be late to class now. I don't want to give him the satisfaction of me actually listening to him. I dyed my hair blue because my mom hates blue. I'm at a point that I would probably kill myself if they told me not to.

It's kind of a philosophical thing that has changed in my mind...


I'm thinking about myself first, then I think about others and it has changed me and my life. I know this is an umpopular opinion but I used to care about the others and forget about myself. This is the way I found to be less ”too nice too stupid"" and not taking care of other people's problems. Now I help when I want, because I want to (with rewards or not, don't really care) and most important is that I managed to refuse help to someone and not feel bad about myself because it's not my problem and the ""help"" these people ask (like money, something futile or something that is going to prejudices me) is not really going to help them or will harm me.

Month after Xmas, I had to quit quite well going job because of a dumb girl, who having no experience nor ideas how to do stuff correctly, ruined everything I tired and ran for in my work life. You know, sometimes you ran into complete asshole, who becomes your manager and, well, if you haven't experienced it on your own skin, pray not to.

So I tried applying for alike position in nearby company and got accepted. I thought to myself, whoa! Restart! Let's go and rock again! Well, I lost the job after a week. I just couldn't realign myself to being new one in the team. I was used to do certain things my way, as I was quite the old experienced guy in my old job.

As spring slowly came to take rule over my quite industrial town, time that used to be my most favourite came. Time of spring walks into forests, out of town. This year I have not enjoyed those walks. I was sitting home, paralyzed by crippling depression and suicidal tendencies. I sold some electricity appliances I owned, to have money for food and rent.

I could find bloody job. As I slowly opened one of my last Chinese instant noodles, I came over to job listing that looked really stupid. It was some 7am, Monday. I summoned last of my spirits, spirits who have been dragged down by numerous instances of rejection.

Long story short, I got new job in field I did barely know it existed. Now I build kitchen units and furniture for people and it makes my living. Each and every day I go home with feeling that there is something i build with my hands and my boss is pleased as well.

The TV was on so we could catch sleep, so when I was ready I turned back and slept. I drank a little so it was naturally a heavier sleep.

Death Dodging Timeline: 

1)  **Respiratory Failure**  [Infant]  
My mom found me in my crib, not breathing &amp; blue in the face/lips. On the way to the hospital, I miraculously ""just started breathing again"".

2)  **GHB**  [15 years old]  
I left my drink unattended at a college party and was drugged with GHB.  After being date raped, I began having seizures and the guys who lived at the house refused to help and demanded my friends get me off of their property immediately.  It took all 3 of my ""friends"" to carry me a couple blocks to the vehicle and was rushed to the hospital.  When regained conciousness the next day, the doctor told me how lucky I was to be alive and he ""estimated"" that I'd have been died if my friends had gotten me to the ER just 5-10 min later. 

3)  **Alcohol Poisoning**  [16 years old]  
When I didn't show up for my little brother's birthday party, my mom came looking for me.  She eventually called the police to keep an eye out for my vehicle; I was found hours later in a grocery store parking lot.  I was unresponsive in the passenger seat, so I was taken to the hospital.  The blood test revealed a BAC of .41 and was subsequently treated for alcohol poisoning.

4)  **DUI Crash**  [16 years old]  
Drove my car head on into a tree at ~50 mph, and wasn't wearing a seat belt. Crushed my coupe like a pop can and totally de-rooted the tree.  Doctors told my mom they attributed my escaping the accident with only a cracked collarbone to my outrageous BAC of .37, which made my body ""loosey goosey"" instead of rigid during the impact.  Obviously, I got a much-deserved DUI, much-needed rehab, and $2000 bill for the tree I'd uprooted in someone's yard.

*Turned my life around by this point, but these last 2 were the scariest:*

5)  **Traumatic Brain Injury** [20 years old]  
Life flighted due to traumatic brain injury. Skull facture, brain hemorrhaging, frontal &amp; occipital lobe bruising, and cerebral edema (brain swelling).  This time my soul actually started to leave my body after I ""gave up"" after 3 days of fighting for my life.  As soon as I prayed &amp; told God he could take me, my soul began departing (some CRAZY shit!) and I realized I did actually have the power of choice whether to live or die. In a panic I cried to God ""No, nevermind, I WANT TO LIVE!"" and my soul sucked back into my body. 

Recovery took months; regaining my ability to walk was painful &amp; frustrating, couldn't remember barely anything about the 6 months prior to my assault, and my head hurt constantly for months!!!  But there was the silver lining of getting a handicapped tag once I was able to drive again :)  Permanently damaged areas of my brain included short term memory, learning, inhibition, and personality.  The neurologist told me I'd have to drop out of school and get a ""simple job"" that didn't require high-level mental skills b/c my brain would never work like that again.  I said F** THAT...if I lived through this I could do anything I set my mind to!  So instead, I studied the structural science, neuroplasticity and psychology of the brain, and learned the importance of getting those neurons firing before they died out from lack of activity.  I learned how to hack my brain, eventually returned to college, and over time my brain became even sharper than it was before (some issues in some spots still, but they're manageable). 

6)  **Sepsis**  [25 years old]  
Went into septic shock after a dual kidney infection had gone undiagnosed.  I'd gone to urgent care 5 days prior with back pain and a 103 degree temperature.  I thought it was just severe back pain so the doctoe gave me pain relievers and muscle relaxers, instructing me to go to the hospital if my fever hadn't gone down by morning.

82,"Just kind of heart warming to see everybody celebrating his life in such a positive way.  Normally these deaths are met with MASS sorrow &amp; solemn memories, but for once it's different and it feels great.  Yesterday after a few hours of seeing the headline..I almost felt like there was this unspoken unity in the world; as if everybody was just happily reflecting on the memories that this amazing man touched all of ours lives with.

Just remember, death isn't sad, it's a part of life, and we're better off celebrating the great things someone has done rather than hurting from the pain of a loss that won't be undone.

83,"Long post but hope it was worth writing for you all...

I just Keep. Cheating. Death. 6 times so far (so I'm crossing my fingers I'm a reincarnated cat &amp; still have 3 left). I know so many of you have lost amazing people who weren't given a second chance at life, but really deserved one. So some of you will likely be infuriated to read some of the bullshit I pulled that, not only almost resulted in my own death, but that could have resulted in the loss of others (praise God that wasn't the case). And that's okay; the person I used to be infuriates me, too. Some of these incidents were total freak accidents or unlucky illnesses/occurances, but some were a result of my own poor judgement and/or negligence.  Thanks to God and an incredible mother who loved and supported me unconditionally, I'm proud to say that the woman I've become feels much more worthy of a chance at life than that nightmare younger me was.

Death Dodging Timeline: 

1)  **Respiratory Failure**  [Infant]  
My mom found me in my crib, not breathing &amp; blue in the face/lips. On the way to the hospital, I miraculously ""just started breathing again"".

2)  **GHB**  [15 years old]  
I left my drink unattended at a college party and was drugged with GHB.  After being date raped, I began having seizures and the guys who lived at the house refused to help and demanded my friends get me off of their property immediately.  It took all 3 of my ""friends"" to carry me a couple blocks to the vehicle and was rushed to the hospital.  When regained conciousness the next day, the doctor told me how lucky I was to be alive and he ""estimated"" that I'd have been died if my friends had gotten me to the ER just 5-10 min later. 

3)  **Alcohol Poisoning**  [16 years old]  
When I didn't show up for my little brother's birthday party, my mom came looking for me.  She eventually called the police to keep an eye out for my vehicle; I was found hours later in a grocery store parking lot.  I was unresponsive in the passenger seat, so I was taken to the hospital.  The blood test revealed a BAC of .41 and was subsequently treated for alcohol poisoning.

4)  **DUI Crash**  [16 years old]  
Drove my car head on into a tree at ~50 mph, and wasn't wearing a seat belt. Crushed my coupe like a pop can and totally de-rooted the tree.  Doctors told my mom they attributed my escaping the accident with only a cracked collarbone to my outrageous BAC of .37, which made my body ""loosey goosey"" instead of rigid during the impact.  Obviously, I got a much-deserved DUI, much-needed rehab, and $2000 bill for the tree I'd uprooted in someone's yard.

*Turned my life around by this point, but these last 2 were the scariest:*

5)  **Traumatic Brain Injury** [20 years old]  
Life flighted due to traumatic brain injury. Skull facture, brain hemorrhaging, frontal &amp; occipital lobe bruising, and cerebral edema (brain swelling).  This time my soul actually started to leave my body after I ""gave up"" after 3 days of fighting for my life.  As soon as I prayed &amp; told God he could take me, my soul began departing (some CRAZY shit!) and I realized I did actually have the power of choice whether to live or die. In a panic I cried to God ""No, nevermind, I WANT TO LIVE!"" and my soul sucked back into my body. 

Recovery took months; regaining my ability to walk was painful &amp; frustrating, couldn't remember barely anything about the 6 months prior to my assault, and my head hurt constantly for months!!!  But there was the silver lining of getting a handicapped tag once I was able to drive again :)  Permanently damaged areas of my brain included short term memory, learning, inhibition, and personality.  The neurologist told me I'd have to drop out of school and get a ""simple job"" that didn't require high-level mental skills b/c my brain would never work like that again.  I said F** THAT...if I lived through this I could do anything I set my mind to!  So instead, I studied the structural science, neuroplasticity and psychology of the brain, and learned the importance of getting those neurons firing before they died out from lack of activity.  I learned how to hack my brain, eventually returned to college, and over time my brain became even sharper than it was before (some issues in some spots still, but they're manageable). 

6)  **Sepsis**  [25 years old]  
Went into septic shock after a dual kidney infection had gone undiagnosed.  I'd gone to urgent care 5 days prior with back pain and a 103 degree temperature.  I thought it was just severe back pain so the doctoe gave me pain relievers and muscle relaxers, instructing me to go to the hospital if my fever hadn't gone down by morning.  Morning came, but I was so sick that all I could do was sleep.  When someone stopped by to check on me a few days later, they thought I was just napping and left so as to not disturb me.  But in reality, I was screaming for help on the inside but couldn't even open my eyes or get words out to tell them I needed help.  2 days later, that same person called a friend and asked them to drop by because they were worried, and that phone call saved my life.

84,"Ive had this wish for a long time now. It mostly resurfaces when I feel like shit, but that's a lot of the time.

I am annoying, lazy, have trouble focusing for good periods of time, and have self control issues. However none of these things are 'bad' enough for me to say I have some sort of disorder. I mean, I might but I have never been checked.

85,"This is my story. 

I have low vision (about 65% in my right eye and 6% in my left eye). I study in regular school even though I used to study in a blind school before till I was 12 (yes, I can read and write Braille). I also have photo phobia and dry eyes (my tear glands are literally dry). That means I never cry (I'm a real man I guess). My photo phobia makes it hard to make direct eye contact or go out in the sun. That's why I wear a cap all the time. 

In school people ask me weird questions about my eyes even though they know everything. Sometimes they snatch away my cap and believe me or not, out in the open, without that cap I'm almost blind. Then they tell me to chase them (which is impossible). It's not that I get offended quickly. I make jokes on me always. But I can understand (Well, everybody can) when someone's trying to be mean.

88,"I graduated this past May, and for the first few months after I was looking for a job until I found one in August.  The job wasn't exactly in the field I was hoping for (my major was in Supply Chain in college, I now work for a software company), but there were some similarities with what the business does and I needed a job.  It wasn't some terrible sales job either.

4 months later and I've realized that this job isn't for me.  The company is full of nice people, my boss is demanding but fair, and the job isn't necessarily terrible. There aren't any real issues with the company, I just don't have a passion for using our software to help clients.

Thing is, I signed an apartment lease and moved in a couple of months ago.  I did have family in the area, but I wanted to be on my own as my family is fairly strict.  Because of rent I feel as if I can't just quit my job and start anew because I still have to pay for rent.  The job has long hours (nothing crazy, but more that 40 hours weekly) so I can't spend enough time looking for a position more towards what I want to do.

90,"I saw posts on here about toxic moms. I never opened up the posts. I went to the Reddit search space and typed toxic moms. I was shocked. There are Reddits and Subreddits where posts are given about toxic moms. My mom has been toxic to me and others about as long as I have known her. She is nice when she can be in control. She is nice to others outside of the family who she wants to suck up to, to hide her ways.

One of the non-physical things she did to me was tell my stepdad I have holes in my head and make things up after one of the times I saw her cheating on him in bed with another man. She could have asked me not to say anything but she used the fact that I was born disabled and without a whole brain to discredit me. I was the first one in our family to find out she was cheating on my dad and with my future stepdad. She had been telling me my whole life no one else had to know how I was born. This is just one of the non-physical things.

One thing that pertain to me but include others outside the family is when I was at a concert. I had told her that man and I were friends. She had been trying to convince me many years that he was only pretending to be my friend. (She's been trying to convince me many years since I was a little girl that no one who says they're my friend is really my friend) Years ago, many months too, I was sexually abused many times by two men. One of the triggers is hummus because I never heard of vegan, hummus or organic anything until the sexual horrors. The night of the concert, in the VIP area, she ordered something with hummus, out of everything on the menu she could have ordered. She later told me she couldn't order anything else. Right.

I am not gonna get into any of the violent things, death threats, suicide manipulations, kidnapping attempts on my life, attempts on my life, neglect when my brother spoke and showed me death threats after having been violent to me and others when he was a little boy, family abuse that landed me in the hospital and unconscious many times followed by ""Keep it in the family"" whenever doctors tried to get me to talk, etc.

94,"By 'stereotypical nerd' I am specifically talking about nerdy guys who look like the guy in this photo - https://imgur.com/a/nRfdlD8

I also like looking up weird ways people have died and one time I made a forum thread about weird ways people have died (just out of curiosity) and someone replied about how some years ago a stereotypical nerd was being harassed so one day the nerd locked this person in a bathroom and then the nerd got him to the ground, put him in a scissor hold and choked him until he died of asphyxiation. 

Something about that turned me on so much I kind of became obsessed. Every few years I look at news cases to see if it's happened again and it has. In 2014 in Oregon a man was found dead in his car. The bruises on his neck suggested that he was strangled between a set of thighs, and the victim was last seen alive at a restaurant with three stereotypical looking skinny nerds. There was one in 2013 too and the nerdy guy had a Facebook profile. His victim too died of asphyxiation when he put his neck in a scissor hold after an argument -  the nerd squeezed his neck for ten minutes. 

I already liked stereotypical nerds before all of this but something about this makes me really love them for some reason. Like I act super nice to nerdy guys all the time because I respect how deceptively deadly their thighs can be and I feel somewhat jealous of the people who died. Like maybe not to death but just having a nerd jump on me and wrap his thighs across my neck and give it a squeeze. 

Can anyone explain why exactly this turns me on so much? Like I'm not complaining, I'm just genuinely curious.",13Nov2018,1

I say “may” because I have until the 15th to decide (in 2 days). I am suppose to be buying my ticket tonight and I can’t help but feel.. conflicted. 

Im 23 years old and Im engaged to an amazing supportive man(24). We’ve been together for almost 6 years (this December). We’ve known one another since we were teenagers via online. When I turned 18 I flew to meet him and his family. In all honestly our relationship has literally been a fairytale. I met his family and they are all wonderful. He has met mine and they absolutely adore him. We moved out together and have been living together for about 2 years while I finish up college and he works full time. That’s my current situation. 

I have always loved to travel. I loved visiting Mexico when I was younger. I loved long car rides and train rides. I like visiting different states. My fiancé has encouraged this. We travel a lot  together within the states. For our honey moon we want to go visit another country like Germany or Japan. 

I became interested in studying abroad during a fair my college was hosting. I was instantly sold. I had always wanted to study in another place, specifically in the East. Over the past 5 months I have been prepping like getting my passport, attending orientation, finding out info about my college abroad etc. My fiancé was never against it, but I could tell there were some hesitation ofc. There was always this idea, “well if things don’t work out I have until the 15 of November to withdraw from the program” well, that’s in two days. 

My fiancé and I have recently gotten into an arguement about independence. I feel like he forgets I’m independent, that i am my own person, that i don’t need him to protect me and shield me from all the evils of the world . He understands that now but.. I feel guilty. When I first shared the news with his family, the first thing his sister said was, “well what about him?” And I asked, “what do you mean?” And she said “you’re just going to leave him?” 

It hit me hard. The feminist in me was like, uh yeah. But there’s a part of me now that I’m feeling that’s like, “well wait a minute...” can I just leave him? It’s only 4 months and way back in our relationship we did long distance (we met online for goodness sakes). I started to convince myself, we can do this! We did this before and we will get thru it. It’ll be ok! 


He told me that he didn’t want me to leave a few weeks ago. He said he’s been thinking about how different it’ll be when I’m gone. In other words, he’s going to miss me. He knows that it’s selfish of him to say that but he wanted to tell me. As far as money goes, he has drilled into my brain that he will be sending money every month to support me. I told him not to! That if I need money I’ll talk to him but don’t send me money every month! It’s just so frustrating 😔 i don’t want to be seen as the fiancé who takes advantage of their partner to him or his family. 

Half of me is really pissed off while the other is sympathetic towards him. I’m torn. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to handle this and i don’t have anyone I could talk to. I’m scared that he will resent me for it. I’ve told him this and he reassured me that he won’t but “jokingly” he’ll say things like “don’t go” or “I’ll miss you, stay” WHENEVER I bring it up. 

There are other worrisome factors like, since I’m graduating I won’t be able to walk across stage since I’ll be in China, and I don’t know anyone in this program, and that it is 4 months is concerning but not as prominent as my other issue.

Any kind words of advice or wisdom would be really appreciated. ",13Nov2018,1

115,"I'm currently in college as a cooking student. I was assigned to do two salads today, a potato salad and a coleslaw. Quickly, I got the potatoes, cleaned and peeled them, put them in a pot with water and put them on high heat. As I was waiting for them to boil, I got a start on the coleslaw. Once I got the coleslaw done, the potatoes were very tender, so I drained them off and mashed them. The recipe for the potato salad called for celery, green onion, and parsley, I finely diced the celery and chopped the parsley,  but as I was cutting the green onion, I sliced and into and made a deep gash into my left index finger just beside my fingernail. 

In a panic, I rushed to the sink to clean off the wound, one of my classmates seen and helped me wrap it in paper towel. I gave my locker key to one of my other classmates to bring me my purse and jacket so I could go to the hospital. My instructor told me to sit down and keep breathing, because apparently I was extremely pale. He got his kitchen assistant to rush me to the hospital, which is luckily just down the road from the college. She dropped me off at the hospital entrance. I rush to the ER and thankfully, I got in right away. The nurse asked for my info and then she unwrapped the paper towel off my finger. You could see how my knife created a flap of skin. The nurse put dressing on my finger and told me to wait in a room. 

5 minutes later the doctor, the same nurse who checked me, and a nurse in training came in the room. The doctor cleaned the wound, proceeded the process of numbing my finger, and started stitching. The doctor made sure I didn't feel a thing besides the needle to numb my finger. The doctor said it's a good thing I didn't cut too deep, apparently I only needed one stitch and a bit of glue. After everything was done, I was given instructions on how to take care of the stitch. When eveything was done I called the kitchen at the college and told them I was done. 

The kitchen assistant picked me up and brought me back to the campus. My instructor told me to go to his office so we could file an incident report. Once we got it filled out, he asked me if I was okay to drive. I told him I should be fine, I normally drive with my right hand anyway. He told me that I should go home and not worry about the afternoon classes. I was supposed to write a test that afternoon, but he told me I should go home and take it easy after today and write my test tomorrow. I decided not to argue with him, mainly because my instructor is pretty intimidating since he used to been in the military before he became an instructor. I was reluctant, but I packed up my things and got ready to go home. 

So much for my perfect attendance... * sigh*",13Nov2018,1

118,"I hate the rat race. i'm a 21 yr old male. I dont have a degree and have been working minimum wage my whole life. The only things i'm truly passionate for in life are my music and art. And obviously those arent necessarily moneymaking passions. I hate my job. I hate that im working myself to death to live. I have no time to do what i love, and when i do have time im exhausted. I dislike being in this country (East coast USA). I cant continue living like this, it doesnt feel right. I need to reassimilate somewhere else, so many things are bringing me down in this country.. I cant stand it anymore.


I've thought about just packing up and leaving to somewhere in asia/the middle east to start playing music in the street and doing something new. It would be wholfully beneficial to my musicianship, I would meet many new people to play with and socialize with, I could live much more cheaply, etc.


I would plan and save more.. but this thought has been stuck in my head for awhile now. I feel like i just need to get up and do it and im faultering for nothing. Am i in over my head? This sounds like something i would greatly benefit from given i plan before hand. I'm really enthusiastic about field recording and learning about other cultures and their music and the instruments they use for it. Can somebody tell me whats up? Why shouldnt i do this?

119,"I just have to vent. I've been working my ass off the last two years the hardest I have in my life. I had saved $15k, had locked down what I thought was a very affordable housing situation and told myself that now was the time, I was going to finish my degree and do something I could give a shit about - teach.

So I continued working 30 + hours at a decent paying working class job. I worked nights April - September at a seasonal job to make as much extra cash as I could to supplement that income. I took classes, building my course load to the point where at this moment I am holding down basically a full time job, a part time job, and 14 credit hours. I do my absolute best to budget but I can't stick to it at this level of work. Working that many hours I'm too exhausted to ever cook. I eat carry out or dine  out for every meal. After two years my money is drying up.

To compound this my university doesn't structure courses with any consideration for those who have to work to feed and house themselves and pay for their education. Once you reach a certain point you have to take 12+ credit hours every semester and cut the amount you can work to make room. Assignments require you to go to highly specific events that are scheduled at certain times that are inevitably at work hours or night class hours. It's a catch 22 - to avoid loans you have to work so much, but at a certain point you simply cannot work enough and take all the courses you need to move forward.

It's impossible. Everything is structured for me to take a 20k loan and just do school. You have to work for health insurance? Fuck you. You don't want to take loans because you are 30 y.o. and don't want to have to work into your 50's paying off your loans on a pitiful teacher's salary? Fuck off.

It's impossible. I've tried being the best millennial I can be, trying to avoid debt and get into my career. It's just not possible. /endrant",13Nov2018,1
120,"Just had my Australian version of a prom we just call formal and so usually after that you'd go to afters where you would go somewhere to have a couple of drinks and have fun. Anyway so i ask my formal date if there was any afters, in which she replied there isn't really one, and she was just going to her best friends house which was fine and I planned on not going anywhere after.
Then during formal, a couple of my mates all asked me if I was going to afters in which i replied nah i didn't get invited to any? So that got me really confused and i thought they had another afters with another group of friends.
So once formal was over, everyone all said they were going to afters at my dates best friends house and so i realised she was going to her friends house with everyone else but never really invited me to go.  
So when everyone  were leaving, they asked hey do you want to come, I thought it was bad to accept because i was never invited in the first place so i declined and went home instead.

Now, after i woke up seeing all these pictures of them having fun, drinking (which they said they weren't going to) without me, i have really bad fomo and feel sad and lonely, regretting not accepting their invitation. 
How do you deal with this feeling of missing out? ",13Nov2018,1
121,"I'm finding myself in a really hard situation. My boyfriend of three months has severe depression. He self harms and informs me of this afterwards and always talks about ""offing himself"". I'm currently at University in a different city, meaning I am unable to see him as consistently as I did over the summer. Also, I can't access how he's feeling so easily anymore as he constantly lies and tells he's fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

His depression makes him see every aspect of his life in a severely negative light. He thinks he's stupid when he's flying through uni whilst barely trying, got no friends when he's down the pub every other night with pals, thinks he could do more for other people when he is really considerate towards other people and tries to do nice things for them. Occasionally, he hides himself away and doesn't answer any phone calls and doesn't want to meet up when I'm home or when he is supposed to visit. But mostly, he tells me every little thought and feelings that is going on his brain. It is only me he tells and he is too embarrassed to talk about it to his other friends. Now, admittedly, I've never had depression or anxiety and none of my friendship group suffers with any mental health disorder other than loneliness. I have no experience in helping people with depression since I went out with my boyfriend. But the fact he tells me everything and only me it is really overwhelming. His depression is always there, so we can be there for hours texting, me reassuring him and him rejected my reassurance. I lightly nag him to speak to others or get professional help and no matter how much he says he will, it never seems to happen as he ""forgets"" to.  I've been told not to pressure or nag, but I'm seeing this as my only option. When I told him I found this whole situation a bit mentally damaging and tiring for me, he said he would never tell me anything again and bundle it up, which I didn't want. However, on the occasion when I've lost my temper and got angry, he cries and starts reciting how much he doesn't like himself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've gone on the internet for help and advice, but its all very generic (""Be patient and reassure him you're there"") and everyone expresses there depression in different ways, not I did not find its advice very helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if I seem insensitive towards my boyfriend's depression or depression in general, but I don't know how to help the situation. I'd characterise myself as impatient, have a pessimist outlook on society, and often very selfish, so I'm not sure if I'm right off him.

Any advice? ",13Nov2018,1

123,What are some (legal) ways to make a little bit of extra money? ,13Nov2018,1
124,"Today was a long day, nothing was going good but most things were okay until I had to do my homework. I was tired after school and I fell asleep by accident a couple times and I didn’t wake up until 8:30ish. Then I was dreading my homework so I procrastinate for like half an hour by playing solitaire.

(Sort of irrelevant paragraph)
 I start my homework and I do the easy subjects first but then I get to maths and I’m gone. I didnt get a full question right at all and I had to kept looking at the answers. I got part of each question, but I was never able to make it to the end. Then I had science and I didn’t know what was happening and all my answers are guesses. 

Anyway I was in a bad mood after my homework and I started thinking about music and how I’d love to just become a musician and not do school. I thought about an audition being open for the national orchestra and me entering just because I could and ending up getting it, having a life based around music and getting good money from it. I imagined the grand house I would have which was white and had a music room on the left with a beautiful black piano when you walked in and I’d teach kids music for extra money and there’d be a jar of lollipops that I’d say “take one” after each lesson.

I was happy there but then I realised that that isn’t reality, I’m not musically gifted and I am stuck in school. The daydream was just a dream that was pretty much impossible for me. I’m stuck in school where I need to get good grades in case I realise a job that has high points is what I want. 

Like everyone says school is the best part of our lives, but they also say it gets better when you grow up or it’ll be worth it. But how do we know that? What if my life doesn’t get better and I’m just drowning through it. ",13Nov2018,1
