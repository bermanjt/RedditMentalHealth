1,"I realized I can explain basically everything I do in terms of trying to win attention from someone (generally my dad or my SO, but anyone will do. 

My therapist pointed out to me a few weeks ago that I exhibit many attention-seeking behaviors, citing how I default to saying ""no"" or correcting people, and that I break rules just because they are rules, how I show up late to everything because I unconsciously value my own time over anyone else's. He suggested I ""misbehave"" now because as a kid I felt like I only got attention from my parents when I was a spectacular failure or spectacular success and it's a hell of a lot easier to fail (though I keep trying my hand at success every so often). 

Ever since that therapy session I've been noticing more and more things I do can be explained by my seeking attention. Like how I dye my hair purple and have an ""odd"" (and often ""slutty"") fashion sense (I made a plastic bag into a shirt once). I do a lot of things that are contrary to expectations (I failed math in 6th grade despite getting the highest score on the placement test, I look really ""alt/punk/metal"" but am a competitive figure skater, in high school I had a 3.9 gpa and my best friend was a dropout, etc.) and I wonder if I only do them because being a collection of contradictions makes me ""interesting"". I am diagnosed with two mental illnesses and I wonder if I'm subconsciously just faking it to get sympathy from people. It's gotten to the point that I'm questioning why my passions in life are what they are. 

My two biggest passions are engineering (where being a pretty woman who knows stuff gets me noticed) and music (I'm mainly a vocalist and performing on stage....this one should be obvious). I guess I just want to be looked at.

Now, this all is relatively harmless attention whoring I guess. Where it gets yucky is when you look at the fact that I've cheated in my 3 longest relationships (which of course includes my current and possibly dead marriage) because I struggle to turn down flattery and praise. Or that I have lied so much and been so selfish a friend that I only have 1 left (well I have another, but I'm not allowed to talk to him).

I think my whole personality, good and bad exists just because I desperately want attention, and I don't care how shallow or deep it is. I give off a ""I don't give a fuck what you think about me"" vibe when it's really the opposite, I see now. I care so much that I don't know if I am who I am because it's actually what I want or if it's because it's what I think other people will find interesting.",20Sep2018,1

We were the same age though . We broke up, Violently after I caught her cheating with someone 4 years older than her (We where 14) and she cut me and I thought I deserved it because she was depressed and it was better for her to cut me that herself 
Eventually I got paranoid that she was going to kill herself and apologized for the hell I put her through . We are friends right now . 

Also she yelled at a safety (Which is a 11-13 year old that helps the younger children cross the busy streets)  because she didn’t say hi back to her loud enough . 
I had to tell her that she did to make her back off .

4,"I'm going to graduate high school in about a year and half.  I keep thinking back to 6th grade, and when everyone was excited to join their clubs and activities. I was never one of those people. I joined football, played for two years, and quit freshman year. After 2 years of football, Sophomore year was bliss. Now, i just feel bored. I didn't even exactly like football, I just liked the sense of brotherhood with everyone going through the same shit, together. Seeing my old teammates on varsity, it reminds me of my missed opportunities, and how little time I have left.  Now I'm overwhelmed on what to do with this remaining time. I used to only think about what job I was going to get and how to get there the quickest, but I realized thats fucking stupid. I don't want to rush through college like I did high school and work for the rest of my life. I guess it's mainly about my missed opportunites. I missed the opportunity to do alot of things, and now I'm trying to figure out what to do before I miss that opportunity too. i just needed to get this off my chest, and maybe a little help.

I am graduating earlier than all my other friends in college and most of them don’t even live anywhere near me. I need a community to belong to where I can meet people, make friends and feel like I am making an impact on something.

I love the outdoors, love watching sports although I am pretty unathletic, and I’d like to be with people around my age like 22-30. I’m not much into volunteering although I can see it being a last resort option to at least socialize and make an impact on people’s lives.

7,"**TL;DR**

24 never a girlfriend or been kissed still a virgin never a date No attractive women like me only unattractive obese women like me and that's who people tell me to learn to settle for i hate my life cause of it

5 dating sites and never has an attractive or decent looking woman matched or message me only unattractive obese women or unattractive women do. 

When I go to bars and clubs I get rejected and ignored every time I cant win. 

The women i try for and who i want to attract are Ria Ciuffo from Barstool Sports attractive. 

I get told to aim for girls as unattractive and fat as the girl from youtube Christine Syldelko. 

Big difference in what i try for and what people tell me to get used to aiming for instead of offering advice that would help me attract women as good looking as Ria. 

And if any of my friends saw me dating a fat ugly girl they'd either laugh at me or worse think we're a good match saying I'm as bad looking and as much a loser as her. And if any of the women who rejected me saw me with a fat ugly girl I'd be looking for a bus to hit me. 

To give more context into what people read

 NO I do not hate women.  who I hate are the guys who women choose because the guys who women choose are always the type who have always picked on me and bullied me and then they rub it in my face on how they were able to get the girl I try for


**TL;DR**
Here's a list of all my experiences
1st Friendzone/Rejection ""**SARA**""

The girl i tried for in high school (24) but who friendzoned me is getting married to a scumbag piece of shit. (21) who cheated on her with a teacher She started dating him when me and her were seniors and he was a freshman he was caught sexting a teacher caught on the news and now the girl I want is marrying him and A TEACHER HERSELF 

and now everybody is happy that they're getting married it's like I'm living in the Twilight Zone that people forget that he cheated on her with the teacher and got caught on the news. And the only type of women who like me or unattractive and obese so when it rains it pours. i hate my life and i hate her fiance. 


AND THEN 2nd Friendzone/Rejection "" **ASHLEY** ""

**TL;DR**

Girl i love has a boyfriend and she's in love with him and it depresses me beyond comprehension that she loves him and she will never love me. I'm absolutely fucking depressed. 

Everybody else wants them to get married except me, i fucking hate her boyfriend he ruined my life. I asked girls on here if he's better looking than me and they all said yes he was and theyd rather date him than me. Can anybody give me advice thats beneficial for me? Not advice that only benefits her boyfriend, cause reality is if you say ""If you really love her youd be happy for her"" or ""move on"", that has no benefits for me it only benefits her bitchboy punkass boyfriend.


And again to recap she doesn't love me she loves him nobody feels bad for me because everybody else wants these two to be married already and the only type of girls who like me or unattractive obese girls so I don't get a bright side or a silver lining or happy ending that benefits me all of those is a losing situation for me or I end up with either nothing or what doesn't make up for what I lost out on. 


I told her I love her she rejected me then a week later she had me meet with her only so she can set me up with her fat ugly friend

3rd Friendzone/Rejection **ALEX**

My high school prom date whose a family friend and who i had a crush on for years, she made out with another guy in front of me and fucked him in his car and because she stayed at my place she invited him over to make out with him on MY DRIVEWAY.

8,"I don’t use FB often, but this is an ongoing gripe of mine. There is no option to choose “graduated from”. Friends and some family members, that I know for a fact never went to, nor graduated from, their said university, have that in their profile. To boost themselves, I’m sure. Will I call any one of them out? Probably not. I sure as fuck would like to, though.",20Sep2018,1
9,"So, I don't know how to start this. I have emotions. I can be happy, mad, and I've cried because of movies/TV shows/music (Toy Story 3 ending and I bawled like a baby at The Office series finale). I have this crush on a girl right now and it's really, really strong. Like whenever I think of her I get this warm and fuzzy feeling in my chest (call me cheesy, yada-yada, I'm kind of overly-romantic). But I don't know, lately, these thoughts just popped into my head that I'm faking my emotions, my happiness, love, everything. These thoughts didn't occur until a couple of days ago, honestly. 

And guess what, I'm not even so sure this is solidified myself because I go through shit like this all the time. Different crisis-es that affect me and become a plague on my mind. It's happened before and it's happening now. They usually last c. 3 weeks or so before my head is cleared and the cycle begins again. I think it's a symptom of depression. I read this story about a guy who dated a girl for a year and was basically the perfect guy, but then revealed to her that he was just doing it to break up with her and crush her heart. I'm worried about becoming that, I guess. I don't know, I know I won't, because I do legitimately have feelings for the girls I like, but yeah. 

I think I have a stilted ability with feeling empathy and taking blame. Like, I can sympa- and empathize with people. I know this girl who's been abused by her boyfriend and I feel so, so bad for her. Like, really, really bad. Sometimes I give her a hug just to make her feel loved, and I know I do it out of pure sincerity, but I still doubt myself. And as for the fault thing, I *know* exactly when I'm at fault for things, but this voice in the back of my head (not literally, just figurative) tells me that I'm *not*. I hate it and want to let it go. But it just pops up. Is that psychologically normal? 

I think part of this is the fact that I'm living in an emotionally abusive and sometimes physically abusive household with my mother. I don't feel cared for or loved myself and, on a slightly offtopic note, I feel like I look for the love and nurture I don't have in the girls I tend to be drawn towards. The one I like now, who I'm okay friends with since we don't know each other too well, called me really sweet at a gathering with friends and I became enchanted with her, I guess lol. 

But yeah. Those are my problems. So tell me, do I sound like what my mind seems to think I am? ",20Sep2018,0

21,"I am currently a first semester freshman at a very very expensive business school in NYC. The school is quite prestigious, and really does offer a solid education. Many students from this school are able to find pretty good internships and eventually jobs. Personally, I think I only came to this school because I was chasing prestige. My mother wanted me to go to the best college with the highest name brand I could. However, I am now realizing that I don't really want to go into the business field. I also don't want to graduate from undergraduate with upwards of $200k worth of debt. My parents have been very reserved about talking to me regarding how much they would help with the cost. I'm expecting to have to take on at least $170k myself, most likely more, and possibly up to $250k. This is just stupid right? It is certainly possible that I can get a good job after this, but even still, I don't want to have this massive debt looming over me. I recently approached them about possibly transferring, and they aren't completely against it. However, they are certainly upset at the moment and feel like I am wasting my potential. I want to transfer to a college back in my home state. I'd end up graduating from there in 2.5 years due to my AP credits and credits from this school I'm at already. Also, the debt would be so much less. Like maybe $10k? Which is certainly a much more manageable sum of money to pay off. The school is certainly less prestigious than the one I am at right now. But further more, it would allow me to do something I'd like to do instead (i'd greatly prefer some form of engineering or biology-related subject than business). It just makes sense to me to transfer. The benefits certainly out-weight the cons, and I feel like it is the mature choice to make. Yet, my parents are the one's against it.

24,"  

I married my first wife at 27. We were married for just over 4 years. Before that we were very good friends who hung out constantly and then we dated for a while before we got married. Basically, she was a very big part of my life for 8 years. We got divorced when I was 31. I filed for divorce and didn't look back. She treated me very poorly and it crushed the life out of a what was a great, but definitely non-traditional, marriage.

   
 

I am now married to my 2nd wife. We met about 6 months following my divorce and got married 9 months after that (what was I thinking?!?)

   
 

Anyways, this marriage is great. I love my wife. We have fun together. We have similar goals and hobbies. blah blah, whatever. 

   
 

I don't miss my ex and I'm not having issues with my wife. This post is more of an observation than anything, and every time I listen to Estranged by Guns n' Roses it brings some major feelings that I have kind of a hard time explaining and I've thought about a lot. I've kind of defined the feelings and figured out what exactly the song made me feel.

   
 

I was best friends and totally in love with my ex for a very long time. Now we don't talk, and we have no desire to ever talk or be friends again. That major part of my life is just gone now, and that's all there is to it. I don't know if I feel like the woman who treated me like garbage replaced my best friend, or if they are two different people - in my mind - that are both gone together. It's a strange bittersweet feeling.

It wakes me up. I am so exhausted. I wake up every night and cry and drive around my neighborhood to try to find where it is.

Cops won't do anything because it is really not even loud. I just get woken up by the feeling. I don't know if it makes sense .

The reality is this, we are all a parasite - like organisms that live on a floating rock that flies through space and eventually we will all be dead. No wait, i was supposed to make you feel better....ehh.. Well, there is no meaning in your life, because there is no meaning in life! There, that should settle it. No? What if you knew the truth? Well, I actually know the truth...Do you want to know it? Fine! The meaning of life is to co-exist with another organism that produces oxygen, and in order to keep that organism alive is to take a healthy shit in the forest. Happy? No? Okay, we need to produce oxygen in order so that our god, Steve, can get an A in his science experiment. Still to little information? Fine. Steve got a D-, and he sometimes inhales the oxygen in order to get high, he then uses his high to masturbate to a three blobbed bright green globs (Don't judge).

My initial point was to say that even if you knew the meaning of life, you would still feel the same way. The void is what that drives us to do great things. Learning that you will one day die, and learning that whatever you do, does not really matter - is in my opinion, essential in order to live a well lived life.

Are there value in anything? Yes, of course! As of right now, Silver is worth about 14$ per ounce, while Gold is worth about 1200$ per ounce. Is now a good time to buy? Who knows! All i know that is as soon we as a species leave earth, we will encounter many great adventures and challenges! While being on another planet, one of many of these challenges is avoiding being killed by all the diamonds, emeralds, gold or silver or whatever that literally fall from the sky like rain! Although rare materials are uncommon here, they are common everywhere else. Wait....does this mean that we are insignificant? Is there any value in us?  Sure, we are created by the weary sets of atoms as the stars and cosmos itself! In a way, you, and everyone else are the universe, and your farts are like gasses in the cosmos that forms the stars! And black holes are....

It's okay to be not okay. There is no secret to happiness, in fact I am willing to go as far to say that there is no such thing as being constantly happy, anyone that claims to be that are lying.

What you should learn instead is not taking what you have, what you do, and what has happened for granted. Enjoy moments which are meant to be enjoyed, or maybe even enjoy stupid or bizarre moments.

Cry during appropriate times, learn how to both feel and express yourself.

Seeking happiness won't give you anything but sadness, it makes you desperate. The only thing you can do, is let it come to you. Why? Because like I said, it doesn't exist. What we procede as happiness has been greatly exaggerated, to the point that it has become a myth.

Yesterday I started laughing out of the blue several times, because I was looking back on a fun and wholesome memory. When I was in that moment, I enjoyed it and I did not just let it go over my head, I was actively participating in creating a good memory that I will probably remember for the rest of my life, and most importantly enjoy being a part of that memory.

""woah, what did you do, Mr. Dude""

Well Timmy, I just told a joke to a friend of mine, it just made us laugh. Nothing more really. But I enjoyed the moment, and I had a jolly good time, despite the joke being really bad.",20Sep2018,5
35,"This is a bit of a rambly wall of text because I need to vent / ask some questions, I'll bold the questions / important parts if you want to just skim those.

I broke up with my boyfriend a week ago after we mutually agreed that we couldn't sustain what we'd had. We're both starting senior year in fairly intense majors in college (pure math / physics), and kinda realized that the thing we had going on for the last 6 months couldn't last. We're both logical people near the top of our majors, and we each had to prioritize our study, which is pretty intense for both of us. Although we both understood this, we both just ended up feeling irrationally sad. We tried to reconcile it for a while, but it kept going back to us being in a weird state of both feeling bad and understanding each others priorities. It got to the stage where I felt guilty for studying when we could be together instead - for the first time in 3 years of college **I felt burnt out doing something I loved - studying math. As I found out this feeling was mutual, and was the primary motivation for the breakup.**

**The one thought that I can't get over is that if we were really meant for each other, then we'd make time for each other.** We both tried, but the fact is that if you don't dedicate an unreasonable amount of time (\~70-80hrs/wk) to our respective majors then you're fucked. And the thing is with pure math / physics is if you do well (top &lt;5%), you're likely guaranteed a well paying / fulfilling career path, but if you're not in the top \~20% then your job prospects are fucked.

The breakup was positive, it ended with a long conversation about what we loved about each other, laughing, a hug goodbye, and us both saying 'maybe one day'. The breakup was in the morning, I cried and generally felt sad until the afternoon, but that feeling slowly subsided and gave way to me feeling alright with the situation. My last breakup was a 'stereotypical' one, and had me pretty devastated for a week or two. This time, almost instantly I got back to doing my math homework and I felt that spark come back - the passion that I previously had for studying that had so notably been absent recently. **And I guess this is the second conundrum that I feel a bit guilty about - I don't feel bad. I assumed that I'd feel bad when I left the man that I loved. I think I feel good?**

We still talk occasionally online, but both agree that we should let the situation settle a bit before we try to hang out again. The common advice I see is to just block him and get over it, but I don't think that really applies in my case. **Does anyone have experiences / advice about my breakup?**",20Sep2018,1
36,It seems like the sky is falling no matter who you ask but for different reasons. The left tells me that Trump is literally hitler and just about to raise a fourth reich and every minority group is in grave peril and we're about to become a corporatist dystopia and everything the right does is evil and heres proof of them making stuff up to smear us. and the right says we're entering a quasi-communist dystopia and our social fabric is eroding along with our civil rights and liberties at the hands of crazed leftists pushing PC culture and heres proof of them fabricating information to smear us .  At face value it just looks like they're both lying and whoring for ratings but they didn't get their proof of the other lying out of nowhere. It all just seems like nothing but propaganda where neither of it is true.

I let it become like this because I was too edgy/depressed/hopeless to realize how important it is to develop social skills to the extent of seeming like a normal person. I started out late at 18 and there is SOME progress but I feel sad that I'm lagging behind my peers.

I understand that shouldn't be an issue but I'm letting it get to me and it's making me depressed. But that's not I want to really say, it's a buildup to what bothers me right now. I have a crush at the moment. I don't particularly like how I am when I have a crush. The lack of control over my thoughts and emotions, is honestly quite unnerving. But this isn't my first time, I usually preemptively break my own heart by telling them how I feel. I already know they never feel the same way. 

I just want the pain to end for myself. I do it for myself. Now, I can't do that. My crush is a fellow team member for sports club. I can't make everything awkward now considering how close the competition for the sport I'm in is. Furthermore, I can't make things awkward in the club.

42,"My sister in law is getting married and having a hen/bachelorette party. She asked me and two others (her cousins) to organise the hen, which we had scheduled for November (but not booked anything). Recently, I started an important diploma course (as I'm switching careers) that will be integral to my future. I only last week found out that my course dates conflict with the hen. I'm already taking off time to go to her wedding, which will be in India, so I don't want to take off an additional day. They tried to rearrange it around me, but then others couldn't come and it didn't work out.

&amp;#x200B;

We also had a local one day hen planned in the UK - but just my luck, I'm not available on that day either. When the overseas hen didn't work out, they decided to add a couple of days to the local one. I've said I'll come to the dinner on the Friday night before, and join the girls after my class on the Saturday, and stay overnight for brunch. Now I feel as though the two cousins are trying to guilt me and I think it's working. The convo went something like this:

Cousin#1: ""It's really sad and disappointing that none of Rita's sister in laws are coming. Oh well it is what it is, we'll make the most of it."" 

Me: ""I'm coming!""

Cousin #1: ""I understand you are and I'm pleased, I also understand you have a course, it would be nice if you had come for the whole day.""

Me: ""I know and if I weren't taking time off for India I would be able to. I couldn't do both so had to choose."" 

Cousin #1: ""I just feel Rita does a lot for her side and it would be nice if all her sister in laws were there. But oh well it is what it is, we make the most of the Saturday.""

Me (trying to diffuse): ""I know man and (location) looks so cool! Really wish I could come to that!""

Cousin #2: ""Since all you sister in laws can't come maybe you all should contribute for Rita?""

Me: ""Sure if everyone is contributing for Rita, of course that's fair!"" 

She did not reply to this message, and I feel I'm being penalised for putting my future at the top of my priority list in this situation. The rest of the group is not contributing for Rita's portion of the hen, and I know this for a fact. Please bear in mind I am already contributing £100 for the hen materials on top of my part. I don't feel I'm being treated fairly and I just want an outside opinion. To me this is not about a weekend or a holiday or several nights out, it's about my future.

How to deal with people that dislike you and refuse you to join their project group. We need to do a project for class. All the 4 groups in my class either said they are already full and already started the project ( most likely an excuse) the projectgroup should consist of 4-6 people. Most of the groups in our class have 5 people. There are 2 groups with 4 people. They also rejected me. 

I persisted more with this 1 group of 4 people. 1 guy from those 4 people doesnt seem to mind if i join the group but the other 3 all do. They say they need agreement from all the group members and they try to avoid conversation with me. I sat next to 2 of these people and told them about that 1 guy that agreed for me to join and that i await the approval of them 2. 1 Guy replied hes busy ( they were on pc typing in office word). I persisted and need to know their answer asap. Guy told me to be quiet. I said “ i notice you are being hostile towards me, how come ? “ he replied “ ofcourse i am! You are persisting when i told you i am busy!” ( this is obviously an excuse because he fears to truly say what he feels)

53,"**TL;DR**
24 never a girlfriend or been kissed still a virgin never a date No attractive women like me only unattractive obese women like me and that's who people tell me to learn to settle for i hate my life cause of it

5 dating sites and never has an attractive or decent looking woman matched or message me only unattractive obese women or unattractive women do. 

When I go to bars and clubs I get rejected and ignored every time I cant win. 

The women i try for and who i want to attract are Ria Ciuffo from Barstool Sports attractive. 

I get told to aim for girls as unattractive and fat as the girl from youtube Christine Syldelko. 

Big difference in what i try for and what people tell me to get used to aiming for instead of offering advice that would help me attract women as good looking as Ria. 

And if any of my friends saw me dating a fat ugly girl they'd either laugh at me or worse think we're a good match saying I'm as bad looking and as much a loser as her. And if any of the women who rejected me saw me with a fat ugly girl I'd be looking for a bus to hit me. 

To give more context into what people read

 NO I do not hate women.  who I hate are the guys who women choose because the guys who women choose are always the type who have always picked on me and bullied me and then they rub it in my face on how they were able to get the girl I try for


**TL;DR**
Here's a list of all my experiences
1st Friendzone/Rejection ""**SARA**""

The girl i tried for in high school (24) but who friendzoned me is getting married to a scumbag piece of shit. (21) who cheated on her with a teacher She started dating him when me and her were seniors and he was a freshman he was caught sexting a teacher caught on the news and now the girl I want is marrying him and A TEACHER HERSELF 

and now everybody is happy that they're getting married it's like I'm living in the Twilight Zone that people forget that he cheated on her with the teacher and got caught on the news. And the only type of women who like me or unattractive and obese so when it rains it pours. i hate my life and i hate her fiance. 


AND THEN 2nd Friendzone/Rejection "" **ASHLEY** ""

**TL;DR**

Girl i love has a boyfriend and she's in love with him and it depresses me beyond comprehension that she loves him and she will never love me. I'm absolutely fucking depressed. 

Everybody else wants them to get married except me, i fucking hate her boyfriend he ruined my life. I asked girls on here if he's better looking than me and they all said yes he was and theyd rather date him than me. Can anybody give me advice thats beneficial for me? Not advice that only benefits her boyfriend, cause reality is if you say ""If you really love her youd be happy for her"" or ""move on"", that has no benefits for me it only benefits her bitchboy punkass boyfriend.


And again to recap she doesn't love me she loves him nobody feels bad for me because everybody else wants these two to be married already and the only type of girls who like me or unattractive obese girls so I don't get a bright side or a silver lining or happy ending that benefits me all of those is a losing situation for me or I end up with either nothing or what doesn't make up for what I lost out on. 


I told her I love her she rejected me then a week later she had me meet with her only so she can set me up with her fat ugly friend

3rd Friendzone/Rejection **ALEX**

My high school prom date whose a family friend and who i had a crush on for years, she made out with another guy in front of me and fucked him in his car and because she stayed at my place she invited him over to make out with him on MY DRIVEWAY.

Alright. Bit of backstory. Met 7 months ago in college, he was a part time prof for art. We hit it off amazingly, our world views matched up, interests, way of thought. I graduated. We went out to tea, then again a month later for coffee (both times chatted an hour). Since I really enjoy him, I asked him “want to go on a sushi date?” And with no hesitation he said yes. I waited a couple weeks and then wrote him “still interested in that sushi with me?;)” and his reply confused me so much

This was this response. I don’t know what it means: 

“Hi there!Sorry as you know I am unreliable for meeting but with good reason, I am busier than ever and that's good. As for meeting up I will ask you to wait and maintain our present good nature, I have appreciated our conversations so much but I cannot lead into more than that. I will look forward to being in touch and keeping up with your exciting active life :)”

I have no idea what to make of it, but I think it’s a nice way of saying I never want to see you again. What to you guys think, am I right?

We moved to the U.S when I was 14, and I still smoked with him until 6 months ago, when my girlfriend found out I smoked.  

She told me that she wanted me to quit since her grandfather had lung cancer from smoking, and that she loved me too much.

Tonight, i heated it up and started eating. I was just sitting on my couch, eating and wathching tv. Now, keep in mind, my cat is always laying down on my couch. She's older and just wants to lay down all day, she only gets up to feed and use her litter box.


I finished my chicken, and moved to my soup. I took 2 bites, before my grandmother starting hollering for me because her tv messed up. I left my soup alone, i didn't cover it with a napkin or put the lid back on it. I didn't even think my cat would eat it. I honestly forgot she was even there.


Not even 5 minutes, i come back, and i see my cat with her face buried in the Styrofoam cup, just slurping away. My 15 dollar soup. Was eaten by my cat. Because i'm so stupid and didn't think to cover it.


I guess she was displeased with dollar store brand cat food and took revenge by stealing my soup. I don't get it, i fed her this morning, i let her out and watched her kill and eat 2 birds in my yard today. She's had plenty to eat today, but she still steals my soup.


Note: I'm not actually mad at her. It's my fault for leaving it out. Because i didn't think she'd get it. Because i should know that cats will eat anything they see that's edible.

67,"My dad just wished me goodnight and went into his and his girlfriend’s bedroom. He doesn’t know I am heartbroken about his lifestyle and feel nothing but pity for him.

There is no narrative in my story, I just needed to write something to collect myself.

TL;DR: We were a happy family until my dad cheated on my mom. From that moment his life went downhill and now he is just an empty shell of a person living with nothing to live for.



I was born on the ruins of the Soviet Union in August 1993. My mom quit college to marry my dad and had me shortly after. They were madly in love with one another.

The 90s were tough times: there was no government to care for people, and everyone was on their own. My parents had to leave me with my dad’s parents and moved to the city to try and make money.

I grew up as a curious boy. I liked riding my bicycle and watching ants carry stuff. We lived on the outskirts of the village and there were no other kids to play with. But I was never bored.

I was friends with our cow. Her name was Martha and she was very smart. I was deeply shaken when my grandparents had to have her killed, so we could have something to eat.

I had a dog. His name was Snezhok (‘Snowball’). He was always happy. But one day he disappeared. My grandpa found his body a few days later. He got bitten to death by tramp dogs.

My mom and dad had my little brother when I was five. I only saw him when they visited us one or twice a year.

I didn’t go to kindergarten as there was none. I went to school when I was seven. One day I peed my pants at school because I was too shy to ask if I could go out.

Once I tried to impress my parents and did a ‘fashion show’. I put on granma’s skirt as if it was a dress. My dad didn’t like it and I can still remember the bitterness I felt when he told me to take ‘the dress’ off. 


By the time I was eight, my dad and mom had saved up enough money to bring me and my dad’s parents to the city. Now we were a family of six. My dad had a stable job. My mom was doing alright too.

I enjoyed going to school. I liked Math, English and the Russian Literature. I loved (still do) my little brother and helped him whenever I could. Everything was good.

When I turned 12, my parents transfered to a ‘school for gifted children’, where I had to stay 5 days a week. I didn’t like it there. I never connected with other boys except one. We became best friends but his family moved to another city and the frienship ended.

My dad cheated on my mom when I was 13. My grandma brought me to his mistress’s house and had a quarrel with my dad in front of me. After a series of big fights and several months apart, my parents got back together.

But I never really recovered. I escaped reality by reading fantasy and scifi. My favourite books were the Lord of the Rings and the Lucky Star series by Azimov.

I was 15 when my dad cheated on my mom for the second time. My mom took my little brother and left. My dad left too and went on to live with his new mistress. I stayed and lived with my grandparents.

They were okay to live with but they had no idea what was going on with me. They never understood that I had no father figure (which later caused sexuality and gender identity issues but I am fine now).


Today I have an amazing girlfriend and a job that I love. I never felt as confident as I do now. I am more honest with myself than I ever was but I am not sure how I should feel about my dad living an empty meaningless life.

Right now I am visiting him. This is the old house where all six of us used to live but it is barely recognizable. It doesn’t look like a place where people live. It is cold in here and I think I can hear insects.

Why was I so happy? Why is it something that I subconsciously desire? My first experience was awful. I was 18. I was raped. He never wanted anything to do with it when he found out. Accused me of getting pregnant on purpose when he was the one that raped me in the first place. 

I was alone and depressed my entire pregnancy. I was alone in the delivery room with the nursrs and drs. No family. No boyfriend or husband. I was numb to emotion wheb i birthed that baby. But I still loved him. I still do. 

The first week home I was actually super happy and content. My life finally had meaning and purpose. But then the influence of my family took over. They told me I wasnt ever going to be able to provide him with a good life. They convinced me to move out of state and I will have him again one day. 

Then they convinced me it was never going to work. They took advantage of my deranged, scared, and vulnerable post partum depressjo. And I signed those papers. 

He will be 5 in november. And i havent seen him since his 3rd birthday. He is so handsome and perfect.

71,"My first real boyfriend and long-time friend died of cancer. We broke up years ago because we were doing different things in life and live on opposite side of the country, but I always considered him a close friend. He was a little quirky, but a genuinely good person, which I believe as I get older is all I might really hope for in a partner.

I was sad when I heard he developed cancer, but being the person he was, he never expressed a lot of remorse or frustration over it. I thought it was something he would pull through.

I learned about his death at work. I stepped out of the building at lunch and cried. I’ve had older people I know die before, but when someone your own age dies, a seemingly more fundamental part of your world is ripped away.

A new coworker saw me crying and sat down with me. I’m thankful for that. Sometimes you need someone to share your sadness with.",20Sep2018,2

73," 

Im 17 and today i had an encounter while on a bus from from school that was on my mind the whole day. Two weeks ago a friendly girl didnt have where to sit so she asked me for a seat(this is where all the seat encounters usually end). Then she introduced herself and complimented my shirt.

Today she asks me for a seat again in a pretty friendly way. Right after she sits im looking through the window and from the corner of my eye see her looking at me, so i turn my head and look her directly in the eyes. She smiles, i also smile and that was it. I put on my headphones like usual and not a word spoken.

What do you think about this because i dont what i think or feel about it. She seems like a very extroverted person and im definitly an introvert.",20Sep2018,3

76,"Long story. Gonna try to shorten it as much as possible. 

I’m a 19 year old and for money I buy high end phones (iPhone 8+&amp;X, Note 9) dirt cheap and sell them a little below retail brand new. Normally, In a month I could either lose or make money. 

Well, on one particular iPhone X I got ripped off. The phone was locked to a carrier while I was told it was fully unlocked. 

At first I was really disappointed but got over it. It happens more than you’d think. 

A few months ago my person disappeared so I kinda slowed down by a lot. I’ve been trying to join the marines so I had to buy running shoes cuz We so a lot of running at PT 

My cash flow had completely stopped and I needed money to buy the shoes so I had to sell my personal iPhone X. I had a spare android galaxy s8+ and I used it. 

After a few months I had given up on trying to get another iPhone X for myself. Yesterday I was cleaning out my room because I finally got a ship date to leave to boot camp and I found the iPhone X I had been ripped off on. I tried it once again and I was able to actually get it. But it was still locked. 

So now, I’m using the iPhone X without service but so I can use it I have my androids hotspot on my iPhone lmao 

TL;DR

I use an android I’m forced to use as a portable hotspot for an iPhone X I’m unable to put service on (apple fanboy) ",20Sep2018,0
78,"I’m not sure if this is the right sub... but Sometimes I think I like to make him angry on purpose. When he gets angry, I find him so sexy. I want him to grab me and throw me down and fuck me. 
But he doesn’t. He gets angry and stays upset with me, and it’s hurting our relationship. 
I need to get over this, but I’m not sure how. Is this just me? Am I crazy? (Probably)",20Sep2018,1
79,"Hey everyone, 

So I finally did it! I made my first YouTube video and I couldn’t be more excited. I have talked about, dreamed about, and planned on  creating a channel for YEARS but goals without execution are useless so I finally put the time and effort into it. This is my first video so the editing and sound aren’t the best but I got it done the best I could. Anyway, I say all of this to say: as long as you have a passion and the drive to do something, it can be done. I have one of my favorite quotes, ""hard work always beats talent when talent doesn't work hard"" framed. A person can be doing something for fifty years and someone else with five years experience can surpass that person because of their work ethic and attitude. don't ever go out of your way to tell another person what they can or can't do and if you're on the receiving end, don't allow anyone to dim your light. Even if there are a million people doing what you are doing or what you want to do, always keep in mind that no one has your spirit and you’re you for a reason. Your will to win, your attitude, and personality matter and contrary to popular belief there's room for everyone to win so go out there and do whatever you’ve set your mind to!

83,"I don't know about anyone else but I feel the system we use is not designed for our growing aging population we now spend even longer alive. Living in situations that require additional aid that if you dont have family for is going to cost money. 

Sure we are living longer but it does not seem that the longer period is during the years you can survive well on your own. and due to this I fear at some point we are going to run into a situation where the super invested into the market is less then the payouts being used by the aging population and I have no idea what could even offset that if we earn more money to invest more the cost of living will just get higher to pay those wages. if we reduce wages and the cost of living the people at the bottom will suffer or perish while we wait for the economy to normalise to the new average disposable income. 

so I am just stuck with these thoughts to vent and no idea how to change anything.",20Sep2018,6
