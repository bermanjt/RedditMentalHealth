1,"I came out today. I was low key terrified, but I took over Jeremiah's friend Eli, who has kind of bullied me in the past (calling me stupid, kicking me, etc) but he's now nice because to me because I completely broke down in tears a day before. I told him and he brought Jeremiah over and told him to be supportive of me. Jeremiah is a popular jock who switches between being a dick and being really nice. A few other kids came with me. I told them I was coming out as bisexual and that's why I have been dropping totally subtle hints like the following:

Not shutting up about glam rock like David Bowie and Marilyn Manson (no offense to David Bowie and Marilyn Manson, they are fabulous)

Wearing makeup

Saying ""YAAAAS KWEEN"" and ""SLAY"" in a gay accent

Only one person knew before this, the edgelord friend. After all, he is a bisexual drag queen who can deepthroat and likes Marilyn Manson. Anyways, Jeremiah was really nice to me about it. He said ""Okay, cool"". This is especially good because he's Christian. He did agree that I was stereotypical but I didn't mind. It's just a fact.",16Feb2018,3

9,"Yeah, this is another history about friendzone cuz there's definetly not enough of these. 
So, I've met this girl at the start of 2017. At start I didnt really gave a fuck about her, but she started talking to me, we became friends and next thing I know, she's my crush. 
 Well, if high school taught me anything was ""let the girl know what you're looking for, or else you're in for a bad time"". So, at my first opportunity I made my moves on her. It may not have been a great idea to be completely wasted at the time but screw it. Obviously, she said no, but i dealt with that pretty well, i was only looking for a quick hook-up so i didnt really care. She was still my friend and every now and then I would make this flirty dumb jokes, just to make her know that i was still totally down for it.
Well, the time passes by, we become closer. She stop seeing me as a friend, and now sees me as her *best friend*. I stop seeing her as crush and totally fall in love with her. In high school I was pretty much the president of friendzone, and getting into college, I promised myself that i was done with that shit, but in the first year I end up like this. In my defense, I tried really hard not to but you cant control your heart (or some shit like that). Even though I was in love with her, I was totally in denial. I only accepted that, when i saw her kissing this guy at a party and I got totally devasted. I got drunk the next day and sent her a fucking 5 minute audio message.
Anyway, I live in Brazil and we have this anual weekly festival called Carnaval where basically the whole country is partying like crazy. Think of Mardi Gras but way crazier. Yeah, and my city is pretty much the capital of this thing. She lives in the neighborhood where most of the celebrations take place, so every night after the parties were over, I went down to her place and we would just talk a little bit, until i took a uber home. On the last day i did that, but we just talked our way into the next day morning and while I sat there, watching her in her improvised pajamas, making us sandwishes I realized that I might have actually found the love of my life. I know I'm just 18 and I havent lived much yet, but I've never felt this for anyone ever. Thoses hours in her house were probally the best of this year. We kind of talked about what was going on, she said that her best girlfriend thought that was really not cool of her hooking up with that guy in front of me, we talked about how her last male ""best"" friendships ended (most of them in a bad way and I promised we will not end up hating each othee), and we finally talked about how there's no way of what is going on between us end well: she sees me as best friend, I see her as the girl that I love and sooner or later we'll both end frustrated. But you know what? I dont give a fuck of how sad i'll get when this is over, because i'm loving each moment of it. I love her so much, that the fact that she doesnt see me that way doesnt even bothers me that much.
 I was planing to write this post as a way of asking for advice, but fuck it. I know what I have to do: distance myself from her to protect my feelings. Yeah, I should do that, but thats not happening in a million years because i fucking love every second that i spend with her.
We know that this is not going to end well, we know that we'll get hurt but we also are dumb as fuck so, yeah, that's it.
Thanks for your time.",16Feb2018,1

11,"I am a 25 year old male with a stable life, a job, etc. I'm not boring and I can attract women. What I do lack is a strong enough sense of self to remain myself when I become involved with a woman. When I am single, I know who I am and I see it clearly. I have unique aspirations and desires, and I can voice them with specifics. I can easily value things, activities, and experiences. And I have chased and achieved multiple dreams.


But it seems like I give up all that when I start to date someone.


When I date someone, I want to know that person in detail, every detail. I don't want them to leave anything out, even the horrible things. I want to understand what makes them tick, how to make them happy, how to properly communicate to them clearly, in an empathetic way that shows I care about them and want them to achieve their dreams as well. And historically, this is intoxicating for both the woman I am dating and, even more so, for me. I lose myself in this. Every single time.


I start choosing to attach myself to my girlfriend's desires, to her pleasures, her pains. I feel them and I anticipate them as much as I can. This is intoxicating for me. I love to live through **other** people whom I can clearly understand, especially people who have a strong sense of self that is unbending. I find a security in that, because it is what I lack - at least when interacting with other people.


It is almost like I **want** people to manipulate me. I have had several relationships and friendships with that dynamic. I love so much to find out who **they** are that I change myself to suit them - but not at first. When I first become involved with someone, I am myself. And by myself I am a genuinely likable person. I have unique and interesting experiences to talk about, and tons of stories to share. I have good, deep, and complex ideas that people find interesting. And I have skills and creativity. And I am gentle and caring. And then when I start learning the other person, all of that fades and I become duller and duller trying to satiate that person.


I think this is because I have never felt good enough.


When someone likes me or loves me I feel validated, and that is the feeling that I chase so hard that I lose my self. I want to be wanted. That is my most basic desire. That is why I work so hard to be interesting and fun when I'm alone. I do end up intrinsically enjoying a lot of the things I do when I'm alone. However, since on a base level I do these things in an effort to be wanted, they fade when I find that I **am** wanted.


I don't **want** people. I want the feeling they give me, the sense of purpose they give me. It's like I don't have the ability to generate purpose in anything on my own. I lost that a long time ago.


In January 2017 I was going to kill myself because my abusive relationship had just ended, I had graduated college and was bored without a job, and living with my parents. I had no feelings to stop me. Although my own desire for not committing suicide wasn't really there, I couldn't give myself a reason *not* to do it. My reason for not killing myself came from the fact that my family wants me. They love me. So I was able to stave off suicide for a while. I came up with desires of my own - because they wanted me. I followed my dreams and accomplished two of them over the past year because my family wanted me. I worked tirelessly on those dreams, but I wouldn't have done that in a vacuum. I did it because they pushed me to, indirectly, by wanting me not to kill myself.


This January I was so happy. I was in a relationship where I felt the happiest I had been in so long. That relationship lasted two months. The abusive relationship last December also lasted about two months. When that relationship ended, I felt completely crushed and depressed, beyond anything that a reasonable person would feel, because those people wanted me. And therefore they gave me goals. When a relationship of mine ends, I have no more goals. That is why even a two-month relationship can be so damaging. I can lose myself in **TWO FUCKING MONTHS**. It's beyond infuriating. It ends the relationships in itself, because my girlfriend ends up losing interest in me because I am no longer the person she met and was so attracted to. And I can feel it, because I will have learned what it feels like to be wanted by her. And then I end up finding out what it is to **not** be wanted by her, and it hurts me to the bone. I cannot stomach it. I can deal with rejection by someone whom I don't know - it's no big deal. But when I have known someone and put effort into them, and they end up rejecting me, it's an existential slap in the face. I cannot deal with it. I spend days at a time lying in bed numb and purposeless.


I am not scared to be alone. I am scared to be unwanted. I am scared to make other people feel unwanted, for fear that they will stop wanting me. And I've never really confronted how serious of a problem this is until now, but when I take a clear look at my history, it's a fear so bad that it ruins me.


I am going to change this. That is what **I** want - me. My successes and my failures will be my own, and not someone else's.",16Feb2018,8
12,"Dear 21-Year-Old Me,

I am writing you this letter because of the inspiration from an older me to tell present me to give younger me mentor ship. (Multi-time line theory. You will understand a zeal of what that it is later in life.) I want to give you advice with warning and hope. For the sake of not changing your future. I will NOT go in to specific details and specific road blocks, because I am an older you and I know ""US,"" you will avoid those road blocks like the plague. These check points will ultimately define who you are, and the advice I give will be beneficial in making sure you do not repeat the same problems over and over and over and over again.

The Sooner You Take Responsibility The Better.

Yea, I know you do not know why. But you will soon. You're on top of the world. I remember that feeling. You are in route to have everything you ever desired. Be grateful. Be prepared. Do NOT become arrogant. Sit down, Be humble (Again, this will make sense in due time.) Remember you favorite biblical parable concerning the Pot Maker. You are not only the pot maker but both the pot maker and the pot. As counter intuitive as that may seem, remember the pot maker makes the pot and the pot represents him. So, a flaw in the pot also represents flaw in the pot maker.

You have so much potential and so much pride.  Yet, you have not tasted defeat and that is dangerous. Because of this you do not know how to handle the responsibility of success that will come with failing. You have a mentality of opposition to failure and what it ultimately represents. This is a major downward spiral. You do not look inward for the answers, you look outward. You blame other people, objects, entities, etc. for your situation, yet YOU ARE TO BLAME. When you come to grips that only YOU have the power and ability to control how your actions control your future, you will be empowered more than you know. THE SOONER THE BETTER.

You have a stubbornness towards trusting leadership. ALL leadership. This manifest itself even in benefiting from the advice of mentors. I wish I could be your mentor and guide you step by step but even though I am you and you are me, I know you must do it your way. Since you must be who you are, read everything you can on leadership, personal power, personal development, autobiographies of your heroes, etc. These genres of books are most beneficial for pushing you over the ""hump"" to begin trusting others of authority. The other books you read are ok, however they will not help you as much as you think.

Look, we both know why you lack the trust for taking advice from leaders. Just because all the tough questions you had on various subjects were only answered when you researched them and not from the ""leaders"" who you trusted, DOES NOT mean you have ALL the answers. You will need help. Someone to talk too. Someone more experienced in your trajectory to teach you the more efficient way. Again, THE SOONER you Learn this THE BETTER.

Despite It ALL YOU WILL BE OK.

So.... at this point you are close to tuning me out. That is fine because at this point, I know the destination at least 10 years from now you will take if you do not listen. You didn't turn out to bad. Through much determination and perseverance, you accomplished quite a bit although you won't believe so. You WILL be married with a beautiful child. You WILL have a college degree (the degree will shock the hell out of you). You WILL be a budding business owner and entrepreneur. You WILL have the capacity to give back. You WILL be ok.
I HOPE this is helpful..... I HOPE this benefits you...... I HOPE you will take my advice and speed up the process. If not, at least you know you will survive.

Sincerely from YR 31,

Brandon Boyd

25,"Throwaway because some people know my main acc. , and I don’t want them to find out about all this...

I don’t know how to describe my state of mind right now. Mentally and emotionally fucked up, maybe, if that’s something. Yeah, that’d be close to what I am feeling.

So, lemme introduce myself. I am 17, a guy, and am really bad in social situations. Like, super awkward, and anxious, and clumsy and all. I have had some mental health issues in the past, but let’s not dwell into that. Oh, and after those issues (it lasted for almost a year), I have changed considerably. Become more of an introvert, and also become kinda emotional.

Last year, I met this girl. She was my classmate, but we didn’t know each other till our midterm exams. We became friends. It was a strange experience for me, being friends with a girl, but surprisingly, I felt good with her. It was all really strange, but things turned out just perfect. We became friends, and got super close. In a couple of months, we were best friends. We used to talk for long hours on text, and share little things about our lives. It was a great feeling, to be friends with someone who understood you, and didn’t judge you. We had a special bond of friendship. She was really supportive to me during my tough times.

One night, we were texting each other, and she told me she had a boyfriend. It hit me hard. I didn’t expect it to have that sort of impact on me. I felt a bit hurt, and maybe, thats when I realised, I loved her. But what could I do? Nothing. I told her I was happy for her (which I was. She’s my best friend, remember? ) i was happy for her, but sad for myself.

Over time, our friendship grew deeper and deeper. Many of our classmates thoughtt tat we were dating, or in a relationship or something. She didn’t mind it at all, and would just smile, if someone teased us together. Deep inside, I wished that she and I would really be in a relationship. But I didn’t want to do anything to hurt her, so I kept quiet. And we would often laugh it out.

Fast forward to 13 Feb 2018. It was our farewell party at school. . Kinda like prom, but without the dates and all. We would just hang out, have dinner, dance, click photos, and stuff. Earlier, I used to think, that, maybe on our last day of school, the emotions will force out of me, and maybe, I might declare my feelings for her. But I just could not do it. We had a fun night, we clicked many photos, but it just didn’t feel enough. I know this sounds cheesy, but I wished the night lasted forever, endlessly, so that I could be with her, just a little longer. I wish we had taken more photos, I wish we had talked more, I wish that she’d see my emotions, and just understand how I feel about her, and what she means to me. After that, even if she said no, I would be happy, because I would be able to express, what she was ro me. None of that happened. Oh, and I forgot to mention, 13 Feb was our friendversary... we became friends on 13 Feb last year. I know that date, because of some weird things that happened that day. To think that exactly one year after we became friends, we might probably be seeing each other for the last time, it broke me. 
For the first time in months, I cried. I got home, told everyone I was tired, locked myself in my room, and cried. And I couldn’t sleep that night. I just wanted to spend a little more time with her. 

Since then, she is always on my mind, sounds crazy, yeah. I have been trying to get those feelings of my head, but they just won’t go. I tried that before too, and it didn’t work. I tried things like, watching movies, comedies, sci-fi, action, stuff to get my head off those thoughts, but they wouldn’t go. Its as if I am finding it difficult to let her go, because she meant so much to me. I knew that a day would come, when I part ways woth her, but I just didn’t want it to come so soon. Every minute, I miss her more and more. 

Sorry, this just got too long. I tried to let out my emotions, maybe it might work. But it doesn’t feel like it. I don’t know",16Feb2018,3

As the title suggests I would like to know what you guys would do in a situation such as this:

A reliable dealer you’ve been buying acid from for about a year now texts you and let’s you know he has mushrooms. 
You’re excited because they’re a rare commodity, so you ask him how much he has and how much for them all.

Dealer: $280 Nd that’s all I got, so I don’t really want to do that.

You: I’ll pay you $300 for them all.

Dealer: Bet

So you set a meet time and meet. The transaction is fluid, as it always is, and you go on your way. After opening the bag, your senses are alarmed. You decide to upload pics to r/shrooms and r/shroomid and the consensus is that they’re not magic at all, but dried oyster mushrooms. You text the dealer and he’s playing dumb, and he says he’ll talk to HIS dealer and get HIS money back before he pays you back the $250 you asked for. Because you’re a nice guy and ate an 8th of nothing for nothing, $250 sits more than well for you.

42,"tl;dr: my mom becomes disgusted by my intent to pierce myself and it adds to past feelings.

Last Wednesday I told my mom that I want to do a Prince Albert piercing (NSFW). She made a face of disgust and told that it hurts so I can't do it, oh not there! It can become infected and that can kill me. Kept saying that I need to love myself more, I don't need to do it to impress no one and that I need to go back to therapy. I answered that I'm 25, doing it for myself and that she sounds overly conservative. She sustained herself on the medical concern, that I should keep studying until forget it, also, that I'm a lovely boy but there is some things I do that she doesn't like. To cut the chase and cease the disagreement, I told that wouldn't do it anymore but the last phrase kept floating in my head: she was talking about my bisexuality? I've grown up listening to her casually say that she don't get bi people and that they're just perverts. When I came out to her and my brother last year, her first reaction was to make me swear to not get sick, then she doubted me because I've never slept with a men, then she invalidated my identification because I shouldn't rotulate myself bi to feel part of a group, that I should keep it a secret to not disappoint my grampa and, lastly, she made me swear that I'll never crossdress because she feels offended with it (even if never though about it, I'm in peace with my cis gender).

I agree that it's a health risk that I initially took for granted because I have a congenital hearth disease (although without symptoms or limitations) and infections can possibly reach my heart, possibly killing me. I need to ask the piercing professional and my cardiologist about the real risks first. I also agree that it's time and money burdensome to take a appointment, buy the medicine (if needed), go to the shop and get the job done for a family with a cancer patient (my grandfather). But why she needs to be with such lack of touch? It isn't the first time that I fell powerless and *with the wrong feelings* when I disagree with her and I'm beginning to consider cut the details of my life to her. Don't get me wrong. I love my mother and I'm thankful for all that she done for us. She wants to be part of my life and I also want it, but it seems really hard for her to take the tone down and understand that, just because I still depend on her, I don't need to replicate her ideals and aesthetics.

That wasn't the first time she made something like that. When my brother stands his ground about a political or social topic, she snaps and disqualifies his view because he lacks life experiences, or because she saw someone or read something in the abstract past or simply because she pays the bills. I've saw so many times things get heated up and heard so many times that *'you need to get out and earn your money to keep thinking like that'* kind of answer that i'm afraid to speak up my thoughts most of times. I must also confess that it were some exceptions and when I spoke with her about my feelings and her reactive attitude she reacted mild, but I must wait her light moods every time? I'm just tired of it.",16Feb2018,0
44,"Started a job almost 8 years ago, I was young, naive and had never been subjected to a narcissist / monster before, didn't even know what the word meant.
Thinks started off ok, I licked the Monsters ass, he was my boss, done what he said on got on with my life.
I was the type of person who thought of people that behaved like this sad, and was just glad I wasn't like that myself.
After years of the mental abuse, it started to affect me, my personality. If I was happy about something he put me down and made me feel like an idiot, if I was telling a sad/crazy story he would say ""you don't have anything positive to say"", always full of doom and gloom.
I didn't recognise what was going on, he needed to take other people's self esteem to fuel his own. He threw looks, ignored me for no reasons that I could identify, and made me feel like a piece of shit, like I was crazy and had a bad personality.
I was very good at my job. In the 6 years I worked for him the only complaint he ever said to me about my work was that my desk was messy. 
One day I couldn't take anymore, I went in and ask him if he just wanted me to leave, and if he said yes I would. He said no, and made out as if I was imagining all of the abuse.
He lied to me and told me people were saying bad things about me. I found out a long time after that he didn't. I actually got him stung pretty bad on that one when I finally said something to HR. 
He gave me a promotion. Promised that if I took the job I would get help. I found out I was pregnant, and demanded the help that he promised, and he denied all knowledge, and then landed more work on my lap that was never my responsibility, but he said it was so it meant to was because he was my boss.
I was forced to give the job to someone else (mentally by myself, I literally couldn't take anymore stress, I was going to lose the baby, I was suicidal at this point). He made me sign a contract to say I was incapable of doing the work. I signed it because I had 6 months of work until I never had to go back again.
He hired someone to help the replacement THE NEXT DAY

The reason I didn't leave at this point is because I was getting my house. Sick leave was at his discretion, so no hope of me doing that. And no doubt he would tell the bank that if they rang for a reference for the mortgage. One woman in my job had cancer and was out 2 weeks and he didn't pay her.
The day I decided to never go back was the day my depression went. I had 6 months, I got my confidence back and just started to be annoyingly professional and nice to him until I left. 
I was earning 27k at the time for a job I could have been earning a lot more. Made feel like I wasn't worthy of anything better. It took me 4 years to go a 1k pay rise (the company was sold for billions the same year).
Everyone in every other department was on good money, I worked in finance, I saw it all.
The reason for this was because he wanted to have the best financially functioning department, because he was the FD, so he oppressed us all and made us feel like that's all we were worth.

While I was on maternity leave he was pushed out. I have never in my life been so happy about anything. I could go back to work.
I forgot to mention that the people I work with were like my family, the same people that he tried to turn us all against each other (he said other stuff to them trying to create a bitchy environment that wasn't there).  One thing he was good at was hiring nice normal people.

It's been 15 months, doubled my salary. I've receive a promotion, SIX pay increases I never even asked for, and I'm happy again after being so miserable for so long. My new boss is great.

I still regret not leaving in the beginning before the damage was done. It never goes away. 
I'm happy now I stuck it out, but I will never get those years back. Or ever get that person I was back fully.
Now when I look back it's all so clear, it wasn't then.

If anyone reading this is in the same position, get out now. You will never change them. You are not the problem, you are probably not the only one. Whatever fear they have injected into you. It's not real, and if it is, it's not worth the mental torture.
Everyone needs to learn what a narcissist is, how they behave and how to deal with them.

45,"I'm currently a freshmen in college, and dropped my physics major in for a computer science major. I started college with pressure from my family members and high school teachers to pursue a major in physics. After A few weeks, I lost motivation in the subject. Not because it was hard, but because i looked back at my high school path, and everything my family and teachers did was guide me towards the physics major instead of seeing what I wanted. I've decided that this is my life and I'm going to pursue something that I found to be better suited for me. I have to explain to most of my friends and family now that I am my own person and i can make my own choices. A few of my family members who have graduated college are physics majors, and I'm hoping they can be happy for me choosing this path in computer science.",16Feb2018,27
46,"TL;DR I was/am probably a sociopath, but became, because of religion, a superficially good, loving and caring person. Now I’ve realized (again) that I can’t really feel love or care about other people and that this new personality is a lie. I don’t know who I am. 

I don’t even know how to begin, so that all of this will make sense.

For all of my life, I’ve been an odd person. In childhood I was rather aggressive towards other children and tortured animals. 
In my teenage years I actively manipulated my friends, said and done things I knew would hurt them or even scar them for life.  I did not feel remorse, I even took some sick kind of pleasure out of this. I knew *something* was wrong with me. I knew the things I’d done were terrible. But it made me feel very good.  

I stumbled upon the term of sociopathy and I could relate to it. I didn’t think about it further though and let it slide, although most traits apply to me. 

Some time later I became (and still am) very religious. First I was exclusively satanist, but now just pagan. It helped me, kinda. It even made me, as weird as it sounds, more normal and “good”:

I’ve tried helping people, being genuinely nice to them and “loving” them, so I would be a better human and go to heaven (I don’t believe in heaven, but I don’t want to go into detail about what my afterlife looks like, so I’m just calling it that).

I’ve become pretty happy, but I was exploited fairly quickly by everyone. Everyone now wanted help without giving anything in return. That made me unhappy, angry and frustrated and I started questioning myself:

“why am I doing this?”, “Is this really who I am?”, “Why am I allowing others to abuse me?” and so on. It seemed like I had completely lost myself on this spiritual journey and was now someone else. 

As dumb as it sounds, at that time (yesterday) I was really into “Rick and Morty” and “Evil Morty” somehow came to mind. He could be called a sociopath. And then I remembered how I was in the past and that *that* is *me*. 
This “enlightened “ thing is not me. The sociopath is me.  That’s the point where I snapped. 

Three years of devoted worshiping and spiritual journey just felt so wrong suddenly, but being a sociopath felt kinda wrong, too. Then, i *truly* reflected on myself and my religion:

Do I even love anyone? -No, when thinking about the people closest to me, I can feel excitement at best, but normally just *void*. On further contemplation, I don’t even know what love feels like. 
Why do I even want to be enlightened? -I want to have an easier life and more success by making people happy, so they’ll think highly of me and depend on me. I don’t *really* care if they are happy.
Do I still believe?-Yes, very much so. I “love” my gods to the best of my ability and would rather die than loose them, but I’ll seriously need to think some stuff over. 

Conclusion:

My life is a lie. I’ve manipulated *myself* and almost committed suicide on a psychological level, by loosing my ways and trying to be someone I am not. Now, I don’t know what to do. Should I further live a lie or be my true self? I don’t feel like helping and “loving” people anymore, but being, well, *me* is super scary, because admitting to not have empathy or love and therefore acknowledging the *void* inside me is fucking horrible. 

I am still pretty unclear about who I am. I just don’t know. Any ideas/insight/arguments are greatly welcome.  I just need some outside opinion on this.

47,"I had just been discharged from a psychiatric hospital after 3 weeks, and everything seemed fine. I was happy to be out of that place mainly because of frustration with the incompetence and disingenuousness of the staff however ideally I probably should have stayed there longer. Until I was in my room and and things just started falling apart, I came down to my mum and just told her I feel really really really low. We went into my sister bedroom (who is at university) to talk, and I started crying uncontrollably. After a while I started hyperventilating, I couldn't catch my breathe and I was very light headed, my whole body was shaking and I couldn't sit/stand/lay down still. I was really nauseous, and then suddenly a MASSIVE surge of panic. It FELT like there was this man in the house RUNNING at me to kill me. Like a mix between the zombies in I Am Legend and that burnt guy from Sunshine. I started screaming, I could FEEL his presence, I could fucking FEEL HIM. I ran under my sister's desk and was screaming for my mum to help me. She didn't know what was going on and she was kept trying to calm me down saying there was nobody in the house, then I got out from under the desk and took my shirt off, ran to the landing and screamed 'TAKE ME' because in that moment I remember just wanting this man to kill me, I couldn't handle it anymore, I wanted him to come and kill me. Then I dropped to the floor in the corner and my mum was trying to calm me, and all of a sudden her fucking face kept glitching into his face!!!!!!! Man, this was fucking terrifying, fucking fucking fucking terrifying, she kept reaching out to try and calm me but it looked like it was the man trying to grab me, so I ran to the bathroom and locked myself in. I recked everything, and then I opened the window and was sat half-way outside looking down wanting to jump, I climbed all the way out and was ready to jump to get away but I was scared this man was going to catch me at the bottom. I don't know how long I was in the bathroom but my mum called the ambulance and I just remember my legs were like JELLY so I sat down and was rocking back and fourth with a towel around me still not being able to catch my breathe.. After however long, what felt like a few minutes but was probably a bit longer, I calmed down and came out, then the ambulance arrived and we went to the hospital, but after waiting 2 hours and them saying it would take another 4 hours to see somebody, considering I was already calm, we just decided to go home. 



Fuck man. Fuck. Still can't get the image of my mum's face glitching into this man and fuck man that was just so fucking terrifying... FUCK. FUCK FUCK FUCK. My antidepressants should kick in within the next week or two so hopefully shit gets better man. F u c k.",16Feb2018,5

50,"And I've tried most every one I found. So here's another.

I'm stuck in a physical rehab hospital at the moment with some healing wounds. Physically speaking, I'm on the upswing. Mentally, not so much.

Depression and loneliness have long since set in and I'm trying to reach out for friends to hang on to some semblance of sanity.

I love animals, rock music, Snicker bars, traveling, sci-fi, wrestling, reading and despite being a shy, closed off introvert, I love making friends out of like minded people.

I'm working on getting published as a writer if I can make a June deadline of finishing a first draft of my current project.

I've been hospitalized now for going on two years. It all started with Necrotizing Faciitis, a freak flesh eating virus that nearly killed me.

And on that note, get to know me?",16Feb2018,1
51,"Facing down. Devices on. Sad and angry fearful bowed. Old people and the broken stumble and fall while children laugh and wiggle and skip and giggle. Mom is on her phone and the ads blast out from every angle as sleek metallic coaches speed along spewing filth upon us all. The children breathe the foul pollution and then all wonder why cancer grows every where. Are we the cause or is it the Tao that would allow the destruction of the earth? Tough guys lumber along speaking loudly glaring at my bow. All with plastic cups in their hands many smoking tobacco while healing plants and fungi are forbidden by those who profit from the slime. It envelops our being and seeps into our minds creating deep addiction that lowers us and puts us into the ground. While the military marches proudly with there weapons of mass destruction the poor are defiled while children die as the slime balls profit from the very bullets that destroy us. But fear not. This is the work of the Tao or of God. It is meant to be. God made it happen and if you dare to question God your eyes will be gouged from your face and your tongue ripped from your mouth as the noose tightens around your neck and you burn forever in hell. Or raise your heads up, awaken, realize perfection and live forever in heaven. You have the choice dear friends. Wake the fuck up. ",16Feb2018,2
53,"Hey Self,

In the last couple of months I’ve experienced some significant trauma in relation to suicide. 
Probable PTSD, now on top of that I’m getting a divorce from my partner of ten years. Married 3.
We have a son who is almost two.
Mentally I’ve never been so down in my life.
 I have good support but the person I thought I’d be married to for the rest of my life isn’t going to be there. He has already moved on and I’m still trying to deal with previous trauma let alone getting a divorce. It’s messy and I don’t seem to be able to see the sunshine through the clouds. I’m under huge amounts of financial stress also. So I’m selling some loved assets to get through. 
How do I heal without being bitter and angry and full of hate. 

Thanks in advance",16Feb2018,5
54,"I am talking about hard perimeters here. Like courthouses, for example. Are our children, and school employees, less worthy of protection than the people in courthouses? Expensive? Do we really want to measure the safety of our children in dollars? Are we like Ford Motor deciding that it was cheaper to let people burn and die than to correct a known safety hazard with the Pinto? Do we really want to lay out tens of billions of dollars for a wall between us and Mexico more than we want to protect our kids? I watched a school official on tv last night proudly announcing some porous safety precautions in the works (no actual dates mentioned, of course) for a large school system, while equally proudly ""reassuring"" the public that this did not mean hard perimeters were being planned. Yes, she actually said that. I am glad I don't have kids to send off to school.",16Feb2018,0

56,"https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/7w78qa/sitting_in_a_hotel_room_in_hawaii_with_a_wife/

So i left off after our 4th day of vacation and having gone out on my own and having had a pretty good time solo. 

I returned to the hotel room and she asked me to drop her off at a different hike, Koko head. Koko head is 1/4 as long as the Haiku stairs but is also straight up. 

I dropped her off and picked her up 3 hours later, and she told me she had barely made the climb. There was no way she would have been able to complete the Haiku stairs hike. 

We ate some dinner, and spent the night apart.

The next day we got up and it was almost as if nothing had happened. We spent the day exploring together, but not as a couple, more as if we were just sharing a car. Before going to bed  we agreed to get up before sunrise and hike the Lanakai pillboxes to take sunrise pics over Lanakai beach.

I woke at 530 and tried to get her up, but no luck. by 6:15 i know we are running out of time, sunrise is 7:04. She rolls over and says she wants sex. I got pissed. We made plans to hike at sunrise and I was going regardless not to mention I didnt feel like doing anything with her after her behavior. She began yelling at me telling me again she was going to divorce when we got home and I packed my stuff and went to the car. As I was pulling out she jumped in. I took her to the trailhead, dropped her off and went to the beach instead where I got awesome pics of the sunrise. 

I picked her up afterwards and we spent the day exploring again without talking. 

We've been home 3 days now and She is acting like nothing ever happened except for one thing:

I told her that in 1 years time I would be moving back to Hawaii permanently after paying off some things here and she asked me if she was allowed to come. I told her I wasnt sure if I wanted that. Im so sick of dealing with her mood swings and poor behavior. 

Im definitely taking the dog. ",16Feb2018,1
