0,"It's pretty constant. I feel like at least once a month, usually more often than not, some random person I don't know makes mention of me being gay or asks me directly. On top of that, along with the fact that it obviously annoys me, people I know will constantly say it. One of my 'friends' will make a ""joke"" about it, like ""you're gay"", ""come out already"" etc, and I'll try to divert, ignore or talk back to it, but no matter what I say it always ends up that, ""whatever dude you're gay"".


I get so damn annoyed about it that I don't know how to react anymore. Ignore it, and people keep saying it until they're like ""oh so you're just gonna be mad?"", which is the same outcome if I actually seriously say ""why do you have to make a thing about it?"". It's always a ""joke"". I'm always the one making a big deal. If I actually get mad about it, I'm an asshole. If I talk shit back to lighten the mood, I either just get back the same shit(which honestly is rude, but when I mention that, remember it's a ""joke""), or I ""go to far"".",14Mar2018,23
1,"I have to give four presentations about four totally different topics next week. I've been practicing them every night for the past week.  I will keep practicing them until I have to give them.  

I've been told by many people that I give excellent presentations and that I make it look so easy.  I think it shocks people that I can be so eloquent under pressure since I am so mush-mouthed in regular conversation.  My normal speech is so cluttered and disorganized that I don't enjoy talking to people, so I don't do a lot of idle chitchat.  Sometimes I suffer from low self-esteem because of my communication issues.  So it feels awesome when I get kudos after a talk.  I remember those kudos every time I feel down about myself.

Maybe that's why I push myself to give so many talks.

3,"Dear neighbor, thank you so much for informing me today, during our brief encounter, that I am fat. Never, in all my years, had I realized that. Before you conveyed to me this new information about myself, I had believed that all reflective surfaces in my home were defective. ""It's but a trick of the light"", thought I whenever I looked myself in the mirror and saw a fat man staring back. The fact that regular-sized clothes don't fit me had also completely eluded me. I was going through life believing myself a thin man, unaware of my own fatness. So it was most fortunate that you today pointed out to me, very matter-of-factly and apropos of nothing, that I am, indeed, fat. Thank you, kind lady, for opening my eyes and providing this valuable insight into myself.  I will be forever in your debt.",14Mar2018,372

Some days I feel like everything is fine and other days I feel like utter crap. I have no idea what I want and I don’t know this feeling.

11,"I saw a truly ancient thread in AskReddit, and I really wanted to answer the question: “What is it like to be you?” This is what I wrote. Fair warning, it's a long one.

I am, at heart, an explorer. I love just setting off with no map and no direction and just seeing where I end up. I love taking some time to admire what I find on the way. To see what it relates to. To see what it means. And then moving on.

Just last weekend I wandered through a park, then through another that connected to it, then through another, all following under these great big power lines which seemed to stretch across half the city, and through a whole variety of neighbourhoods and walks of life. After which I came to this pristine, unassuming building that was open to the public but that almost no one seemed to use, except a couple academic sorts tucked away in the records area that probably thought I looked like some sort of vandal who wandered in off some backstreet. From there I visited the biggest mall in the city, found some new books and games that I thought looked interesting, and had lunch in a food court.

When I had first set out, I was only making a trip to the post office.

It's not that the day was *more fun* than most, it just felt *effortless*, in a way I really like.

But even more than physical places, I like exploring ideas. I like learning new things, understanding stuff, forming models, seeing what fits together, etc. For me, a new idea is just the same as exploring a new place. I like finding the same relations, and meanings, and new vistas. I like imagining what's possible, and trying to predict what will happen. It doesn't bother me that I'm not physically surrounded by the thing I found in a book, or a game, or a video, or a conversation; if anything I find it more engaging because you have to really use your mind to 'see' it.

I can get *so* excited about the stuff that grabs my attention. But that's not always a good thing.

Ever since I can remember I have been able to out-talk anyone's desire to listen, about anything I really care about. It's like, I can see how something fits together, in a way that's been right in front of my face, only I hadn't noticed, and in hindsight it seems so simple, so elegant, that the answer is kind-of awe-inspiring, and I can see where the answer will lead, and what sort of futures it could hold, and they feel so real to me, but there's also this sense that there are paths here I haven't walked yet, and I really want to find them, just to see what else could be out there.

Basically, I'm having a good time. And like anyone else, I want to share that good time with others.

But when I go to explain the thing that I'm enjoying to someone else, all they hear is an endless string of details. Or stuff they don't care about. Or stuff that makes no sense. They tell me to stop; they don't want to hear about it. And that's alright. That makes sense. I'm used to it.

But it's not alright. I'm *so* used to it. I've got this learned distrust that other people would care about anything I find interesting. Which makes it very hard to really feel I relate to them. And I limit my behaviour, so as not to be annoying, but that just makes me feel more distant.

The killer part is that I don't even need someone to keep pace with the idea the entire way. I wouldn't even want someone who constantly challenged what I was saying and shot down half-formed possibilities. All I'm really looking for is someone to share the fact that I'm happy with, and who might be happy that I'm happy. (And not be disingenuous or belittling about it either.)

I don't know how much of a role that played, but there was a time I wasn't very happy in my life. Things weren't working out. I didn't have a lot of friends. I was under a lot of stress. I felt like a failure. Blah. Blah. Blah. It's been a long time since then. I've learned a lot. It doesn't hold me down like it used to.

But I feel like I'm different for having been there. I have strong beliefs: in the importance of not burying how you feel, in a person's right to choose what to do with their own life, in the value of having the determination to pick yourself back up and keep fighting, etc. And at the same time, I'm comfortable talking about stuff that makes other people *react*. I can't stand the “gentle flower” approach of endlessly coddling someone as if a stray word could break them. I can't stand the “harsh love” approach of ignoring the difficulty of someone's struggle and the importance of their feelings. I can't stand the defeatist, resigned attitude of so many people who come on hard times.

I'm concerned that other people will judge me for these beliefs if I speak too openly when they come up. I'm even more concerned how people will react if I bring up what I've been through. I don't want pity. I'm not looking for attention. And it would be really annoying to have to talk down and comfort anyone who got freaked out and concerned for me and wanted to make sure I had help and support and check in on me and stuff. I don't need that. I can handle it. I'm pretty damn good at it at this point.

But it would be really nice to just have someone understand what it was like.

So yea, now I don't expect most people to understand my joy *or* my pain. Which makes relating to people, or finding any sense of belonging somewhere, really hard to find. Don't get me wrong, I get along with most people I meet, and there are a bunch of people I see regularly. It's just this nagging feeling like something's missing.

And of course, real life has to interrupt at some point. Recently, I'm reaching the end of my course and I've been applying for internships. It's been a pretty demanding course and I've often felt drained. I fully expect any position I get to be much the same. I'm not saying that it's terrible or wrong. There's just something about a routine so rigid and limited and consumed by productivity that always leaves me feeling spent. I should be putting together more applications right now, but I'm taking the time to write this instead, to avoid burnout on what I need to get done tomorrow. And there is *always* some sort of “should” like that.

I sort of resent it. But at the same time I genuinely want what I'm working towards. For all my lollygagging, I have dreams and ambitions I want out of life. This is the way to get them. And even if I was offered all of the money I needed, a part of me likes the challenge. It's what I learn and improve myself to overcome. I just wish it left me more time and energy (and less stress) with which to enjoy the rest of life.

And so, for a large part of my life these days, I feel like I'm in some sort of limbo, caught between that desire to wander off after some stray thought, my often-pained determination to make something of myself and my life, and the quiet longing in the back of my mind for people I could share it all with.

So that's what it's like to be me.

And if you're looking for some sort of closure or “ever after” sentence, don't hold your breath. My life ain't over yet.

12,"I suppose I was never clinically depressed, or even dysthymic. I'm definitely anxiety-prone. Some days I find that I struggle to find pleasure in anything at all, though I still manage to go through the motions and keep up the facade. Some days I'm just hit with such despair that I wanna cease existing. 


It's almost always related to romantic attachments and feelings of self-worth. I've read the book ""Attached"" by Amir Levine. It helps. I still struggle with it nearly every day. Some days I think I'll never meet the right person for me. I don't know, I'm working on being happy alone. But it seems that I consistently need a romantic attachment figure and it aint healthy.


I've come a really long way - my sleep used to be messed up, sleeping at either 5am or crashing at 8pm, never finding the time to exercise. I now sleep at regular hours and work out regularly. I still slip up and binge every now and then, but I'm working on it.


I sucked it up and went to see a therapist. She gave me a list of ""cognitive distortions"" that perpetuate my negative feelings. A bit of googling brought up the book ""Feeling Good"".

13,"He fucking stole my Apple TV and my jacket. I am so upset. This happened yesterday afternoon when  I left to get some groceries. I came back and he was gone, so I went to put on music and my Apple TV wasn't there. Just found out he took my jacket now.

I say trusted because he owed me $140 before he went to jail and I came home to an envlope with $140 slid under my door which was really nice, so without hesitation I said he could stay here until he figures his shit out, he was here for 3 days.

19,"I was just thinking of one of the best days in my teaching career. 

Every year we did family career presentations and I had a father call and ask if he could bow out of his time slot. He explained he worked as a custodian in a factory and didn’t want his daughter to be embarrassed in front of her friends. 

I told him not to worry about it in the slightest and we’d do whatever his daughter was most comfortable with. 

So long story short his daughter was mortified at the idea of nobody coming in for career day (these were eight and nine year olds, for reference), so the father came in, supremely anxious about the whole ordeal. 

His daughter is asked to come up and introduce her father and his job. This is what she says:

“My Daddy is a cleaner at a manufacturing plant where they have huuuuuugggggeeeee machines and carts with sirens you can ride around in. It’s really hard and you have to be able to do all kinds of different stuff but that’s why you get paid so big and I could get a new bike and a Barbie dream castle for my birthday. 

It’s really difficult and it makes him super tired and you work with tons of chemicals so it’s super important to be really good at science and not just anybody could do it, but my dad can do it.” 

We ask parents to do a little activity with the kids if they can, so he brought in a big piece metal coated in grime and outside showed the kids how to power wash it clean. Everybody got a turn, and they were mesmerized. They all begged him not to leave. 

When it was over I sent the class inside and he didn’t follow us inside, I thought maybe he went straight to his car (we give all the parents a card signed by the class and a little gift after their presentation, so I wanted to catch him) 

And he was standing in the parking lot, crying with joy telling his wife how proud his daughter was of him. 

Best day of that year. ",14Mar2018,9

I don't really know how to say it, but I feel like I was molested when I was younger. Let me give some background. I lived with my mom for the first six years of my life, and in all that, she had many boyfriends which included convicts. One even raped her in my home while my brother and I watched cartoons in the next room. Anyways, ever since I can remember, maybe age four, I have know what sex and sexuality were. I would even pretend my barbies had sex and would know what all that stuff was. I would write in my diary about sexual things and stuff like that. Apparently one time I had told my dad that someone tickled me in my private area at a young age too. Flash forward to today, I have random moments where I feel absolutely disgusted with my body and feel ashamed. I have a fiancé, and whenever he does anything affectionate in public, I freak out, my heart starts racing, and I'm on the verge of tears. I have no idea what's wrong with me. Sometimes I wonder if maybe I was molested at a young age and that's how I knew about sexual things, and how it still mentally affects me. I don't know though, and I don't want to claim ""I've been molested"". But I would love to hear advice with how to deal with these feelings, or maybe just hear from someone who can relate. I also don't know how to talk about this to my SO. I feel stupid for feeling this way especially if I could be completely wrong.

23,"I’m new to reddit, and I figured this would be a good place to let this out. Although advice would be greatly appreciated, my main point here is to express some thoughts and get some things out. 
I’ve been dating my girlfriend for months now, and we’ve grown extremely close and have a strong relationship. There’s no doubt that I love her and that she loves me.
I for one, am not particularly religious, I mean I think I believe in a god, but I don’t particularly follow a set religion. My girlfriend has similar viewpoints to me, but they seem to shift a little more. However, she comes from a pretty strict religious family who thinks she belongs to their religion, which I will keep undisclosed.
Her parents do not want her to date outside of her race or religion, which again, will remain undisclosed. They have flat out said they would not support her if she were to do so. I belong to neither her family’s race nor religion. Therefore our relationship has been kept a secret the entire time.
I honestly can’t understand this and it’s rooted in supremacy. The underlying philosophy of every religion is love and compassion for others— of any background. I feel like as parents, you should support your child in any aspect (so long as they aren’t doing seriously awful things, obviously), and as a religious person, you should support unity and different religions coming together for a common good.
If you truly love someone, their ethnic or religious background should not play a negative factor. If anything, it is a positive thing that leads to more cultural diffusion and unity.
As for now, my girlfriend and I are happy together but there is always the thought lurking in the back of our heads about her parents. I keep a positive outlook most of the time, but sometimes it isn’t so easy.  I hope our future ultimately results in happiness.

A while.
since before the trip, he said. nobody knew, he said
my heart sank.
I am a bad person?
what is a bad person?
I'm an ass, yes. 
but a bad person?
I couldn't sleep. I went for a smoke.
I couldn't move on. i couldn't pretend. It wasn't fine. It's not fine. I'm not fine.
A day ago I told her I'm done. A day ago i stopped pretending. it's not fair, I said, to either of us, I said. we should stop talking, I said.
I wanted to say more. I wanted to get emotional. but there was no point. There was nothing more to say.
It seemed like the best thing to do at the time. I needed to do it. I wanted to do it.
I'm fine. it's fine.
I'm a somewhat mature dude. I'm emotionally a child. It's always like this. just friends. not in that way. 
Am I a bad person? Did I overreact? I want someone, somewhere, to be straight with me.",14Mar2018,8
44,"Some background on me; (18f) I’m pretty quiet and to myself. Starting June of last year I finally started to make friends. I have really bad anxiety. I’m constantly thinking the world is out to get me or it’s just the worst place to be. I’ve been bullied most of my life, betrayed and abused by people I’ve put my trust in. (if you can’t tell I’m pessimistic) 

I recently made a connection with my now best friend S(19f)  (best friend because I’m with her the most.) She’s constantly talking about herself, her boyfriend, her family, what’s she’s been doing or what she wants to do. I already know you attract what YOU are in other people. So I’m guessing I have a part of me that’s narcissistic. I’ve been working on it, and for the most part I think I’m doing well. 

Where I start questioning this friendship is around New Years going into ‘18. We were at a warehouse rave, and she stared flirting with this guy(20m). After it was over he started following us home. We got into a fight because I stared having panic attacks over the course of two hours because she thought it was funny he was following us, and she kept telling me she didn’t feel bad about him so I needed to stop being anxious. ~ to get home we had to get on the same train so I couldn’t just leave ~

Then the guy starts making fun of my anxiety and asking about my mental health issues and if I’ve tried killing myself and if I haven’t why didn’t it work? She thought the whole thing was funny and my anxiety was just stupid and I needed to stop complaining. 

Fast forward to now. She’s broken up with him, and is on her third boyfriend this year. I’m thinking I should talk to her because I’m really starting to resent her, and lose respect for her. She still hasn’t apologized or addressed any of the situations in which I was completely disregarded because she wanted to have fun with a guy (that wasn’t the only time I’ve had anxiety attacks or literally cried in front of her because she’s trying to have sex or get attention from a guy.) 

Im literally clueless on this. Am I just a shitty person, am I the selfish one? I just want her to consider what I’m going through and not just disregard me. I always accommodate her. And when I bring these things up she always had a explanation like “I don’t understand anxiety, I didn’t notice, you didn’t say anything, ok well you did ____ so??”  But then I think she must actually care about me because she gets me gifts all the time and always invites me out with her. 

I’ve talked to her about this, told her I don’t like it, and she HAS changed. But in a small way. She’s so bubbly and always happy. Everyone likes her. So no one sees why we could have issues in our relationship. I’m starting to wonder if I’m just jealous. I’m already dealing with depression but this makes it worse

47,"I'm a 25 year old woman and unfortunately live with my mom and grandma. They're very “traditional” and tend to be overprotective. The one and only time I had a guy pick me up at my house, they got mad at me for not bringing him in and introducing him. This was my first time hanging out with this guy outside of work, and he was not my boyfriend or even a close friend and I honestly think that's an odd thing to immediately do. I don't want to introduce anybody until I'm ready, and sure they're going to be a regular part of my life. But my family thinks I'm disrespectful and rude, and they're pretty much saying I can't go on a date or hang out with anybody without asking for permission and letting them “screen” them beforehand to decide if they're suitable. I think that's ridiculous as an adult woman living in the 21st century, and it suggests I have no good sense or discretion about who I choose to hangout with. And now I am genuinely afraid of ever telling them who I'm hanging out with or letting anybody pick me up at my house, and would prefer to lie because they refuse to respect my boundaries. Are they being unreasonable or am I? Do you think it's weird to introduce someone to your family the first time you're hanging out? 

And yes, before you say it I know all my problems would be solved if I just moved out. I'm working on, that but it might take a while and I don't think I should just put my life on hold.

48,"This was an extreme reaction turned habit after an online friend of mine's brother committed suicide due to false rape accusation. I think this was around 10 years ago where Facebook was still new and most of the chat is base on forums.  

It traumatize the teenage me that I embrace Islam precautionary step to avoid false accusation. Not because of my love and believe but more on the precautionary steps suggested in Islam. 

A bit of history 1st, all of these guidelines are precursor for a punishment in Islam, which is capital punishment for rapist as outline in the Quran and Hadith.  

So, the guidelines. 

Number 1, Never touch a female outside from family and necessary skin contact (doctors, etc)

Number 2, don't stay in the room with an opposite gender. Only 2 people in the room. 

Number 3, Hover hands, no touching. 

Number 4, Sex, wait until you married. (I failed this one)

Number 5, Respect women. Remember one of the most honored human being to you is your mother. 

Number 6, Watch what you say and what you post. 

Number 7, Have a male group as your support system. 

Number 8, Avoid intoxication and drugs. A conscious mind should always be responsible and alert of their own action. 

Basically that's it. Considering I'm not Muslim nor look like one, these behavior were accepted as wisdom by my friends, family and coworkers. 

I worked so hard to get where I am, I'm not willing to be back stab by a bitch who want my position or lack of attention.

50,"I've been in college for 3 years. It's not that high school was that great of a time in my life; in fact I was fairly lonely and unhappy throughout most of it. But it was the last time that my life felt really cohesive; it was centered around the same location and the same people with a common goal and a set timeline. Now I'm just drifting.

I have my phone camera roll from high school saved on my computer. I organized it for each of the four years. I've been making collages with it as gotten into the habit of just poring over it sometimes for hours while listening to a playlist of songs that remind me of every major event from my high school days. I've written summaries, synopses, and analysis of my high school experience because in my mind it's like an epic coming-of-age story. But what do I have to show for it now that I've come of age?

I wish that I could focus more on the present and on my future, but only my past seems to give me any meaning ",14Mar2018,6
51,"I didn't knew where to post this so you guys are the chosen ones.

Well, that's it. I'm obsessed with germs. It started like a year ago. Now it's too much to handle, and I want to stop being obsessed but I can't.
 A few things that are fucking with my life:

• bus rides: I can't get the bus because I feel that sitting will make me get full of other peoples germs, and if I have to take the bus, as soon as I get home I put a laundry with my clothes and take a shower.

• school: too much. I might be using a whole hand cleaning bottle every week. I feel supergross about sitting on the chairs or touching the tables. My mom can't handle the amount of laundries so I have to suffer and wear the same pants for 2 or even 3 days.

• ""the spray"": I made a spray with water and deep cleaning alcohol and as soon as I get home I spray my clothes with it if I can't immediately wash them.

• other people: I've always been someone who loves hugs and contact. Now it stresses me at incredible levels. After I hug someone I feel super gross and can't stop thinking about it until I get home and wash my clothes.

•my room: it smells like deep cleaning alcohol. It's all totally clean because I'm always cleaning it. I try not to get out of my room.

• my house: I reclean it myself. I live with other people and as soon as I need to use something I clean it. I clean the shower every morning before my shower and the toilet every time before I have to use it.

• laundries: my washing machine can't handle more and my mom told me not to put a lot of laundries, so I have to suffer a lot.



And that's a little summary of it. I can't live like this but I can't stop.

52,"Had my first depressive episode at 16 and told my parents about it, I was greeted with love and compassion, before that we were really disfunctional, now we are much much better but we still don't talk that much. I started taking meds and the depression disappeared, life was good and pretty nice.

Now I'm 19, taking a gap year, working part time until I get to university and pretty fucking isolated, which is why I'm depressed. I have a bunch of friends but we rarely ever meet because they all have boyfriends/girlfriends and a real life. I don't want to tell my parents, but they can really sense that I'm feeling like crap, since I spend most of my time isolated in my room. I only want to subtly tell them that we should spend more time together without sounding desperate. I want to have a wholesome family but somehow we are all too embarrased or shy to really communicate what we want ",14Mar2018,9

62,"I’ve posted about this situation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/80hc77/update_im_planning_on_telling_my_best_friend_how/) before, if anyone wants to know the details.

Basically today we hung out all day and I just realised I can’t do this anymore. Like every single minute around her all I could think about was all the shit I was leaving unsaid. I couldn’t just keep pretending I don’t feel all this shit towards her, and I couldn’t deal with being so close with her when I didn’t know how she felt. So I went home, typed up a message to her laying it all out, took about an hour to work up the courage to press send, and just went for it. I basically told her that I’ve liked her for a while, that I respect that she’s in a relationship but that I just had to be honest with her. I asked her if she thinks it’s best if we keep talking like normal or if we have some space, and went on to say I don’t want her to feel bad and regardless of all this she’s been an amazing friend to me.

She replied thanking me for telling her, and she said that while she feels insanely sad about it she feels like this complicates our friendship too much, and that her boyfriend has to be her number one priority, but she completely understands that I can’t help how I feel. She said she hasn’t really ever seen me that way, and that she thinks it’s maybe best if we both take a step back. I had no choice but to just agree, and tell her again not to feel bad about it cause it’s probably all for the best. She didn’t reply after that.

I feel kinda numb, like it’s not really sunk in yet, but holy shit that was rough. I mean maybe we’ll end up talking it through more when the dust settles or whatever, and maybe we’ll be friends again in the future, but god fucking damn man. I basically just lost my best friend. I shared every little mundane detail of my life with this girl, we messaged all day every day, we hung out all the time. I’ve never felt so damn close to anyone, and now I’ve fucked it all up with one message. I feel like I had to tell her eventually, and that this was all probably inevitable from the start, but it doesn’t make all this any less painful. I feel so damn stupid. I can’t really think straight yet man.

I just don’t know what to think. Regardless of this shit did I do the right thing? I do feel a bit of relief at least knowing things wouldn’t have worked out, but right now I just can’t see past having to get through the day without talking to her or whatever. I shared every little mundane detail with her man. She’s been an amazing friend. Like maybe the best I’ve ever had. Nobody’s ever just ‘got’ me so much. I’ve loved every single minute I’ve spent with her over the 2 years I’ve known her. And now that’s fucked. Life sucks sometimes man, and I feel like a bit of an asshole. I suppose there’s nothing I can do but move on day by day, but it’s gonna be fucking hard. She was the person that got me through the day more often than not. I just feel so shitty right now.
