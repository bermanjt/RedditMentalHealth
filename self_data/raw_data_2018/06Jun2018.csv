2,"so, i'm a pretty normal dude, i'm like everyone else.
i work, i pay bills, i go to the gym, i have fun.

i'm into one odd thing, and it's honestly not even that weird.
i love women with hairy pussies. 
not even ""hairy"" women, per-say; i just like an untamed bush. 

it's weird, but it's not insane, right?

but, i swear to god, it is immensely hard to find any quality porn where the girl has even a modicum of hair down there.
typically it's one of two extremes:

a wonderfully shot and produced porn video where both the male and female are completely hairless.

or,

a shitty, low quality video where the man is oddly hairless, yet the woman has more hair than a ukrainian plumber. 

now, i'm progressive, i can get behind girls with body hair!
but, the girls aren't even interested in the sexual activities that they're doing.

i just want to see or talk to a girl with a hairy pussy who is just as sexual and awesome as every other girl, but ironically, it doesn't seem like it's a reality. 

yet, it seems that there are porn videos upon porn videos of women taking pisses in the street.

how come piss is such a popular porn category, yet bush isn't?

i would imagine that pubic hair would be more involved with sexual attraction than urine would be.

damn.

i'm so horny. fuuuck

tl;dr: drunk, horny dude rants about porn and women",06Jun2018,0
4,There's some people that choose not to drink or smoke but still hangout with people that do or use it around them. Other people just brush it off as most people in the world get drunk or smoke weed sometimes. But when someone I am close to is drunk or high around me or I see that on Snapchat I get sick and have a feeling of hate towards them. I see them as really stupid and simply don't want to associate with them. I don't know why I think this way and it annoys the hell out of me because I just sit there and get pissed.  I don't want to join them but I want to be able to just accept what they are doing and realize it's fine. ,06Jun2018,1
5,"Hello Reddit


&amp;nbsp;
So recently I was dicking around the internet with mental health quizzes with a friend who is severely depressed. I always tease her in a light way because I (think) am a picture of perfect mental health: I am confident, have no anxiety, handle pressure very well, don‚Äôt get sad, and generally take a logical approach to everything I do. Needless to say I passed every test flawlessly while she fucked up about every one available (that‚Äôs an exaggeration) One that I took was a sociopath test, I answered it and lo-and-behold I‚Äôm a sociopath. Now I‚Äôm not one to question the validity of internet mental health quizzes, but needless to say I was a little sceptic about it. With further prodding into the rabbit‚Äôs hole that is internet health websites, I think I may actually be a sociopath. Allow me to explain:


&amp;nbsp;
I‚Äôll start at my childhood but I‚Äôll spare you the details. I grew up a privileged childhood with a stable family and kind parents. I have very few memories of my childhood but generally I was a good and smart kid who followed the rules. I also was a bit impulsive and quick to act out. This combined with a general antisocial behavior drew me away from people. This lasted a while until around middle school I decided I actually wanted to have friends. Being anti-social, I had to pick up social ticks from others and I grew quite adept at it. I changed a lot about myself, even the way I walked, to get others to like me. Saying this I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúconform to what other people wanted me to be‚Äù,  I just altered myself to become better in the eyes of my peers. I started exercising, eating healthy, all of that, and by freshman year of high school I was one of the smartest people in my grade and just about everyone liked me with a small group of close friends. 


&amp;nbsp;
Now I‚Äôm in my low 20‚Äôs and am still very much like that. People have a general proclivity to not only like me, but trust me. I am generally attractive and quite self confident. I also am kind of manipulative and I have a propensity to lie often (I often do so for the sake of others as well as myself, and I have never been caught lying or pushing people in a direction I want them to go). I like to think I am a generally good person and I am very protective of my close friends and family; however, I have little regard for those I don‚Äôt know too well. One more startling trait of mine is that I am almost entirely unable to feel sorrow or empathy. I noticed this around mid high school when my grandfather passed away (the first big negative event in my life that I can remember). I loved him deeply but I didn‚Äôt feel anything with his passing. I got frustrated because of this and felt like a bad person to a point where I actually tried to make myself feel sad about it to no avail. After that I realized just how strange it was that I didn‚Äôt really feel sorrow in recent years and empathy more so, and at the same time how good I was at faking both out of fear of being ostracized as cruel.


&amp;nbsp;
So back to present day. I am online and reading about common traits of ASPD (the disorder tied to Psychopaths and Sociopaths) and am astonished at how well it fits me. Traits of a sociopath include superficial charm, adept at lying, manipulative, lack of empathy, inability to feel a wide range of emotions and egocentrism, which all fit me almost too well. I don‚Äôt fit every category of ASPD, mainly the fact that I learn from my mistakes and am no longer an impulsive person, but past that having ASPD explains a lot about myself.


&amp;nbsp;
I am not one to take an online-based self diagnosis to heart, however I am pretty thoroughly convinced that I am a high functioning sociopath. The one person who knows about this is that one friend I mentioned earlier. I wouldn‚Äôt dream of telling my family about this. I also don‚Äôt plan on going to a psychiatrist as I don‚Äôt actually see anything wrong with me; I don‚Äôt hurt others or myself and I am very happy where I am for the most part. I am kind of annoyed though as any time I‚Äôll look up info on sociopathy 90% of the time it is ‚Äúhow to spot a sociopath‚Äù and ‚Äúhow to get out of a relationship with a sociopath‚Äù, and very little on actual advice for people who may be sociopaths.

7,"So I was talking with my Dad today and the conversation eventually led to me telling him I was coming home to see a friend. This is a friend who I have developed a romantic connection with, and the feeling is mutual. She does go to grad school in Virginia, which is an obvious issue, but can be overcome.

 When I told my dad he immediately started out telling me the issues with me being in a relationship with her. I understand that he wants what is best for me and had good intentions with what he said, but it sucks when I bring up something that i'm super excited about and he immediately says something like ""are you sure you are not just doing this because you are lonely"" It is good advice and certainly something I have to think about, but it took me prodding him to stop being negative to admit he was happy I has plans. I love my dad so much, and I always take his advice and counsel very seriously but i'm 24 years old and I think I know when I have a connection with someone that isn't just because I am lonely. He wonders why I don't talk to him about my love life. ",06Jun2018,0

11,"Let‚Äôs just clarify the title - I‚Äôm not your typical ‚Äúover privileged spoilt brat‚Äù only child. I grew up with just my Mum and under some tough times. But this little rant isn‚Äôt about my childhood, it‚Äôs about present day.

I married quite young into a this bigger family; my DH (28/M)  has a few younger brothers and one sister who‚Äôs 7 years younger. Only in recent years has his bond with his little sister become as strong as nails. I am ok with it because she is an amazing young lady and we get along well.

My problem is his approach to the relationship. We‚Äôve almost lived away from our home town two years now. Both of our families and friends miss us a ton! Our most frequent visitors up here are of course his sister and her partner. 

We are quite broke at the moment as have become a student - but the other night DH booked us flights home. We had to put them on credit (along with all the expenses of travelling still to come) his exact words were ‚Äúwe are spending all 6 nights with my sister - she‚Äôs all I care about and I don‚Äôt want you telling the others we are coming‚Äù we are not going down for any occasion, just to see her.

Last time we visited home it was chaos trying to see loved ones - so last time we spent 75% of our time with just his sister. It destroyed me and we had a marital war on our hands...

So this time he told me to pick one person I want to see the most - I chose my elderly Nanna who lives alone. He said ‚Äúok, my sister will drive us for a short visit‚Äù

Meanwhile my Mum who I miss won‚Äôt see me. My only friend I still have who hasn‚Äôt given up on me (yet) - won‚Äôt get to see me. And even his own family (parents, brother etc) won‚Äôt see us. 

It‚Äôs my issue because I don‚Äôt have the gonads to stick up for myself - and when I do I get ‚Äúyou‚Äôre an only child who doesn‚Äôt understand my love for my sister‚Äù just to add to my qualms, when he‚Äôs with his sister I don‚Äôt exist and he is border line a bit mean towards me.

I almost don‚Äôt want to go. I wish I could talk to my mum but it‚Äôll destroy her knowing I wasn‚Äôt going to tell her about the trip down.

I ride my longboard every once in a while, but not on a regular basis. I'll get super into it for maybe a week, then I hang it up and let it sit there for months without touching it. I got super into drawing for about a month, but I haven't drawn anything new in over a year, nor have I ever really made a genuine effort to get better. I haven't been skiing in years and cannot afford to continue that as a hobby (am a student). Disc golf is something I've never been super into, but I've played it a decent amount because I had a course right by my backyard as a kid. I don't even enjoy lifting weights but I force myself to do it because I'm vain. 

Basically all I do in my spare time is chill and watch movies while surfing Reddit. I used to party all the time and had a good social life, but I recently moved to a new state where I don't know people and can't really do any of that good stuff. 

I want to actually spend time with my hobbies and get better at them, and be a more interesting person, but bottom line is that usually I just don't feel like it. Unless I have a party to go to, all I wanna do is sit on my ass and be a waste of space. I want to want to do my hobbies, but I just don't.

17,"Before I start, I want to make it clear that I am not suicidal nor am I making any claim that suicide is a reasonable decision to make. I think I am just at a troubled point in my life and am searching for advice from people on the Internet because I don‚Äôt really have anyone else to go to. 

I am at a point in my life in which I cannot logically find any reason for wanting to be alive. As I am growing into my adulthood (I‚Äôm in my early 20s), I am finding that life isn‚Äôt really something that I enjoy. I am realizing that life is a series of obligations; I am obliged to do several things I simply don‚Äôt want to do: go to school/work, exercise regularly, eat well, etc. When I type it out, I feel like a whiny bitch, but in my head, these are all things I simply dread doing.

When I was a kid, I thought that the meaning of life was to find happiness. As I‚Äôm growing up, I‚Äôm realizing that the one thing that makes me happy is freedom from obligations. One of the worst feelings for me is that which is characterized by a need to do something I don‚Äôt want to do. ‚ÄúI need to wake up early for work,‚Äù ‚ÄúI need to spend 8 hours here,‚Äù ‚ÄúI need to work out after this,‚Äù ‚ÄúI need to eat healthy,‚Äù etc. I recognize that this is what being an adult is, that everyone has these responsibilities, but I cannot logically deduce why I am spending every day doing things I don‚Äôt want to do. 

Perhaps I am doing all these things to stay alive. But then, what‚Äôs the point of being alive if life is a series of unwanted obligations? Do I even want to be alive?

Again, I‚Äôm not suicidal. I‚Äôve just been stuck in my own thoughts and would like to hear the thoughts of others. Thanks for reading.",06Jun2018,2

I got to have a conversation with a girl in my Japanese class. We had to do a project on a person or fictional character of our choice.

It's nice to talk to someone who likes a thing that you also like. 

I also ate whatever I wanted and didn't track my calories. I ate all the unhealthy food I was craving and it felt great. But I do feel a bit sluggish from eating all that junk food.

I also went to my brothers band concert today.  When we got back home my brother and I ate cupcakes to celebrate my birthday. 

Whenever it's my birthday I also spend a bit of time reflecting on how I've changed as a person. It's interesting to see how I've changed as person. I'm in a better place now compared to a year ago but there's still a lot I need to work on.

But not like tonel wind, like air from an ac vent, what makes this weird is that the air is completely still, and the sound would raise to a faster tone periodically. I did hear a truck backing up, implying it could have been something like a dump truck but that sound was coming from another direction. It's 3 am so that would be strange for that to be the case.

28,"So, yesterday I fell asleep late after playing Death Road to Canada to 3AM (grab it on sale rn can‚Äôt recommend it enough), and afterwards a super weird dream ensued. I dreamt I was flying in an airplane, and the pilots were constantly talking into their mics so you could hear them the entire time. I had to go to the bathroom, so I excused myself to my friend, and then I went. Turns out the pilots knew, and commented on it. They didn‚Äôt want me to use the normal bathroom, but the secret Anime bathroom in the back of the plane. Attracted by the secret aspect and repulsed by the Anime aspect, I decided to go anyway. So the bathroom was literally in the back end of the plane, the walls were curved and I could see the backside of the engine/exhaust thing(?) that‚Äôs at the end of planes. Also, there was a bodypillow on the ground for some reason and the room had open, glassless windows where the air would just come through and a glass bottom, so I could see where we would fly while I shit. I also felt a light breeze out of the ‚Äûwindows‚Äú. Now, this bathroom was cool and such, but apparently it was also a prank-room for the pilots. They installed a shower directly over the toilet and sprayed me with it while I had to pee, then laughed about it. I went back to the cabin. I still wonder what in all heavens inspired this, or if it was just my lack of sleep.

34,"Don't need or want feedback on my writing style. This was a few years ago and I am not a good writer nor do I have any interest in improving. Just thought someone might find this interesting on today of all days. 

Seventy years ago on June 6th, 1944, over 150,000 Allied troops participated
in the invasion of Normandy. It was the largest naval invasion in history, and also
one of the most deadly. Being fans of American History and Saving Private Ryan,
while we were on vacation my family and I decided to take a tour of the beaches and
the American Cemetery. What we were able to witness was an experience that was
unlike anything we had ever seen.

We first took tours of Omaha Beach and Pointe du Hoc. Omaha Beach in 2015
is not a beach like we have in Delaware or the Jersey Shore. There is a cliff that runs
the length of the beach. There is sand where people should be tanning. There is an
ocean where people should be playing. Again, this is not a beach. Spread throughout
the sand are giant stone obstacles used to halt tanks. The sand, if you can call it that,
doesn&amp;#39;t actually feel like sand. Whether it is the blood and gunpowder from many
years ago or it just our minds racing, there is just something off about it. It doesn't
feel like it should. If a major battle hadn't happened there, it would have been one of
the most serene places in the world. To put it simply, the landscape is beautiful.
Magnificent cliffs and colorful houses line the beach. There is a giant cliff in the
distance that kids should be jumping from into the water. But instead of all the good
things it could have been, it is just a solemn patch of Earth that could be reminiscent
of hell.

Pointe du Hoc was another very eerie place to visit. You park your car, walk
about a half mile on a dirt path surrounded by trees and bushes, and then it hits you.
You exit the path and are welcomed by what was once a field, except now the field
has holes everywhere. As you walk along the path, there are craters in the ground
everywhere. Some are as small as a few feet deep, with others as big as fifteen feet
deep. Along this trail you also walk right by these giant concrete structures. The
majority of them around 20 feet wide and 10 feet tall. They all have gaping holes in
them that look like someone just punched through them. As we continue along this
dirt path, dodging holes in the ground and the concrete buildings above them, we
come to the end of the path. To the right is a full bunker that was left intact that you
can openly walk through. We go down a few steps into the ground and are staring at
a concrete wall. Only this wall had tiny holes splattered everywhere. In fact, the
entire bunker had these little holes no more than a centimeter wide everywhere.
There was a bedroom with bunkbeds that oddly enough remind me of sleepaway
camp, and then a large room that had a viewpoint of the entire beach. While the
bullet holes were still everywhere, we noticed that the ceiling of this large room had
scorch marks all over it. As we leave the bunker, we go down the other path that
leads to a small memorial overlooking the beach. Pointe du Hoc was situated
strategically above the rest of the beaches so that you can look down. Just like at
Omaha beach, the view is absolutely breathtaking. Just as it was used when it was
built, you can look around and just see beaches and beautiful scenery for miles in
both directions.

The last place we visited was the American Cemetery. It is unlike any
Cemetery I have ever been to or heard of. There are thousands of tombstones that
make the grounds look like a white field. Walking along the rows you can look down
and see a line of white Crosses and Stars of David. Literally thousands that are
perfectly lined up to the millimeter by row, column, and diagonally. Like most other
parts of this trip it is beyond sad, and as with the other parts of this trip there is a
beach right next to the cemetery. However this beach was different in that there
were people playing there. There were people sun tanning, kite surfing, and playing
in the water. You can literally be looking one way at a monument to American
sacrifice, and you can turn around and be looking a beautiful beach with kids
playing in the sand. Looking back on everything we saw, this last view was the
perfect analogy for everything we had witnessed. Dark and gloomy on one side,
bright and joyous on the other.",06Jun2018,10

My parents forced my family and I to move back to Pakistan 3 years ago because I was a ‚Äòrebellious‚Äô child and this is how they thought they could control me. I have lived in England from ten age of 6 to 17. I consider that my home. Anyway, since moving back there has been ups and down but I have experienced a lot of physical and verbal abuse from my parents. My mother is very dependent on my dad and will never go against him even tho he is extremely violent towards her as well. 
Recent events have made me want to leave home permanently, I have always had a very privileged life including here but that is how my parents compensate for how they treat me. Long story short I am 20 now, not at uni yet but I have applied to England and a few apprenticeships. I am trying to see if I will be considered as a home student otherwise I will not be able to go to uni there until later on. My parents want me to live life how they see fit which is killing me day by day. I don‚Äôt leave the house and I‚Äôm constantly down. They have extreme control over me and they‚Äôve specifically said I cannot leave the house until I get married. 
I am too westernised in my beliefs and what I want in life, I‚Äôm also not religious anymore. I‚Äôm giving my alevels currently and I will be done in a week. 
Can anyone advice me on what I should do to get the life I know o deserve. I have a British passport and a boyfriend and a few very close good friends waiting for me back in England. Is leaving the right thing to do? I love my family a lot and I‚Äôve tried to be how they want me to be but I can‚Äôt continue like this. Any advice would be much appreciated! 
I plan on sorting things out very quickly so I could use all the help I can get ",06Jun2018,1

43,"Today was my last full day of high school and I got on my bus for the very last time to go home. As I was getting off I told my driver it would be the last time ever being on and shook his hand. I‚Äôve had him as my driver since 6th grade and that was probably the last time I‚Äôll ever see him. Realizing I‚Äôm finally in the end now and leaving everything I know makes me want to cry. Hell I almost choked up saying goodbye to my driver. In a few months I‚Äôll be gone from the people I love and will be into the real world, with nobody I know. All I want is happiness and I hope that comes out of this",06Jun2018,70

47,"It's not necessarily that I want outright acceptance from every single person I encounter. I just don't know why I do this. I do it with my S.O. with my parents and friends. It drives me nuts, sometimes I find myself convincing myself that I want to do said things I don't even want to do just because people want me to. 

My closest friends and family have always said in the one thing that holds me back from achieving my own personal greatness. I wonder if they know that inside I feel like the only way to break free would be to disassociate from everyone I consider relatively close to me. 

Not to put the blame on them.. at all. I just feel like it would be easier to instead of break out of the shell I created of self restrictions..to just start brand new. 

Is this dumb? ",06Jun2018,3

51,"I remember reading something on the anxiety subreddit where it says that it can limit your overall achivments in life. I think I can safely say that that's true. I might fail beacause I struggle with talking to people.



Ive always been like this ever since I was a kid. I'm 21 and nothing other than my body has changed. I'm just did a presentation amd it wemt horrible.



I know most people here will say to simply get over it but I just can't. Or maybe I can but dont know how. I want to start drinking alcohol again in order to feel 'calm' but thats not an option right now tbh. As for seeking actual medical help, that's not an option at the moment. I can't afford it. Not really sure what else to say other than I hate myself a lot right now.

52,"This is gonna be quite a chaotic post I guess so I'll apologize to anyone who actually takes the effort to read this. It serves as a purpose to me to write my thoughts down and to vent. 

I've been seeing a girl for the past few weeks and I thought things were going great. We had dates, texted pretty much daily and it seemed we were hitting it off. She showed me a lot of signs of being interested so I really thought this could lead somewhere. Today, she suddenly took forever to respond to my text which made me already think something is wrong because she normally answers within minutes. And now she actually stopped responding alltogether and is ghosting me right now even though she was online several times, so I guess this is her way of showing she's not interested anymore. Sucks but that's just what modern dating is. Wish she would just be upfront about it because ghosting is like the worst you can do but whatever. 

But well how does that relate to the title? It's because this showed me how much I am emotionally invested in a girl I've been seeing only for a few weeks and how over\-emotional and over\-sensitive I am. This shit right now hurts like crazy, it makes me feel terrible and it seems like my whole happiness depended on her the last few weeks. What is wrong with me that I am like that? How the fuck can a girl make me fall this hard so early? This shouldn't be the case at all. I don't know what to do from here, I feel like texting her again asking if I did something wrong but that would probably be a mistake. ",06Jun2018,3

I just had a woman almost take out the front end of my vehicle because she wasn't paying attention and was speeding through a parking lot while on her phone. I pulled up beside the woman and politely said ""excuse me"" and waited for her to look up, which she did. I then said ""could you please put your phone down while driving? You almost took out the front end of my vehicle back there"".

Oh boy, that woman started going off on me saying that she didn't almost take out nothing, and that my fat ass needs to keep on going; fuck your mom; my black ass don't need to do shit; all the good stuff.

59,"My ""friend"" only talks about himself. He always tries to tell everyone how much better he is, no matter what. He has spread false accusations about me just so he can tell other people how much better he is. Whenever we argue he only listens to himself and suddenly decided he won the argument and after that if I don't agree with him he goes around telling people I'm the worst at admitting I'm wrong. 

Once in school some kid with anger issues pushed me in a wall and dragged me to the ground. I have a joint disease which was really really bad at the time and I moving was difficult. This ""friend"" would go on about how I was "" beat down"" and went around telling everyone. Later he laughed at how ""bad balance"" I had because of it and how bad I was at defending myself. I tried to tell him how the joint disease is affecting me and how it isn't really easy to defend oneself like that either when it's super slippery. Then he called me stupid for not punishing the guy. Over and over again. Whatever I said he didn't even listen and automatically responded ""you have to weird arguments"" and then said I cant admit I'm wrong. When I told him I have a serious joint disease he laughed and said ""wa you want me to feel sorry for you""? I just wanted him to understand... He used to be a decent friend but after this I don't consider him a friend.  

When we were at a tivoli a few weeks ago with the class, he told people I'm afraid of heights and bragged about how he isn't. I'm not afraid of heights. I never told him I am. He made that up to feel good about himself.   

What do I do? I have been trying to get rid of him for so long. But I can't. He doesn't understand. Whenever I fell him about the bad things he has been doing and get mad at him he just thinks I'm trying to offend him and walks away for a few hours. Then he comes back. I can't tell him I don't want to be his friend anymore. I can't do that mentally. Can't do that to him despite everything he did to me... Even if I wanted to I just can't. He probably would deny it and play it off to himself as a joke and I'd have to manage to do it again. Jesus fuck why is he like this. The fucker doesn't realize it himself. 

*Some rant: *
Got mad at me for not sharing my ice cream. How do one share an ice cream? He's not my girlfriend haha. He kept bringing up how he bought me a 50 cent pepsi once to make me come to the store with him. How nice he is for doing that and saying I never share with him. I share almost everytime I buy stuff... He doesn't even acknowledge it. So now I refuse and he gets really fucking mad. Then when I get mad at him for acting like this he says ""money ruins friendship"" like it's about the money... His sister once offered me and my friend a ride home after we were at his place. I thought it was super nice considering it was 2am. The guy got mad at his sister because she couldn't do it 2:30am and said she always ruins it. So fucking ungreatful. Lost his bag once, told everyone it was my fault. I'm so pissed, but no can't tell him. Not verbally at least. What do I do...",06Jun2018,2
60,"It‚Äôs so easy in the current media obsessed world we live in to expect a perfect life, and to feel that if our life isn‚Äôt 100% perfect then it‚Äôs bad. 

Life is bloody boring 85% of the time. Friendships even can be, perhaps meeting up with a group of friends at the pub, you‚Äôre sat there and you realise you‚Äôre really bored and would rather be at home. Or when you‚Äôre sat at home trying to find something decent to watch on youtube or whatever and bored out of your mind. 

It‚Äôs easy to conclude that your friendships are stale and that your life isn‚Äôt worth living and that everything is pointless. But that‚Äôs not true, it‚Äôs normal and it‚Äôs okay. 

If we would call remember that life isn‚Äôt one big party, that not every event has to be a blow out or that every waking minute must be amazing. Accept that life is mainly us all just bobbing along, with the occasional good time (and of course bad time) thrown into the mix. If we all remembered this and still managed to appreciate the small good times we do have I think we‚Äôd all my happier and more satisfied.

61,"I have struggled with anxiety and led a very closed off, unfulfilled life so far. I want to inspire people, challenge them, and relate to them. I think that as a barber/stylist I've had so many people in my chair tell inspiring and amazing stories, and now I am fired up enough, I want to be done and go out and live life. I started an Instagram and found my old friends all doing mind blowing things, I know how many obsicles they overcame and where they can from and I want to show everyone that they can do it to. I think inspiring myself and others by showing off people who overcame everything and then some would be a cool way to do it. 

I want to talk to people about how they got there, obsicles they over came, how they dealt with issues all people face. I want to talk about disabilities both mental and physical, religion, race, politics, death, loss, fear, failure, hate, and find people in every field, people who support and oppose hot issues. 

I know so many people that I could interview and have real human moments with and I think people out there want to connect and feel included and encouraged and I want to figure out how to do that. I don't have a camera, I don't get how to YouTube, but I just figured out Instagram, and I have a camera on my phone, and I got a new car so I can travel. I don't have much money but I can pay for gas and I don't have to pay for interviews just talk. I have anxiety and I am nervous to do this but I am 26, have massive anxiety but I just ended a 5+ year relationship and have no where to move but my parents. I feel like it's time for a fresh start and maybe this is it. I feel like a failure I don't know where to go but I've wanted to do something like this for a long time and show people we aren't failures, we all struggle and we can all over come.

64,"I'm an 18 years old guy.

I tried taking a picture of myself today after exercising just to realise yet again that my face looks like shit.

I'm probably a 5/10. My face is full of acne despite having good hygiene and starting to eat healthy and exercising since February this year. I could improve my body but the acne just doesn't want to go away, I can't change my face.

I always have these times where I notice how shitty my face looks. Then after some time I feel better about it and I tell myself its isn't that bad. Then it happens again that I try to take a picture and hate myself for the disgusting acne on my face. 

I try to get over it. I try to tell myself that I just have to be confident. But I just can't be confident with my looks. I'm stuck with my shitty face (and mentality) that I apparently can't fix no matter how hard I try. At least I'm trying to improve my body I guess, not that I have a choice.",06Jun2018,1
