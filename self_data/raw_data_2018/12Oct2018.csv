Today we were doing a stretch where you hug your knees to your chest with arms under thighs, then straighten the legs into a modified forward fold.

I finally had my hamstrings relax enough i was able to keep my chin on my knees, chest on thighs, and straightened my legs enough my heels came off the floor.

I'm not the best about recognizing progress when i can't measure it, but for myself and others, I want to say, if you practice, you will improve. Work on what is hard, give it time and it will become easier. [Essentially this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2_Mn-qRKjA)

4,"Dear diary, 

This week I’ve been practicing being selfish and putting myself first, which has been difficult for me since I am so codependent. 

3 weeks ago I met a guy and we hit it off, had an instant emotional connection. Because I’m so codependent, I quickly grew attached. Monday, I kind of had my breaking point. I’ve been hanging out with this guy non stop (staying up reallllly late) as well as doing other things for other people, working out, completing my assignments, and work. So Monday I kinda broke down when we hung out. I had really bad anxiety and he didn’t really do anything to comfort me. He showed me his tinder and would talk about sex and his exes, okay cool now I’m thinking he friend zoned me. We had a conversation and right now we are friends, but there is potential of us dating. 

I’m not so sure. He’s in a really bad spot and I’m starting to dissociate really bad again. I forget what day it is and other small things. I feel like I’m his therapist half the time. I don’t mind, I love helping people and guiding them to a healthier lifestyle. But what about me? This feels so one sided. I’ve fallen for another guy whose still stuck in the past. 

He asked me to go grab a drink later and of course I said yes. But then I hop on insta and he’s posting all these memories, one of his ex and I’m like eh do I really want to get hurt and do I really want to stay up late when I have work tomorrow so I back out. 

And I’m not jealous, I’m glad he can have a friendship with his ex! I just don’t really want to be subjected to seeing it on my feed. But maybe that’s me being irrational or maybe I just care to much and it lowkey hurts. 

I really like this guy and I feel like we have an emotional connection but I should not be having anxiety over someone. I shouldn’t be staying out late and drinking when I have priorities of my own. I shouldn’t be a void for someone else.  I shouldn’t be someone’s personal therapist. I need to stop nurturing people. 

And maybe it’s my fault. It’s not like I have any other guys in my life that want to take me out on dates and I’m tired of dating apps. So I leech onto the first guy who gives me attention. 

But then I look at the posts I write on here and damn I’m also emotionally unavailable. I’ve written things on here I’ve never told anyone aloud. Who would want a women with all this trauma? That’s why I connect with others who are similar to me, because they can at least understand. But it’s toxic nonetheless. 

My walls are so freaking high and I won’t let anyone in. 

I just don’t want to get hurt. 

I don’t want to be codependent. 

I want to get a full 8 hours of sleep.

I want a guy to accept me for me, and not have me solve his problems for him or take me down in his spiral. I’ve fished myself out of my spiral and I don’t wanna go back.

I just want something genuine. I know, I need to fix myself first before that happens. I’ve been working on myself for a long time now. 

How am I still lonely? Why am I still craving human attention? I have a full time job, grad school, and I work out 5 times a week and STILL feel lonely when my mind should be hella occupied. 

Sincerely,
A girl looking for love in all the wrong places

9,"Hi there, before I say anything I'd just like to say that I'm a former employee of this company and am still am in contact with many people who work there (crazy the company still around, right?). I'm not making this post to start any type of retaliation or witch hunt against them, I'd just like to get this off my chest and warn any job seekers or recruiters.

There are a few things that I'd like to address in this post and I'll start with the most alarming.

**Selling your data.** The Ladders was built around the idea of helping executives find jobs that pay over $100k, meaning that they have a substantial resume database of well-paid professionals. While I was at the company I had a conversation with one of the salespeople about what types of companies they were selling to (a sale in this case refers to a recruiter license that allows them access to the resume database). They were telling me that recently that had been in contact with several insurance and financial services companies. The types of companies they were referencing struck me as odd because I didn't think these companies had many $100k+ positions outside of the HQ, and it turns out I was right. They stated that these companies wanted access to the database because they would instantly receive millions of well-paid professional's direct contact information. If you were a member of The Ladders and now receive unsolicited calls or emails from insurance and financial services companies this may be the reason.

&amp;#x200B;

**Misleading information.** Once again, this company advertises that the jobs posted on the site are $100k+ positions. Guess what, they aren't. Most companies don't even know their jobs are posted on the site. That's because The Ladders hires offshore teams to manually scrape positions from companies' careers pages and put them on the site. This means that they have no idea if the job meets the $100k+ mark. Additionally, there are often grammatical and formatting errors in the job descriptions, but no customer service for them to call and complain to. The salespeople tell me they get calls from angry HR departments telling them to fix these errors or remove the job from the site. Salespeople are instructed to tell recruiters that there are 10 million active members! They said when they pull up the reports, the real number is around 5 or 6 million, many of which are accounts based outside of the U.S.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spamming.** Are you receiving emails from The Ladders? Can't unsubscribe? You're not alone! To this day they receive complaints about how they are unable to unsubscribe. When I worked there this was a big problem and nobody knew how to fix it. There wasn't any urgency to fix it either. Seems nothing has changed.

&amp;#x200B;

**The CEO publicly berating employees.** He is a public figure, so mods please let me know if this violates any rules. I do not wish to start a witch hunt. First off, at the time of this post his approval rating on Glassdoor is 32% (should be even lower because during my time there we were instructed to get on Glassdoor and leave positive reviews of the company) and I think that speaks volumes. There are quite a number of articles online outlining his old blog posts which supposedly contained misogynistic and bigoted content, however, at the time of those posts he was running for office so I'll let you decide what to believe regarding that. In the context of the office, if he did not agree with a business decision, he would publicly berate the employee and make a scene. As CEO obviously he has the power to make business decisions, I was just very disappointed in the manner that he behaved to make those choices. He is notorious for the amount of turnover in his company. There aren't even any VP's at the company anymore. He fires people very quickly. FUN FACT: When I was there we were told by the marketing department that we needed to buy his book off of Amazon and leave a positive review. We got reimbursed for this.

&amp;#x200B;

And so much more. There is other behavior from this company that I found completely unethical and immoral, however, I just needed to get some of this off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anybody else had any issues with this company?

I don’t ever have ANY thing to do on my birthday (I’ve arranged it for the last 8 years) and I want so much to be able to enjoy that morning with her. 

I’ve asked her.  And like any other present, I told her I don’t want to know if I can have it until it’s my birthday.  I know for certain she’s the type of woman that will do everything she can do make it happen, but I also know there are factors she can’t control.  That makes it much more exciting for me — it’s possible I won’t get it, but it’s possible I will.

19,"Where do I start. God complex because of her job, her mommy martyr BS, She's constantly conflating small things like leaving a dish in the sink with me failing college (I'm but ok), she constantly beats me over the head with the fact that I still live at home while at the same time telling me to quit college because I did fail the first time, and persue some shit factory job. Never, does she fail to lets EVERYONE know her goddamn opinion on everything like people give a shit, bitches up a storm whenever anyone uses the laundry when she needs it, and instead of waiting like a fucking adult, she calls them a mooch and tells them they're using HER laundry and HER detergent in HER house so clearly they need to take their shit out mid wash to make room for the incredibly important person that is herself. She honestly thinks she knows everything. to the point where when offhandedly mentioning a issue i was having with my computer, tried to explain how I fucked up my computer through Steam giving it a virus (lol!) and I dont know as much about computers as her ""Are you sure you know how this works""  OH GEE I DUNNO I ONLY BUILT ,OVERCLOCKED, AND LIQUID COOLED THE FUCKING THING I BETTER GODDAMN KNOW HOW IT WORKS!! And then when anyone, (mainly me) tells her to quit her bullshit, she erupts in a massive tirade of personal insults and attacks and thinks shes justified in how she acts. Everyone else just deals with it and tries not to piss her off whereas I'm the only one who's just not having it. It's starting to affect me and my personality. The difference is night and day.

23,"Being on medication has been helping me cope with my mental health issues. I don’t want to go into details as I do value my privacy, but I wish to share a little in case anyone has any doubt as to whether going to a psychiatrist is right for you. 

I first started developing symptoms as a teenager and they worsened through early adulthood. My family and friends misattributed what was happening in my brain to quirks or character flaws. Despite this I was able to function well enough to hold down a job and attend school. Unfortunately, as my symptoms continued to progress and as life stress piled on my condition deteriorated until I was forcibly hospitalized. Thanks to a community intervention program I was able to get the help I needed. 

My life progressed, and the symptoms seemed to be under control. I had struggled with stress, work/life balance and self-medicating but without the symptoms that had destroyed my coping abilities. I managed to live on my own and even complete a certification program for my career. 

Recently my symptoms came back unexpectedly, and I was again forcibly hospitalized. I had been off my medication for several years and was coping well. It was the perfect storm of stressors that put me there. I’ve experienced a great setback but thankfully I have support. I’m on medication again and I am thankful. 

My symptoms are terrifying and debilitating. They practically destroyed the life I had been building for myself. If doctors hadn’t intervened on my behalf I don’t know what would have happened. I can’t function properly without my medication and without support. 

I mentioned that my symptoms were misattributed to quirks or character flaws. That’s because my family and friends aren’t trained mental health professionals with years of experience. I don’t blame them. They were there for me when they realized what was going on. 

I must deal with the stigma surrounding my condition. There are simply too many myths about mental illness. In addition, I must keep my condition private. Most people I meet can’t tell at a glance or even after spending time with me what I’m dealing with. I don’t know how they’d feel if they did know but I’d rather not find out. I’ve heard enough horror stories about discrimination to be wary of oversharing. 

I’ve noticed that many people who have my condition or similar ones are afraid of becoming “doped-up zombies” or “guinea pigs for lazy doctors”. Yes, it’s true that sometimes doctors are throwing darts at a board. But if you work with them and respect their profession your treatment does go a lot better. I’ve made mistakes and run the risk of alienating people who were trying to help. I’m thankful that they’re forgiving and willing to give me second and third chances. 

I don’t know in which direction my life is heading from here and I’m aware of how much I’ve lost of myself recently, but I remain hopeful. If I did it once I can do it again. No sense rushing into an early grave or alienating people until I end up homeless. My struggle is my burden, but I don’t need to let it define my character or my motivation. I will overcome the adversity I have suffered. 

I encourage everyone who is struggling with a mental illness to gather your strengths and work towards a positive outcome. Don’t let your burden break your will. Don’t let it rob you of your freedom. Keep fighting. Stay positive. Learn coping strategies. Take your medication. Change your entire lifestyle if necessary. I’ve had to. And I’ve fucked up. And I keep coming back to fight another day. Because I choose to. 

I’ve been through the ringer. I’ve had those moments where I welcomed death like an old friend. I’ve thought, “If I got cancer at least I wouldn’t be responsible for my life ending.” Or “If some drunk driver smashed into me that would save me the burden.” I’ve contemplated my end plenty of times. I’ve though about jumping off bridges, balconies or just drinking myself into oblivion. But I keep going one more day because I know how hard suicide hits families and after all they’ve done for me I could never hurt them like that. Furthermore, my life has value to me. 

Some of you may be saying that this is a tale of privilege. It is, I’m lucky enough to live in a country with Universal Healthcare. My family isn’t rich by any means, but we support each other. I went to community college and my career is far from prestigious. I recognize that my situation could have been much worse. I realize that many people do have it worse or don’t have access to the community services and healthcare I do. I sincerely believe that it’s the right of every person to have access to the medical care they need. If your community does not offer services I encourage you to demand them, now. Without the support I had I’d likely be homeless or dead. 

I’m grateful to have an opportunity to live a normal life. This opportunity has been given to me by my family, my community and by my own effort. I’ve been through hell and I still have a lot of work left to do but it’s getting better, one day at a time.

28," I can already hear it, “another one.... just kill yourself already.” That’s fine, and that will most likely be the TL;DR of the local newspaper. Right now though, I’m performing that last step. I’ve battled internal and external demons my entire frail unimpressive existence. My parents were uneducated blue-collar worker bees. Their lives revolved around the incredibly small town in which I am from. They still do not internet, and they absolutely don’t know what a Reddit is. Which is good. If anyone I knew read this... they’d know without any shred of doubt who this is. “Fuck you piggy!” Thanks ‘Lord of Flies,’ you may be a literal accomplishment. You also remind every boy and girl that everyone is not equal. There are some that want to build and work together and others just want to rip you apart in a ritualistic-primal manner. I’ve had to claw my way to where I am. All the while I check in with my family I left and found they are slowly fading the longer I am gone. While I thought it was just quirks and that sheltered persona I grew to expect. I realized was actually a form of mental illness that I can now see in myself. It started with a phrase, “What was that?” Thinking they must’ve not heard me. Nope. They just weren’t there, but the others were. I got spanked as a child, fine, at my age it was not uncommon. What was uncommon that I didn’t know until much later in life was the parents were supposed to remember the discipline they performed. Thankfully (I suppose), they didn’t abuse a drug or alcohol to excess. They just forgot disciplinary actions they performed on their children. I say ‘they,’ but it was really my Mom that physically disciplined us. My Dad would just be scarce at the time. As much as I try to recall it, I still have issues recalling it all. Which worries me most. Fast forward. I married my high school sweet heart. “Awwww...” for a couple years it was hard, but great. Then after a few years of casual mid-1900’s mental abuse of “So when are you having kids coming?” Side note: say that to anyone, ever, you should walk in front of traffic. Anyways... oh guess what. You can’t have kids... So you’ve grown up a socially fucked, overweight-garbage child of mid-west trash. You’ve put your own self  through $100,000 worth of schooling to try and change your existence. To find out you can’t make shit better for your kids, because they are fictional. We started our process of IVF or plainly; infertility treatments, when we were 25. Seven years go by. 3 doctors, 2 healers, 2 therapists, and countless nurses later. We get pregnant. Now we are in debt two times more than my student loans just to have this little guy. And I couldn’t be more proud to call him my son. Which brought me back to debating my past. The psychosis my parents seem to have experienced during raising me. My multiple attempts at my own life. My limitless hate towards myself. I don’t want to pass that on. I truly believe if I were to leave forever, it would be my greatest example left behind for him.

36,"Okay, so I just need to vent, I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if this belongs on this community, but yeah. So my parents has mentally abused me for a long while now, and I don't know if I can take this anymore. Basically, yesterday I was at my boyfriends house and my mom called asking where I was. So I told her where I was and she got super mad and threatened to call the police and the socialworkers to get me. Then she told me that she is gonna decide everything about me and my boyfriend. And I can't take this, she called me a freak when I cried and she told me to shut up. This morning I overslept, and she started screaming for 30 minutes straight, and now I'm scared as fuck. She made me relapse the day before yesterday, I used to be 3 months clean but now my self harm is back. And my dad has started sexually harassing me again. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm sorry for venting. I just feel like I need to talk about everything somewhere none can judge me. Also sorry for my English, im from Sweden :/",12Oct2018,1
37,"A couple of months ago I chatted with this guy on Grindr (gay hookup app), and finally I gave him my address for him to come. He then came up with an excuse and didn't show up. Now last Monday he writes to me again and this time invites me to his place, but he gives me just the street number, it was a 5 min. walk from where I live. I go there at 21:15, a time when usually I am home. When there I start texting him, calling him, but he doesn't answer. At 21:20 I start walking back home. When almost getting home he starts texting me again saying that he doesn't have good reception and he didn't get the messages, lies. I ignore him and I go upstairs and I find my door open and some noises coming from inside. While l was thinking what to do, the robbers ran away through the terrace, on the roof, and then showed up next to me outside the apartment and ran down the stairs (I live in an attic in Barcelona). They didn't get to steal anything. I called the police and explained everything. I was absolutely convinced the porn star was involved, because of how he acted and the fact that the robbers came in at a time I usually don't leave home. The police agrees, but they say it's all just conjectures. The next day I put his photo on Grindr tagged as an apartment robber and wrote the story. Some other guys started writing to me complaining about him, one of them saying he stole his credit card twice, others saying they were already warned about him etc. The guy with the stolen visa met with him in person and confirmed it was actually him, but didn't report him to the police, because he was married and didn't want his husband to find out. His porn name is Diego Senna. If you google Diego Senna gay porn, you'll get lots of results. I think his real name is Junior Silva. It looks he does petty crimes since long ago and he's not afraid to show his face, because it's difficult to prove he's actually involved. What could I do to bring him down?

TLDR: Gay porn star Diego Senna lures me out of my apartment to meet with him, while he sends the robbers to go inside my place.",12Oct2018,1
39,"Getting it all of my chest ended up being pretty lengthy but I appreciate those of you willing to stick through. Those that aren't? Here ya go:
**TL;DR: I relapsed twice this week after two months and even used a discarded needle. Hate myself for stooping so low. Hate myself every time I use and immediately regret what I put myself through. Hate the things I think to myself as a result. Give me everything you got, maybe hearing all you rip me a new one, or give me your most candid responses/reactions, is something I need right now to see myself and get real.**

I relapsed this week after almost two months. Knowing every time I'll have to confront this desperate stranger that I can't bear to share my mind and body with and feel the shame of another use. Another comedown.  


This time, though, was the most careless and irresponsible I've ever been.  I've always been clean and used clean supplies. Always careful. Until Tuesday when in my desperation to score I used a discarded needle. WHAT. THE. F. Right? Never imagined that I'd allow myself to disregard the most basic precaution just for ""convenience"". I hate myself for doing it, and the shame/embarrassment of coming to the er for testing and exposure meds.   


God willing, it'll turn out I never needed them. I wish to everything in the universe that the embarrassment of this, having to try to interact ""normally"" without feeling shifty and being unable to maintain eye contact is the worst part of this choice I made. That the anxious wait for results are my only consequences for this risky behavior. Y'all I'm so disappointed and ashamed of myself.. 


Context/personal insight: I've been using for about 6 years... Heavily for a little while a couple years back, but in the last couple have been working at recovery. Like. REAL recovery. So far I last a few months before I inevitably relapse. It's not even fun anymore. Those first few moments are euphoric, but it doesn't take long for the regret and disappointment to set in because the agony I know follows relapse...


I know every time this decision sets me back in everything I'm trying to achieve for myself. Also the not sleeping, not eating, not even feeling comfortable in my own skin and just wanting it all to be over. Wishing that all these feelings I knew I would have would be enough to just.... Not. Why can't the way I know I feel about it and myself when using be enough to make a different decision? 


Having to be accountable to my boyfriend, my friends. Wondering how my truth is going to affect and alter their days. Feeling like every time I do this I ""change"" our relationship or his/their view of me just a little bit more... Not to mention what it makes me think of myself. I'm just tired. SO TIRED of this cycle. I have support, and sometimes when I talk about it with them it helps. I can go on for however many more days before I have a using dream, or the urge hits for some random reason. Sometimes I even stave off the urge a few times before I give in. I've gotten better. But I have, to this day, always eventually given in.


I don't want to anymore. I haven't done meetings.. Is it shame? Pride? Doubt or disbelief in their success or in myself going through with it? I don't know. But obviously I can't do it right as I am now, so I should finally suck up whatever keeps me from them and just go. Because this has to change. I HAVE to change. Because if I don't? Idk how much longer I could live with myself if I thought I can't ever change this. 
Even if I can have my two jobs and etc and relapse without affecting my personal success anymore... I don't want to. I don't want to ""work around"" knowing I'm at the point where I ""have to go use"". 


I don't want to live with this hanging over me for the rest of my life. I don't want this to be me. But it doesn't seem to matter how hard I am on myself about it... How do I do this? ",12Oct2018,1
40,"I graduated high school some time ago. Last February, a girl in my high school a couple of years younger than me, who I didn't know too well but who I talked to and saw a lot, killed herself. I guess she was dealing with depression, she was always kind of awkward and definitely not in the best mental place but my school was an alternative school so everyone was like that. I was at my job and my friend sent me a screenshot of someone's snapchat story saying ""Condolences to x's family."" I left early that day and then kinda just spent the rest of the week in a weird haze. That week sort of turned into a month, a month in which I quit my job and practically stopped going to classes. I've been dealing with death anxiety for years, and this just fucked me up really bad for some reason. I guess the weirdest thing to me is that this person who I've talked to and seen now only exists in memory. Like I have a memory of her being alive, and yet she's dead and I and no one else will ever talk to her again. She doesn't live anywhere outside of the heads of the few people who knew her. This girl 15 (16?) year old girl who was full of life and super creative and a part of our community is just gone forever. When I was a couple of years younger than her I was suicidal and was very very close to killing myself. It's really strange seeing the aftermath of her suicide and thinking that might have been me. I might have been the one to exist in the minds of like maybe 30 people at most, and that that would dissapear with their memory and with time. I was so fucking close to doing it myself and I didn't and I'm so happy I didn't, but it's just weird thinking how close I was to being her. There's this scene in the West Wing where Josh is dealing with PTSD, and that pilot with the same birthday and same life details as him kills himself by crashing his plane. Those hazy months felt exactly like that. Maybe it'd be somehow easier for me to wrap my head around that if I'd been able to go to the memorial service or been part of anything relating to her after her death aside from instagram posts, but my college is too far away from my hometown. I never really got closure I guess. Don't really know how to end this, that's my little ramble I guess. Thanks if you read this far.",12Oct2018,1

In school i suck big dick. Why others study one sheet and get most info out of it and i study it a few times my brain is clueless??? I want to have a life with direction. Not live a life with not a great head on this body.

I live in kurdistan/iraq. Isis was here. Mostly curropted and we have a curropted goverment. I live in a small town and most others live in erbil where its dope. I wish i was there.

“he..has..had..the sharpest wit, it cut through layers of social conventions and cultured bullshit..he..i felt like i was his heaven, even when he was with other women..i don’t know if they were lovers or friends, maybe both, but it didn’t matter, that wasn’t the point,” she’s long and sophisticated, expertly groomed, formally educated.  the tips of her nails, a seductive red, demand my attention.

“oh, and yes, of course, he..made love..with those same qualities..strokes of intelligence, bites of  cool wit, and a..his..flagrant insistence breaching the walls of my..reticence,” she doesn’t seem to realize her words are poetry, flowing with a tense, deliberate ease.  she stubs the cigarette, stained with the shape of red lips, arches her back, reaching for some deeper reminiscence.  yes, it’s there, he’s there, in the stretch she displays.  i get a sudden urge to kiss what he left.

“i miss..who i was with him..uncomplicated, free of doubt and conceit..untroubled, free of anger and self-deceit..undressed, free of vanity and crude arrogance..naked, unspoiled, replete and.. conscious..” she tells me her name, slips me her pale hand, smiles with a sadness i’d like to invade or..change.

48,"This happened yesterday and I've only just recovered enough to begin articulating what this FU means to me personally.

I'm a lifelong Counting Crows fan (since their first album came out and, yes, that does make me as old as fuck). I've always been into making music and have started doing some music production from my spare room (around my full time job and looking after the kids). I remixed a Counting Crows song a year or so ago and, pleased with my efforts, stuck it up on Soundcloud for the world to hear. And by world, I mean, about 4 people. 1 of whom is my mum. And there it has sat, unheard by anyone of any significance (sorry mum), until yesterday.

I hadn't checked my Soundcloud account for a while and logged in to find a message. It was from a DJ Celeste Lear who was playing a private party for the Counting Crows and their friends and would like a WAV copy of my remix to play at the gig! Now, for a hobbyist, making music on his lonesome in a small spare room, in a seaside town on the North East coast of England, this was best-fucking-case scenario. But as this is a TIFU I'm betting you can guess where this is going... the gig was a week ago and I was too late.

I'm not ashamed to say that a 42-year-old man cried in his office yesterday. To say that I'm disappointed would be an understatement.

If anyone's interested the song's [here](https://soundcloud.com/sykal/catching-crows-counting-crows-round-here-bootleg-remix)

And if anyone knows any of the band, feel free to forward them the link (one can but hope that lightning strikes twice).

50,"We were talking about something dumb and pointless and they jokingly accused me of something. I “testified” to where I was before the accusation to which my friend objected to before I finish. I said he had no reason to object and it devolved into a discussion about objections. He said that he had mock court experience in high school and I said I was in the Law major in my high school. After correcting him in a debatably essay like message he stopped responding. He responded maybe an hour later with a completely different demeanor now acting incredibly passive aggressive and saying that I was a “petty fuck”. I’ve honestly never seen anyone get so upset after I’ve corrected them, but to be fair usually when I correct someone they tend to just thank me or say “oh I didn’t know that” and the same can be said when someone corrects me. It’s even weirder considering he’s basically stopped talking to me in real life despite the fact that we live in the same dormitory.

53,"I was only expecting one interview, but I told the guy that I'd be in the state where the job was located this past weekend and he said ""Oh really?! Wow well, we can get Lea on the phone to interview with you in about 15 minutes, maybe instead of flying you out, we can interview you this weekend?""

He immediately phoned her up, sped me through the process of filling out a questionnaire for her (I didn't even get to finish it) and then while speaking to her, she basically asked me behavioral questions that I was totally unprepared for. 

I feel like shit because I had no time to prep, to think about ""Okay, examples of leadership, do I even remember any of this stuff?""

and while recalling events, I couldn't provide her with enough detail because it was the first time I was remembering stuff like that in 2 years or so. 

I tried my best. But I still feel like I was unprepared and rushed. I really fucking hope it doesn't ruin my chance for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 

Lea, the second interviewer, had me apply again through the company website for some reason. I was contacted about another phone interview, I got happy and was hoping I could redeem myself by making notes of previous times I'd shown leadership skills.

Well today was the day and when the woman asked me where I learned about the position, I told her I was recruited and she had to literally stop the interview because I was already in the hiring process by recruiters that the company contracts with.

The only thing that gives me hope is that she said ""We're still interested, I think you've got a wonderful background, I just thought you were a new applicant so I cannot continue.""

She told me that they'll contact me with the next steps. Now I'm sitting here disgusted and I don't know what to do. 

Maybe the fact that I didn't have a chance to prepare ruined this for me. Or maybe they figure that I had to do it on the fly and that I am good for that. Who knows... I feel awful...",12Oct2018,1
56,"This is the first time posting on Reddit for me and honestly it's because I don't really have anyone else to talk to about this.

Basically, I was forced to leave a job that I loved because the company I worked for didn't want to keep me on without a degree. They pushed me to go back to university, which I thought I was fine with, but since starting a few weeks ago I have started binge drinking far past any point I had been at before.

The nights start off innocently enough, but the next morning I wake up to find that I'm missing several hours from the night before. This week, for example, I woke up with no memory of what happened between about midnight and 5am. I have a vague recollection of throwing up in a bathroom, stumbling into traffic, trying to stop cars for help and wandering the streets. I lost my phone, my glasses and woke up with cuts and bruises all down my arms.

This sort of thing is so out of character for me and I genuinely don't know how to deal with it. I feel constantly ashamed and embarrassed. I'm paranoid that I'll have done something illegal that I don't remember and that the police will come knocking. I've been skipping my classes as a result of all this and that makes me feel even worse.

57,"(Alt account, kinda throw away, I feel like I'm going to post more of this wierdness)

No, don't hyperbolize this.  This isn't some fancy hot rod we're driving.... it's a '86 Ford Taurus, with electrical issues.... replacing the engine every time you drive it is not what we're doing.  We're jumping in and pulling the screw driver glued into the main ignition switch below the steering column, and I was suggesting ya know... maybe putting in a proper ignition switch?  ""but doing that doesn't sell the product""

What I said is ""the code seems to naturally want to have this whole chunk removed, as we reduced the complexity on the front end""  because it's not being used that way at all anymore ... nor ever again.

(this is not a security issue, btw but I wrote this rant as such, so it's a characterization of the issue)

I'm not trying to put a new shiny engine into a car,  What I noticed is that... ages ago someone thought ""I need to make this car more secure"", they don't have security knowledge, nor did they talk to anyone else how something should be engineered.  They just came up with an idea that should be ""good enough"" and went with it.

So, in their inspired moment, they installed one handle on the drivers door.  This way there's only one point of entry!!  It does however, open all 4 doors simultaneously.  The user must close the other 3 manually (I assume before they drive away.)

Nobody commented on how weird this was because, they aren't car engineers they just went about selling the car. Now someone in sales noticed that people rarely got into the other 3 doors, You said ""oh aha, I have the perfect solution"" ... you duct taped each door shut, so they don't pop open automatically, they still get the open signal, but the tape keeps them shut.  By using the tape, the end user can configure exactly how many doors they want to open by removing the tape, it's such a well working system!  (so configurable!)

I just suggested that it would be much more natural to ... remove the fucking duct tape and install door handles on all of the doors.  But ... ""that would undermine the original claim of security!!""... it was never a security issue --  ""but people are paying for the feature that configures the number of doors you can open aren't they""

The response to me mentioning it would make sense to factor out that code is ""but it's not making us money to fix it""

I really don't understand how to respond to this mess,  I do understand that it costs money for me to do work but ... goddammit  ""useless code refactors"" but at the same time.... FFS this is a silly mess;

The processes we use here are the same processes that lead to all of those security vulnerabilities that kill companies when exposed.  And people laugh at for years to come, ""like really what were you thinking""

Am I wrong in thinking, you can't claim to be an agile shop and be afraid to refactor... ??

So, when someone’s being nice how do you know if that person is really that nice/kind or if they’re just being nice because of how you look?

Today something happened that made me think
About this. I recently started to get energy drinks before I go workout and at the grocery store it’s usually random sometimes it’s full sometimes not. Today there wasn’t that many people but still a couple of people in line to pay. 

There was this girl(I’m a male) who was in front of me who had about 70ish items. She saw me in line behind her and (I only had that energy drink) offered me to put it in with her stuff and she’d pay for it. I said “that’s very nice of you, it’s alright, thank you though” she proceeded to offer again etc. I said the energy drink was pretty expensive for a drink (2 dollars) and she said it was fine etc. I said no and she offered to let me go in front of her “it’s the least I could do” 

Like come on that’s so nice. But why though? She didn’t know me so were complete strangers.

However, I do notice that masturbation is a method to contain and relieve this sexual energy. I've noticed it's easier to think clearly when I'm around women. Sexual energy can be suppressed but it will leak out in strange unexpected ways in a comment or a gesture. Sex before marriage is still something that hasn't been an issue since I'm not getting any, but I'd imagine it is important to ""test the vehicle before you drive off"". If the wedding night is the first time my partner and I have sex, I can imagine a bunch of issues that you guys already are aware of. But it was nice to finally stop flip-flopping on this issue.",12Oct2018,1

67,"My chronic pain is getting better and so my physical health is improving rapidly, but when I see people I'm starting to view them as body with limbs, sometimes seeing them as dismembered temporarily, and I'm feeling a strong urge to get knives and to get a gun license so I can learn how to shoot one and own one.  I wish I was joking but these are really strong urges.",12Oct2018,1
