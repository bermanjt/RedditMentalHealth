5,"I am a 30 something year old guy. I dont have any hobbies to speak of.  I can do a number of things, but nothing hobby-wise that really brings me joy on a regular basis. All of the minor hobbies i have had have generally came by accident. For example, when i was 16 i got put on house arrest and didnt have internet, etc. So i got a guitar and learned to play it.   I used to skate, because all my friends did and it turned out i was pretty good for my little town, so i just kept going for a while.  


Ive also never liked one dimensional people. Everyone knows the guy who loves football. You cant get him out of the house unless its to go watch the football game. His house is decorated with football things, he wears a football jersey everywhere, and thats all he talks about.  change football to hiking. or traveling. or clubbing. lots of peoples live focus around 1 single thing.   So i learned to play guitar to a decent degree, but i never wanted my life to revolve around it so i never had any interest in getting to a professional level, which would require a huge amount of practice and learning. ive tried to keep my interests wide and broad. so instead of practicing guitar past the intermediate level, i would learn programming, or something like that. but before i would have to put in the work to be a master programmer, i would switch to learning a new language, etc. I think a lot was that i never really LOVED doing any of it. It was there, and others were doing it, or i was bored and had no other options, etc.

Now that im older, i cant get motivated to start, or cant really enjoy a new thing (the single experience can be awesome, i can still enjoy that....but i mean a thing as a hobby), because i know i wont get good enough to use it as a job or be professional, and im not interested in learning another thing just enough to get by but not enough to really make it useful or enjoyable. 
Not to mention the older i get, the more stereotypical i get with being less motivated in life in general, and weighing out time commitments, and value that way.

16,"I graduated last December with my degree, after a rough college life. 

I was the first in my family to go to college, and to say that it was an uphill battle was an understatement. It took me semesters just to get the hang of it. I spent so much energy just keeping my grades up. And I had to work because I needed to support myself and help my family. I didn't have much time for much else, but I managed to be involved in some extracurricular activities. 

Throughout my college career, I tried to get some actual, meaningful career experience (an internship, some type of job, fucking anything really). I legitimately tried to ""network"". I met a lot of people, but became jaded as no one really seemed to be able to actually help me. I stuck to my lame janitorial job because that's all I had to get by. About halfway through, I decided to try for medical school, partially because I was fascinated by medicine and thought that it'd be cool to help others for a living but mostly because I felt lost and happened to latch onto it. I legitimately don't know if I truly want to do medicine, but no other area ever pulled me, so I don't know if I was meant to be an electrical engineer, an accountant, a lawyer, a teacher or whatever. 

Anyway, I volunteered at the local hospital and the homeless shelter. I did some shadowing but have limited experience in that area because of how fucking difficult it is to contact a doctor who is actually willing to meet me halfway and give me the opportunity to shadow. Not only that, but I couldn't find any fucking relevant clinical jobs because they either (a) required experience I didn't have, (b) required certification which comes in the form of a class that costs too much for me too afford and takes up too much time which I didn't have anyway, (c) I had shit luck and some places seemed to never hire. 

So I'm thoroughly unqualified to even apply for medical school but I'm going to apply anyways against my better judgement because I have jack shit going on in my life regardless. I haven't gotten a job despite applying to dozens of places. I have no money so I don't even know how I'm going to afford applications. I fucking hate my life. I have no friends. I talk to no one. I literally just sit on the couch all day looking for jobs and walk in the park absentmindedly. I lost my self. I've become this shadow of a person. 

I think I hallucinate. I can't even go buy groceries because I feel like panicking. I don't care for my health. I don't sleep much, I eat inconsistently. Being alive hurts. It makes me want to go crazy. I want to scream but I can't. I just want all the pain to go away. It's 2 in the morning and I can't sleep because there's no one in the house and I have no one to talk to. I go days without hearing my own voice.",13May2018,323

18,"I’m in the UK. I’ve been working in a call centre for over 3 years. I take incoming support calls. In the last year I’ve discovered autism, and been professionally diagnosed as being on the spectrum in December 2017.

I take pride in what I do. I want to treat people as I’d want to be treated. My employer wants me to do that. The problem I’m having is that the way our knowledge base and communication is, means that I’m hunting all over the place to piece together the current correct answer every time I need it. The different parts of each answer vary too so I can’t build any experience.

We get plenty of paid time in training, team time, one to one time etc but it’s all about workarounds on top of workarounds.

I’m now at the breaking point. My brain is overwhelmed with the sheer number of workarounds I have to keep track of. On Wednesday, for the first time, I didn’t want to get up with the alarm. I had to force myself. When I did, I just sat and stared. By the time I’d arrived at work, I was mentally broken. I left without doing anything, being marked down as ill. Thursday and Friday had a similar pattern, except I couldn’t even face going in.

I’m “loyal to my employer”, whoever that is. I want to do well. I’ve spent most of my time trying to improve things, optimise communication etc with little success. The biggest hurdle there is that it’s simply not my job. All I can hope to achieve is more workarounds.

I do have longer term plans, but I need advice for the short term. I’ve now accepted that my current role / employer isn’t suitable for me. I want to transition away, but on good terms.

I’m back on Monday (hopefully with something resembling the building blocks of a plan). They are generally good at trying to work with people, but the underlying stuff isn’t likely to change.

I’m looking for suggestions as to how I can cope with such a confusing and complicated environment, so I can keep my standards acceptable, until I transition away.",13May2018,1
19,"After 15 years of being single, my 40th birthday approaching, I met someone. She was so into me, like a young girl infatuated. We got along well but were very different people.  I communicated, she told me that's who she is. She yelled, I listened. I was trying to figure out what being in a relationship was like, she expected me to know already. She got offered her dream job in another country. I was all for moving together. She became more insecure, constantly questioning my commitment and excitement for the move. I have medical issues, I have chronic pain. It dragged me down, it affected our relationship. I let things slide. Things I should have done, things I should have told her were bothering me.  She exploded, got abusive. We didn't recover. I injured myself dealing with the emotional pain. Now I'm 40 and single. The broken heart, the guilt, the misplaced guilt, the knowing that it was a bad relationship... none of that hurts more than the shattered dream.  The dream we had of moving away and adventuring together. Something I've wanted since i was an abused boy wracked with emotional and physical pain. That one person to accept me and love me. To go on adventures with. Its all gone now.

20,"So last night I go to sleep after a night out with friends. Didn't drink or anything but anyways.

I remember being on a sidewalk next to a yellowcar and my dad was standing there. Then I see some random guy come out of another car holding what looks like a cartoony shotgun, like a Looney Toons one.

Then I see a big limo pull up with secret agents and they're panicking. Then I see a line of people from different backgrounds, all holding guns. I could feel their intent was malicious for some reason.

Then a shootout starts and I'm in the middle of it. I remember feeling so terrified because I was laying on the ground and had no way of defending myself.

Then I see prison guards wearing that orange outfit prisoners wear, holding guns and shooting down a bald dude but, although I was so scared, I noticed that no blood came out. It was also a very very cloudy, grey day.

I woke up and haven't shaken the nightmare off at all. It's really ruined my mood today. I've just been numb and depressed, not even scared or in shock. I just don't feel anything, like I'm speechless. I hate feeling this way. It's just a stupid dream.

Maybe the fact that all these shootings happening over the years have made me feel so goddamn paranoid and scared. Maybe that buildup triggered the dream. I hate this.",13May2018,1

24,"Hey guys, so I created this reddit because I just want to sort of dump some issues. So I'm in my fourth year of studying at university and lately I've just not been motivated at all. I attribute some of this feeling to the fact that I have watched most of my friends graduate and I know I'm the only one who will be studying after next semester. Anyway, I've not been able to hand assignments in on time and I can never bring myself to actually write them sometimes. I don't know why. Other than my university life, I work 3 jobs and I feel my ethic slacking as well. I nanny which is ok but I often feel really drained when I'm looking after the kids. I do admin and marketing work for my brother which should only really take an hour or 2 a day but I never find myself doing it properly and lastly I have lost all interest in working my weekend cafe job which is odd because I love the social environment of a cafe. I guess I've also been having some pretty emotional ups and downs where I just feel really overwhelmed with my life but I also think maybe I'm just extremely lazy... 

Have you ever felt so unmotivated to get out of bed? Is it just me being lazy that I can't bring myself to finish my work or do it to my full capacity?

26,"I've posted this on another sub but I really need some advice and other people's perspectives. I can't go to the doctors because I have a family history of schizophrenia and they will just say it's due to that. I've not taken any of the medication and I don't intend on doing so either.

But I'm terrified of my medication which has been recently prescribed to be used to control my mind. I feel like I'm part of a huge experiment to see how it works. 

What's the best way to test it on people, test it on the people who are ""mentally ill"" and then if they say that it's used for kind controlling or some sort of experiment they are just mentally ill and don't make sense. It's a genius idea, test mind controlling drugs on people who are classed as mentally unstable so their opinions and thoughts are that of a crazy person and no one will listen to it properly.

I've been diagnosed with OCD and depression but I feel like somehow I've been targeted using tv and social media to make me feel depressed so I go to get help and they give me these tablets that control my mind. 

I can't tell the doctors how I feel about it either because they'll just class me as crazy and section me, try to keep me away from society so I can't ruin their plan. The doctors themselves may not even know it's an experiment but they've been taught to take to section anyone who says things like that so they can't harm themselves or anyone else.

But I've been told I have OCD so I doubt how I feel about this but what if that's the plan, they tell me I suffer from OCD so I believe it's the OCD that's makes me like this when I'm fact I'm right about it all. The worst part is I can't stop it or doing anything about it because people will think I'm crazy.

I don't know what to do, any advice is welcome.

33,"Throwaway account. Obviously. 

So My wifes friend passed away when she was a child. She was her best friend and meant the world to her. She has visited her grave every year on the same date every year for 18 years. We may move here in the near future and she is worried about how she will be able to visit her if we move out of state. I have thought about taking a patch of grass from in front of her headstone but not sure on the legal ramifications on that. I have thought about maybe trying to get a piece of the headstone \(some that's already loose from it. not to deface it for remembrance.\)

How can I get something that she can have tangibly that she can still ""visit"" her best friend if not in state?

37,"I'm in a rough place in my life at the minute. I'm 22 nearly 23. I spent about 4 of the best years of my life basically in isolation getting stoned and playing video games. I felt like that was the most fun I could be having at the time. I didn't realise how self destructive I was being. 

As a result of this I believe my social skills have suffered greatly. I lack self confidence and direction in life. I have a job only for like 2 weeks that I already can't stand. (Retention for a big broadband company, I'm currently being trained to be an overly friendly robot that will trick you into a contract by offering you discounts and pretending to be your friend) before this I worked at my local store for a few months which wasn't so bad compared to this job. I only changed job because the pay at this new one is better and I didn't realise how much I'd hate it.

I have one friend that lives abroad with his girl not counting my couple of online gaming buddies I talk to like once a week. I live at home with mom. I haven't ever had a real girlfriend. I dated some girl off tinder like 2 years ago for like a month. She liked me at the start but I was very awkward when we went out due to my anxiety. So that didn't last and ended quite badly because I didn't know how to handle rejection.

Recently I've been trying to improve myself. I quit cigarettes and I've been making efforts to exercise everyday for the last couple of months. Nothing crazy just press ups and stuff. I quit weed 10 days ago as well. I'm trying to make an effort to stay off it for 30 days and achieve some happiness in my life.

Obviously it's not happening for me overnight though.

 I got along well with my co workers from my old job. I also felt confident enough at my old job because I formed good relationships with the customers as well as my co workers. I was able to joke around with them and generally have a good time. Girls even used to smile at me and hint they liked me when I served them which made me realise I must be somewhat attractive to some people. I feel like that job built my self confidence up and now it's dwindling again due to me being incapable at my new job due to sheer lack of interest.

I also asked one of my old co workers from the store out whom I really like. She said yes. When she said yes I was rendered speechless due to shock and couldn't even give her my number or ask for hers. So I left with no phone number and no plans made to do anything. Today (2 weeks after I asked her out)I saw her and made awkward small talk for a minute or 2. Then I handed her my number on a piece of paper and told her to"" give me a call or something "". She laughed and thanked me. I'm patiently waiting on my rejection message and I know I only have myself to blame for that. I wasn't awkward around her before I asked her out. She actually seemed to enjoy my company.

I often feel stupid due to my anxiety and lack of social skills. I go into depressive states where I don't feel like doing anything like right now. So I'm writing a reddit post that's too long about my shit life. I can't help but hate myself even more for this because I know I'm not doing shit to help myself I'm just lying around in bed feeling sorry for myself when I should be out enjoying myself on my day off with friends or this girl I like who's rejection of me is inevitable because she deserves better than me.

On top of this I have recently developed dandruff due to stress ( I guess) and I can see my hairline receding so I'm going bald in my early 20s. Nowhere near as much of an issue as everything else in this post I know but it is making me more self conscious and less self confident.

I apologise for the incredibly long self pitying post. Any advice on how to improve myself and get out of this rut would be much appreciated. Thank you if you read this far.

41,"So a little over a year ago I made a suicide attempt. I was asked about what my mindset was like a few days ago, and I wrote this, I figured someone would find it interesting, so I'm posting it here. Also, to be clear, I'm in a much better place now.

Question: Where were you mentally at that point in your life?

It's hard to describe. I'd struggled with suicidal thoughts and feelings since I was young. Really young. I remember in the 5th grade feeling a horrible sensation of lonliness and not belonging, of being defective, and like I'd never be able to bond with my peers. I remembered wanting to cut myself, but being scared of frightening my parents. I remember feeling actually suicidal in the 7th grade. And angry. I actually considered hurting my peers. I knew that was wrong though, and I realized that my feelings weren't anyone's fault, especially not some kids my age. I drifted in and out of depression, but by the time I finished high school I thought I'd beaten it. I was wrong. In college it came back with a vengance. My freshman year I sought help. My sophomore year I actually made a suicide attempt.

It's hard to describe that mindset to someone who hasn't lived it. Looking back, I know part of it was that I had changed medications recently and had my dosage upped right before it got really bad. I remember feeling just utterly hopeless. Unable to move for hours at a time. Utterly exhausted no matter how much I ate or didn't eat, slept or didn't sleep. I couldn't muster much mental effort to focus on anything enough to do anything more than eat one meal every other day and pretend not to be so pathetic and maybe shower. And I physically hurt. Nothing felt comfortable, every joint ached. I was always queasy. My head felt achy and dizzy. And I was never able to sleep or relax, or feel fully awake and alert. I felt caught in the middle between waking and sleeping, living and dying. There was this numb, empty feeling in my stomach the whole time as well.

 I had an overwhelming sense that I was in a dire situation and there was absolutely nothing I could do to change it. I knew in my heart that even if I managed the monumental task of achieving some semblence of normalcy, I'd still wind up right back in the same spot no matter how hard I tried not to, and no matter how much help I got from my friends and family and doctors. And I owed it to the people who cared not to be as broken as I was. And seeing as that was an impossibility, the next best thing was to just call it quits before I could hurt them more. Before I cost my parents more wasted money on my school and medical expenses. Before they had to watch me wither into a husk of a person. I thought my girlfriend deserved better then I could ever give her as someone damned to such ab existence, so the least awful thing I could do would be to die sooner rather than later and let her finish grieving while she was still young, and could move one and live the happy memories she would want to. I also thought I could move on from the suicidal thoughts that always came back if I'd just give it an honest effort. I guess I thought I'd either kill myself or I'd kill the cancer in my soul.

I spent a lot of time trying to find a way to attempt suicide which didn't run the risk of becoming a vegtable or leave a horrible mess for whoever found me. I also wanted something which offered a 50/50 chance of living or dying. I didn't find many resources which helped one figure these sorts of things out. Eventually I just kinda freaked out and made a half-baked attempt with what was in my room. I wouldn't recommend the experience. I would reccomend getting treatment and opening up about your problems to whoever you have that can listen and help. It's scary, and people don't always know how to handle it, but it's liberating to not have to hide your secret shame from the whole world.",13May2018,4

I miss having someone to hang out with/talk to during the day when my husband is at work. Kind of nervous posting on here because I don't want to attract any creepers... I just want to meet some people to enjoy the company of who won't try to murder me or sleep with my husband, haha. I'm open to an online friendship, but what I would really like is to meet some people near me that I could be friends with IRL (maybe we could just be ""internet friends"" at first and meet IRL once we know each other better). Anyway, about me: I'm 28, female, and married with a 4 year old son and 2 cats, living in the greater Dayton area of Ohio. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, watching Netflix and playing video games. I also used to go horseback riding a lot when I was younger, but haven't been able to get back into it since getting married and having my son; I would really like to pick it up again. I'm generally easy going and accepting so there's not much that ruffles my feathers, haha. Hope to hear from some of you soon. :) ",13May2018,1
44,"I feel like I need help.  I never want to hurt my amazing husband, but I feel like I'm dragging him down.  I don't even know what I'm asking.  I guess I just want to know if anyone else has ever thought about killing themselves. I hate myself.",13May2018,1
45,"I weathered a lot of storms to get to where I'm at now. I have a good life. I have a good job, money, travel twice a year. I left a loving relationship to get here. She told me to pursue my dream even if it meant letting me go otherwise I'd be resentful of not taking the chance. For a while I struggled a lot, got on medication, got therapy, went through programs. 

Whenever I think of venturing out into dating, I feel too much pressure. Too much pressure to say the right things, to make her laugh, don't say creepy things, be smart, be witty, be interesting, etc. I'm still looking for a relationship out of desperation, not because I'm ready. I don't know if this feeling will stop. Maybe it won't. I can't give into despair. Too much pain. Guess I need more time. Hopefully not the rest of my life.",13May2018,1
46,"Think about it...an alien species that is capable of near-light speed space travel with the intent of taking over a planet is not going to be under-prepared.  Our weapons will be fucking bows and arrows compared to what they have.  There is absolutely no way we can outsmart them.  It's not like they're out there exploring, trying to contact other forms of life.  No, their intent is to take over mother fucking planets.  

""But OP maybe our biologic weapons will be effective against them like in War of the Worlds.""  You think they'll risk being exposed to our fucking atmosphere initially?  If we've thought of that, then you can bet your fucking ass they've thought of it x1000.  They're going to completely insulate themselves from our environment.  If YOU were going to another planet, would you take your helmet and deeply breath in that delicious alien air just because your computer tells you there's 20% oxygen and 80% nitrogen in the air?  I'm looking at you Alien prequel movies (prometheus/covenant).  No, I'd be scared to death about all those alien spores and infectious crap in the air that would fuck my shit up.

Do you think we'll be able to hack our way into their computer system like in Independence Day?  Please, do I even have to address that.  As if we'll have the faintest fucking idea how their technology works.  Do you think if you showed some Aborigine a circuitboard from our desktop computer and gave him a week to figure it out, do you think he's going to have any fucking clue what he's dealing with?  Why do we think that if we're able to obtain alien technology we'd know what to do with it?  How many years do you think it'll take for humans to be able to fly to another fucking solar system and attack a planet...500 years?  Do you think our computers in 500 years will look ANYTHING like the ones we have now?  That's stupid.

During the invasion do you think that humans will somehow find their local central command, or their mother ship, or some other thing that controls all their soldiers and weapons?  Why would they do that?  Why would they allow themselves to be vulnerable?  It makes no sense.  I'm looking at you fucking Battle Los Angeles.  Any alien that wants to send down a command center would blow the entire fucking city to ash before settling in to make sure that would not happen.  Would you settle your mother ship that controls ALLLLL your other ships and weapons anywhere near an alien planet when you're invading it?  Do you think aliens would be caught with their pants down against us?  No, they're going find US with our pants down and fuck our asses up.

Let's stop pretending we'd have any chance against any alien invasion.  We would get so fucked up.  fucking hollywood.  fucking movies.  lets show a movie in which aliens just completely rape our shit up and make us slaves.  because that's exactly what would happen.",13May2018,2
48,"So today I was driving by Geylang, yknow where they had the fair last year? Full of overpriced rainbow food and steamy cold drinks. Everyone fell for the trend, though, including you. You went with your friends, Sun I, Justin, someone else. You never were a person for trends, but you caved in. Sent me a cute video.

I went, too.

Alone, by myself. I went to the place. At 8, on a bus to Dakota and then one stop to Paya Lebar. I got off at the wrong exit, then had to walk all the way back to the station and then the market, alone against the tidal wave of people coming back. 

Did I ever tell you about it? I checked our chat, the daily logs. I never did so. It was the day where zy and the gang and I were supposed to go, and i missed it for guitar class with sensei.

I went because I was angry. Out of sheer denial and refusal to accept that I had no one to go for this Cool and Exciting Thing with, and it was ending soon. I would catch it before it ended. Stuffing a $50 note into my pocket, in a T shirt and denim shorts too loose for me, i went.

It was hell. 

Out of sheer stubbornness, i refused to accept that i got off at the wrong exit and was going the wrong way. it was only after i had departed the pathway and gone off into the residential areas that i was forced to confront the reality and headed back. the crocs cut into my feet and i dug my fingernails into my palms.

it was hell.

when i got there, the tidal wave of people engulfed me. people have always made me feel afraid, yknow? they made me afraid of being alone. at least back then. they were all heading home. i was this one lone agent pushing back. 

i stopped at the traffic light. there was no one crossing. but fuck, i go my own way right? i crossed. and headed over, straight.

there was nothing there. nothing to eat, nothing that looked delicious. the cool rainbow doughnuts were all sold out, and i had no idea where to find them. The remaining food looked overpriced. I had no friends to go with and make it more fun. The fluorescent lights blinded me and made me sick, and the aunties sitting around eyed me warily. Instinctively avoiding the lights, i found myself in a wet market, no longer in the Hipster Fair part they were raving about.

I saw a busker, and smiled. Enjoyed the music for a bit. He was playing a Hari Raya classic, i think, and the families around him were enjoying it. I wished I could relate. Relate to having mustered a skill and having people enjoy it. Family? What family. they werent here, for me, with me. The familiar wave of self hatred rose up like bile in my stomach, and i decided that the pretense of acting to enjoy myself was over. Enough was enough. I backed up, and headed to the MRT. 

On the way back home, i was carried by the crowd. People singing, laughing, talking around me. When I got home, my mother asked me why I only took an hour with my friends. I lied and said i got a stomach ache.

I had never felt more alone in my life. 

Jiacannie, I longed for you. Yet I couldnt touch you, because it was my fault I didnt go for it with ZY and the rest, and i knew you went for it with friends already, so who am i?! I honestly dont know why i didnt. The point of this anecdote is to say that I feel lost. Somehow, with you, I never thought to reach out... you just felt so far away then, and the world and people around me so distant, and faded, and muted. The pain I feel in my heart now is the exact same piercing pain I felt all alone there in the bazaar with no one and everyone beside me, and I am sorry. Reading through our chat... we were so in love back then, no? So desperately in love. I love you now even still, and this pain... perhaps a numbness? a mutedness? a limbo. I am so sorry. I have no doubt we'd be killer, we'd have been amazing together, we really thought... i thought, but i wasnt as perfect as i thought. fuck im flawed. im sorry for screwing this up. towards the end of our relationship, i just gave off and you so much negativity.. i dont know why, and i was trying to get to the bottom of it. Maybe JC? confusing, scary, self hatred everywhere... Maybe we just didnt have it in us. The world feels like the bazaar now... limbo. limbo. limbo. a blur... its 3.27am.",13May2018,1

51,"Went out with my folks today because of Mother's Day. Got my mom a card and gift card, and we went out for a hike. I had a good time, as always. Got on my phone when I got back expecting to see quite a few people wishing me a happy birthday. Not the case.

Let's see, two of my friends wished me one, \(well, it feels like they're my only friends right now\) my boss, two of coworkers, and some dude I haven't seen in a year and a half. I appreciate all of them. Most of my friends have Facebook and are on it a lot, so there's no excuse not to take five seconds out of their day to wish me a happy birthday. It'd make my day. I always wish everybody I consider a friend happy birthday. I've probably wished about 50 people a happy birthday in the past year, through text or call.

52,"That video basically depicts that America depends on entertainment as a distraction from it's social problems. Black people are discriminated against and yet their culture is so popular. I don't get why the video try to push this as some great hypocrisy of American public. America is not a single entity hivemind. There are 330 million people in America. It's ignorant to assume that the people who like and celebrate black culture are also ignoring the discrimination against black people and our doing nothing about it(and vice versa). That video gave me the impression that you can't enjoy something if you aren't raising your voice against discrimination. Which isn't fair. 

Also, America isn't unique in that aspect most of the world have it way worse. Sometimes we NEED distraction in our shitty lives, doesn't mean that we are ignoring or dismissing the injustices and tragedies of our society.",13May2018,1
53,"I dislike and do not love my mother, and she probably didn't even do anything wrong. 

I feel this way about both my parents, but particularly my mother. Every time I'm with her I can only think about how badly I want to be somewhere else, or to never have to hear her voice again. I would much rather have any sum of money than my mother in my life. I sometimes think what would happen if she died, and I suspect I'd be relieved.

Despite this, I am still capable of loving other people, including women. I'm not a bad person because I don't love or like my mother, or feel like I'm somehow obligated to her for deciding to yank me from nothingness into somethingness.

For all others who feel this way, and don't have frequent beatings, sexual abuse, or total absence to point to, you're not alone and I don't think you're bad for feeling this way, even if others never understand your feeling about it.

Feel what you feel, and try to live a good life away from mothers and fathers. You're fine, other's don't know what they're talking about. I suspect almost no one does.

Happy Mother's Day.",13May2018,15
54,"The life guard at the hotel I am staying at. 

I'm ashamed to say that I was watching in confusion as I saw a hand breaching the surface of the water and didn't clock it. The life guard did. It was a kid drowning in the corner of the pool, not able to surface for air. 

The young lad made no fuss, simply dived in, pulled the child to the surface, placed him pool side and administered first aid. The child was dragged off by the parents and the guard sat back in his seat.

I sat there thinking.... He just bloody saved a life. While this is not war and it wasn't an act of heroism... He beat time which would have inevitably killed the kid. 

Just wanted to share this.... As it really went unappreciated on the pool side.",13May2018,24

56,I feel like I’m too young to be feeling this way but I just feel like I’m drowning. Like I’m gasping for breath and my lungs just can’t be filled. I seriously wish that I could die and I cannot go to counselling/therapy as our family can’t afford it also I cannot seem to talk to them. I don’t know what to do. I just feel so worthless and I’ve been having a lot of existential thoughts and I just can’t seem a meaning in life. If it’s to be happy how do I achieve that? If it’s for inner peace then how do I get that? I don’t know. I’m very confused and I just feel like I’m suffocating. I suffer from frequent panic attacks and at one point a few months ago they were so bad that I had one every single day. Once I had 13 in one day and had to be send home early from school. My family just think it’s part of puberty but I just cannot deal with the world anymore. I don’t see a meaning and if I don’t soon I might end my own life. The only reason I’m still here is so I don’t upset my mom but it’s getting more and more difficult to stay here when I’m in so much pain. Please help me. I’m actually begging. ,13May2018,5
57,"This isn't to say that I deserved it more than her, because she's a fantastic filmmaker who graduated valedictorian and I graduated with the lowest-passing GPA (3.0). I was terrible at everything I did and was generally considered to be a lost cause.

But I can't help but be jealous and petty about it, though I'm definitely far worse at it than she is. I make a living as an editor (not what I originally intended but it pays), creating nothing of my own, working on other people's stuff. I'm too stupid to ever be a filmmaker like her, even though we graduated with the exact same degree.

And I wish she was a bad person so I could justify hating her, but she's like the sweetest person around and constantly offered me advice and tried to help me out whenever she could, that's what hurts the most. She *deserves* to be in the world's greatest film festival, while I deserve to be rotting for my lack of ability. ",13May2018,5

59,"And I don't mean that as in ""I deliberately repress my emotions."" I do my best to ""work through"" my feelings, whatever that means. It just doesn't change anything. If I stay with an emotion, if I talk it out with someone, all that shit you're supposed to do, nothing happens.

For example, if I'm angry about something, I just stay angry. I think deeply about *why* I'm angry? Doesn't change anything.

I talk to the person I'm angry with? Usually makes it worse.

I smash a plate? Exactly as angry as before.

I sit in an empty room for six hours? Still angry.

The problem is resolved and there's no reason for me to be angry any more? Irrelevant.

Until something distracts me, I just stay angry. And if I think about it later--be it five minutes or five years later--it's all going to come rushing back with the same energy.

Most people can apparently purge their emotions by experiencing them. I wish I had this superpower. Instead, shit just swirls around in my head like an endless rinse cycle.

60,"I came across this creepy Reddit account where this one guy posts pictures of 4 different girls from his high school. He then asks people to “degrade them” in the comment section. He even goes as far as to call one of them his “girlfriend,” which I highly doubt. Keep in mind these pictures aren’t nudes, just pictures your average teenaged girl posts showing off their bodies.

Never the less, I tried reverse image searching the pictures of the girls to tell them what this creepy fuck is doing, but to no avail. Is there any way I could get an Instagram account with just an image; other than that?

I could give you more information about the account in DM. But, I would rather not make it public. 

This is extra concerning for me because I believe these girls are underaged. So, any advice would be highly appreciated, for their sake.",13May2018,1
