I’m 30 years old and a stay at home Mom right now with a 3 year old. My husband has a new job opportunity where he will be making more than enough to comfortably support us and has let me know if I want to take the opportunity to go back to school, now would be the best time. I just have my high school diploma. I don’t really have any interest in anything, and can’t decide what to go to school for or how to really get started. I worked since I was 15 and just quit my last job 6 months ago because we were having issues with my sons daycare. I have worked doing data entry/receptionist/office manager and also an at home customer service agent for an insurance company. I have pretty much dabbled in lots of work areas. Ideally I would like to do something that I can do from home, and I definitely do not want to do something that requires me to be on the phone the whole time. I am a quick learner and have been fortunate enough to excel in any job I have had, but like I said I just don’t know what to go to school for. I want to do this so once my son does start school I can have something to do, and also feel like I can contribute again when the time comes. Any suggestions?",20Feb2018,1

Finally the most recent one a girl I started talking to. We were talking for a while and went to a dance together. As soon as the dance was over it was like I didn't exist. It was like as soon as I let myself get attached she let go of me. The first one I was just mad at myself. The second one I believe was just bad timing if I would have waited a few days she would have said yes. The third one just destroyed me. ,20Feb2018,3

11,"Lately people have been angry at the loss of the community cats found on the park nearby a hotel. Apparently they've been trying to get rid of them since November but successfully eradicated them sometime around Valentine's. 

The cats have a group of volunteers taking care of them from food to vaccines in association with animal non-profit organizations. And they were the ones who noted the sudden disappearance of the cats. 

It got viral and people started asking what happened to the cats. In my country there are only two options when that happens, either they relocated the cats or have them killed. The first official response of the hotel was their employees adopted them. The second one was that the pest company released it to a residential place outside the area. 

People coordinated an official search and didn't find the cats in the areas they provided. Honestly floored by the extent of care they gave this issue. Still it wasn't enough.

Now people are angry and like what most Facebook people do, they flood the hotel and pest company's pages. I don't condone the brigading because it destroys the little integrity rating systems have. However hundreds of people reporting their accounts getting locked is really suspicious. Here's a sample [explanation](https://imgur.com/Pqq2Myf). 

Now I'm aware of Facebook's community rules and it's reasonable to be banned for offensive language and spam. But they made it look like people were logging into these people's accounts. My theory is that their post were being reported enmasse which got their account locked. But are there any other reasons for this? 

Anyway I hope they find the cats soon. Even in this tragedy it's good to know citizens managed to show their care for strays this much. Our animal rights sentiment in general is not up to par with Western countries but it's nice to know people are trying care more and do more.

12,"When I was around 15 and my sister was 11 I asked her for a back-scratch for the first time I can remember. I was surprised when she said yes. A few facts about my sister: she’s smart, strong, and hates when I tell her what to do. In the years following that day my sister gave me a back-scratch any time I wanted, for as long as I wanted, how I wanted (all nail to skin). It was like a trance, if she was doing something, and I told her to scratch my back she’d stop what she was doing and scratch my back. However, when she was around 15 or 16 her attitude changed. I recall one time she gave me a backscratch but got annoyed when I told her how to scratch. When she was 16 I asked her for one and she got angry saying she was embarrassed she ever did that and would “never” do it again. However, two weeks later we were sharing a room on vacation and after asking nicely she gave me a nice backscratch in bed.

A few questions:

In the first place why did my sister do this? It seemed she wouldn’t lift a finger for me unless it was to run its nail down my back.

Why did my sister’s attitude change? These backscratches have always happened when it’s just the two of us and our relationship didn’t otherwise change around that time.

Why do you think she switched her position when we were on vacation together?

I know these are weird questions, but I’m curious what you think.",20Feb2018,0

14,"First time poster on this sub, I would just like to get some thoughts out. 

I decided that this year I was going to limit my phone usage and spend more time on my mental wellness. Taking myself out to places, working out regularly, feeding my body nutritious foods, getting 8 hours of sleep, read and write more. surround myself with good friends and family; that sort of thing. 

Well how does phone usage tie into that? I can’t speak for others, but for myself I feel as if my phone can be addicting. I have realized I check it often. Very very very often. I’m clicking on app to app to gain some sort of entertainment. Watching other people portray themselves in a different light for the world to see on social media. Instant gratification. Never ending pointless text convos. Hours spent on the Instagram explore page, internally critiquing and criticizing things I don’t like about other people and hell about myself. 

So I decided that I was going to take a break. Phone is on do not disturb, social media notifications are off, text notifications are off. I want to absorb myself among many other things.

“But you’re on Reddit”

Ok yes, fair. I enjoy Reddit for its anonymity, I feel as if none of us really give a damn about how others perceive ourselves to be on here. This is the only app I use, predominantly right before bed. I like to lurk and play on ask ouija. Let me have one guilty pleasure, please and thank you. 

Overall, I just want to focus on the little things. I want to see the world and its people for what it/they really are. I won’t be able to do that constantly behind  a screen. ",20Feb2018,3

18,"As silly as it sounds, Paul's songs and contributions were short-sighted and uniquely too-British (felt John), whilst John's songs were breaking all boundaries of music and adhered to nothing conventional. John could break free and innovate, and Paul's innovation was lacking, yet he was a better ""musical"" writer, if you will. They needed something from each other, and they both fucking hated it; especially when it came to contractually-dictated mutual-ownership of each and every song credited to ""Lennon/McCartney"". I'll rest on my laurels in betting that Paul hated that John's name was first, and John absolutely loved it; maybe not at first, but had he lived to see the day... 

Add to this, that despite whatever their individual limitations may have been, they were both absolutely astounding writers/musicians. That's not even taking Starr and Harrison's contributions into consideration...

They are likely two of the best musical artists that have ever lived, and somehow by the divine way of the multiverse: they happened upon each other. Cheers, and thanks.

20,"So I am a senior in high school now and my time at my school will be over relatively soon. I’ve been thinking about the time I’ve spent there and I just feel like I don’t have many stories to tell. Like you watch the movies that take place in high school of teens doing dumb things and falling in love and having fun and I just feel like I never did any of those things. I know those films are necessarily realistic but I feel like even my classmates have done things that they will at least remember down the line. I’ve never had a girlfriend, never drank, never smoked, granted I’ve had a group of close friends that I’ve done most things with but I feel like I have not made that many friends at school. I just hope I don’t regret this when high school does end. Anyways, I’m pretty much just venting but any advice would be much appreciated.

21,"Hello, I am a junior and am about to choose my classes for the next year. I want to major in compsci, and know how to code but that is kinda besides the point, I just want to give more context to my dilemma.

So the main thing I am deciding on right now is whether or not to take AP Physics C, or AP Biology. Currently, I am taking AP Physics 1&amp;2 and am doing mediocre. I go to a school that has a lot of smart people and I can say that I probably lie in the middle-low of the pack in physics even though I consider myself pretty good at math. I also feel like I didn't completely grasp the first semester of physics too well either, and I still don't write my units.. AP Bio on the other hand is apparently much easier and will probably be an A if I take it.

So I have been pondering about this and have come up with the pros and cons of both, and I would like your opinion about it:

AP Physics C:

 * I want to major in compsci, itll be way more useful for me and also look better on my transcript and when I tell colleges that ""I want to major in compsci""
 * I kinda like physics: even though I might not be the best at it, I loved the first semester and it just made me see the world in a completely different way
 * CON: I might do pretty bad since I didn't fully grasp the first semester of physics 1&amp;2

AP Bio:

 * Is an AP class and will fill my AP science course and will look better on transcript
 * much easier, most likely A
 * CON: I'm scared colleges will think, ""don't you wanna be a compsci major? why tf are u taking ap bio and not ap physics c""
 * i honestly don't care for bio

22,"(I’m a senior in high school btw. I’ve struggled with social anxiety my whole life and have been wanting to beat it for a while now)

There’s this girl who I hooked up with drunk a couple months ago, and since then she’s been showing very obvious. signs of interest. She’d text me “hi” a lot, she suggested we hang out some time at the party, and even snapped me “you said hi to me today :)” a few hours after we said hi in the hallway once. There’s much more I can’t think of right now but basically I thought she was really into me.

About a month I had the courage to ask her to hang out during the weekend and she said “yeah ofc” and *she* even suggested we do her house when I brought up watching a movie. But she added that her family was having dinner at 4 so we had to do the daytime. I was so siked to get the chance to finally beat my social anxiety and be happy. 

Unfortunately, she later told me that her sister was leaving early and that she couldn’t hang. I got pretty depressed was overthinking a lot of shit after that. I questioned if I did something wrong once she started taking a little longer to answer snaps. Even through the doubt I decided I would ask her again, and I did a week later. She said “yea I’ll seeing if I can :)”. I felt a little better, but the uncertainty still ate at me.

Then an hour ago I asked her if she wanted to hang and she replied “I’m having friends over tn at 7.”  And added“another day tho :)” didn’t make me feel much better. But at least i thought there was hope. 

Guess not.

I waited a few weeks to see if she’d initiate but there was nothing. Just constant snaps sent back and forth. I contemplated trying *one* more time, and I eventually did on Friday.

Since we were having a week long break that I’m currently on, I gave her the open opportunity of hanging out during the week. I asked if she wanted to, and she said “yea sure”. I didn’t want to end up in the same place, so I said if she was ever free to just tell me and she said “yea I’ll lyk”.

Now it’s Monday (technically tuesday at this point) and she’s left me on read late at night two nights in a row for the first time. Even as early as it is in the week right now, I don’t think she’s going to really “let me know”.

I would normally be depressed, but for some reason, I feel great. I don’t have anymore obsessive thoughts and don’t give a shit if this doesn’t happen. I’m sitting here watching Marvel movies and enjoying my break with my friends

I gotta wonder though. Why would she do this? What if I was like, in love with her? She gave all these obvious and strong signs of interest and she flakes two (going on three) times? If that’s bad enough she *agreed* to hanging out and gave false hope when she flaked! 

Looking back, I see how blinded I was by my feelings. I remember at the party she hard time saying no to the guys trying to get with her at the party we hooked up at . I realized how silly I was to put her on some pedestal. 

I realize that I have to focus on me and only me. Rejection is *okay*. There are millions of other girls out there. No more what ifs. No more what could’ve beens. I know this now

24,"As an avid gamer since I was a child, I am both amazed and horrified with the modern gaming world. Everything is digital nowadays, and people as young as seven years old have become addicted to games. Kids, teenagers, young adults, adults, all pulling in countless hours into video games, pulling themselves away from real life and harming their potential in the future. 

As a 24 year old, I am a victim of my gaming addiction and have put away real world responsibilities for far too long. No job experience, little to no volunteering experience, not bilingual, almost graduating from undergrad (finally) is starting to show how behind I am. This rat-race is intense and all my friends are driven to get experience to pursue the white collar path. I am personally an advocate for blue collar and think it should be pursued more without the stigma.

I often hear that gaming is a ""hobby"" or a ""passion"", but when people starting pulling away minimum 4-5 hour sessions, it's scary. Please, please, understand the harm it can do to you. It has already done wonders on my ""future"" already. ",20Feb2018,0

Writing is the best remedy for worry, It calms you down and relieve stress, Writing feels extremely uncomfortable on a norman lewis book of vocabulary which anyone could read      

FUCK OFF,  IF YOU ARR READING THIS

but ranveer singh won't feel uncomfortable writing down anything. he js so bold that once he told to a news reporter that he losts his virginity at age 13.      

So i don't give a fuck if someone would read this

like i never got offended or triggered to anything at all.

my resolution of 2018 is to bulk up         

Writing is the best thing in the world it helps in keeping yourself calm         

So now everything is clear for me (i think so, fortunately)        
• Worry         
• If you can do something→then do it→ then why worry         
• if you can't do anything→ thwn why worry

30,"First of all, I want to acknowledge how fundementally stupid short post is. I'm basically just explaining my distaste for the way H3H3 criticizes people or concepts. But the way that he argues seems so... illogical. I just can't put my finger on it, but I KNOW there's an intellectual FAR superior to me that would be able to describe it. I was listening to a podcast from him and it got to a point where he was dismissed a handful of arguments against Elon Musk launching his Roadster into space, most of them being that the public is giving it a lot of attention instead of other very topical issues. He made claims like, ""launching a Roadster is more interesting than using his money to help starving children"", or, ""its his money, hes not obligated to help anyone with it."" While I'm not saying I disagree or agree with him, I feel like answering questions like this CANNOT BE the most proper way to refute someone's ideas, but again, I could be wrong. Another thing he seemed to do was ""call out"" another YouTuber for being very disrespectful at an important religious place of worship. While you definitely should be respectful at places of worship, he fails to mention that he, and plenty of his ""friends"" have done similar things in the past, and he himself has engaged in unsavory activities that he has condemned in other cases.

I'm not the most up to date with these events, but can anyone explain tell me what I'm missing here? I fail to see why people support him so much.

Ever think maybe those things only ever happened to misguided teenagers, where they got bored, got drunk and eventually ended up in a car crash? Hell, I'll bet that's the image you conjure up when you hear this phrase. I know I do.

I've been told I'm a boring dude. I mean, I know I'm quiet, I read a lot, play a lot of games, watch a lot of shows and movies, come to think of it, most of my interests lie in things I can do solo. Never really been called the life of a party that's for sure. Wait a minute. Maybe I am boring. Wow. That hurts. Is it *me*? Am I doing something wrong? I'm certainly not bored with my sci-fi and anime. I live what I consider a pretty curious and engaged life. Why are you bored of me?

Hold on. Why do I feel guilty if you're bored.

I examined that spark of guilt. I found that I'm hard wired to react to someone else's boredom with guilt. Because I'm causing them to be bored. My ramblings are causing them to tune out, stop expending precious energy towards something that's not reaching them at any level. But *I'm* not bored while ""rambling"" on. So why are you? And why do I care so much about that?

Boredom is not an affliction. You don't catch it off chronically bored people like a cold. You can't be cursed with it by someone. It's essentially your mind responding to lack of meaningful stimulus by causing anxiety so you'll actively search for it. It arises from within. And the human way of expressing this formless anxiety is a loud interjection proclaiming your state of mind to anyone who would listen. And of course, blaming them for causing you this anxiety that's due to your failure to connect.

You blame a person and they react with guilt, as anybody (with empathy) would, when faced with it. They scramble to find a way to amuse you, to inject novelty into your brief relationship, so you'll feel better. In short, they're doing what your mind wants *you* to do when you're bored, find a new stimulus.

Boredom isn't someone's fault. It's your own. The onus of correcting that feeling isn't on them, it's on you. Take up rock climbing. Travel. Crack open a book. Call a friend. Do something, but *do it yourself*, instead of blaming and subsequently punishing the listener for your discomfort. Because that's what we do. We punish them.

It's different every time. Small punishments may be that spark of guilt we induce into someone's heart just by telling them you're bored. You could easily rephrase that and say the whole sentence that you're implying anyway, ""I'm bored, and *it's all your fault*"", and shatter their self confidence. Hell, if you really wanted to punish them, you could cheat on your spouse to experience something ""new"", because you blame them for your boredom. Or make the listener an accomplice in a crime that could destroy their careers, futures or even their lives, just because they caused you boredom. Like rob a joint. Go drinking and joy riding. Shoplifting a pack of gum. Harass a stranger. You know, those things that stupid teenagers do when they're bored.

Well, I never really gave thought to the fact that I've been exclusively eating pasta or rice with some meat and raw vegetables for a few months now.

So, I had a two week break a short while ago and me being in college and free from my parents, I of course got drunk or high nearly every night, socially in the weekends but on my own as well. I didn't really see the severity so I kept at it for a few days when school began, but noticed I had problems concentrating and memorizing stuff so I stopped drinking on weekdays immediately.

Two days pass and I feel foggy as hell and figured it might be some light alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Hell, I'd been drinking every night for three weeks straight at that point and drank half a quart of whisky on Saturday alone, it wouldn't surprise me. Monday evening I had a school essay due in a few hours so I drank like 4 cups of coffee and cranked it out.

That's when the fogginess I'd been feeling went totally crazy. My eyesight felt out of focus, couldn't concentrate on anything, felt like puking and curling up in bed. And a wave of depression hit me like it hadn't in months if not years, some pretty bad suicidal urges. At this point I felt like the alcohol and drug use (just weed, but that's nothing to joke about when it comes to mental health) had fucked me up in the head and I was experiencing derealisation or even turning psychotic. Maybe something to with dopamine levels, I didn't know so I drank a bunch of water and eventually fell asleep. I'd like to emphasize how fucked up I was feeling; I really thought I was losing it, maybe permanently.

Today I went to school again, feeling a bit better after a night of sleep but still pretty damn distant and very melancholy. Did some more googling and came up with vitamin deficits. Bought some B complex supplement, took 2, now it's 5 hours later and I dare to say I'm feeling sharper and less depressed already.

I'm definitely not understating sudden alcohol withdrawal to have pushed me into a bad mental break, though. That in combination with sudden school stress AND way too much caffeine late in the evening probably didnt help either. I'm just hoping the vitamins aren't working as a placebo and I'll be myself again in a day or two if I keep taking them. Man, what a weird fucking week. Not planning on quitting social drinking just yet but on school days I'm definitely done with it.",20Feb2018,4
51,"**Sunday Morning**: I show up to work to find out that the switch from my favorite shift (sunday day) to my least favorite (saturday day) is permanent and not just temporary

**Sunday night**: My best friend is supposed to drop something off at my place at a certain time. Best friend flakes on me to hang out with his gf. He set the time, he knows that it really hurts my feelings since he has done it a couple times in the recent past and I told him how it makes me feel.

**Later Sunday night**: me and best friend get into an argument about how he keeps massively hurting my feelings and doesn't seem to give a shit.

Since then I have been shut up in my apt crying my fucking eyes out slowly realizing that he is a crappy friend and that I need to scale back friendship or completely end it. He is basically my only friend and I know that I might suicide without him in my life.

52,"It's not for any big, single reason; I just feel like it's time to move on. I've put so much of my time and energy into this job. I've become really close to all of my co-workers, my bosses are great people that I've always been proud to work for, and, for the most part, I genuinely enjoy the work that I do there.

But I do feel as though I'm a little *too* dedicated to it. Like I'm making it a much bigger part of my life and identity than I ought to, for something that's just supposed to be a way of making money. Lately, I've been thinking of all the times I've had to bend over backwards for that place and marvel at the fact that some of these things didn't make me quit right then and there. It's because I've respected the people too much, and because I've been convincing myself for so long that there wouldn't be a better job out there, when, probably, there is. I just haven't gone looking for one.

Besides all that, the place has gone through a *huge* number of changes during my time there, more than they've ever seen in their 25 years of being open, and at this point it's almost become an entirely different place than it was when I first started. It looks different, the employee dynamic is different, the customer base is different, and a lot of what we serve there is different. A lot of the things I loved most about working there are totally missing, now, and I didn't realize it until recently because it's all happened so gradually.

I don't want to become the embittered employee who ought to have quit a long time ago. We already have a couple of those, and nobody likes working with them because their attitude coming in is always so shitty and negative. I've always told myself that if it ever reaches a point where I go for a whole month feeling bitter about my job there, I'd know it was finally time to leave. I feel like I've reached that point. Now it's just a matter of finding the courage to let my superiors know I'm considering it seriously.

My biggest reservation about leaving (and this might sound a tad narcissistic) is that I truly don't know what they are going to do without me. Not *me* as a person, but my seniority and experience. I'm one of the only long-term employees left, and one of only a few managers who has mostly open availability. If I left, they'd have to promote someone to manager, and the selection right now is so rough, and I don't think they realize it because they've been taking it for granted that the managers we have right now will just stick around forever. I wish I didn't care so much about the issues they might face after I've already left, but, like I said, these people are my friends and I'd feel like I was abandoning them by leaving, which hurts. 

Basically, I'm just really conflicted and I don't know how to bring it up to the GM.",20Feb2018,1
53,"The 2nd Amendment states that *because* a ""well regulated militia"" is *necessary* for the security of a free state, the right of ""the people"" to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. But what does that mean? To answer that we first need to define some of the terms being used. The Founding Fathers believed that a free state could not exist without a well regulated militia; that its existence was absolutely necessary for our nation's existence, so let's start there because I happen to agree with them.

At the time it was written, something that was ""well regulated"" was something that was maintained in good working order and functioning as intended. So a ""well regulated militia"" would be one that was filled with people who were healthy and able bodied, responsible, armed with weapons they were proficient with, and ready and willing to fight when called upon if needed.

With that in mind, I believe that every person who chooses to exercise their right to keep and bare arms is volunteering to be a member of this nation's militia by default...because as stated in the 2nd Amendment, it only exists to ensure that the militia has access to the arms they need to carry out their function. So what is the militia and what is its function?

The militia is ""the people"" mentioned in the 2nd Amendment, and ""the people"" are the militia. The militia is more than a lynch mob or posse, but less than an army. It is a fighting force made up of common people called upon during times of extreme distress to maintain the safety and security of our free state. Because they are not an army, they do not have the budget nor logistics to supply their members with arms or supplies and as such, members are required to use their personally owned weapons and supplies when activated; the militia is quite frankly our nation's last line of defense against all enemies foreign and domestic and they need to arrive at the fight ready to engage immediately if called upon.
 
So now that we've defined it, how can we ensure that our militia is well regulated? We'll get to its function a little later.

First we have to ensure that they are healthy and able bodied. This can be accomplished by requiring individuals to submit to a health screening that includes a mental health check prior to being allowed to purchase a weapon. This screening should be completed by a licensed physician who has a knowledge of the history of the individual. (i. e. an  individual's primary care physician, not a government sponsored ""gun doctor""). This check should ensure that the individual is both physically and mentally capable of accepting the responsibility of legal gun ownership, and it should be repeated every 2-3 to 3-5 years for as long as the individual owns firearms.  ""Physician Approval"" could be revoked at any time if the physician deems it prudent due to a change in the physical or mental health of a current gun owner.  Physicians should be required to provide documentation to show ""just cause"" for denials or revocation,  and should include what steps would be required in order for the individual to be approved (assuming the impairment is temporary and an individual's rights could be restored in the future). PCPs who question the mental state of a patient could require them to be evaluated by a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist to get a more thorough picture of their mental health prior to deciding whether to approve or deny an application. Every denial should be entered in a database to be easily indexed and checked as part of the background check for firearm purchases.  I don't feel this would violate any HIPAA standards because the choice to exercise your right to keep and bear arms is made voluntarily, so any required HIPAA waiver that would need to be signed would be entered into voluntarily as well.  I don't think any system could be perfect so some mentally ill people will invariably fall through the cracks and wind up possessing weapons they shouldn't have because nothing is fool proof, but at the same time I feel expecting or demanding a zero percent fail rate is unreasonable.  For that reason I don't feel any doctor should be held liable or responsible for approving an application for someone who then goes on to kill innocent people unless it was obvious negligence on the doctor's part that allowed the possession, or continued possession, to occur.

So now we've determined that they're healthy and able bodied, next we have to ensure they are responsible. This can be easily accomplished via the criminal background check system currently in place. That system should be expanded to include every gun purchase and sale so it needs to be accessible to the public for a nominal fee to facilitate private party sales and end the ""gun show loophole"". No firearms should be legally sold in this country without the buyer first having undergone a background check and health screening. 

Ok they have demonstrated they are healthy, able bodied, and responsible so now we need to ensure that they are armed with weapons they are proficient with. Because an ""unregulated militia"" has the potential to cause more harm than good,  we need to ensure that our militia is capable of carrying out their function without causing undue harm to others during times when they are needed.  When it was written, there was no need to include firearm training in the 2nd Amendment because an individual who couldn't shoot well didn't typically eat well.  Firearms were a much larger part of the average person's life back then so they maintained both their weapon and their skill of using it safely and effectively more than the average person today does so we need to ensure gun owners are skilled in the safe and effective use of their weapons. This can be accomplished by requiring prospective gun owners to complete a 40hr gun safety course prior to their first purchase, and complete an annual 8hr refresher course for as long as they own firearms. Gun owners should be required to demonstrate their proficiency by shooting a qualifying course of fire every 6 months for every type and caliber of weapon owned. (i. e. an individual that owns four 9mm semi-automatic handguns from different manufacturers would only need to shoot 1 of them, but an individual that owned 4 Glocks all of different calibers would need to shoot all 4. The same rules would apply to long guns and shotguns. This requirement could be satisfied by individuals submitting documentation that shows regular trips to the range, filled tags that document successful hunts, or other such information that shows regular practice.

So now they're healthy and able bodied, responsible, and effectively armed...but are they willing and able to fight if called upon? Individuals would demonstrate their willingness to fight if needed by simply exercising their right and purchasing a weapon. 

But what kind of weapons should be available to members of the militia, and by extension the people?  I think that should be determined by the purpose of the militia itself. So what's the purpose of this militia I keep talking about?

As I said before, the militia is our country's last line of defense against both attack and tyranny; but how do they accomplish that mission? I feel that the most effective use of the militia during the times they would be needed would be to utilize them to maintain law and order in a given area of responsibility (i. e. their ""home turf"" whether it's local, state, or national depending on the circumstances) since the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of the military to perform that function on American soil.

In the event our government becomes tyrannical, the revolution that would occur would not take the form of Americans taking up arms to march on DC and engage our government in a fire fight, that's just sheer lunacy.  The most logical response to a tyrannical government is for the people to simply succeed and declare their independence, and the only thing necessary for them to maintain that independence is to simply defend the ground they occupy.  It is so rare to defeat an entrenched fighting force using guerrilla tactics to defend their own land that it has almost never happened throughout human history. Some of the greatest wars ever lost were lost to the underdog defending home turf with seemingly insufficient firepower and personnel.

Peasants and farmers were able to successfully defend the ground they occupied against the full power of the US military (a nuclear power at the time and the only one in the history of mankind to ever use one against an enemy) for over a decade in Vietnam. Freedom fighters in the Middle East have been successfully defending their own land for over a century, at times against multiple tyrannical nuclear powers at once, with primitive weapons and camels. It almost doesn't matter how big and bad your army is, you are almost guaranteed to fail when you try to invade an area you're unfamiliar with, against the wishes of an armed local population intent on keeping you out. 

As far as the nuclear angle is concerned, a government fighting a revolting population is not attempting to annihilate them, they are attempting to bring them back into the fold in order to continue enjoying the goods and resources produced by that population.  There is no ""win"" achieved by nuking your own soil in an attempt to kill a rebellion and I feel it's ridiculous to even entertain the idea that it would be an option. 

Keeping all of that in mind, in order to maintain law and order a militia needs access to all of the tools necessary to perform that task.  That means that members of the militia, and by extension the people, should be able to keep and bear any weapon that is available for use on duty to any officer or agent of every law enforcement agency in the country.

To be clear, I'm speaking strictly toward law enforcement. Weapons of war only available for use by members of the military do not apply to this discussion as members of the military aren't simply citizens. Officers and agents of law enforcement are citizens first and their respective careers second, while members of the military are soldiers first and citizens second.

If a law enforcement agency determines that a particular weapon is necessary in order to fulfill their function, that weapon should be available for use by the citizenry that agency serves. Weapons used by local LE agencies should be available to everyone in that jurisdiction, weapons available to state agencies should be available to everyone in that state, and weapons available to federal agencies should be available to everyone in the country because I feel that a government that uses weapons against its citizens that it prohibits those citizens from possessing themselves is the definition of oppressive. Officers and agents of law enforcement are not a special class of citizen and should not be given more rights than others based on their chosen profession. I should know, I proudly served as a Federal Law Enforcement Officer for 5 years once upon a time in what seems like a lifetime ago, and I wasn't anything special when I was filling that role.

I don't see any reason to allow a person who does not agree with what I feel are completely reasonable and absolutely common sense gun control measures to own a firearm. I also don't see any reason to restrict the type of weapons that can be owned by someone who successfully completes these steps as they will have demonstrated that they are capable of being safe and responsible gun owners, and any gun in the hands of a safe and responsible individual is no more dangerous than any other. Any person who was found in possession of a weapon, and not in compliance with the law, would be punished severely (I feel a sentence in the 20 to life neighborhood would be appropriate).

Now you may be asking yourself ""What does this have to do with school shootings and how does any of this make us safer?"". The answer is quite simply ""Nothing, and it doesn't"". My thoughts are not about safety because safety is an illusion. It always has been and it always will be, and it's usually an incredibly expensive illusion to maintain. My thoughts are geared toward building and establishing the well regulated militia that our forefathers knew was absolutely vital to our survival, because eventually they're going to be needed, and if they were to be called up tomorrow the one that would report would be anything but ""well regulated"" as a whole.   No, my thoughts are not intended to make us safe, they are intended to keep us free because **you cannot be both safe and free at the same time**. It simply can't be done.

Now I'm going to address the obvious elephant that I've left over in the corner. In order to track compliance with everything I've proposed, it will effectively create a database of gun owners that carries a high potential for abuse by both a tyrannical government and thieves looking for targets...among others. As I said before, expecting or demanding a zero percent failure rate is just not reasonable, and that cuts both ways. I feel we've reached a point in society where such a database is simply unavoidable, and being included in it is just the price an individual has to pay in order to exercise their right. The level of the illusion of safety demanded by the public requires it, and I feel that demand is perfectly reasonable. I feel the risk to the individual if it is abused is far outweighed by the benefits such a database would provide to society.

54,"And it's a scary thought honestly. Twenty-one, last semester of college, just got a job, and I might be moving in with my boyfriend in the beginning of April into a small townhouse just 30 minutes away from my family, and it's scary to think about. It's scary because I think about time. A year or two ago, I never thought I would do it and yet, here I am possibly getting ready to make the move once my boyfriend and I view the place and see if it's to our liking. It's a month before what we planned (originally the end of May) and the monthly rent and location are so convenient that we're just baffled. In about 2 weeks once we have our work schedules, we're going to make time to go and see the place since my parents will be working on it (and leasing it coincidentally enough) and it just makes me feel like I'm growing up a lot faster then I think. 
I'll be leaving a place of familiarity to me soon and now that I glance at my room, I realize that I only have a month to organize my belongings and figure out what I will be taking and what I will be leaving behind. I feel like there's so much to go through, but at the same time it's probably very little. I know internally what I will already be taking and what I'll more then likely leave behind, but the amount of sorting and tossing that needs to be done overwhelms me mentally. I know it'll take time, and I try not to let it discourage me. I'm already planning to dedicate the entirety of March to organizing and sorting through my stuff in a methodical fashion, starting from my dresser and making my way around the room.
It's still weird to think about, like the time I started driving. It's all just sinking in that soon I'll have my own space to call home and be sharing it with someone I absolutely love and adore. We'll hopefully have a dog to call our own and we're already talking about what to do with the potential space if we get it. I'm almost certain we will, but sometimes you never know. My parents had offered the place to one of my uncles, as well as my older brother, but they already expressed how much happier they would be if I got the place instead since it's close to home and will give them some peace of mind.
It's still scary though, and I know I'll probably have a hard time adjusting in the beginning and getting used to the idea of being away from home and having a place to myself but I know once I get used to it, I'll enjoy it. I'll enjoy being able to see my boyfriend daily, having a dog, my own space, and just getting out of how noisy and busy my house is on the regular and finally having that privacy and silence I only get in the early mornings or late nights. I know I'll miss home though, I'll miss the familiarity that comes with being around everyone. But it's a part of life. It's a part of growing up and living the experience of becoming an adult in the end.

The insomnia and anxiety is gonna suck though. Definitely not looking forward to that. But I'm still excited in the end and if the place is better then described, my boyfriend will be beyond thrill as well (he also lives at home so this will be his first time moving as well). I'm just hoping all goes well.",20Feb2018,4
56,"Just a running state of consciousness I'm having.  

We need to limit social media exposure to all people until they are 21 years of age. The rise of the internet in the mid to late 90's matches that of the school shootings that rise. The problem isn't guns..it's how kids are interacting, what they are being exposed to, etc..  

It's growing depression, isolationism, peer pressure, stress, etc. People want likes, they want attention..and it's become a giant game on who can become the most popular. The Logan Paul's of this world have been raised on social media. 

And add on access to high powered weapons that people can get quite easily, mind you, on top of everything else is a perfect storm recipe. Banning AR-15's won't stop school shootings.  The gun isn't the limiting factor here...no kid has said .... 

""Well shit...guess I will just go to school today instead of killing everyone...my parents took my AR-15 away"" 

They will opt for a smaller gun, like the ones used at Virginia Tech, and do whatever their motivation will allow them to do.  Removing the guns won't fix the health and mental problem that social media has sickened us with. 

Families don't sit anymore for dinner. And when they do, everyone (parents included) are on their phones..browsing, scrolling, liking, commenting, etc.. The environment is perfectly aligned to create these young murderers..and in some cases, their parents are shit.  Worthless parents create worthless children. 

Kids can access porn so easily with the click of a button.  Back in my day..you had to work for it.  You actually had to click the ""Are you 18?"" splash page..now the various tube sites just let you go straight in and do what you wanna do. This adds to men and women having growing insecurities with their body, with what is realistic in sex (I've read plenty of the horror relationship stories where guys choke girls or try to do stuff because they think it's normal...wtf no it's not). And because of this lack of reality due to porn...it raises anxiety in both sexes on how to even approach relationships.   

If we are talking about gun reform...why aren't we talking about social media reform. Why should these 9 year olds be allowed to have a phone and have social media related accounts?  

Gun shootings will continue, and no gun law will stop it..outside of some force coming down and literally evaporating the 300 million guns in this country. People are mentally unhealthy..and it's not a medication thing. Society and home life has bred it. And what you will have now...with the pressure to reform guns, are crazy fucking people who will do crazy ass shit just to prove a point.  Someone will shoot up a school or blow it up JUST to prove banning AR-15's isn't the problem. 

Just like riots were planned and generated via the RNC and DNC to try and make a candidate look bad. It's as likely the DNC planned it as the RNC..because the RNC would self sabotage itself for the pity points. It's the same thing with gun control....some group will do something and blame the other side.  

Scary times are upon us..and it's only going to get worse, unfortunately.  Trump won't do shit about it, he doesn't even think climate change is real. He won't even listen to a guy like @elonmusk who landed reusable rockets and sent a car into space about the planet and it's health.  But not just shitting on Trump...I don't have faith in any politician, they are all fucking political hacks who honestly don't give a shit. They give a shit because it gets television views, clicks to their websites, eyesballs on their twitter feed, etc..

WAH WAH WAH RUSSIA HACKED OUR ELECTION.  Give me a fucking break. Sure they tried...they didn't even make a fucking dent. Media gave Donald Trump $6 billion in Free advertising.  FREE FUCKING ADVERTISING. The Media and DNC propped Trump up thinking he would be an easy lay, and boy did that back fucking fire on them.  Russia took out FB ads, Twitter bots, and Reddit bots trying to sway discussion...and people think the minds of American's who had to choose over a smelly dick like Trump or a disease ridden vagina like Hillary were changed. People had their mind made up months before the election. 

I used to be a member of the_donald. I got banned, over the dumbest shit in the world...god forbid I'd ask a question about the 2nd amendment.  I was never a fan of Trump, that wasn't why I was a member. I voted for Stein. I enjoyed seeing the other side of the coin. I felt there were valid points often brought up to counter the hypocritical media and democrats.  I thought the memes were funny.  But if you don't deep throat that Donald cock and lick the balls at the same time, insta-ban.  Fuck that.  Fuck them, I hope the sub does get removed from Reddit now. I tried to defend them, tried to defend why I was a member there for a long time despite the non stop downvotes I'd get..all because I felt they should have a voice and that at times, they brought up valid points.  No more.  And the politics sub reddit is an STD covered shithole, filled with paid mods and bots as well. You wanna blame Russia manipulating the election..well blame Russia and the DNC like David Brock's share blue bullshit rotting that sub to the core.  I'm glad shareblue was banned.  I'd be perfectly fine with both the politics sub reddit and the_donald being removed from Reddit altogether.  

Back to the gun thing...I mean fuck...alcohol related deaths account for almost 3x that of gun related deaths..yet here we are, passing laws so that states who have no alcohol purchases on Sunday (which is an old weird law) can start selling.  You can go to a bar and get shitfaced on Sunday..but don't fucking go to the store to buy your liquor.  

There is a school massacre sized death x 3 almost every single day in this country.  About 85 to 100, every fucking day.   219 or so die from something alcohol related.   

Mind fucking blowing.

I'm all over the place with this rant..just a stream of consciousness. Sorry.  Carry on Reddit.

That explains why only I am laughing at my jokes) That said turns everyone into a compilation of ""Top 40 Hits from the 70's of how your mother handles the fact that the store ran out of milk"" or shortly a collection of reactions which reflect to the surrounding events. And the best part of all this is that you have to find by yourself in what delightful soup the conditions turned you. 

This here is my recipe.

First, here is a major aspect that I think has to be kept in mind. I bet it sometimes happens to you, when you watch a movie and also lets it's drama and you recognize yourself in one of the characters and you really dig into the movie to see what happens with ""you"". Well, I too sometimes capture myself doing that but also, sometimes I imagine if my life was a movie and to be honest no matter how many times I watch it and rewrite/re-imagine it, it never feels like most of the movies. Why? Because even if I am the leading role in it, I... I am the bad guy. I don't get to see the sunset, I don't get the girl and I could never be happy while the others are. People come and try to help you but how could they when they don't understand you because they never had it like you did and cannot comprehend why you are like this...

But let me give you a tour through the thoughts of a villain. Often a common part is neglected when it comes to all antagonists is that they are human too and they have a story of their own and it has all the answers to why they turned out to be like this. [Everything seems unfair](http://assets.amuniversal.com/63776f307863012ee3c400163e41dd5b), sometimes I wonder why everything is so easy for everyone else and I am trying much harder than them and in the end it's all in vein. At some point you just give up on your patience because it's been too long already and you let yourself be driven by wrath and envy it's time for you to get your happy ending for a change.

And here is some bold characteristics of a great super villain and how to achieve it.

**I AM NARCISSISTIC**
-

I really don't know how I got myself into this trait of mine. But really, I was busy manipulation and using whoever was vulnerable enough to fall into my web that I never had the chance to notice that the sun is not actually spinning around my head. Yet it was so easy and every time I knew this one thing - I am better than them. Getting what I wanted was with highest priority and it was bringing me satisfaction. Of course there were occasions I had to try but I didn't and went home empty-handed but that only means that I didn't really wanted what I wanted because else I wouldn't give up and also there is the contradiction where I completely ignore myself in the name of others and later on I ask myself why.

Knowing that you are better than everyone else has really different meaning in different moments. Sometimes you look at the others with disgust, sometimes you don't care, sometimes you are confused why they aren't more like you.

Having a really bad case of *I am always right* is skyrocketing the narcissistic trait to highs you can't even imagine. Having to prove a point is my all-time favorite competition in which I am the one-and-only absolute winner and I have enough time and chances to prove this that *""I told you so""* got old and it's not worth saying anymore. I dare you to prove me wrong. It is really frustrating when people doesn't listen or believe mostly because things tend to be exactly like I said. The biggest flaw of this is that I too am bound to not listen to myself which makes me as ignorant as the others.

[**I AM INSECURE**](/I'm confident about it)
-

Ever since forever I've been insecure about way too many things and I just realized it recently*/a year ago/* which I regret deeply but it's a thing I cannot do anything about it because up until now I wasn't truly aware of myself. I wasn't like this when I was 4 until my parents decided to move me to another kindergarten where the kids laughed at my long hair and didn't have a [girlfriend](/ I wish I was as brave as my 4-year-old self when I was a teenager.). Fast forward into my school years nothing changed since then and I was getting more and more insecure, mostly about my looks, partly because of my disabilities. And with the time passing they kept growing. I passed through school to high school to graduating without having ever a girlfriend or even a date or a random kiss on a party, and this also helped a lot about my insecurity, because the thought that no one ever liked me was really influential and stuck there and not gonna lie, I still think about it from time to time.

This is the part where I realize that I am not special. I'm just one of the billion equal ants that are the same. But since ants has their own hierarchy and so do we, I must be a simple worker ant and as that I can't do what the other ants do, can I. So I managed to create the fictional *""my place""* where everything I do is right just as long as I do what I am *""allowed""* to do. There's this thing where being good looking and charming makes your life easier, or in this case mine harder, because that's how we, the social animals work and I never managed to sell myself to the others. Key point here is that smiling people are more appealing and I don't smile for the simple reason that my teeth are so weirdly crooked and this one[ I blame on my mother because she decided that buying an apartment during the crisis was more important than paying for brackets for her child. ](/s by the way that said apartment is still sitting empty since she bought it 10 years ago.) Actually there are many things that I can blame my mother on because she is lucky to have kids, but doesn't know how to treat them and clearly doesn't deserve them.

I can go on with the list of what makes me insecure, but I prefer to not care about this stuff anymore.

**I AM PESSIMISTIC**
-

I decided to accept that title even though I don't think of me this way really. Here's the deal, whenever something is about to happen on what is most likely to happen which in most of the cases is not a positive thing and it also happens for me to be right. Sometimes I think to myself that I am too paranoid but then I prove myself wrong when my *""fears""* come to life. I can boldly say that I'm currently living in my worst, most terrible nightmare and it seems like it is here to stay. 

Don't get me wrong, I do have positive attitude too and I use it towards many things daily but you can catch me daydreaming very often because of it. There were times when I ended up delusional about things I desired but all this lead to being disappointed later on because all the things that are up in the clouds are out of touch with reality. And again, it would be nice if any of these dreams become real for a change.

**I AM OBSESSIVE**
-

Here is where I get offended. It's because I do get obsessive about some things but people cannot tell apart obsession and passion and I tend to be very passionate about many of the things I pursuit because they make me feel better. For example, I get obsessed with hating people and revenge and their demise but that's easy to snap out of it. I am obsessive with collecting things - comics, trading cards, books, caps, video games - you name it. Usually playing games is bad for me because I get obsessed with collecting unique in-game items and achievements. I gave away few of my collections this year because I decided it's time to stop. On the other hand, I am very sentimental and I keep many things to remind me of what I've lived through, not that I need them because for now I have great memory and [I can recall everything from every thought.](/s everything is connected in a weird way) 

Not to be confused with my obsessions, I am very passionate about many things. The difference is that when I'm obsessed about something, is that I just want that thing, for example, I wanted to have every card from a set and they had to be sorted in ascending order and then I was pleased, but when I am passionate about something I do it because I simply love it, which is why I want to go to a concert of every of my favorite artists/bands and I am slowly getting there. When I'm passionate about something it involves great amount of primarily joyful emotions and it makes me want to continue because of that, just exactly how I feel towards my countless hobbies and few other stuff.

**I AM AFRAID**
-

If you ever said that you aren't afraid of anything, you are simply a liar. Fear is the first natural emotion we are born with, it's an instinct to preserve yourself from the outside world and I have my fears like everyone else. Don't really know how to properly list them because I feel different about every other fear.

Firstly, I fear death. When I am at my worst, I often contemplate it as the last unopened door that may lead to the solution of all of it, but in the end I cannot ignore the fact that what's next is unknown and the unknown is what I really fear. Death, deep darkness, deep waters, thick fogs, the future, none of this certain and it freezes my blood. Yes, it is contradictory to fear death and yet contemplate it but I can foolishly justify it as fighting my fears, in the worst way possible. With this I also fear time. It is the one and only thing you cannot control and you have only what you are given. It's never going backwards, if you don't spend it, it's wasted and that's it. Nevertheless I'm still wasting mine.

Next, I sorely fear being alone in many different forms. I fear abandonment, I fear people dying and I fear one-sided love.  The thing about these fears is that they all became reality. Living nightmare. And nothing to do about any of it. Some say that we are born alone and we die alone, but that is so wrong. And even if it is so, I don't want to, because I feel so much love that I could give, it's another matter that the people around are getting fewer or just don't want or need it. Of all the things this makes me the saddest because it makes me feel worthless.

No matter how many times I count my blessings, I'll always seem short with few and I'll always want to go back and try to make some things differently. Nothing is impossible but this. Some say that not everything is just gray or black &amp; white but what could I do when I'm all out of color pencils. I am glad I shared some of my with the others, just wish they returned the favor instead of being selfish. Anyway, I'd get myself new ones. I just hope things are better from now on. Or at least far worse for the others. Would be nice if I, for once, am the more fortunate.",20Feb2018,0
