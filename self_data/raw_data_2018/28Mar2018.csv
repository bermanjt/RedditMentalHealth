1,"For clarity, my husband and I were invited to go. They said “ hey frito67 we are heading up to the camp for the long weekend, want to come up too?” I said, sure sounds like fun. We have gone up a few times before and when we are there we bring everything we need and are completely self sufficient, ie. tent, food, port a toilet. I usually will bring something baked for everyone, or like the last time when I brought up a ton of fireworks so everyone could enjoy a display. 

This morning I got a text telling me how much they pay each month for the mortgage, and how much their property tax is for the year, and if we are going up we should give cash or a bottle of booze to stay. 

I’m feeling a bit insulted to be honest. Is that crazy of me?

3,"I've written and rewritten this text so many times I've lost count..

I know who my father is but obviously as I haven't seen him in years, I know nothing about him at all. I don't want to know anything about him either. 

He made a choice and that choice was 'his own family' - his words not mine. 

It really never bothered me. My parents split up when I was 6 months old so I don't remember any different than a single parent houshold and seeing my 'dad' every few weeks. I remember being fairly apathetic about seeing him - my mum was my mum and my dad. I remember other times crying not wanting to go to his house.

When he finally disappeared when I was about 10 I wasn't upset. The 6 weeks he was supposed to be away working for came and went. As my sister got increasingly upset over the years that passed, it never bothered me. That's not to say it didn't affect me. It did. But I didn't know any different at the time.

I'm 32 now and have beautiful baby boy who is 2 years old. I wish I could articulate how I felt about him. I have never known a love like it. I'm doing everything in life with him for the first time. Trying to be the best dad to him I can be.

But now after 30 years of apathy towards  my own father, I feel so angry. I don't know why it bothers me so much when it never did before?

I don't want any form of reconciliation (he tried a few years back). It's too late to start playing happy families. I just wish I didn't care like I used to but it bothers me.

I genuinely believe that I learnt far more about what it is to be a good dad than if he had have been in my life. I wouldn't change a thing. I will always be there for my son. 

Why do I feel so angry about it now? I don't understand. I suppose it's because I don't understand whereas before I didn't care enough to try and understand.

Thanks for taking the time to read this if you made it to the end. I suppose this is some kind of cathartic activity. This has been chewing me up on the inside lately and I just needed to let it out.

4,So I was adopted foster kid whatever don't know. So you know those papers the parents get with how much money they get for the kid. (idk if just foster/adoptive parents get this or if it's families with low income or everyone) well I noticed that my middle name on this paper was different (but the same one I saw on an old photo at my bio grandparents house.) than my middle name I was used to. So I'm wondering if my parents just didn't get it legally changed and if that could cause me problems down the road ,28Mar2018,1

9,"Im worried that my laptop may have leaked some fluid/acid onto my bed and I am now sitting in it, I know that isnt real, but I can't get it out of my head. I also can't get out of my head that it's emitting some smoke or something that is bad, please confirm or deny. 

Okay, so the reason behind this post was a mysterious liquid on my bed, and I just now remembered that I did my OCD routine and got into bed, and that involves a lot of water, so I think I just got some water in an unexpected spot on me and it just rubbed off of me and onto the blankets.",28Mar2018,13
10,"So to keep this brief, I was kicked out of my mother’s house for a very interesting reason back in February of 2017. I left behind quite a bit, including my very expensive $1500 bed that I was paying on. I’m genuinely having such a moral dilemma, I don’t know what to do. I don’t want the bed back because my siblings have probably ruined it, but I want to ask my mother to pay me for the bed because she took it with her when they moved to a different town. 

A little back story:
I have six siblings, one of which has autism. Five of them still reside with my mother. None of them have beds, except for my autistic sister who is currently using mine, and my two 6 year old brothers that are sleeping with my mother and their father. The other two sleep on a futon on the floor. Mind you, I’m not asking for advice on what to do about their shitty parenting. I grew up with it, I’ve done what I can about it, that’s not my moral dilemma. My moral dilemma is how to carefully ask for the money I paid for this bed, especially when I have just recently built an okay enough relationship with my mother to be able to see my siblings. I know that if I ask her for money, she will more than likely tell me she can’t afford to pay me for it, even though she makes a six figure salary. When this happens, things are going to tense up. I’ll probably be restricted from seeing my siblings again, and I’ll be out the chance to even get the bed back or some money for it. If I do upset her over this, my very expensive bed will probably end up out on the curb for me to pick up an hour away from me, I won’t see my siblings for a long time and I’ll be out $1500. 

She’s very defensive about anything that isn’t a positive subject. I really have absolutely no idea how to go about this without ruining all of the progress that I’ve made, but I don’t want to be without a bed or the money either. Not to mention, I don’t want her throwing it out and then my sister be without a bed. 

Help.

Seriously I'm ALWAYS getting this and I don't know how I'm wierd? I mean I guess it's because whenever I talk to my friends I kinda get overexcited? That's a thing to, every time I'm with my friends I turn like fucking WILD. It's not even funny, I catch myself stopping myself from turning into a loud maniac each time I'm with my friends lol.

18,"My grandfather is probably the most influential person in my life. He was a very kind man, but the circumstances in which he lived his life (partly because of his upbringing, partly because of my grandma’s nightmare family) led him to become a lone wolf, and very prone to fits of rage. Mind you, he never laid a hand on me or anyone else in my family, but he had a bad temper, and he would start yelling very easily if he saw something he didn’t deem right. I have a feeling this was never unwarranted, that the victims of his anger always had it coming. His tolerance was at its lowest when it came to braggers, asskissers and hypocrites. 
I always admired this about him, and I like to think I inherited his no-bullshit philosophy (maybe my way of expressing it is a bit more socially acceptable). What I am sure I got from him is my anger, which helped me overcome deeply dire situation, but also shaped me into a kind of unlikable person. I mean, I am satisfied with my social and romantic life, but I still struggle making a good impression when meeting someone for the first time. People are extremely wary of someone who doesn’t smile a lot. That is probably the biggest clue to my inner agitation, since I have learned to live with it and somehow exploit it. Sorry, got on a tangent, maybe it will help understand the rest of this story. Back to my grandpa. 
Despite his jumpiness, my grandfather loved his life, and kept following his passions well into his eighties. He loved gardening: he used to grow grapes to make brandy (we still have some bottles left, saving them for big occasions). He was also a big fan of bike racing, keeping a notebook updated with names of riders, teams, grand tour winners and so on (it may have started as some kind of betting almanac then carried on into his later years). He loved his grandchildren, preparing every week a little paper envelope with spare change for each of them with the word “grandpa” handwritten on it.
When he was about 80 years old, he was diagnosed with a small tumor on the basis of his brain, which at the time wasn’t causing any symptoms and could be treated with some radiotherapy and an operation to extirpate it. I don’t know why, but the doctor informed only his children (my father and his sister), which decided to keep it a secret. They knew that the prospect of an operation on their father would be too much to take for him, who never had a health problem and therefore developed a massive fear of doctors and hospitals. They told noone, deciding instead to let the old man life the rest of his life unaware of the condition. Ignorance truly is bliss, and I couldn’t be more proud of my father and aunt for doing what they did. My grandfather lived five years without any symptoms after the diagnosis was made. Then, ten years ago this November, he had an epilepsy attack. He had to move to a nursing home, and 3 months later he died. He was the first of my close relatives to die since I was born (I was in my mid-teens), I was devastated. I couldn’t believe I could go on without him in my life, but of course I could, and I have. There are many memories I treasure dearly from his life, and there is one from his death that still haunts me. The day of his funeral came, and during the ceremony I was a mess, wheeping loudly all the way through, until the last song came on. It was The Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel. I had never heard it before, and it was the most beautiful song I’ve ever heard, and for a moment I was somewhere else, far away from the funeral home and all that sorrow. I listened to that song costantly for weeks after the funeral, I was obsessed. Then I gradualy started avoiding it. I was moving on, and that song just reminded me of a sad period in my adolescent life. It’s not that I actively leave the room when it plays somewhere, but I’d rather listen to something else. It’s just too much man.

Do you guys have trouble listening some meaninful songs/artists? I’d like to know :)

As I was writing this I realized this was gonna be a two-, probably a three-parter. I’m sorry if this post was boring and/or overly long, I just wanted to write something personal.

34,"I just found out that I'm being blocked from promotion or transfer because I'm too valuable where I am.  I’ve been trying to secure a higher-level position, and nothing has been happening.  I am super critical.  So instead of supporting me I’m getting blocked, and people are speaking negatively about me to keep me from moving up and to another office into a higher-level position.

The guy that used to be my manager but did move on just gave me some “advice” to let me know why none of these roles have been coming my way.  And he spelled out, bluntly and clearly.

Some of the people that would be new peers are intimidated by me because I am already a hell of a lot better than them.  So, for this reason, they’re seeding negative views about me to our director.  

Our Director is simultaneously talking about how valuable I am to my projects and our office and the same time using this negative feedback to justify not giving me the advancement I’m trying to secure.  In fact, they’re using my effort to move up as a negative against me and using my “flight risk” as a negative performance indicator.

42,"It was kind of rough. Even after a year. 

We had a tumultuous relationship which overall, was pretty bad. Lacking in experience, healthy communication, personality match, overlapping interests, similar values, similar goals, and mental stability. We clung on to it, and each other, for far too long for the absolutely crazy sex, and the moments of insanely powerful emotional intimacy. It fell apart about as badly as one would expect, and it involved other guys.

I acknowledge my part in this. We made each other unhappy by simply being the wrong people for each other. She lacked the maturity to communicate her needs, I lacked the same, as well as the ability to see that I needed to end it when she couldn't.

Saw her while I was doing my work placement.

Same insane, physical chemistry even from across the room. Same emotional connection. 

So much pain, regret, happy recognition, arousal. Even just from a look and a few minutes talking. Even after a year.

She's doing better I think. Seeing a new guy. Says they're taking it slow... though it's only been three weeks and they're already talking about moving away together and engagement. But they were friends for a while first (I actually knew the guy in passing when she and I were learning to dance together), so whatever.

It stung to hear her talk about all the disasters we had, and how she's applied that to what seems like a smoother relationship. 

I won't forgive her for how things ended - right or wrong, my pride was far too hurt and the exact situation caused me so much pain, that I've ensured we'll never be together again. 

But I don't know. I have my own thoughts on her new relationship. But for her sake, I found myself really hoping that things would work out for her.

44,"So this actually happened several years ago when I was going to college. My writing skills aren't great but bear with me. Anyways, it was my first semester and I had been trying this new thing out called polyphasic sleeping which is essentially just sleeping multiple times during the day. The results were okay, but I would get really sleepy if I missed a nap.

Now I usually tried sitting close to the front of my classes, but when I got to my Human Resources class I was very tired. I didn't want to be caught sleeping so I sat in the back of the auditorium so I could pass out if I wanted to. It turned out I didn't need to sleep, but I did meet this pretty chill guy sitting in the back of the class. We talked a lot during the year about sports and tv and we had a lot in common. We eventually starting going to the movies pretty much every week together and spending a lot of time at school with each other.

After a few years, we both graduated and we would text on occasion, but he lived very far away so we didn't see each other often. Fast forward to the present time and I'm about to go to work. I'm looking out my window and I see someone who looks like some salesman coming to my door. Being the anxious person that I am I think about hiding and pretending I'm not there so I don't have to have more human interaction than necessary. Eventually, I just opened the door after he knocked because maybe he actually has some important stuff to say. So when I open the door this guy has a serious look on his face, he says do you know ****  *****. I say yeah I know him from college and he says that he is charged with murdering his brother. We just talked for like half an hour about how I knew him and what we did together or if there was anyone he didn't get along with. I got around to viewing the evidence that was publicly available and I had no doubt in my mind he was innocent. It was all circumstantial and it was a flawed case against him. He had the support of all his friends and family.

I still remember when my mom found out and she was losing her shit. I was trying to calm her down, but its really hard to just casually say you're involved in a murder trial. When his trial came I was subpoenaed as a character witness and drove a few hours to the courthouse. I remember I kept asking the defense attorney to rehearse what we were going to talk about, but she didn't really go in depth and just vaguely said to talk about how you knew him. At one point I asked her if the opposing attorney would cross-examine me and she said that it was highly unlikely and I wouldn't have to worry about it. I end up getting cross-examined by the opposing attorney 30 minutes later. The opposing attorney's questions were a lot harder testing my memory of specific times of events and about some of the things the defendant has done. It was definitely very stressful considering I'm not a public speaker at all and it was a serious matter. Having questions spoon fed to me was like playing T-ball and the opposing attorney was like college baseball. In the final day of the trial, the mom of the defendant had an emotional outburst and was shouting that they had the wrong person. I kept incessantly checking for an update on the verdict and when I did find out the verdict it was something that I could never forget. I didn't even need to read the headline to know. There was this picture of the Defense attorney consoling my friend with her arm around his shoulder as the verdict was read that he was sentenced to life. She was covering her face with one hand crying a little and my friend had a devastated look.

Right now I'm trying to support him the best I can. I'm sending him books and letters to make his time a little easier. Since he is in a reception center I can't send him book right now, but I did promise to send him some Stephen King novels. I had sent him Infinite Jest which was like half a million words, but he finished it already. It was kinda funny that some of the other inmates asked to borrow the book, but they all said it was way too complicated.
