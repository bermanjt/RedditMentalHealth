I’m going crazy, everything is terrifying. I can’t leave my parents house cuz I’ve missed so much school that there’s just no point, I’m fucked. And even if I do go, my mind just races about the most random shit, I don’t know whats happening.

My mood is so erratic, I go from depressed to a psycho mad at the stupidest stuff. I don’t know fucking why?

I just can’t stop thinking about shit, like are people looking at me? Did I understand what the professor explained? Did I do that homework? Are my friends hanging out and not inviting me? Am I fucking psycho?",13Dec2018,1

I care about you. And you were such an amazing person in my life. I don’t wish it would’ve taken this to make me understand, but I’m sorry. I did wrong. I wish I was better in touch with my emotions and opened room to think about you. I am selfish. I tried hard not to be but I am..was. I don’t want to be like this. I want to care for myself and the things around me. It took too long maybe. I got so lucky with the friends I’ve made. And I’ve lost them all. I’m so sorry. I am sad. I’m am sorry.

2,"Hi to anyone who randomly chooses to read this pity party of a post. I appreciate you taking the time to read what is essentially the materialized internal screaming that has been going on within me over these past few semesters. 

First, let me be honest that I am not someone who should really be complaining. I am a student at an upper-level American university who is achieving a 3.95 right now with many other accomplishments. I know that I should be proud and give myself some room to breathe, but I was not always a high-achiever. In high school the bar that I set for myself was far lower, yet the one that I have set in college is the equivalent of trying to navigate defusing a bomb each semester. I am at a point where a singular A- actually hurts my GPA, and that thought is strikes fear into the depths of my being. I know, I know--how tragic would it be if my GPA dropped .02 with one A-, but I cannot convince myself that this is okay. Instead I fill myself with anxiety, crunching numbers on assignments figuring out what I need to receive in order to keep an A. This semester and the past one have always had two classes where I am absolutely on the edge and it kills me. 

The only one putting this pressure on me is, well, me. My parents couldn't be more proud of my grades. But I know that the law schools I hope to attend are sticklers for GPAs. I hate the idea of my GPA dropping and it is a feeling that I cannot put to words (despite my effort here). I only have one more year after the completion of finals this week (thankfully I am graduating early lol), and hopefully this unnecessary expectation mentality is something I leave in undergrad.

So I'm in the car with my parents, returning home from San Diego, and Mom turned off the smartphone navigation for some reason and we ended up going quite a way in the wrong direction. I think it's a mix of incompetence and something else that's harder to identify. I think she's deliberately resistant to using technology effectively for some reason, but wouldn't admit it. Like, she's not that dumb. It doesn't take much to just type in an address and hit go, and listen to the voice. And that's even what was happening, before she intervened to disable it. Perhaps she doesn't like the technology because she thinks she can do a better job of navigating herself. But that doesn't make sense either, because she doesn't claim to be a good navigator, and indeed, didn't even attempt to navigate manually. I think perhaps she is simply so bitter about the technology being so effective that she would rather render it ineffective and suffer because of it than just let it do its job. But idk, it doesn't really make sense to me. I would ask her what her thought process was, but I doubt that would go over well. Even when she does use automatic navigation, she disables the voice, and reads the directions herself. It's certainly not any more effective, but I think perhaps it makes her feel more useful. Kinda like how cake mixes could be just add water with no significant loss of quality, but require that an egg be added to make the housewife feel like she's really putting effort into cooking. But just disabling the navigation seems like buying such a mix and then just not adding the egg at all.

Regardless,I wouldn't want to be judged based on something I did so long ago. We had always been friends so we remained in touch. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm most angry about is how he shit talked about me to our friends. It makes me even more angry that I know he was doing it because I had confronted him about something he said that I thought was condescending the night before. Part of me really wants the friendship. But I don't know if that's because I've glossed over his negative attributes so many times. It feels like cognitive dissonance. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the most part, I hardly think of him and when I do it is in a positive way. But every now and then when he comes into my life, I become extremely angry and remember how mean and manipulative he has been to me. His apologies feel meaningless because he will lie and change the story as long as you aren't upset with him anymore. You don't want to push too hard for the truth or call him out on his bullshit because he has a lot of issues with depression and suicidal thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling like the best thing to do might be to cut him out of my life, but it makes me sad when we had been friends for so long.

8,"In one of my accounts, this person started replying to my comments and be very friendly, so i kept replying their comments back. At some point, she became TOO familiar with me and started referring to me adding ""-chan"" at the end of my name. Nothing against japanophiles at all, but that was an insanely big red flag for me to ignore.

So, I googled her username, and turns out she had this huge amount of drama in all these online communities, where they would accuse her of stealing other people's art and claiming it as hers, among many other things. She even had ""hate blogs"" dedicated to her.

Now, she clearly didn't do anything to me, but based on past experiences, I decided it was safer to just stop talking to her, so I replied to a couple more of her comments (she always replied to mine, even when there was nothing really to be addressed in my comment), and eventually I said ""hey, I'm super busy, I better get back to work, have a good day"", and then never talked to her again.

She hasn't looked for me after that or anything, so I'm guessing my fears of being stalked (which has happened to me in the past) were unfounded. But anyway, I still feel like I let external opinions dictate how I feel about a person.

Hi,

Anyone ever been in a similar situation?

I tried college not once but 5 times. First time I went to a biology school to study nutrition then figured that biology wasn't for me. I also thought I'd like to be a professional bodybuilder and got sidetracked and was eating sleeping and training 24x7 and skipping classes. Had an injury that stopped me from training for a year and gave that up (never would have made it any way, don't have the genetics).

My dad and mum divorced when I was young (there was always violence in the house, and I have been slapped and even kicked by my mother, who I am not close to.

My dad and I moved to the US from India, and at the time he was a caring, loving father who always thought about me first. He was also very progressive in his mindset, and for years he kept saying 'I will always support you no matter what.'

I tried community college a year later, but that didn't work out either. I just didn't have the drive or interest.

Then I got into meditation and spirituality. I went for some retreats with a Zen master, who I later introduced my dad to. Long story short, it turned out to be a cult and when I told the master I was leaving the teaching he said 'God will punish you.' My dad kept going for retreats, and although he doesn't any more, he still reads the books and roughly follows the teaching.

This zen stuff completely changed him as a person. He translates the teaching given that 'sometimes one is too sensitive and has to close one's heart and assert oneself to be more conscious'. He has suddenly started blaming me for 'years lost in his life'.

He also took a second wife who had a teenage daughter (also Indian). This was when I was 22. I wasn't doing anything that the world would call constructive at the time, and she basically ran me out of the house. My dad rented another house in the same city and I moved in there. I lived alone for about 2 years in total.

Then he bought a house in chicago (we were in dallas) to lease out, but said I could live there.

I moved there without a job or degree and on my own. I degenerated quickly. 4 months later, the police came knocking on my door due to a faulty water meter that showed water usage 100x of what is normally used. They found a house with no bed, just me (i had taken to living naked alone in my house) and about 4 months worth of fast food boxes all over the place. There was some law that said if the place is unfit to live in, the owner must evict.

They also said I should go for a health checkup. I agreed. They detained me at the facility against my will in a psychiatric ward. This happened twice. At the end of it (the doctor never saw me) I was told I must take some heavy anti-psychotics and return to the facility for half a day every day for 6 months. They diagnosed me with drug induced schizophrenia (i had an on-again-off-again relationship with marijuana for about 5 years till this point.) I decided to just leave and return to India.

My dad returned with me. I got a Deep Vein Thrombosis within weeks of returning. Most painful thing ever.

My dad rented a place for me and one for him and I lived there for awhile. I didn't want to live with him because I felt disconnected from him. I was seeing a counsellor for awhile.

About 6 months later I got tired of living alone and moved back in with him. He started dating my counselor and soon after she moved in.

I got my first job and worked there for 6 months (a near impossibility without a degree in India.) It had been about a decade since I had any real contact with my mom, and then I learned she lived in France. We connected a little and I decided to go and live with her and attend college in France. I had no bedroom (her PAX partner had one and she had one, I slept on the living room floor.) I aced my first semester at the top of my class (first place literally). Then I started to see why I had disconnected from my mother. She was OCD about my schizophrenia diagnosis. The doctor said I shouldn't sleep or sit around doing nothing during the day. So, even if I would nap for 30 minutes (she would sleep all day sometimes) she would shake me and wake me up and tell me to get the fuck up. I'm not really sure this is what the doctor meant. She also slapped me and was abusive towards her pax partner and me all the time.

So I came back to India and started working for my dad in his IT company as the content writer for the marketing team (im a very good writer if I have any skills at all). My marketing manager was very happy to have me as they didn't have anyone to write good content before on a regular basis (on my salary with my level of English, creativity and style, in India, they will never find anyone else).

I tried an evening college here when I started the job but the hours were too long.

I joined a correspondence course (4 months late. I didn't want to, I wanted to start next semester, but my dad wouldn't have it.) I wasn't really motivated because the time I had was so short and it wasn't my choice any way, I didn't study very much. I paid the fees myself from my salary. My exams were over the last two weeks and I failed 3/4 subjects. I can retake them with next semesters exams. I took leave from the office last week for 3 days to study (was my father's suggestion.)

Had an exam today, which I took (would have failed). I then had an upset stomach so I had to call in sick to work.

I've been hitting the gym for the last 2 months or so. But last week I was irregular.

My dad is travelling at the moment and I got a call from him in the afternoon. He says my energy is bad and that he 'just wants to live his life on his own' and that 'I have no interest in anything'. He said I don't go to the gym (which I do) and am not contributing at work (I am doing every bit of my job as necessary - just not taking initiative outside my job description like I was doing in the beginning). I have a cigarette habit, and he has been fine with it all this while, sometimes suggesting that I quit for my health, but mostly saying that when you are mature enough you will quit. Today he says 'he is sick of my disgusting habit' (i smoke on the terrace).

He has fired me from the job and given me 2 weeks to get out of the house.

His counselor-partner is a complete bitch to be honest as well. If my dad spends any time with me whatsoever, she gets moody and blows up in a fit a few days later about how 'her son is so much better than me' and that I am utterly useless.

I'm not sure what to do right now. I'm quite sick of life and sick of my 'new dad' ever since the Zen master. He calls it 'tough love' and says its good for me. But he is behaving 100% opposite of the way he raised me and somehow in my late 20s I'm supposed to just change as a person because it suits his new ideologies better.

I also started gaming again a week ago and he has disconnected the internet near my room and says 'You don't need internet anyway.'

Also says that I am gaining weight when I have lost 12 lbs in the last two months through dieting and weight training. I told him I have lost weight but 'I am lying'.

He has turned into a complete bullshit person. But, particularly in India without a degree, I have nowhere else to turn to. There is no social security or any kind of government support like in the west.",13Dec2018,1

This was my ""dream job"" in politics and I just fucked up a great opportunity. Everyone knows everyone else and boy there's no recovering from this.

12,"A few months ago I had a bad reaction to some antidepressant meds, they were fast acting and after a few days of taking them I was having like a 24 hour long panic attack, my psych wasn't in so I went to the ER and they institutionalized me for 7 days, even tho after 2 days off the meds I was perfectly fine, I saw a psych once and that was the day she was like ""You don't need to be here I'll put in the paperwork for you to leave"".

I had no access to a phone, could not call my job. I had my roommate call them and she spoke with the asst. supervisor and let him know.

I get back to work, they say that my roommate calling in didn't count and essentially did not believe me, I offered to provide them my discharge papers as proof but in the end, I got fired for it. 

I'm legally blind and have bad arthritis and other joint issues due to my illness (Stickler syndrome for those who know of it) and have been looking for work but there are only warehouse positions that I cannot physically do. And while a lot of places say they're equal opportunity employers.. not many people want to deal with that.

After a month I finally got a low paying job at a theater which I'm thankful for and its something but..

my bank account was drained, I had a company when I was already overdrawn try to charge me NINE times, even tho I never ordered anything. I called the bank and they basically told me tough luck and once I was in the positive I could put a stop charge. Well, I got a $35 fee every time they tried to charge me, so by the first of this month I was around $600 overdrawn.. 

My roommate and I are trying to scrape money up, we paid rent but due to some changes my bank made to my account without informing me, they couldn't cash my check, so now I'm 11 days late on rent, freaking out and who knows when I'm going to be evicted. 

We pay way to much for this place anyways, they refuse to come to fix anything, there's been a bug problem and they never do anything. There is a huge hole in my closet that the mantience people made and refuse to patch up. But that's beside the point It just pisses me off.

I mean I finally have a job now, but we're down to 2 hotdogs and some rice and coffee creamer for food, I can't turn to my family for help either and at this point, I have no clue what I'm going to do. I'm more worried about my dog and cat, the cat has food but my dog is running low on food. 

I keep looking through my belongings to see if I can pawn anything but besides my deceased father's wedding ring, I own nothing of value besides my phone.

I'm trying to find hope that thing will turn out, it has just been breaking me down. I wish I could go back and just  never go to the ER, If I never got institutionalized I'd still have a job, things would be fine. I'd be able to get my friends presents for Christmas, get my dog a birthday present (He's a Christmas baby) and things would be fine, but I feel like I fucked up, that I just let everyone down and there's nothing I can do about it. I have so much guilt built up and I'm trying to be productive and work to make things better, but what do you do when hard work doesn't help?",13Dec2018,1

14,"Background on me 

M21
Senior in University 

Growing up, my parents were new to this country and never formally educated. They also placed a high value on one I'd be receiving here in the U.S. 

As a kid I mainly was a good student due to fear of disclipline from my father, and as a got older the motivation of receiving video games and gifts for high grades. It worked amazing and I did develop good habits as a student at first. 

But being the only student of my ethnicity in the ghetto schools I grew up I got BS from other kids growing up. Eventually I got tired of it, getting into trouble, having to explain to my parents why I always had issues at school. So I started doing no school work so people would leave me alone and I'd fit in... I end up enrolled at a awful high school and continue doing nothing as 2nd nature now and graduate with a B- somehow and getting a decent enough SAT to get into an okay state school. 

Thing is I never learned to study, I never developed a passion, joy to learn, and real intrinsic motivation. 

I've halfed/ 1/3'd assed my way though this business program and through some experiences I had and interview skills I landed a job offer at a pretty reputable firm. 

Thing is IM SO WORRIED ABOUT THE REAL WORLD OF WORKING AND BEING TO KEEP THIS UP

I've done all the good in my life thus for my parents and it's been easy enough as far as University is concerned

27,"Exactly one year ago I was getting off the bus from school, the time was 3:17. I remember because I just changed the song on my phone to Heat by 50 cent. 

And just as I stepped off the bus out of the corner of my eye I see a boy turn his bike around in the road from a driveway across the street. He was hit by a white pick up truck doing 50mph, it happened so fast I didn’t process it. 

I seen his bike tire of his BMX bike go over the power lines and 50 feet in the air. I seen his body roll on the ground in front of the truck. I remember his shoe flew across the street over the fence of my apartment complex. I seen his backpack and it’s contents get spewed all over the street. 

My body just went numb. My legs, my hands, my face, and I didn’t want to move but I did. My legs just stared moving. I don’t even know how I can explain this but it was like my body started moving on it own over to him. 

I hate myself for doing that. 

As I went over to him, he laid there taking these heavy breaths. Like his whole body was moving as he breathed, there was this man who put his shirt under his head, I put my backpack against his head and my hoodie tucked up against the other side to keep his head still. 

He was bleeding from his ear and nose, it was a lot of blood coming from his nose, it was a thick bright red color. It felt like warm slime against my fingers when I checked his pulse. 

He wasn’t moving, but he was breathing and he had a pulse, and suddenly he didn’t. I saw his eyes look into mine before he stopped breathing. I will never forget that look. His eyes were mellow and his mouth open like he fell asleep.

I started to try to do CPR, I remember his older brother holding his head down in the grass praying, and crying right next to me.  

I didn’t even know how to do CPR, I just knew that you push to the beat of staying alive, you push hard with proper form and when there is no pulse you always do CPR. 

I was afraid I was going to hurt him more because how small he was, it was like my hands would sink into his chest every time I pushed. It seemed like every time I pushed his eyes would move. 

It seemed like an hour before the fire truck arrived, but it was only like 2 minutes. It was like at a snap of a finger the police, Ambulance, EMTs, all showed up at once. 

I remember this firefighter pull me up the shoulder and threw my bag and hoodie to the curb before a police officer told me to go to by the front gate of the apartment. I seen them put this neck brace thing on him and start doing CPR. They put something that looked like a 2 liter bottle with a mouth piece on it over his mouth. 

I saw the driver of the truck on his hands and knees and then he buried his head in his hands. I saw the man who was there with holding the boys head crouched down with his hands over his mouth. It felt like the whole world was moving faster than me. 

Then there was the father. This was the worst for me. Never in my entire life have I heard a noise more horrible than this. The father was literally screaming as the EMTs worked on this kids lifeless body. He was trying to get passed the police officers to see his boy. He was screaming something in Haitian as he was held back by some family members. 

There was this crowd of people who gathered at this point. When I saw them filming on their phones I got unbelievably pissed off. I wanted fucking strangle everyone of those bastards, instead of comforting the obviously distressed family or trying to do something they stood there and filmed, and I hated them for that. 
I had so much running threw my mind, I wanted to cry, scream, I wanted to hit something. I know there was nothing me or anyone else could do at that point but it made me so fucking mad.

There was this fire marshal that came and was yelling at people to put their  phones away. He even threatened to smack it out of some guys hand. He was walking around asking people what they had seen, he came to me and I told him what I had seen and he said I did what I could.

It hadn’t occurred to me how bad I was shaking until this point. I was twisting this piece of grass together I pulled when I was sitting down, it felt like my heart was punching my ribs, my fingers had some dried blood on it but I had more on my palm than my fingers but it was really hard to tell because my hand was shaking to fast. There was this blood spot on my backpack I couldn’t stop looking at. 

I was there until they loaded the boy in the ambulance and the fire trucks left. 

I just grabbed my hoodie and backpack and walked across the street to my apartment. My legs felt heavy and weak. 

I walked into the bathroom and started washing the Dried blood off my hands, it was weird watching this blood swirl slowly down the drain, I mean, it all hit me at once. The fact that this was somebody’s blood that kept them alive, and kept them going was now on my hands being washed down the drain. 

I just started bawling my damn eyes out and I feel like it writing this now, I don’t even know why I was crying. When my mom got home from work she went and put candles on the spot where he was hit. I told my family and they went on as if life was normal. Like it never even happened but ever since that day I can never stop thinking about it. Every time I get off the bus I think about it, every time i look across the street and see the spot where he got hit I think about it, every time I see ketchup I think about his blood coming from his nose. I can’t even listen to the song I was listening to when it happens without getting shaken up.

I hate myself for going to school that day. 

I hate the fact that I ran over there when I could have went home. 

I hate the people who just filmed this boys body while I tried to help. 

I hate that I can’t forget what happened. 

I know that there was nothing I could do to save him. I know I can’t play God. 

I just wish I could erase this day from my fucking head. 

I read online that writing/talking about traumatic experiences can help cope with it so I figured I would try. My brother thinks I have PTSD from it but I don’t think I do. I just want to forget it. I can’t.

42,"I have an unreasonable dislike for Asians (And only Asians) because of my many bad experiences with them.

The root of my dislike comes from:

1) My sister used to love Asian Culture when we were kids.  I grew a dislike for it because she was absorbed by K-POP and Japanse Culture to the point that it affected her grades in HS.

2) Their food is generally not my thing.

3) I do not like the Chinese government one bit.

4) Their numbers scare me. a lot.

5)  Only 5% of USA is Asian however 20%  of US  UnderGrads are Asian. On top of that Asian are suing Harvard to remove affirmative action because they want more Asians to go to Harvard. This act alone is very selfish and just symbolically shows that Asian groups are willing to screw over every other minority in the US in order to benefit themselves. 

6)  From my experience, my Asian friends tend to lack social skills.

7) They are successful and I envy that. 

8) Tunnel Vision: Every time I see an Asian person do something bad, I associate their behavior to the race. Today, for example, an Asian girl accidentally took my papers from the printer.  When I confronted her, my face was red and I gave her an angry glare. 

9)I don't like their general core values

Look. I have Asian friends, but that is because 23% of my school is Asian.  Every time I hear a group speaking some Asian language, I get angry. I feel like I am in a fucking Study Abroad program. 

&amp;#x200B;

Help. I want to like these people. They are peers, after all, however, I just find a lot of things repulsive.  I can live a perfect life with a dislike of Asian-Americans, but I don't think that is a good strategy.   I only have these problems with no other race, but my Asian friends. Does this still make me a racist?  I don't necessarily think they are inferior, I just find them repulsive. What do I need to do to get out of this loop of hate?

43,"First of all, I really don't know if this is the right subreddit, so uh, feel free to point me in the right direction. Also, long rant warning. 

So I'm a teenager, and I get that hormones are nuts during this time and it's natural for something out another to be going wrong in our brains and bodies (e.g. I haven't had my period in four months and I'm pretty sure I'm not pregnant)

However, I'm confused at what is regarded as normal and not. Now I have a couple friends who are diagnosed with depression and anxiety and all that fun stuff, but I don't necessarily think I have anything like that. You see, every few months or so, I get these stupid mood swings, that last from a day to a month. 

Basically what happens is that every little thing makes me pissed and I'll start crying. My thought processes and reactions change drastically. And then usually halfway through I'll kind of come to my senses and go, wait a second, why the hell am I crying? But then I'll still cry, and cry, even though I'm not even sad anymore, the tears just keep coming. I can't control it. 

Once during one of these episodes, I didn't talk to my parents basically at all for a week. I felt horrible afterwards because they're the greatest parents a kid could ask for and it really hurt them.   I also remember once taking a kind of drunken walk around town (not actually drunk just kind of disassociated) that lasted four hours, for no reason, making my parents think I'd been kidnapped or worse. 

Another time, it was my birthday. And I was in the shittiest mood for the first half of the day (I'd binged) but then my mood was actually fine for the rest. Like, I was pretty happy. My dad was getting me a drawing tablet as a present and I was really happy, but I was still crying? Not happy tears, but just crying?? 

I can't find anything that really triggers it. I've had a relatively breezy life with a total of zero traumatic experiences and nothing like some of the pretty terrible stories I've heard. My friends, grades, parents, they're all fine. 

I'm writing this now because I've always directed my stupidity and anger, I suppose, at my parents, and during school I would act relatively normally. But recently, this stupid little thing happened (which I'm not going to say because I have an irrational fear that one of my friends will see this post) during school, while I was in this weird emotional state, and it happened: I couldn't stop crying. I avoided my friends and sat in the bathroom for break to try and see if I could just cry it out. And again, during it, I recognized that my crying was stupid and I had no reason to be doing so. 

And yet the next break, when I thought I was fine and finally mustered up the courage to go to the group, I sat down for a few seconds, made an attempt at conversation and the tears just hit. Boom. No bad mood, no triggers, I just crying and had to excuse myself. Kinda just ran off. I was near the edge of the group so I don't think everyone noticed, but I kinda just laughed it off later when asked. Because again, is it really all that serious? 

As I said, I don't think I'm necessarily depressed, but then again, I don't really know much about this kinda stuff. So uh does anyone know what to make of this? Is it normal for a teenager? 

Also really sorry for the unnecessarily long post, and also any mistakes because my phone is about to die so I can't edit yeet.

46,"I've been emotionally numb since I was 14 (21 now) so this feeling isn't exactly uncommon, but recently I'm getting more bad days than good days and it's worrying me more and more.. 

It started when my first love (was also a very close friend) was beaten viciously by her (at the time boyfriend) [thats a whole story In of its self and I'm not going into it but man did it leave me dark.] -- after the aftermath &amp; fallout from that I found possibly my best friend that I've ever had. This girl kept me rooted, helped me climb out of some of the darkest holes I found myself in and was also a major factor in me not.. doing anything 'stupid' when my father would beat on me. After some time, our friendship fizzled into some weird spots and eventually.. she left too.

These 2 people probably had some of the biggest impacts on me. They were the only 2 that I'd told some of my inner most thoughts to, and them me; but when it came to the end, they left. I'm not the most trusting person due to some childhood stuff and that was the cherry on the cake for me and now I refuse to show my true emotions. A lot of fake smiles, fake laughs, and generally putting up a wall that lets people feel like they know a lot whilst also knowing bare nothing of essence. Some of my friends know of my past but all think I've gotten over it (my own words to them - yes I lied, yes it might be bad, but I'm not really prepared to let anyone in like that again. I'm done with people walking out on me and it killing me)

After she left I kinda became a recluse. Started smoking weed at 17; still managed to finish college with top marks but refused to socialise with anyone outside of my friend group. I have happy days and not so happy days, just like everyone. But most of the time I don't 'feel' anything... empty mostly. Don't get me wrong, there's times where I'm genuinely happy (usually with the help of drugs ngl) but most days.. it's not that I'm sad, it's that I'm feeling legitimately.. void.

I guess I learnt to live with it to an extent. Because I don't want people in I learnt to put up a good facade. All my friends know me as the happy go lucky one, the one who always looks to the bright side (""Ah well, look at the silver lining"" is a phrase I use a lot) mostly because I'm so used to seeking out the worst result in order to better prepare myself for it when it eventually comes around.. so it's a method I've taught myself to help sidetrack those thoughts and occupy myself with more pleasing imagery.

In the last few years I suppose I became 'Comfortably numb', I mean I wasn't happy but I wasn't as bad as previous years so.. silver linings? But  about 2/3 months ago now, I met a girl. And I knew from the get go I should've distanced myself; there was just something screaming at me in my gut saying this is gonna end in tears again.. and yet, for the first 2 months I could feel myself becoming happier. I wouldn't wake up with wet eyes, or in bad moods, I'd wake up actually happy and looking forward to being with this girl. Within a week of seeing each other it was obvious we shared a wave length, it felt like I'd known her for years despite it still being early days. Well about 2/3 weeks ago now, she decides she wants to break things off for her own reasons but wants to stay friends...

Idk, those 2-3 months with her was the first time i can actually say I wasn't emotionally numb anymore. I would feel anger, sadness &amp; happiness in ways I hadn't in years. The feelings would be overwhelming and whilst a lot to handle revitalised me because.. well shit I hadn't felt some of these things in genuine years. I guess she opened up a portion to my world I thought I'd lost and now she doesn't want to be there anymore so I guess.. c'est la vie? 

More than anything.. she made me aware of just how numb I had become and now that she's gone from my life in that respect.. I don't want to go back to being empty me but I'm falling back into old habits so easily and.. well.. I just needed to get this out into the open world instead of ruminating it over, and over, and over, and over, and fucking over in my head. 

Idk man fuck it, thanks if you read this far if not.. well congrats, you can be #4 on my list of not to bother 🤙🏼

58,"I apologise for the rant, but I need to get it out of me. I feel suffocated. 2018 has been a very, very bad year for me, emotionally. I don't know if I'm depressed, and I can't make myself go to a therapist/psychologist because I don't think I can talk about everything, with a stranger, in extreme detail just yet.



I don't know how to get out of this pit. I try to put on a happy face for everyone, but deep down I am getting crushed by everything. Mostly, I avoid thinking about my feelings, and that makes things worse, because every week I have a major meltdown, which entails crying for hours and hours, and not being able to make sense of anything at all. 

Smallest things trigger me, and because I'm surrounded by people all day, I can't show any emotion. I HAVE to pretend to be happy. So at night when I allow myself to think about it, I start thinking about EVERYTHING and I can't cope up with it. 




I've taken several psychological tests online, to know what's wrong, and all those depression quizzes included a question - 'Are you having trouble focusing on things?' Since months I have always ticked NO, but I just realized today that I am not being able to focus on anything. I get distracted all the time. All I want to do is be in bed, and watch a movie (so that I don't have to think about anything). I've been sleeping so much. My body gets tired of it, but I still don't want to move.



Another really terrifying thing is that my appetite has gone crazy. I am eating so much. When my issues started, one of the causes was a bad self image, but at that time I was still thin. My weight's increasing, and my self image issues are getting worse day by day. Up until last year I was one of those people who looked a lot in the mirror, took lots of pictures etc, but now I don't like what I see because everything about me is just wrong.



I can't talk about it with family. Whatever friends I did have, are all too busy in life to even talk to me, and a few who I do talk to, can't be trusted with anything anymore. I was such a talkative person. I always spoke too much in person and via text. I can't do it anymore. 

It exhausts me. I tried the make friends subreddit twice, and so many kind people replied to my post, but I was unable to keep up the conversations after a few days. Its so difficult to handle any impersonal, internet/text things right now. I am so desperate for a personal connection. But there is no one. I just want to talk to someone who already knows me well. To just let it out for once. The only thing I want is for someone to hold me and tell me I'll get better. That they have faith in me.  I feel so suffocated. I don't know for how long I can go on like this, when there is absolutely nothing to look forward to.



I tried making changes in my life in several ways, but I always fail. Things don't become better. I really want to get better. I've tried getting up early, not eating bad things, writing, learning new things, reading books. I've tried to work on myself. But after a few days, I just don't do it anymore. 

Its as if there are two things controlling me. One wants good for me, the other doesn't. I know I'm going against my rules when I eat something sweet, for example, but I just cannot stop it. I know what I'm doing wrong, I know I should fix it, but I'm not being able to. 



Its such a weird state that I'm in. Yes I've been through tough times in the past. Life hasn't been all rosy. But my mind never played games with me like this. Only people did. Now I've become my own enemy and I just don't know what to do.

This conflict between ""that's not you,"" and ""that is you,"" is tiresome, but I'm taking my side.

That is me, right now. And it's a choice I will make to make myself better, to grow for the better. There's no bad time to do something good for yourself, and I'm doing this.

63," I'll keep it short - growing up through high school and university, I was always one of the minority black kids in the class. Went to an all boys school with little social interaction with women - come Uni I was absolutely clueless. Now I've graduated, working, and have been steadily approaching women since Marc (I'm now 24). My social confidence has never been higher and I'm finally noticing women NOTICE ME. However, I'm wondering if I've developed a sorta 'complex' so to speak. See, basically I was never invited to weekend parties in HS - those were where dudes from our school met and hooked up with girls - typically wealthy and/or white chicks. So in my mind, I think because I missed out on that HS experience, I find myself, maybe not EXCLUSIVELY, but definitely MAJORITY of the time approaching caucasian women. It feels like some kind of weird sexual attraction/fetish I can't help - in my low confidence days I thought that being a 6'4"" black dude with a terrible jawline would mean being 'forever alone', but I just use my positives to get past that. Just wondering about this weird hangup, because I feel like subconsciously I'm somehow doing something wrong (and when people start noticing my dating history as I start getting them, it will seem bizzare or 'problematic') ",13Dec2018,1

I just want to know how to differentiate between being depressed and feeling lethargic and lazy? And whether what I am feeling is only the latter? If somebody could give some pointers as to what would exactly constitute depression it would be helpful.

72,"I was walking the dog and saw my neighbor across the street coming out of their house with their kid (2 - 3ish years old). She started asking/yelling at her kid if she wanted to push the stroller, very loudly and slowly, like the stereotypical image of an angry tourist berating someone who doesn't speak the same language. What really disturbed me was she was insulting the kid too, ""DO YOU WANT TO PUSH THE STROLLER? DO YOU WANT TO PUSH IT RETARD?"" And the kid, like I said, is 2 or 3, and crying. This is not OK. I don't think she realized I was there, but she ended up putting the kid in the stroller and they started on their way. 

Basically, it's a few days later, and I can't stop wondering if this is the kind of thing to report?

I haven't really ever met them, though the father did offer to help us move some stuff in once (we were 99% done so i just said no thanks, didnt get to chat or anything). I really only see them come outside to smoke. I have no reason to think they're abusing the kid other than this one instance, and I'd hate to report over a one time temper flare, but then again that'd be assuming things the other direction?

Anyway, we are sexually active and he decided to tell me that a couple weeks ago he came inside of me. I was upset he didn’t just tell me but I told him I was fine bc I had just gotten my period. He didn’t believe me and started getting really aggressive. He dragged me to go buy a pregnancy test and made me take it in his bathroom. Ge ended up making me take four. The last two tests I tried to take at my house and he asked me to FaceTime him while I do it. I said I didn’t wanna be too loud or wake anyone up and he came to my house and rang the bell and told my mom he forgot something that he needed and I was stuck dealing with that in my house when I just wanted to get away. 

He still said he didn’t believe it for some reason. He’s been really weird since. I can’t say I feel sick or mention my weight or say I’m hungry because he assumes I’m pregnant and hiding it or trying to trick him into being a father. 

One day we were play fighting and he’d hit my stomach and say something about a baby and I’m just like jeez dude are you kidding me??

I understand he was put in a shit situation the first time around but I am in no way looking to have a baby. I figured it was all over with but since then he’s been weirdly controlling. He yells at me when my phone is upside down or on silent and I think I should do something before it gets worse.

81," 

Hi,

So I've been working a job now for a little more than a year. I work a non-standard shift at a small company (100-150 people).

When interviewing, they asked why I was looking for a new job. I was honest that my previous boss had changed my non-standard shift hours to standard 9-5 with a very short notice, and switched a lot of the workers, myself included, to salary when the company started requiring overtime.

I get the job offer, with similar hours to my original weird shift. I didn't try to negotiate money at all, just my hours, which they wouldn't budge on. I accepted because the hours were close enough to what I wanted, anyway. I started off salary, slightly underpaid based on Glassdoor but much better than the previous place, so I was happy.

Now, my boss hired us a new coworker to take some work load off me. He heavily hinted that I should ""rethink"" my hours since she's started. Anytime we are scheduling meetings and anyone mentions my start time, he makes a face. We are working on a large project recently. He came into my cube today and told me that he's prevented me from being required to do weekend overtime (for work that is not my job anymore, per the new coworker), and so I should really consider changing my hours and doing overtime to help him with the project. I'm fairly certain the change would be permanent.

I get it, I do. It's a small company. If he said the new hours are purely for the project and were not permanent, I wouldn't even be here writing this. Every time a coworker who does slightly similar work to me calls out, I cover them and come in early. Vacation times are covered by me as well. My own work always gets backlogged during this, but I don't really complain because I know there is an end date.

To be honest, the hours I work aren't super-vital to me, but I was looking for a morning part-time job which always fails to pan out anyway with all the coverage I wind up doing. It's more the changing of my routine when he refused to budge on my hours negotiations (which were closer to his new ideal) that feels like I'm being taken advantage of. The training I request always gets pushed aside in favor of mundane ""urgent"" day-to-day tasks, and I feel like I am not learning anything here. There isn't much room for growth skill or money-wise.

So in essence: Is it immature of me to start seeking a new job because of the impending shift change? If not, should I mention to my boss at all beforehand that this is driving me out of the company? Should I suck it up and just be happy I have a job? Basically, am I being a 'spoiled millennial?'

TLDR; Hours changing at new job after I left previous company for the same reason. Is this too petty/immature of a reason to find a new job?",13Dec2018,1

Okay, so I am a sohpmore in univeraity, 19, and I don't know what I want to study. At the moment, I am a pre social work major, bur I just don't know if social work would be the right job field for me. I feel like if you want to be a social worker then you have to be really passionate about it considering the pay is lousy and the hours are long.

I grew up poor (like we almost got evicted several times poor) and I do not know if I want that kind of life. Being a social worker means that I possibly will never get the life I want. I want to have a social life outside of my job, I wanna get married, have a kid, etc. But I can't do all those things if I'm constantly working. It could be worth it if I at least made good money, but I know I won't.
