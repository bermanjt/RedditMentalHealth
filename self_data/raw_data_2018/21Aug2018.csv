1,"Given my background (fairly well-to-do black female of nebulous sexual orientation) I should be really up on politics. It feels kinda selfish of me *not* to be, considering many people pretty similar to me are being disenfranchised. I think I'm complacent because *I'm* in a good place, so why worry?

Another problem for me is that I'm always on the fence about shit. I like to listen to both sides, but then I see the merit in both and then I can't make a decision. It feels really good to ban Neo-Nazis and the alt-right from holding protests, but it also feels kind of iffy, because the whole point of the first amendment is that everyone gets the right to assemble, regardless of what they're actually saying. 

And then, even stuff that I think would be a good idea, like Universal Healthcare, seems like it would have a lot of downsides. Personally, I follow the philosophy of ""choose something and make it the right decision"", but how effective really is that when the only tool I have is a vote? Especially against entities like the NRA that have millions of dollars to sway politicians. 

So how do I get inspired politically? Where am I getting things wrong? How are y'all looking at things? ",21Aug2018,3

3,"And I'm really not excited. It's nothing against my sister at all, I was just excited for teachers to not look at me and see her as well. I really liked the independence. She's always seemed really dependent on me, and I really just wanted my own life at school.  We have a lot of the same friends, so it's not like I'm trying to isolate myself from her, I just really wanted to do my own thing. Plus, the class we're sharing is a smaller class, so there's absolutely no escaping the fact that we're twins. I know teachers don't mean to, but when they have siblings, especially twins, they compare them to each other. They talk about how alike or different we are. They never see just me, they see me as one part of something else, and I don't like being looked at as less than a whole person. It's only one class, and I still have basically all my other ones alone, but I really liked having a completely separate schedule from her. They also might change her lunch when her schedule is finally figured out, and while it would be easier since we have to share a car and we both want to go off campus for lunch once in a while, it's still the same feelings I talked about earlier. I really want to become my own person, away from her. I'm always around her at home, I'm always going to her band things, helping her with homework, and just hanging out. I really just wanted this one thing for myself. She's really looking forward to sharing a class, so there's no way I'd ever bring this up to her, but I really needed to say it. I even told my parents how I felt, but they basically disregarded it, saying teachers don't compare and it would be good for my sister. Sometimes, I don't want to care what's better for her, and I just want to be a little selfish. ",21Aug2018,0
4,"I posted this elsewhere but it got modded off, I really need to share it.

. In the Kazaa/Limewire days, I went to download a Treble Charger music video for my brother, who was a huge Treble Charger fan. I opened it to watch it once it finished downloading to make sure it didn't have any audio or visual issues, otherwise I would download a different copy. I only got a few seconds in, it was some guy screwing a little boy. I deleted it and downloaded a different Treble Charger video which turned out to be the right one. I made friends with the guy who ripped the proper video and he ended up taking some requests from me for others. When he asked how I found him I explained it and he never talked to me again. I know I didn't do it intentionally, but I still feel nauseous thinking about what I saw, I kind of wonder how much of an effect that had on causing me to have bad depression episodes and anxiety, which I had around people anyway, but it always feels like this dirty thing I need to hide. Like some people can just talk and feel good not worrying about saying something bad, I feel like I have to watch what I say in case I ever slip this to someone who thinks I did it intentionally or spreads it through social chains or whatever. It was a complete accident but it makes me feel awful. I remember the sounds the kid was making as well. The adult male that was doing it probably never got in trouble for it and is living fine. I know people who got away with so much bad stuff and it doesn't bother them, I just witness someone doing something awful accidentally and it ends up haunting me for life. There isn't any justice. I feel like the bad guy and it was a complete accident and I didn't enjoy it at all.",21Aug2018,2
5,"I've always loved movies, tv shows and stories about shrinking. I love the reaction of the characters when they shrink. I love how they feel themselves and look around in amazement as they get smaller and their voice gets higher.

I know that there are other girls out there who are obsessed with shrinking so that they could be like a cute doll. That is cool and all but I've always wanted to see someone else get shrunken in real life. It would be totally amazing. It  would be so cool to see people shrink to all sorts of sizes. Like a tall girl becomes a shorty, a short girl becomes a midget and a doll collector becomes a doll.

My friends think this is really weird. They just don't see why it would be so cool to shrink. I think getting shrunken would be so cool. It would be really tingly and be like a great big hug and then everything would be bigger.

What do you think?",21Aug2018,1

While lying there deciding if I get up yet or not something caught my eye. 
A spider dangling about 1m above my still sleeping partners head. 
I could have stayed in bed for another good 30 min. Hell I could have moved the spider they don't bother me on bit, Instead I got up and left the room. 
While sitting with my morning brew I hear the loudest scream ever. 
Oh whoopsi did I forget to say the partner is absolutely terrified of spiders. Apparently by the time the partner woke up the spider was only a few inches from his face. He was too scared to move till the spider had gone.

Like we went out to eat once and it was pretty fun like I told all my friends about it fun. But the thing is I work with them and sometimes all I wanna do is talk or goof off and try to make them laugh and stuff. So I’m thinking it should be too hard to find another fast food job right?

16,"I don´t know how to properly explain it but basically when any part of my body hurts, like having a strong headache or really sore muscles from working out, anything...I would say I feel more ""alive"" and my mind is way way clearer than it normally is.  Like I become aware of my breathing more, of the sounds/noises around me (but not being irritated by them - which otherwise I get irritated quite easily), I don´t ""sweat"" things as much. My mind is a mess most of the time, but in such situations it gets somehow calm. Calm before the storm haha. But yesterday´s headache was both pain in the ass and sort of a blessing. Gotta mention that I´ve been feeling really anxious and stressed out for a longer period of time, and I´m an overthinker...but in those particular moments I feel like the train of my thoughts is slower and I can read my own mind a bit more easily.

21,"Hello, excuse my writing I hurt my hand myself of alcohol (of course) I've been drinking since I was 15 years old. Always been the drunkest girl at the party. Removed my clothes at parties in High School, Peed on a guy while sitting on his lap, hung out with homeless people till 6am because no-one else would drink with me, OD-ed on a drug and landed up in the hospital, fought and beaten up all my ex boyfriends, thrown drinks on people and started abusing for no reason etc. Somehow my childhood friends still love me because sober me is the exact opposite. I'm very calm, funny, quiet when sober. However, when I party I am hardly sober and people who hardly know me, know me as an aggressive, slutty, stupid person. Oh and I've slept with around 10 guys in the past one year because I was too drunk to know what I was doing. So 2 nights back, I went on a date with this guy I have been chatting with on the phone. I end up getting super drunk within one hour of being there (I was day drinking from 1-7pm as well) and start making moves on him, opening his belt, pulling on this necklace he was wearing. Then I forced him to take me home and told him I wanted to sleep with him. He said I was too drunk and needed to get some rest. So I take off my clothes and try forcing myself on him. He refused and said I had to go home and SLEEP. At this point i completely lose it and start behaving like I don't know him and my name is someone else. Like I start making a silly play and behaving like 5 different people. After that I'm like I'm sorry I can't sleep wit you because I probably have an STD and I start hugging him and crying, begging him to take me for a blood test.  I know the story sounds random as hell but these are just random parts of the night I remember. Anyway, he somehow managed to dress me up and dropped me to my car. He messaged me the next day saying he is really worried for me and thinks I need to take it easy. Never wants to see me again. I don't remember what else I did.
whatever, point is that I really really need to quit drinking and doing coke (quite occasionally) I've been crying all day. I can't work, I can't eat. I just feel like a mess. I've ruined another relationship. He enjoyed chatting with me so much when he hadn't seen me wasted and now I go ahead and ruin everything. I wish I could tell my parents I might have a problem and need to see a therapist or go to rehab. ",21Aug2018,26

Thing is, she’s also stressed with family and friends. All that has really been putting some weight on her shoulders. Today I was talking about saturday’s party and she started lashing out at me. I asked why she got so angry amd she started talking about _her_ problems. I get that she is stressed and needs to vent, but it felt very disrespectful to me. I’m trying to help with her problems as well so it’s not like she had no one, but stilll I feel conflicted because I don’t know if that’s selfish.",21Aug2018,3

26,"So going back about a year and a half-two years I was happy but not super happy. I felt alone a lot of the time despite having a bunch of friends etc. etc. it may sound stupid but I was missing that value you get from a relationship. I would try to go on dates and all that but would consistently be stood up and/or ignored after. 

Rewind a year and about a month ago in July of 2017 (I am 19) my family and I go on a cruise for vacation and I meet this wonderful girl at a salsa dancing class and ask her to be my dance partner. She agrees and we had some fun. Throughout that vacation, we hung out a bunch and we had a great time together, but all good things must come to an end.  We depart the cruise ship and I hold back a few tears as we leave because I’ve Ben on cruises before and you usually lose touch with the friends you make after some time.  We drove the long depressing trip home from Miami to Michigan and we go on with our lives. 

The best part is, I stayed in touch with this girl. She lives in New Jersey, goes to this school, etc. etc. One day I ask if she would want to hang out (father’s occupation allows for free standby travel by air) and we get together and I fly out to see her. 

Exactly a year ago today my life changed for the better when we decided to date despite being hundreds of miles apart. I have never been happier before and even though the long distance is hard, I have found the right person that is very much worth it. Big thanks to her for making it work, and thanks to my dad for making it less expensive. 

Just wanted to share this today to everyone

27,"I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’m codependent on members of the opposite sex. I’ve been saying for over a year that I want to stop dating and “just do me”. But I have not been able to keep my promise to myself, and since I know I’m not ready for a relationship I continue to get hurt or hurt others in all of my “flings”. 

I need some solid advice on how to maintain completely platonic relationships with men. I’ve read a thousand article so please spare me from the “find a hobby” line. I live a busy life with family, school and work but somehow without a partner I’m always left feeling incomplete. I know I need to change my way of thinking to live a healthier life and have a better self esteem.

My grandpa had a triple heart bypass yesterday. The doctors/surgeons told him that if he didn’t go through with the surgery he would have a year to live, his heart was in a very bad condition. He is an extremely healthy person other than his heart so the surgeons reassured him that his chances of survival were much higher than the usual 83 year old. However today we found out that his kidney stopped working overnight and he is now on dialysis as well as life support. I have scoured then internet and there is pretty much no information about how likely he is to survive this and it’s driving me crazy because the nurses aren’t giving much information so I don’t know what to expect or what is going to happen.

39,"I'm still shaking, this happened yesterday. I went in pretty tired and neglected to do a proper warmup. My first set for bench was obviously terrible, my last rep I failed and had to push it onto the lower pins. I missed one of the sides but thankfully it got caught on the lowest pin. That woke me up.

The only other person in the gym came running over asking if I was okay and said if I needed a spot just to ask. I said thanks but I was just tired and didn't warm up enough. 

When I tried to start my next couple sets he always came running over to spot me. BUT THIS IS WHERE IT GOES WRONG. For bench I go for 5 reps. After I did a clean 5 reps solo, he grabbed the bar and kept saying ""just one more"" until I did 10. With the last couple most the work done by him.

BUT IT GET WORSE. I am a weak child, only been working out for 3 months, and was already pushing it with the weight. ""COME ON MATE LET'S ADD SOME MORE WEIGHT"" okay, maybe another 2.5kg won't hurt, he grabs two 5kg plates and puts them on my bar.

MY GUY WHAT ARE YOU DOING. this steroids ass mf just put another 10kg onto my bar. Normally for a final set for compounds I'll rest for 4-5 minutes, ""YEAH SO REST FOR 30 SECONDS AND WE'LL HIT IT""

This is how I die... I messaged my friend to delete my browsing history and to tell my cautionary tale to everyone.

Under the bar, knees weak, arms heavy. I managed a rep by myself, second rep I lost some form and struggled to get it up. ""COME ON 4 MORE"" what did I do to deserve this punishment. My spot did most of the work for the last couple reps again.
