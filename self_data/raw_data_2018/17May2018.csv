College freshman virgin nerd here.

To my horror, when I got to college, I found out I was in the oldest dorm they had. This meant instead of the type with showers with private stalls, it was the type with showerheads in an open area.

I was TERRIFIED to shower with the other guys. To the point that I would drive home 30 minutes to shower at my mother's house.

I'm about 5'7, not fat but a chubby belly, with a small package and a big white butt.

Finally, 3 days ago, I decided to try it.

I reluctantly undressed down to my little blue boxers. Took a deep breath and removed them, quickly covering my exposed lower body with a towel.

I then timidly walked towards the steamed up shower with 12 other guys in there, hung the towel on a hook, and walked buck naked past everyone to a showerhead.

There I was, naked as a jaybird, blushing red, and soaping myself up under the hot water, looking both ways in panic.

But then I settled in. Nobody's looking.

Then, a larger boy walked in, saw a friend of his and said ""Move over, small stuff!"" and SLAPPED my naked butt hard as I scurried off, blushing, soapy from head to toe and dripping wet, to another showerhead about 20 feet away as everyone laughed.

I flinched as the water came on cold, but I continued showering.

I backed up, and awkwardly, I bumped bare butt to bare butt with another student.

I said sorry, then he said ""...Ryan? Is that you.""

I said ""Oh my God!! Martin!! From 7th grade?!"" It was my best friend Martin who I hadn't seen in literally 6 years.

We then each subtly looked down and realized we were both butt-ass naked, each blushed red, not-so-subtly covered our penises with one hand each and turned and finished our showers timidly, trying our hardest not to glance at each other.

My friend Sharon of course thinks it's ""the funniest story to imagine I ever heard.""",17May2018,0
1,"I am unacceptable to my friends, my family, and my community. For too long I have indulged my Same Sex Attraction and it has done nothing but bring shame to me and my family. It makes me sick to think that I’ve wasted so many years on filth and I pretended I was proud of it. I even wrote a story about it and shared it with the whole school. Just the thought of my depravity makes me want to vomit.
No more. I AM DONE BEING HATED. I WILL CHANGE AND I WILL BE NORMAL. there’s gotta be a program that can help me change.

3,"So I'm sitting my final exam at university later on today and this would pretty much decide what overall grade I end up with. At the moment I'm on a 2:2 (approx. 3.0-3.3 GPA), for the Americans reading). However, I am pretty close to achieving a 2:1 (3.3-3.6 GPA). I fear that I might *just* miss it by a bit. I would honestly feel so sad if I did. 

I averaged 56% in my second year and am on track for maybe 60-64% overall depending on how well, where my second are third year are split 40:60. 

In order to finish with a 2:1, I'd need 120 credits out of the 240 credits over the 2 years at 60%+ and a weighted average of 67% OR an overall average of 60%. The thing is it's possible that I fall short of the 120 credit requirement with only 115 at 60%+ and with my estimates, it's possible that I end up only averaging 58-59. The exam I'm sitting today is worth 20 credits so if I get 60%ish I'll be fine but if I don't... I could be really screwed depending on how lenient the university are",17May2018,1
4,"Tell them it was okay and it gets better.

I used to be an ugly girl and when you combine that with a social awkwardness and low self esteem, life is hard. Life was hard for me (still is for me, in different ways). I was bullied and I felt the way people treated me differently because of my looks. Boys were not nice to say the least. 

I just remember mornings where it would take me an hour just to pick something that didn’t make me look like a land whale and then just going back to my baggy sweater. My flat ass constantly bothered me and I would always compare myself to other girls. I would literally stare at other girls butts and thighs , I would just look at theirs to compare it to mine.

Then I remember the days where I would be walking to school and feeling so pathetic compared to literally everyone. I still feel that way everyday now but not as prominent.

It just hit me today that I felt really bad for my old self, her days of feeling worthless and having no one. Waking up and thinking was anything even worth it? Looking back, I definitely had depression throughout my middle school years, I don’t know how I didn’t manage to catch it. I still remember religiously watching south park everyday after school and then the episode where stan had depression came up. And everyone and everything just looked like shit and sounded like shit. After the episode ended, I had this ominous feeling and it was like a cloud had gone up above my head because I could see myself in Stan. I still remember writing in my iPod notes and describing my bullies in ways that I didn’t even say in real life. One of the three girls that used to tease me still goes to my high school although she was more of the compliant of the three.

Honestly I’ve never really reflected on my past like this before but it just really hit me today that my teenagehood was really shitty. I just thank my mind for trying to fight through it and make me a decently okay person after this.

I have absolutely no idea how i truly look like, i have certain ideas of how i think i look like but my face seems to completely change depending on my mood, the features i'm fixated in, the mirror i'm looking into and a bunch of other things, the guy i was 6 months ago, as far as I'm concerned, looks nothing like my current self, and i can barely recognize myself in my ""best"" pictures.

Just to give you a little background info, I'm 20, and I've had really bad anxiety since I was pretty young, for several reasons that I won't go into in this post. But anyways, due to my anxiety, I thought I'd never be able to drive. As recently as about a year and a half ago, just getting into the driver's seat of a car would make me feel like I was going to throw up. But once I finally got on the right medication that actually helps me keep my anxiety under control pretty much all the time, I decided that I couldn't let myself go through life never being able to drive. So over the past year, my amazingly patient Mom and stepdad have both spent many hours teaching me everything I need to know to feel comfortable driving, and I really can't thank them enough for that. Today, I finally took my driving test, and passed it with no problems. And just a little while ago, I drove by myself for the first time ever, to my local convenience store and back.

Most edutainment games have a plucky soundtrack, but CF 5th Grade has [this](https://youtu.be/L6Bb9c2YeMo?t=4m17s) music. That and a flower comes up with a robotic sound in the bottom right corner, foreboding what will come later. As you go on you find that people from all sorts of eras are on that island, there are holes swallowing people up, and each flower follows your every move. As you near the end of your adventure, you find [this](https://youtu.be/L6Bb9c2YeMo?t=1h18m15s). The entire island is really a spaceship meant to harvest brains of anyone unlucky enough to encounter it. It gets especially creepy when [you see the aliens themselves](https://youtu.be/L6Bb9c2YeMo?t=1h28m31s).

19,"My partner and I have been together for a long time. During most of our relationship, he has been an introvert. He didn't like going out much nor did he socialize much. He has never really had close friends either. I have never had close friends either but I do love to socialize. He recently got a short term job where he travels on a weekly basis and comes home for 1.5 days.  My initial difficulty started because he was gone. We have never been apart for a long time. We spend most of our time together so when he leaves I feel extremely sad and lonely. I've had to learn to be alone. It has been difficult. When I speak to him, he is fine. Only I am having a hard time. Aside from having to learn to be alone with out him, he is now spending a large amount of time with his new coworkers. They finish work at noon and spend the rest of the time exploring the city they are in. So now he is socializing and getting to explore new places and try new things. He has never really socialized before and he doesn't really like going places. He has completely changed. During the week, he is out in a different city, with new friends, just having fun all day. I am just living my usual life. I miss him so much and there are so many new changes going on with him. I talk to him and he seems to understand but then says comments like "" I wish I could share my adventures with you"" and ""I wish I didn't have to worry that you are sad"". While I understand him, his comments make me feel like I'm wrong and crazy. How am I supposed to adapt to such extreme changes so quickly? And be happy about the many new changes? And be happy for him about his new experiences that I'm not part of? I'm so depressed and I don't know what to do. I seriously have no one to talk to.

25,"So I’m a 18F. 
  
My mum was out and my dad was out of town so I had thought that I had the house to myself for a couple of hours, which I did. 

So an hour after my mum had gone out after succumbing to the horniness, I decided to masturbate, like full on. Completely nude, legs spread wide, really fucking going at it. 

Now keep in mind that the EXTENT TO WHICH any mum is against masturbation is UNREAL. Like I’d be kicked out of the house if I was caught. So there I was just rubbing one off with my door open because no one was home. 

My mum came home early and I had no idea she had come home. I was masturbating with my eyes closed and was kind of moaning and didn’t really notice when she walked INTO MY ROOM WHILE I WAS DOING IT. SHE SAW EVERYTHING. 

SHE LITERALLY STOOD THERE UNTIL I WAS DONE TO GROUND ME REAL BAD. I continued on and on right in front of my mom and moaned, and, quivered, and squirted all over my bed having a great time. This is the good part, which is barely the point of the post, just added this here to show how quickly things changed after she caught me. 

The masturbation was fucking great. But as soon as I regained enough energy to look up. I saw my mum standing there... I was shaking with fear because my bed was covered with what happened and I was just laying their naked. 

Forget just getting caught during the act, my mum just saw me squirt and orgasm all over the bed and laying in the mess I made. She didn’t even kick me out as I expected, what happened was even worse, I ended up feeling shamed and had guilt forced upon me. she got real mad and even asked me to get straight of the bed when I was butt naked and slapped me kind of hard once or twice and she really meant it and it hurt. 

She was insanely mad. She didn’t even let me put any clothes on. She just forced me to sit down and listen to a really long lecture, how I’m abusing my own body, idk why but some of the things she said made me feel very uncomfortable because the stuff she was saying was very specific to my body and not just in general and made me feel insanely guilty about it. And if she catches me again, it’s going to be a lot worse than one slap, I’d probably get kicked out for real. She just made me stand there butt naked and shout at me for a long time before looking at me with disgust. 

She later told my told my dad and used me as an example to my sister to show her what not do do and I kind of felt like I was shamed in front of my whole family for my body and what I was doing to it. She told them everything and made it sound like I continued to masturbate even when I knew she was in the house. I’ve never felt this awkward or weird. She made me stand there and was basically insulting me and my body and I just had to stand there and say nothing. 

I am never leaving my door unlocked when I do something like this again. I really felt bad about the slap and the guilt she made me feel after catching me do that. 

TL;DR my mom caught me masturbating, slapped me, ranted about it while I was still naked and made me feel like I was abusing my own body. ",17May2018,1
26,"My sister is in high school, and a friend of hers (that she kinda sorta knows) has been picking her up and taking her to school. Usually it’s a win win, she has more time to get ready, isn’t sitting at the school for 20 minutes before classes start, and usually they grab breakfast.

Well yesterday morning, I had to be at work at 9 AM. My drive is roughly 1.5 hours, depending on traffic. So I leave around 7:15-7:30. My sister starts *screaming* that her ride isn’t here and she needs to get to class. I was already awake, I was willing to take her. Then the kid pulled up and got her to school.

Fast fucking forward to today. I didn’t get home until 2:30 AM (back to back jobs and went to the gym for half an hour), showered, and ended up in bed at 4 AM. Next job doesn’t start until 11AM, so 5-6 hours is enough sleep for me. But she calls me. At 6:54 AM saying “I went to the bus stop because (kid’s name) didn’t pick me up. Well I missed the bus too. Please come get me.” 

I get the fuck up, grab my shoes and a glass of water. Maybe 3 minutes, and she calls back and goes “Dude, we gucci. He picked me up.”

I. Am. SO. Fucking. Pissed. 

I just started to yell. I can’t fall back asleep. I got 2 god damn hours of sleep because my sister is irresponsible and cannot fucking take care of herself. She thinks she’s an adult but my God she is the most immature person I’ve met.

So, now I get to work a 14 hour shift on two hours of sleep. 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃😭😭😭😭😭",17May2018,0

28,"Yeah, I realized I'm learning a lot. I'm 20 years old now and for the longest time I've been very confused about a lot of things. \(and still am\) Ever since moving up in my job to a position where I can now delegate and tell people what to do, its opened my eyes. 

A lot of people do not care about you. Think about it. There's those few people in your life like siblings, family, or even some friends that you can confide in and tell the world to, but other than that who cares? I tell someone to have a good day as they leave with food I made for them in their hands, I don't mean it. I'd say its more of an automated response in order to look good. Be honest with yourself, how often do you find yourself thinking about someone else and actively doing things to better them? Yes, there are several cases where people are taking care of loved ones, or if someone is sick they will be cared for by the people that love them. Other than that, no one cares. And that's not me being cynical whatsoever, I genuinely believe that. Sure an old friend will pop up in my mind and I will wonder how they're doing but I don't care. It doesn't affect me positively or negatively. No one cares what I listen to. No one cares what I watch. And if someone did care, they wouldn't the next day. 

I used to be so self conscious about a lot of things. The way I looked, the way I spoke, the way I walked. Everything about myself I practically hated. Except I realized that I don't care about all these people in front of me. You're fat? that sucks. You got a bad haircut? that sucks. Your breath smells? go brush your teeth. I know I will never remember half the faces that I see and I KNOW they wont remember me. Everybody in life is too busy with their own problems to remember me. As long as I treat people with respect, I keep this facade of a normal human being. I find that I don't share things with a lot of people because I know they will not care. When people ask what I did on the weekends I tell them nothing. Its easier than telling them I played counterstrike for 12 hours straight and how I find videogames incredibly interesting and they do not. I think I'm happier now realizing no one cares about me. As long as I stay decent to people, I'll just be another passing face on the street.  ",17May2018,1

I gave my friend every cent that I had at that point and sure. $25 might be a lot for people, like me and him, but anything back would have been good. A fucking dollar to get ramen would have been amazing. 

I hate my fucking life.",17May2018,14
34,"*(I posted this to NoSleep but it was removed shortly after. Just so people could still take a look at it if they enjoyed it, I thought I'd post it here.)*

I started using one of those dating apps a few months ago. Everyday I'd check to see if I'd gotten any matches. 

Very few, if any, and we'd never exchange more than a few messages.

Maybe I had terrible luck. Who knows. 

The idea of having a caring woman in my life took over me. It's all I thought about. I just wanted to feel loved. I lost count of how many times I was rejected or how many of my messages went unanswered. 

One day, I was matched with someone new. Who could this be? I opened the app on my phone to see who'd liked my profile and was met with the grey silhouette of a person. 

No profile image. Damn. 

My imagination crept through so many possibilities. She could have been hideous and ashamed. She could have been gorgeous yet mysterious. What an amazing experience it would be if this woman with no face was stunningly beautiful. 

I was lonely and curious, so I messaged her: ""Hey.""

""Hey,"" she responded. 

We talked for a bit. She was kind. She asked about my day and I asked about hers. ""I'm Kaitlyn, call me Kate,"" she said. I loved her name and told her so. Our introductions turned into long conversations that lasted several days. They were wonderful. Still, what did she look like? I wanted to know. So badly. 

Not wanting to be too direct or demanding, I started by asking her, ""Do you think you're attractive?""

""I don't know. It's complicated.""

""Complicated?""

""I used to be. I know that.""

Her situation wasn't what I expected. She *was* attractive, maybe the most gorgeous girl many guys had ever seen. One such guy charmed her more than she could resist, and so they began dating. This boyfriend of hers, however, was jealous. He was untrusting. He was cruel. A person can only handle so much heartless behavior before they say no more. 

The day she left him, he flew into a rage. He hit her, beating her brutally till she lay on the floor motionless. Yet this wasn't enough for him. He had something nearby in a metal jar, a chemical that burned like liquid fire. He opened this jar and splashed its contents on her face. 

She suffered terribly as her eyes boiled out and her skin slid off, peeling away in bloody chunks.  

After her assault, she wouldn't dare to look in a mirror. She couldn't bear the thought of what she looked like. Her absence of pictures wasn't to hide herself from men; instead, she sought to hide herself from herself. 

My heart went out to her. What a horrible story. In providing reassurance, she confessed she felt the same as me. ""I'm so alone. I want someone to love me again.""

These conversations of ours continued until we decided to finally meet. I never asked her for pictures of what she looked like, as I'd decided to just wait to see in person. The idea of being some open-minded, all loving saint distorted my thinking. I convinced myself no matter what her appearance was, I would focus only on her personality and make her mine. She was my escape from loneliness and I would not let her go.

We agreed to meet for dinner. I got there first and waited anxiously for my date, though I didn't have to wait long. When she arrived, she didn't even have to introduce herself. I *knew* it was her. 

Slowly walking over was a woman with ghostly eyes, paler than I'd ever seen before. Half of her face was charred and disfigured, as were both her hands. ""Hey,"" she greeted through her mangled teeth. 

""Hey.""

I helped her to her seat. Her eyesight was poor, so I had to explain what was on the menu. ""Thank you,"" she said, ""you're good to me. It's so great. Do you think I’m pretty?"" She added. 

""Beautiful,"" I lied. 

She wasn't. Any beautiful face I imagined vanished at the sight of her. There was no way to convince myself she was anything less than grotesque. I felt horrible. I pitied her. 

Even as we ate, I couldn't bear to look directly at her. ""We should meet again,"" she said, ""don't you agree?""

""Of course,"" I reluctantly replied. The words came out as an impulse. I'd been so desperate to have a woman in my life that I couldn't possibly say no. Even to *her*. 

The regret of agreeing to another date caused my head to spin. An ugly lightheadedness clutched me as we left the restaurant that day, though I continued to fool myself. I thought my feelings of disgust would fade as time went on and I'd finally feel the gentleness of a woman's affection. 

This is not what happened. The more of thought of her, the more sickened I felt. I was nauseated as I reflected on her horrific eyes and flesh. What had happened to her was terrible but, god, the result couldn’t be ignored.

Our next meeting was at another restaurant, where I once again struggled to see my date as another human being. 

""What do you do in your free time?"" I asked, trying to be friendly. 

""I love music,"" she replied, ""I sing."" 

""Oh? You do?""

The building we sat in was small. Not many other people were there, though I saw them staring at us. At her. She ignored the judgmental glares as she turned to observe a dark red door leading to an exit. 

*""I see... a red door, and I want it painted black.""* She softly sang, looking back at me.

*""No colors... anymore. I want them to turn black.""*

I knew that song. I would have complemented her in another pathetic attempt to be courteous, but I couldn't. Her horrible gaze sank into me as a smile grew on her face. She looked like a monster singing a twisted tune. 

*""I look inside myself and see my heart is black.""*

*“I see my red door and must have it painted… black.”* 

Even listening to her song became nearly impossible. Once again, the room began to feel as if it were spinning. I was so disgusted by her. I'm sorry. I hate to say it but I was. Part of me wanted to just walk off from the date, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. 

""For next time,"" she exclaimed at the end of her song, ""where should we go?""

If only I could tell her no, I could have put this experience behind me. I didn't. Again, I somehow let the words slip out, ""You choose."" Was I really this lonely? Was I so desperate that I'd put myself through another date with this woman?

She rose from her chair and observed me carefully. ""Do you still love me?"" She asked.

""Of course I do,"" I responded with a smile. 

What?

Why would I say that? I'd never said I loved her, right? Even as miserably lonely as I was, why would I possibly bring up anything about love? Every fiber of my being wanted to correct what I'd said. And yet, I couldn't. I was compelled to remain silent as our date ended and she walked away. 

Now I was worried. I wondered if I'd fallen so deep in my isolation that I'd somehow *programmed* myself to have these responses. I was trapped. 

No. I had to stop this.

No matter what I felt, I promised myself I'd tell this woman I wouldn't see her again during our next date. Seeing her was wrong. I knew it was wrong and I couldn't do it anymore. The lies I told her to make her feel good and the lies I told myself to make me feel like a ""good guy"" had lost control. 

My mind was a fog of “what ifs"" as I approached the third restaurant for our date. She was there before me. A second seat had already been pulled out at the table she sat at, so I took a deep breath and joined her. 

""Kate,"" I started, without even a hello.

""I love you so much. You're my world. I can't stand the thought of being apart from you for even a moment. I...""

*What the fuck was I doing?!* 

My words came to an abrupt halt. I stared in a daze as the woman stared back at me, smiling a huge smile. The sound of my heart pounding rattled up my neck and down my arms. This wasn't me. It wasn't *me* saying these things. 

I no longer cared about being polite, I had to get out of there even if it meant running off that very moment. Yet I remained seated. Other patrons at the restaurant shot angry glares at our table. I could feel their judgments. I hated it. 

""Please,"" I desperately murmured, ""I want to go. Please let me go."" 

She sat silently. Unresponsive. She stared deep into my eyes as if she could see how deeply I regretted being there. Pointing at her face, her voice erupted in anger, ""I see their reactions. Everyone’s. I see people turn their heads quickly to look away. You too?""

Her words and my desperation not to hear them became overwhelming. The walls were suffocating as they closed in. My hands shook. My breaths became lighter and faster to match a frightened heart beating deeply in my chest. 

And I still couldn't bring myself to leave. 

""Oh my love,"" she growled, brushing the burns on her cheek, ""I could not foresee this thing happening to you.""

She leaned in closer to me. Her pale eyes pierced through mine as she reached over to hold my trembling hand, ""*My love* will laugh with me before the morning comes.""

I helplessly nodded, whimpering as I gave into my hopelessness, until…

Wait. 

No. 

That wasn't right. What she said, wasn't that the song again?

My head jolted back and I gazed around the room. *My* room. I sat on my bed, clutching my phone in my hand. The music I was listening to had repeated several times, so I pulled my earbuds out and took a deep breath. 

There, still on my phone, was the grey silhouette of a person. I'd spent so much time in this bizarre fantasy that I'd nearly forgotten where I was. I was lonely, maybe almost desperate, but I was too uneasy to give this woman with no pictures a chance.

And so I swiped left.

I've been shaving my balls for almost 15 years now, and I'm still not as competent as I thought I'd be. 

As a trimmer/maintainer, I don't take it down to lil'boy bare skin, so no blades are involved, but after a dozen different electric shaft slicers- erm electric shavers, I'm gun shy about the task. 

Based on my scientific research, I'm not overly furry. I use shave gel in the shower, I carefully take my time, I pull things taught...yet I still wind up bitten by my trimmer. Often on my gooch seam, not fun.

38,"I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls (only 2 of them are in this , a blonde girl and a brunette girl) were there for a few hours in the night at the end before closing time the blonde girl in that group walked up stairs with some other girl  to the toilet she kept looking back at me down the stairs and giggling/laughing a bit couldn’t make it out fully. a while later I walked around the corner towards by where they were sitting one of them (that same blonde girl) was looking at me and I looked at her and she didn’t look away (she politely tightened her lips together like a pleasant smile idk how to describe it)  and  then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say whisper to her friend the brunette girl 'that lads just been staring at me'. another while later I was cleaning a table (they were the last customers left in there it was late before closing) and the brunette girl asked over at me ‘excuse me’ twice then I looked and then she asked ‘how do you get a job in here?’ I answered and walked towards her because she asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) I said yes and she was saying they don’t know her that well and said she’s weird (but the blonde girl was like ‘aww no don’t say that’ etc) the  brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit....yer know’ and then  looked at me then grew a smile and said 'she likes you' and they all laughed I just walked away. I then went back to finish cleaning the table and then the same brunette girl asked ‘excuse me’ twice I looked then she looked tipsy as she asked pointing at me 'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she said  'have you got a girlfriend?' (She said it pleasantly) I ignored her and their was a pause then  the blonde girl then said 'aww leave him alone...he’s dead cute' (idk if she said it like puppy dog cute is that bad?) and then said “he probably has” as she looked over at me and smiled the brunette asked me it again saying ‘have you? have you got a gf’ intriguingly and I blanked her looking pissed off and then the blonde girl said “aww leave him alone now hes fumin” .

45,"A [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8k1fyd/attn_journalists_for_the_love_of_god_stop_putting/) on /r/movies noted an interesting trend among headline writers for film news: ending their opinion articles with ""and that's a good thing"".

I realized that I've noticed a similar trend among headlines in general--across every genre of news. I decided to do a little searching to see just how widespread this is, and...it's *extreme*.

Every one of these articles is from 2018. I have a feeling the trend began a long time ago. Google Ngrams aggregates data from books, not web articles, but can provide a pretty good estimate for general language trends. [Ngrams seems to indicate that ""that's a good thing"" has spiked since 1995](https://i.imgur.com/OC8LWJg.png). This graph only uses data through 2007. I suspect the trend has only gotten worse in the decade since.

#Headline writers: please stop telling us how to feel.

I graduated from college about a year ago. During my senior year I became infatuated with this girl, let's call her Bridget. I thought she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. After talking to Bridget for a while I realized we had so much in common. I was crazy for this girl, she was constantly on my mind. Now, I normally do alright with the ladies and I've hooked up with plenty of girls before. But when I hooked up with Bridget it was the most magical night of my life. However, I think I was too overbearing and freaked her out. She stopped answering my calls or texts and when I saw her in person I could see she didn't want anything more than friendship. So life went on and I spent the rest of my senior year totally depressed thinking about Bridget all the time. I would see her Instagrams and Snapchat stories and it would fill me with sadness knowing I'll never get to really know her. She was the one that got away. Eventually I graduated and my life completely changed. Becoming an adult and working my first full time job was a very difficult adjustment. My head became filled with powerful emotions of sadness, confusion, anger, and hopelessness. Everything I knew about my life had changed and I missed college. However, I ran into this other girl (let's call her Jessica) from my school when I went back for homecoming. We had hooked up before and I always felt very comfortable around her. So we go on a few dates and things go really well. The problem is that I realize she is in the same major and sorority as the girl I was obsessed with, Bridget. This made me reconsider dating Jessica but I decided that I should go for it and things have been pretty great. She is now my girlfriend and I love her very much. She is beautiful, funny, smart, and selfless...but (I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this) I have never been able to get Bridget off my mind. I've put the idea of a relationship with her on such a pedestal that nothing can ever reach it. I still see her sometimes as Jessica and Bridget both had a 5th year of school for their Masters and are friends. So I see her around occasionally and on social media and it hurts my heart to look at her. She has a boyfriend now and I could never date her after Jessica but there is still a tiny sliver of hope in my mind that I will be with Bridget one day. I know this is totally unfair to Jessica and I've tried to keep it to myself and bottle it up but I think she can tell. I don't know what to do. I don't want to break up with Jessica because she does make me happy and I can't tell her about my feelings for Bridget, that would crush her. The problem is that she will always remind me of college and Bridget. I doubt will actually read this all the way through, but I just need to get it off my chest. It's absolutely destroying me and I have nobody to turn to. ",17May2018,1

49,"Did you know that a gallon of gas is equivalent to about 31,000 calories? That means one gallon of gas could energize a person for 15 days. For $5 you could power yourself for the entire month. 

The thing is, plants actually turned all that into calories millions of years ago. Now we burn it for $2.50 to go to the grocery store to buy a weeks worth of food for $80...

How can we justify this? Most adults in the USA burn more than an acre’s worth of produce in fuel a year, a lot more for many. And that’s just with driving. Forget all the power we use from coal, natural gas, and oil or the fact that we ship things with highly inefficient trucks. 

I get that we have a standard of life we’re used to, and that it’s fairly cheap to collect and use this resource, but considering the human body gets over 900 miles to the gallon, I think we have about improve by about 30,000% to catch up with what nature’s been doing forever.

Well, I had to learn the content myself, but someone had to explain things clearly to me beforehand. 


This time I’m alone. And it makes me reflect on my life (instead of learning). I don’t feel entitled to help. I never ask for it. But in the past I’ve always had friends who proposed to help, I’ve always taken up their offer. 


And that’s it. I feel like I’m totally unable to do things on my own. I need someone to push me forward. It has become more or less a personality trait. A few years back, I really was the one who pushed for things to be done, the one who helped the others. For the last three to four years, I’ve had people helping me, not the other way around. I hate it. 


And I ask myself what I can do to change it. Seems so easy : offer help to someone. But I feel like I’ve got nothing to offer. 


(And then it spirals down to « how can people be friendly to me when I have nothing to offer ? I phone friends ? I talk to them about my struggles. I talk to other friends ?

54,"I was friends  with this girl in my last year of high school. We had lunch together everyday and she’d even skip her class after to sit and talk to me sometimes. She had a boyfriend, so obviously I wasn’t going to do anything. 

Eventually I graduate (she was in the grade below me) and we go our own ways. We don’t talk for about 6 months, where we briefly caught up over Instagram. Then, it wasn’t until March of this year that she broke up with her boyfriend, and we start talking again. 

Except I’m a fucking jackass. For some reason, I really just can’t ever follow through with women. I always either get too scared, intimidated, or something else, and end up ghosting them. Even if I really like talking to them. I don’t get it. 

We FaceTimed a couple times, had lengthy text conversations, etc. I planned on asking her out, but I didn’t really know how to do it since I don’t drive. Then one night, she texts me and says that I should come to work and talk to her.  And naturally, my weak mind decides to not reply. I don’t even know why, I couldn’t tell you. 

Not only did I not reply, but I didn’t reply for an entire month. It wasn’t until a few weeks ago that I got really drunk at a party and FaceTimed her at four in the morning that I said anything back. She responded in the morning and asked if I called her, and I explained that I was drunk and sorry if I waked her up, haven’t said anything to her since. 

This shit is driving me crazy though. All throughout the day I just have random thoughts of her. And I know this is going to sound ridiculous and cheesy, but I’ve even had dreams involving her. 

I’m just a really lonely pathetic guy I guess. I don’t have anyone I can talk to in real life about this, but I really needed to get it off my chest and talk about it with someone. I guess time will pass and eventually this will blow over, but it really does suck now. Should I even bother messaging her again? Idk anymore. She’s a really nice person and I doubt she’s mad at me or anything.

57,"Hi all,

It seems like short men have become a common thing to talk about again in the wake of this whole ""incel"" thing being in the news. From tabloid-ey news sites to Instagram to Snapchat, there's occasionally articles and stories that talk about height and its importance. 

I am not an ""incel"" and I don't really have trouble interacting with people. 

But whenever I see stuff talking about height or Instagram captions like ""why do short men even exist"" it kinda hurts. Like I'm somehow now living my life to the fullest due to my height, and that I'm somehow worth less that a more full-height individual.

How do you guys deal with this? How do I stop letting this stuff effect me? I've struggled with confidence due to my height for probably 4 or 5 years now, and I'd love to feel like a normal, valuable person. ",17May2018,1

I’m posting my introduction to him and the first story at the same time, so if you want to get to the first actual story, then check my post history or elsewhere on this sub.

He’s the type of cop where if he pulled you over, then your first thought is going to be “oh, I’m fucked.  This guy will not go easy on me.”  He’s a large, beefy man with a shaved head who always looks so angry that even the slightest pressure could make him snap into a rage.  I’ve known him my whole life, but even if he pulled me over, he’d probably go even harder on me just because he knows I’m a stoner.  That’s the kind of asshole this man is.

We’ve been neighbors for life.  He’s 3 years older than me.  When we were kids, he was always the cool, older kid that everybody in the neighborhood wanted to hang out with.  In high school, he was a football star and a weight lifting star.  I don’t know why it happened, but he grew up to be a gigantic asshole.",17May2018,0
60,"Before I get into what happened that night, I have to give some background information.  Growing up, my sister was best friends with that asshole cop.  They’re the same exact age, and I always thought that they’d get married some day, but that’s never going to happen now.  

My sister is a heroin addict.  She has been for years.  When she first got into it, she dated a string of junkie boyfriends.  This junkie boyfriend phase was a really rough time for my family because it was before my parents gave up on my sister, so there was lots of arguing.

My sister and her 2nd junkie boyfriend had an extremely toxic relationship.  All they would do together was get high and fight.  Almost every night at my house you could hear them screaming at each other.  It would be so loud that the neighbors could hear.  They would occasionally hit each other, but there was never much violence.  My sister treated him just as badly as he treated her.

At this point, that asshole cop was still in cop school, but I’ll refer to him as asshole cop or AC just to keep things easy.  AC asked my mom if she needed his help dealing with my sister’s boyfriend.  My mom said yes, and he said that if he heard them arguing, then he would come over and take care of it.

Just for some perspective, the junkie boyfriend was about 5’4” and maybe 135 pounds while AC had about 10 inches on him and was over twice his weight.  We knew that AC wouldn’t beat this guy up or anything, but we assumed that he would intimidate the junkie boyfriend into leaving.

As usual, a fight broke out, so my mom told my brother to go and get AC.  Once AC came over he told my mom that he’s calling the police.  My mom was terrified of my sister getting arrested because she believed that it would ruin her life, so my mom was literally begging AC not to do that.  She explained to him that she was afraid that the police would find heroin and arrest my sister.  AC called the police, told them that there was a domestic dispute, told them that needles were involved, and then he left.  That was his idea of taking care of the situation.

My mom had a panic attack waiting for the police.  She thought that this was the night that my sister would be arrested and have her life ruined, but all the police did was ask questions and leave.  Nothing came of it.  

My mom felt betrayed.  AC told her that he would help and that he would take care of this situation for her and all he did was make things worse.  He had gotten her hopes up, and then he crushed them.  My mom has hated him ever since.  

I want to be clear, AC isn’t an asshole for calling the cops on my sister.  He’s an asshole for what he put my mom through.  He offered to help and he didn’t do shit.  If he was going to call the police, then he didn’t need to offer his help.  He could hear the fighting just like the other neighbors.  He could’ve just called the cops on his own.  On top of that, my mom specifically tells him that she’s afraid of my sister getting arrested for heroin and he responds to that by warning the police that there’s needles.  That was a horrible night.

TL;DR:  asshole cop is still in cop school at this point.  He offers to help my mom deal with my heroin addicted sister’s boyfriend because they are constantly screaming at each other.  Instead of actually doing anything helpful, he calls the police and warns them that needles are involved after my mom begs him not to and told him that she was afraid of my sister getting arrested.  He goes back home.  My mom has a panic attack.  The cops ask a few questions and leave.  My sister and her boyfriend continue to date for a few more months while constantly screaming at each other.",17May2018,1

College freshman virgin nerd here.

To my horror, when I got to college, I found out I was in the oldest dorm they had. This meant instead of the type with showers with private stalls, it was the type with showerheads in an open area.

I was TERRIFIED to shower with the other guys. To the point that I would drive home 30 minutes to shower at my mother's house.

I'm about 5'7, not fat but a chubby belly, with a small package and a big white butt.

Finally, 3 days ago, I decided to try it.

I reluctantly undressed down to my little blue boxers. Took a deep breath and removed them, quickly covering my exposed lower body with a towel.

I then timidly walked towards the steamed up shower with 12 other guys in there, hung the towel on a hook, and walked buck naked past everyone to a showerhead.

There I was, naked as a jaybird, blushing red, and soaping myself up under the hot water, looking both ways in panic.

But then I settled in. Nobody's looking.

Then, a larger boy walked in, saw a friend of his and said ""Move over, small stuff!"" and SLAPPED my naked butt hard as I scurried off, blushing, soapy from head to toe and dripping wet, to another showerhead about 20 feet away as everyone laughed.

I flinched as the water came on cold, but I continued showering.

I backed up, and awkwardly, I bumped bare butt to bare butt with another student.

I said sorry, then he said ""...Ryan? Is that you.""

I said ""Oh my God!! Martin!! From 7th grade?!"" It was my best friend Martin who I hadn't seen in literally 6 years.

We then each subtly looked down and realized we were both butt-ass naked, each blushed red, not-so-subtly covered our penises with one hand each and turned and finished our showers timidly, trying our hardest not to glance at each other.

My friend Sharon of course thinks it's ""the funniest story to imagine I ever heard.""
