Because of my non existant social life and terrible anxiety most of my time is spent indoors usually online

I usually avoided politics and kept to watching funny animations and new game videos

But over the years youtubes algorithim made it almost impossible to avoid politics

I began watching all those anti sjw videos and anti feminist videos and and became preety vocal about it always hating on feminists and getting into flame wars in the comments section

After a while i realised that all these people i hated barely existed 

Then i left all that nonsense behind me and didnt really have any political leaning for a while

Then i decided to get back into politics and i was preety liberal on most issues 

I kept a liberal mind on most things but one day i saw people in the comments section arguing about capitalism

I was confused because i was always thought that capitalism was the best system 

Then i saw people advocating for socialism and communism and i was shocked because in history class i learned that they were evil systems out to kill everyone

Because of this i decided to go on places like reddit on subs like r/latestagecapitalism

I started hearing arguments from the other side on why capitalism is a bad system but i still wasnt conviced and they also banned me lol

Then i went to r/completeanarchy and that hit the nail in the coffin for capitalism for me, i began to realise that our system is shit and divides us 

I kept reading that sub for a while and reading more and more and then i finally chose to identify as an anarcho communist but i still hated people like lenin and Mao 

I started hating the police system more and more, i started hating fascists more and more, i started seeing propaganda everywhere in movies and shows and other stuff aswell

Then someone reccomened leftypol for me and i decided to take a look, i only lurked and never posted because i knew 8chan was a toxic hellhole

Anyways after reading a bit i found the term anarkiddie thrown around alot, then i read some arguments as to why anarchists are so disliked 

They said that while some of the killings were true alot of it was western propaganda made to make them look bad

Of course i called bullshit and said that they were lying

But as of recently i have become very symapthetic towards them, and i started dismissing history books as western propaganda and i became sick of the conusmer culture and i stopped visiting malls unless i really needed something 

Then i began watching old communist videos on youtube and i was enjoying them

I even started thinking to myself that the killings were necessary and the famines unfortunate for them

I was horrified at myself for this and decided to delete my other account and stop with politics all together and i got rid of the books i had 

But i cant escape the mindset and my mind hasnt changed at all and i still think the same

Im discusted with myself now and i regret getting into politics

If you read all of this then thank you also sorry if my writing is shitty, i was never good at english

1,"The good after the bad is the holy grail for a lot of us, and I think I'm nearly there, but how do you comprehend what happened?

&amp;#x200B;

Being depressed was horrible. I wanted to die a lot, and it cost me my job and my relationship (which itself was made worse by my low self-esteem, permissive attitude: being forcefully kicked out of bed, having my hair pulled, being insulted, constant talking about his ex -- all only made me closer to him, so being dumped ruined me). I've spent months living off my savings without prospects, my own place, or any friends or places to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I've been getting better. Probably don't need to delve too much, and things are touch-and-go, but as horribly anxious as I am, I'm able to set goals and be productive again. I'm not indulging any outright destructive habits (which has left me rather idle, in a funny old turn -- sometimes I'm not sure what to think about so I just watch Sailor Moon lol. Watching media when I was depressed was unthinkable). 

The issue is that I'm kind of emerging as a sensible and coping person in a ruin that I created. It's a bit weird because I am functional again but also more acutely aware of the mess that's been made because I am able to think outside of myself for once, and not just relentlessly spiral. I haven't hurt anybody, but I'm kind of financially, professional, geographically nowhere, and all my old friends are living the life

So gaining hope, in a way, is pretty bitter.

I read a lot about depression, I haven't read much about rehabilitation. ",25Nov2018,1
2,"Basically I am living paycheck to paycheck, can barely afford food so no meds or therapy. I try to socialize but no one replies and/or ghosts me, doing excersizes is the only escape but that gets repeptive quickly, &amp; I've been seeking a girlfriend but absolutely 0 progress after years, ughhhh",25Nov2018,1
3,"This is probably going to be kinda disorganized and just over all incoherent, so I’m sorry about that, but I need to tell this story to someone, and y’all seem like you’d be a fun bunch to share it with.

So I was visiting my family for thanksgiving, and while I was there, I was talking to my brother. We were shootin’ the breeze and he brought up how I never cry at funerals (I don’t cry at all anymore, I can tell that story another time.) so my 11 year old sister chimes in with “No wonder your girlfriend cheated on you. She needed someone with a soul. You’ll never get a real girlfriend if you don’t have a soul.” My girlfriend cheating on me, even though it’s been a month, is still a very very sensitive wound, as I had been with her through a lot of high school and almost all of my adult life. So fuck that kid. Little shit. ANYWAY, I’m floored by what she has said. I’m thinking in my mind “you can say those words and the people police don’t come and arrest you?” Obviously you can, cause she did. So, for a little back ground on her, she’s 11 years old, all she eats is PB&amp;J, Mac and Cheese, Pizza, Chicken Nuggets, Pop Tarts and Pancakes. So I looked at her, and I said “You’ll never get a boyfriend cause you only order off the kid’s menu.” This made her very very upset. I’m a 23 year old man, I shouldn’t be doing this shit. I feel pretty terrible for saying it, but what I said is true. So maybe she’ll start eating more food. Who knows. This was kinda ranty, sorry, I just needed to say it.",25Nov2018,1
4,"The Office, Parks and Rec, Brooklyn Nine Nine, etc.

People don't like to admit that they prefer no-stakes media; it's a shame that these kinds of shows are so mainstream, instead of more complex or ambitious stuff. I certainly enjoy these types of shows on occasion also, but people's addiction to a lot of these is telling about how deeply they think about general stuff.",25Nov2018,1
5,"Being “successful” is the only thing I have going for me.

I just study and work 24/7, pays off really well and I’m where I want to be right now. All I can think about is more school, more work, and the future.

I have probably about 3-4 friends I don’t see that often, no close family. Try hard to meet people but swamped in responsibility. Don’t think I’ll ever get company or life experience. Never celebrated holidays properly because had nobody to do it with. 

Deep down I don’t think I’ll ever get to that stuff. Having fun. It hasn’t happened to me before in my life so I doubt it’ll come to me. 

Luckily, I’m choosing a career where you barely get time to sleep or take off...goal is to just work until I drop. I do want to travel, though. But who doesn’t?",25Nov2018,1
7,"I missed a massive hint from a girl I like.

This happened a few months back, we are still friends.

We were rolling on Mdma in the evening. We talked about deep topics, emotions, we hugged and cuddled a lot, smoked a lot, went around a nearby forrest.. the usual stuff you do on mdma.

When the effects came to an end we were laying outside on a few air mattresses cuddling and watching the stars. We were alone at her house so no one could see us.
After the effects were gone we continued talking about life and our future and stuff.
Then, she looked at me in that weird way and started kissing neck.

Dumb me thought it must have been just the ecstasy. Hours after it was over. Hours.

After about 10 seconds of me not doing anything she stopped.

It shot me in the head a few hours later before we fell asleep.
I feel bad because I probably made her feel bad.

8," I've lived all 17 years of my life without social media whatsoever (I don't count Reddit because it's not really communicating with IRL people).

I have a post-less Instagram account on my iPad that I occasional sign onto to get ahold of friends (though hardly receive any messages from it because I never look).

I don't own a cell phone. (Yes, last year of high school and don't own a phone. Also in a somewhat affluent area... so yeah. Though I guess it also isn't a surprise when I tell you I'm a bit of a loser, or at the very least think I am).

Life goes on. People always ask me: ""How do you live without!?!?!?! arghhhh!!!!"" The reality is, I have never known any better. I live just fine, as people did 20 years ago. It's also given me a perspective on how ridiculous the whole social media scene is: especially in teenagers (and older than that you should be mature enough to stay off of it generally anyways).

\- People post half-nude shots seeking attention

\- People post scenes of underage intoxication/themselves in drunken messes (who cares about jobs, university, and scholarships?)

\- People post any social situation they encounter (tagging as many people as possible, because look at me - I have so many friends! Why bother enjoying the event for what it is, rather than making sure that my Instagram entourage knows?)

\- People post opinions that are bound to be unpopular with somebody (God forbid if I were to post some of my very rationally justified, but not so politically correct opinions. Frankly, you could post the most innocuous political stance and it could probably piss off 30% of people - though that is if it were shown to the general population, as social media tends to cherry pick and keep people with akin views together)

\- People's posts are permanent. Somebody can stare at your post and keep coming back. If you fuck up, it's there ""forever"". Yet in some cases, the only comments on a major fuck-up are ""ohhh babe you're so sexy"". It just isn't the same as an evanescent wrong-saying/doing IRL. It never will be.

I could go on and on and on. I wish people would realize where we are going with this and consider the very real risks, even if it means being a little bit of a pariah. I'm not one to protest change, as society inevitably evolves and much of what was scorned upon in the past is now a cornerstone of our everyday life. We need to learn traditional social skills - outside of 6ix9ine references and what we saw on Snapchat.

Why is this ""modernization"" of socialization bad? We have undertaken on a very drastic change to a key aspect of our lives in such a short period of time. Humans have lived for thousands of years with socialization either gradually evolving or ossified. To rewrite this paradigm so quickly... we have no idea what comes next.

**Just slow the fuck down everyone. That's all I'm saying.**",25Nov2018,1
9,"And what I mean is that you can either be Elon Musk or a  renowned Serial Killer. If you let me in I'll let you in.
I don't consider myself lonely even tho I lived most of my life alone.
My social interactions have risen a lot during these last year and I got to know a lot of people but no one seems to really want me around.I realize that I might be over the top,that what I say might be weird but It's just who I am and I know for a fact that I'm not annoying anyone,I just feel that I can't form deep bonds. Am I really that shallow?. Even the people I thought were my best friends literally ignore me now.

My husband and I have a great life, young, good job, friends, family, everything. Life just decided to throw shit at us the last couple of months...

Husband has been sick for some weeks from work due to random symptoms for months, I've been doing my best to take care of him but I'm getting a little tired of it all tbh. I feel quite guilty about that.
 MRI shows he needs neurosurgery. BAM, finally we know but hard hit,  both scared and trying to make the best if it.

Same day, after months of on and off 'I can barely function pain' the gyno tells me I have endometriosis. I feel like I finally can explain all the weird stuff over the years. 
Reading up tells me I might have trouble making babies, gyno tells me get on the pill or pregnant. I would not think twice about a baby if it wasn't for the surgery of my husband.

12,"If you don’t know what Hmong New Year is, then imagine this big 3-day event where possibly thousands of people show up and just have a good time buying/eating food, playing some carnival games, watching singers and dancers perform, ball tossing/flirting with guys and/or girls, etc. Basically, it’s a fun time, especially if you’re hanging out with friends. 

Anyway, my group of friends and I were just standing by talking and joking around while we waited (for 45 minutes to nearly an hour) for a friend of ours to get 2 boba tea drinks. I told my friend about me possibly just leaving early since it was pretty boring for me at that point. I said “if M (let’s call her that) shows up right now, I’ll stay a bit longer”. 

And with the mother of all coincidences, M literally popped out of nowhere less than 20 feet away from me and my friends. She went away to sit and watch some singer but that left me pretty speechless. I don’t think she saw me but that was a really funny and somewhat weird coincidence (I really want to say that it’s fate, but that’d be weird).

15,"I've had depression before; this isn't it. I've been ""bummed out"" in all sorts of ways, all my life. I know what being sad feels like. None of it compares.

It's like in the past couple days I sunk into this abyss. I made a post on advice, which I promptly deleted, about my violent, rapey sexual fantasies, how much I hated them, and how much I worry that my willpower will give out and I'll act on them. All that anyone said was ""get help,"" which is legitimate, but it's not like there's anything that anyone can do. And regardless, I can't just spill this shit to a therapist who knows my name, face, and location. I don't trust anyone with it, especially not someone who a) barely knows me and b) could get me checked into a mental hospital or jail or whatever.

So I'm stuck here with my awful, disgusting, Jeffrey Dahmer-ish fantasies, my computer, and ramen.

I don't know what to do with myself. I haven't left my apartment in three days, and, honestly, I don't plan on leaving again, ever. I just can't face myself anymore. I know I've lived my whole life up until now without killing myself, but the fact that I've made it so long only makes me feel worse. I should've jumped off a bridge years ago and done my duty to society.

I'm going to stay inside so I can't hurt anyone, and I'm going to wait until I get the courage to kill myself. Anyone who would mourn me doesn't really know me.",25Nov2018,1

18,"He has a tendency to break everything he touches, which basically means headphones don't exactly last for him. He loves playing a certain battle royale game all the time with his friends, but since his headphones don't work, he loves taking mine without my permission. I know that he'll break them, so I don't usually let him have them, but he always comes and takes them anyway. He will then claim I totally let him borrow them and try to make me seem like the asshole.

Well, today I go get my headphones from his room and I find that they're broken. The cushioning has been ripped clean off, and it's open in several areas. Of course I'm angry about this because they're mine and I never actually let him have them, so I take them and hide them somewhere in my room.

I've always tried to be nice to him. I do stuff for him, offer to help when he needs it, even defend him when our parents are being too hard on him. And yet in return all I get is destroyed property and physical aggression (more often than not I have bruises from him punching me or kicking me for extremely minor reasons), and I'm starting to get tired of it.

This is not the first or fifth or tenth time something like this has happened. I’ve had to clean up blood from where she hit her head on the doorstep and needed staples before. 

She stayed on the ground resting for a while and I got bandages for her scrapes and cuts. But then she couldn’t get up. She had to have a chair in front of her with two people helping her in order for her to get up again. It took over five minutes of her trying to get up. I kind of want to cry. She isn’t a perfect person and is reaping the repercussions for treating her body poorly during life, but she is a weak old lady now who is embarrassed about her situation. I just want to cry. She wants to do all of these things but she can’t. She can’t walk. She can’t focus. She can’t talk well or make sense most of the time. It’s a huge ordeal to get up the steps to my house.

23,"i had planned to be out of my hometown by the end of this year, and it's been the same for the past two years. i didn't want to stay here. for some reason i can't stop making bad financial decisions. for some reason i have such a hard time saving my money. it's like if it's not one thing, it's another. the rent in my town is consistently higher than anything i can afford. going by the 1/3 rule, id need to make at least 6$ more per hour to afford a one bedroom apartment here. and, i have bad rental history. but i can't stay with my grandmother because she's transphobic. i can't stay with my mother, who's an alcoholic. i'd end up being her babysitter for my siblings, or i'd end up paying for most of her bills in exchange to live with her. not to mention, she has two cats already. i have two cats i can't give up. they're both ESAs for my girlfriend and i. my girlfriend is disabled and cant work. i dont dislike supporting her, it just gets difficult. this year, we've been staying with my girlfriend's abusive, meth-addict dad, and it's been hell. the good thing is, we havent had to pay rent with him so long as we support ourselves financially. i told myself i'd pay off the ~$2000 debt i owe to various people this year since we werent paying rent. i dont know what i did with my money. a lot of it is definitely for food. her dad gets angry if we use his kitchen, so we didnt cook much. he's kicking us out in a month, i don't know where we'll go. i can't afford it. i work in a kitchen currently, and do uber eats the rest of the time, which actually pays more than my kitchen job. my phone recently broke and the one i'm using is my grandmas old phone she gave me about a year and a half ago. the screen pops out and it runs really slow; uber barely functions on it but it does work. i want to get my phone repaired but it'd be around $179. that would at least make ubering easier. but i need to repair something on my car that i can't do myself, and so far the cheapest i've found is $325. it's approaching winter here, often times the snow gets to be at least a foot and a half deep. my tires are old and desperately need to be replaced, but i can't afford that right now either. the cheapest i've found those for is $400.

money aside, i dont find interest in any of my usual hobbies anymore. all i do when i'm not working is sit on my phone and i hate it. i just sit on my phone and watch youtube, or go on reddit, or play boring games. i don't even want to. but i dont have the motivation to do anything else. i love art and i'm good at it, too. i love to make music, too, but i haven't done any of that lately, either. art used to be my escape, and i could do it whenever i wanted. i've been creatively blocked for what feels like almost 2 years now- i can pinpoint the exact date i stopped drawing as much- march 4, 2017. but these past 6 months especially have been the worst. i've drawn maybe one picture i havent entirely hated. i havent even tried to make music for about a year.

i just said id do all of these things this year. id pay off my debts, id lose that weight, i'd be more creative, i'd pick up that language again, i'd leave this town for the first time in 20 years, id come out so i can stop pretending i'm someone i'm not, id finally go to a psychiatrist and figure out why i'm thinking certain things, id... be better somehow. id make some friends. i dont know. ive had a year to mend. ive had a year to try and make things better. and like so many opportunities before now, i didnt act. and now i dont know what i'm going to do. i dont really have another chance.

26,"I live in New Delhi, born in India but I don't look like an Indian, more like a fillipino. My interest, views and opinions are very liberal western, thanks to reddit. I have no interest in Bollywood or the Indian entertainment industry I just think they're low quality entertainment, there are some good media tho like PK, Special 26, Sacred games etc. But those movies like those are rare. My taste in entertainment is mostly western pop music, old rock, anime, SciFi movies and animation. I am really into anime and animation, icould say I've watched everything worth watching and am constantly searching for new things.

 I'm an atheist in a theistic society, most people here don't even know the difference between an agnostic and an atheist, a typical conversation would go like 
Me- Wow so you're an atheist too
Them - Yes
Me- So you think there is nothing after death and there is no god?
Them - Well I don't know what happens after death but I'm sure there is a higher power out there who cannot be defined by the term god
Me - That would mean you're agnostic since you believe a higher power
Them - I guess I am 
Me - 🤦

I also have no interest in the politics of my country but I know a lot more than I should about the US's bi partisan republic system, and how the republicans manipulates the elections with gerrymandering and oh boy can I go on about Donald Trump. It's hard to explain to my peers how he won the presidency without winning the popular vote but how each state's vote is represented by the number of representatives in the house/senate (I'm still not 100% clear on this because US 'democracy' is really complicated) 
I am by no means a United States' shill I think every country has its pros and cons but US you really done F***** up on this one. 

I also love science, facts and deconstruction of an entertainment medium. Any free time I get I spend it on watching YouTube channels like SciShow, PBS space time, smarter everyday, Ted-ed(not ted X), Vox, half as interesting, exurb1a, kurzgesagt, seeker, wendover productions, Super eye patch wolf, aleczandxr, mother's basement, Caspian report, 2 minute papers and ofcourse PewDiePie and Dolan dark 

The reason I bring these up is to give you a sense of my interests and views. It's becoming hard to connect/find people who shares my beliefs and interest. I cannot connect with my still  close childhood friends, colleagues or people I meet at social events. I am sad to say but I've had bouts of depressive episodes, loneliness. For a long time I've had this attitude of 'let them do them and let me do me'. I have accepted myself for who I am, that I am this way but this makes me feel isolated and lonely. I am a very social person, I can fit into any conversation but it's all just surface level, I cannot go too deep about my interests, because once I go they've already lost me. I have met a lot of people but it's hard to find someone that completely gets me.

I've worked at jobs which have given me various degrees of satisfaction. When I was younger, I had specific career goals and had a fantasy about starting my own business. However, I accomplished those career goals years ago and got involved with some friends in starting a side business. That said business does not pay the bills, but it's also not a money pit by any means.

 I've been really struggling recently. I feel like, for so many years, I pushed myself forward by completing a checklist (finding a spouse, obtaining degrees, receive degrees, etc.). We recently moved cross country and things have been difficult. I'm trying to get a sense of how to meet new people. My new job is pretty terrible and I'm already actively looking. However, I don't have the same drive that I did when I was younger, especially since I've previously accomplished so much. However, this just makes me feel like a lazy fraud and I'm really struggling to find meaning in my life right now. My partner has suggested that I see a therapist for help. I have seen a therapist at various points before, but I've never found it particularly a good use of time.

But whenever I want to go out and ride my bike or something outside and I'm immediately told no and told to go back upstairsand play my games. And then when I try to offer help they're always like, ""No I don't need any help.""




Another thing is that I feel like I'm letting my parents down. I have 2 sisters that play softball have amazing grades. I'm here with pretty decent grades (Asn Bs and a few Cs) but no athletic talent. I tried baseball before back in 3rd grade and hated it. Never really liked sports too much. I've always played video games before and loved em'. They really helped with comforting me when I was lonely. But my parents always hated it. They've always wanted me to get into the Olympics and the CWS or whatever. 



I've been wanting to do something like play bass guitar. And when I tell them, in their reactions, I can hear the disappointment. I'd love to make them proud and have them cheer for me at a gig and feel all badass or whatever. Not even summer school classes will make them proud now. 



I've feel like I've changed too. Personality wise. Ever since I left my previous school because of money and shit, I've noticed that I'm kinda going a little crazy. I've only been talking to one friend but that's through voice chat and rarely one other. I haven't been able to meet up with them whenever we plan something. Because why? Can't drive. 


Nearly every fucking week I end up in a funk. Nothing interesting anymore. Trapped inside my fucking home. The only place I'm allowed to go is my school. Which I'm not too upset about since it gets me away from my room. Honestly I'm thinking about sneaking out late at night and going for a walk. I can't stand being in here anymore.


Sorry if this was a tough read if you read it. I am extremely tired at this point. And thank you.",25Nov2018,1
31,"The title basically explains it. We’ve been dating for 2 1/2 months. We’ve never had sex without a condom. I just wanna get fucking nutted in. I asked him to not use a condom and he said he wasn’t comfortable with that. Okay. That’s fine by me. 

Still doesn’t stop me from fantasizing about his cum dripping down my thighs. 

And no, this isn’t a pregnancy trap or anything. I’m on birth control and way too young for kids.",25Nov2018,1
32,"This is a long one. I apologize for that. I’ve tried to condense it as much as possible, but it’s an involved story. 

I have a very dear friend who I helped get out of an unbelievably horrible situation last year. She literally fled her home without warning one day and went into hiding from her own family. I and my children are the only people in the world who have ever even been to the place she now lives for the past year, after she spent 6 months in a shelter - where only I and my daughter knew where she was. 

Her escape from her psychologically abusive family, who she’d become dependent on after leaving a high-stress job she could no longer sustain, all started last summer when she confided in me one day that she was losing chunks of time and could no longer remember where she’d been or what she’d done on previous days. She asked if I thought she was suffering early onset dementia, and she was truly scared. I was already aware that she’d been raped at the age of 14, and again as an entry level military personnel at the age of 18 while stationed overseas. I said “No sweetie, that’s just your PTSD acting up.” She answered “I have PTSD?!” I genuinely was unaware that she hadn’t been diagnosed. That was the day we started searching for counseling, and a way to get her out of her abusive situation. A few weeks later, she packed a bag, and a co-worker drove her to the local VA and dropped her off. She severed all contact with everyone but me and her two adult children that day. 

I visited her last weekend, and she opened up to me and shared more of her story than she ever had before. We’ll call her M. This is what she told me:

M was one of the first female recruits stationed overseas in her particular branch of the military 40 years ago. There were a small handful of other women in her battalion (I’m not military, so forgive any mistaken terminology), and they were given one section of the otherwise all-male barracks. M shared a room with another young woman, B. Having joined up straight out of high school and even before her 18th birthday, M was thrilled to have a girlfriend and roommate at her first post overseas. She confided in B that at the age of 14 she was staying at a friend’s house, helping to look after her ailing mother and had been given a bed for the night. No one informed her it was her friend’s brother’s bed. The brother came home in the middle of the night drunk, found a sleeping girl in his bed, and forced himself on her. M immediately went home and never told anyone what happened. She didn’t want to bring more trouble on a family whose mother was already dying. But when she got away from home - half a world away from the town where it all happened - and she had a friend who she shared everything with, she told her. She also told B that from that night on she was scared to death of men. 

Soon after posting, B started “entertaining” their fellow soldiers in her and M’a shared room at night, and locking M out. M would come back from dinner or a late shift to find herself locked out of her own room and with nowhere to sleep but in the hallway of the common co-ed barracks. With her history, there was no way she got any sleep at all that way. Her job performance began to suffer, and her CO started noticing. 

She complained to her commander, repeatedly, but he refused to do anything. He just told her to toughen up and said “I told them you girls didn’t have any business in my unit. You just need to behave and stop making trouble.” So M went over his head and complained to *his* commander, who eventually had B moved to a different room and disciplined. 

2 weeks after B was moved out of M’s room, M woke up one night in the pitch black darkness. There was a pillowcase over her head, and her hands were tied to her bed with washrags. One of her fellow servicemen was on top of her, and as he raped her he repeated “this is what happens to girls who don’t behave.” When he stopped, 2 more servicemen took turns, then they left. The next morning, M realized that her door was still locked - she locked it every night and checked it multiple times before going to sleep because of her past trauma. The only way the men could have gotten into her room was with a key. 

She cleaned herself up and went straight to her post, where her CO was waiting for her to give her a good chewing out for being 10 minutes late. He’d been waiting to see her reaction. She told him what had happened the night before, and while nearly dancing on his toes he *smiled broadly* and said “So you’re ready to quit, huh? I guess the rest won’t be far behind you!” She said “No, sir, I’m staying.” He then suggested she go to the hospital “to cry about it.” But she told him she was ready to go to work. He then told her she had *better behave herself* from then on. 

Later that afternoon the CO’s CO sent word that M was being ordered to the hospital, where her records show that she refused to state a reason why she was there, and was sent back to duty. 



I’m so shocked and angry that this was clearly orchestrated and condoned by her CO. I want to do something. I want someone held accountable. I want her story to be told. I don’t know what to do. I’m just so angry! This story should be told!!

I need some feedback here. What do I do? These sleazeballs are still walking around out there. It seems a certainty they did this to more women. I’m aware that this story can only be told with my friend’s consent, but if she does consent, how do we get people to listen, care, and act? What’s the next step? I feel like I can’t go to her and say “let’s tell this story” until I know how, and to whom, and with what purpose. ",25Nov2018,1
34,"I became friends with a guy right when I met the guy who would become my boyfriend. This friend liked me, but I let him know right off the bat that it wasn't going to happen. He took a while to seem to accept this, so my boyfriend was not comfortable with me hanging out with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I backed away, but made sure the keep texting him because he was going through a hard time in his life. He had been expressing some suicidal thoughts, and I just wanted to be in his corner so he knew he had people who cared for him. During this time there was never any flirting, if he got inappropriate I let him know, and my boyfriend knew him and I were talking. 

&amp;#x200B;

He was there for me a lot, and I tried very hard to be there for him without crossing the line with my boyfriend. This did at times caused conflicts. We would fight about it. I was really upset, confused, and didn't know what to do. I wanted to respect my boyfriend, but at the same time I had a friend who needed me to be there. My boyfriend and I established rules that would make him comfortable for me to talk to this guy, but this seemed to hurt the friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight we got into a huge fight, and I think our friendship is over. We got into a big fight over text because he mentioned liking me again. I got frustrated because I had told him so many times that it wasn't going to happen. I finally had to be blunt and probably hurt his feelings in telling him that it was never going to happen. He told me that he didn't understand that after all the times he was there for me, I could still choose my boyfriend over him. I told him I wasn't choosing my boyfriend over him, I was trying to do the right thing while also still keeping him in my life as a friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

He asked me to come over tonight to talk. It would have just been us alone, so I was honest and said my boyfriend wouldn't be comfortable with that. He got mad again and said that I'm an adult who shouldn't have to ask my boyfriend for permission, which is true, but I'm also trying to respect what makes him feel uncomfortable. After this he told me that I had made my choice, and hoped I realized what I had lost. I am really upset over this. We were friends for a while, we were both there through difficult times, but me being with someone ultimately broke our relationship. Im hurt, sad, and mad. ",25Nov2018,1
35,"...Getting over them, anyways. 

 I've (mostly) made my peace with it, and I've come to terms that we would be an awful couple, that it's not a good idea, and that he doesn't like me like _that_,  all for a multitude of reasons that we won't get too fussed over right now. This is fine. 

  Operation get over them by getting under someone else was a bust. That's okay too, we'll try again some other time. 

  The wild, frenzied obsession has died down, due in no small part to an almost painful amount of effort. It was bad, but I like to think that we've weathered that storm, and while it may not be completely over, at least the worst of it has passed.  

 Most days my feelings range from friendly to sibling like in nature.  

  He's got a girl that he's been talking to. This is good because it puts the nail in my hope's coffin. It was bad for a bit, but at this point when he mentions her I feel no rage, jealousy, or ill will. When he mentions her I feel nothing. We'll take apathy because it's better than antipathy, but a good friend with no romantic delusions would feel happy wouldn't they? It's a work in progress. 

  Definitely a work in progress. I know that they're close, that they hang out a lot, but I was previously (blissfully) ignorant of anything beyond that. 

  This is all ""previously"", because today he told me (the conversation had somehow veered down that path) about all the things that he's been getting up to with her. He confirmed everything I'd had vague ideas about, and honestly that leaves me feeling pretty raw. It didn't ache so much as it stung. A part of me thinks ""Good for you"",  another part thinks ""Christ, I did not need to know that"". 

  And I guess it's good for him, but holy shit was that not good for my heart. I thought I was past this point, but apparently I was wrong. This is a learning experience, but damn if it doesn't sting. Sometimes, friends share details about their sex lives. Good friends with strictly platonic feelings, are sometimes alright with this. 

  
  Today I was reminded that I'm not as safe, that I'm not entirely the good friend with only platonic feelings that I thought I was.  I have no idea why this bothers me as much as it does, and I wish it would stop. I wish I could just stop having these feelings and go back to being happy for just having a good friend. 

  And there's a lot going on here, and I'm not unpacking all of that that right now(maybe later though?). Maybe someday I'll try to parse out all the details of our relationship, pinpoint where I went wrong, how things are wrong, what's going to inevitably go wrong, but it's also late and I'm tired and a little sad.

i have trouble opening up and letting people into my life and i feel like it’s gonna push us away from each other. i’ve never actually had a close friend for more than like? 2 years bc of this, we always end up drifting apart. i also have a few people i am not on speaking terms with, including my ex and former best friend. we got too close and ended up really hurting each other 

i feel like perhaps i am not ready for a relationship? stuff is going well but my brain is still like “DANGER” all the time and it stresses me out :( he was also a very close friend before we started dating and i am so afraid so lose someone i actually became close to? part of me wants to break up now before stuff gets more intense so we can still be friends. but at the same time thinking about doing that makes me feel horrible.

44,"My life changed for the better a couple of years ago.  It wasn't instantaneously, but a process as are most things in life.  I had just moved back into my parents house, was working an entry level job, and decided to go back to school to complete my degree.  

My last semester before graduation I earned an internship with an organization.  It was a great learning experience.  Unfortunately at that point my ability to follow directions, research, and problem solve were not at the level they needed to be.  I was usually one of the last ones done with a task in training and needed help sometimes.  

After earning my degree I worked a couple more entry level positions before being offered a career track position a couple of months ago.  It was close to a year and half between earning my degree and finding a good position.  Anything worth it takes time and effort.

Anyone reading this that may want to improve their education I encourage to do so.  College is the most well known way to improve one's education, but there are also many free and low-cost ways to learn as well.  I use the Lumosity and Duolingo applications myself.  Lumosity is an application that helps a person improve their speed, attention, memory, and other skills by playing games.  Duolingo is an application that teaches one a foreign language.  There are also many other free or low-cost applications that help one improve their current skills or learn new skills.

Believe me, how I wish I could be like introverts or 'asocials' and just sit and watch a TV show or something and not stress out about not having people to talk to.

Introverts have an escape. And it's tough for people like me who say moves somewhere else, or now living in situations where interacting with people  become less.

And please look at it from our perspective too my dear introverts, we might be too much sometimes and I get it. But we also face the same problems just in the opposite way. &lt;3",25Nov2018,1

49,"Long post. Buckle up, grab the tissues. I’m on mobile so I’m sorry if there’s errors.

Well where do I start.
2018 has been a shit show for me.

Let me start from the beginning.

January 2018, we get an offer to rent a little place out of town on some acerage. Perfect and everything I have ever wanted. I get to move away from this shit hole small town and I get to have my horses(who are usually paddocked across town) right at my my door step. And it’s not far from the town I work in. 

I am a 24 year old Aussie Girl, my partner is 27. 
He isn’t a fan of leaving the town because he doesn’t have a car and it meant he had to travel back for work. I worked in the new town which was 7km from the new place.
We saved our butts off and brought a small tidy car for him to use to travel to work.

We move in. It’s the most fantastic place. 3-4 bedroom, new bathroom, on a lovely landscape with a lovely established garden. We didn’t deserve something this nice and we were beside ourselves with happiness.

Now, living in rural Australia, our animals are very important in our lives(in any lives really). So when we moved, we had 2 dogs. Flea was my mastiff I’ve had for a long time, Sarge was our Great Dane who we got when my partner and I first got together. Fluffy, our cat. And my 3 horses. Slider, my absolute world and my main competition horse. Haze, she was young but my future competition horse and Indy, my Broodmare who was in foal. These horses are my life. I’ve had horses before I could walk.

Anyway. Firstly, my partner was getting used to travelling back and fourth. One morning he Hits a kangaroo and completely totals the car we just bought. This was the end of February. We couldn’t afford another so I would drop him at his parents Sunday afternoon and pick him up fridays. So we spent the entire week apart. 30km from each other...

Then, I come home from a comp one day with Slider to notice that Haze was sick and stumbling everywhere. I suspected snake bite, long story short, vet arrived, and diagnosed colic...shit what did she get into... partner rushed home in his mums car and scoured the place... haze had found some wheat in a big drum and had  ate about half of it. It was then I realised there was nothing we could do. We stayed up with her for hours. Vet left, she prolapsed, I couldn’t keep her comfortable it was horrible. I loved this little horse so much. She had such a bright future ahead of her. 
She finished her iV fluids and I took her back to her yards. I went to the house to shower and have a coffee to come back out and find her gone. She basically ruptured her insides. I was beside myself. My poor girl. I was so sorry. If I had knew it was colic I would have put her straight down, because there was no way she would have made it. My poor poor girl. 

I cried all night, 
The next day we called our landlords(who were also our neighbors, they are honestly the most lovely people) to ask if they could take her away with their tractor. They came and buried her up on the hill where she still watches out for us now. The landlords didn’t know about the wheat as it was their grandfathers place. The wheat was about 8 years old. It was a drought at this stage so she was only eating it because there was no grass. Rest easy My girl.

Fast forward to July. Slider and I are getting ready for a rodeo, he and i had been doing amazing all year. Bringing home prize money and he really tried his heart out for me. I’ve owned this horse since he was a foal and we have an amazing bond. 
Day after our rodeo, he has a sore leg. I just put it down to muscle soreness as we had a huge weekend competing.
Weeks later I realised it was much more than that and took him to the vets. Turns out he has a bone spur growing in his knee joint and has also fractured part of his bone in his hoof. Our year. Down the drain. We were currently leading in points at our club events and had just qualified for the Aussie finals. It was all over for us.
I was gutted. All our hard work and travelling and the miles we put in. 
He was to be confined while his joints and bones heal up. I was thankful he was still okay. I love this horse more than anything in my life and I wouldn’t care if I could never ride him again. As long as he is healthy and well, I am happy.

Also, in July. Our dogs had had puppies. 7 gorgeous puppies. This litter was very special, because we have had both our dogs for a very long time and we wanted to keep a son or daughter. 
Fast forward a few weeks. We decided on 3 puppies that were to stay. They were perfect. Energetic, everything their parents were. Our Dane and our mastiff. Loyal dogs.
One by one. I’d come out to find them unwell. Laying there. Cold. Spewing up. Paralysed unable to move and barely breathing.... what happened!!! I was just outside playing with them not even a hour ago! 
This happened in a span of about 2 weeks. We lost all 3. To the same thing. All were vaccinated and all were really healthy pups. We searched and searched for what could have killed them but could not find anything. The landlords had tidied up any chemicals and drums laying around after what happened to Haze.... to this day we don’t know what happened to those pups. We suspect it may have been some kind of bug or perhaps a frog? They were in the same kennel since birth with no ill effects... it only happened when they got older... 

October. My mare Indy is finally nearing her due date and I am very excited! 
I had been using my sisters horse float for about 2 years. I maintained it, paid its registration and looked after it. Now. I don’t have any family to begin with. My mum and dad aren’t in the picture and one of my sisters passed away leaving my only remaining one. However, she has many issues. Probably undiagnosed depression and bipolar. A very manipulative and spiteful person. 
We had a disagreement about something quite minor that she decided to take severe offence to and as a result came to my house while I was at work and took her horse float back. Now. I know it is hers and she can do what she pleases with it, and it’s not that that bothers me. It’s the fact that she KNEW I needed it. With my horse about to have a baby and another one with a fractured leg that requires follow up xrays, I can now not even take them to the vets. 
She doesn’t need it, she doesn’t own big horses. I had only paid one $600 for a new wiring kit for it a few weeks prior...I said how am I going to get my horses to the vets if I need to... her response was “having horses isn’t meant to be easy”. 
I have now completely cut contact with her and I am still entirely mad about that situation. 
I cannot compete, I cannot get my horses to the vets. I had a colleagues horse staying over while she was in hospital, I couldn’t even take her horse back to her. 

October. I get a call while I’m at work from my landlord. “We were over at the shed and there are some bees attacking your dogs”. I go home thinking it was a few bees. Hell no.
I got out of my car and immediately my arms are covered with bees. 
I try to run over to our dog cage and let our Great Dane out(the mastiff managed to get out but our Dane couldnt because he was too big). The bees were all over me. Biting me and in my hair. I opened the cage and retreated back to the house. About 50 meters away to get better protection. The sky was just humming with bees. 
I put come better clothes on and a shirt over my face and go back out to get sarge. He had wedged himself between his kennel and the yard fence.
I ran over near him and called out to him. He wasn’t responding. I called and called. Bees were all over my. And started going down my shirt and in my hair again. I retreated to the house and called my partner “sarge isn’t responding and I can’t get to him”.
My partner races home which took about 20 mins. By the time he got home the afternoon had set in, and the bees had calmed a little.

My partner went straight into the cage and pulled him out. He was gone. Killed by bees. Our big healthy, fit Great Dane who weighed more than me, killed by f*cking bees. He was our dog but my partners main hunting dog. He had caught many great pigs and was the best family dog.  A big soon who never did anything wrong. Laying there. Face and eyes swollen. Bee stings in his eyes and mouth. My poor poor boy. I am so sorry I couldn’t get to him sooner. My partner didn’t say much but I knew he was absolutely gutted. He took him away and buried him up on the hill, next to his puppies and my dear Haze. There were so many questions. Why were the bees swarming? We don’t know why. Why did he have to go like that. He didn’t deserve to die that way. Alone, trapped and scared. 

November.
My horse Indy’ foal is now ready to come on any day. This pregnancy meant the world to me. I had always dreamed of having a horse stud and this foal was going to be the stepping stone for that. My first breeding from start to finish. I chose the stallion and I went through the long process of getting her pregnant. She lost the first pregnancy in early stages so we had to try again. And now this foal was finally about to arrive! 
I bought an expensive alarm that goes on her so I would know when she is in labor and she has multiple checks every day to monitor her progress. Finally after 11 months counting down the days, I was so ready to meet our little one.

10:30pm on November 5th. The alarm went off and I knew it was go time. I went out to her and she had most of the hard work done. She had passed the shoulders and all I had to do was remove the placenta from his face and make sure his airways were clear. It was a little brown boy. I’ll admit he wasn’t my preferred sex or colour but he was still perfect and would be a special horse.
After a few hours, I helped him find his legs and the milk bar and it was right as rain. He was doing everything a newborn foal should do which was fantastic.

He was so cute. Loved butt scratches and was so playful. I moved him and his mother out into a bigger paddock after a few days so they could stretch their legs. All was going perfect. Until.

Saturday morning, about 6:30am. I got up early to unload feed from my Ute. I hear a horse calling out. I knew straight away it was a distress call. I look over to their paddock, Indy was running around like mad calling out. Shit. 
I go over to her and she is a sweaty mess. No foal.
Being a big paddock, I started searching straight away.
She runs off over the far side of the paddock, stops and puts her head down. I knew.

I walked over to her and there lay the lifeless body of her little one. Cold and lifeless. I kneeled down beside him and cried and cried and cried. Everything I have dreamed of and planned. Gone. I could see bite marks on his neck where his mother had been trying to get him up. It broke me. She stood there grieving. Head down wondering why he wasn’t getting up. It was one of the hardest things to see. My poor girl, the road we have come and the healthy baby that was perfectly fine not even 12 hours prior was gone.

I checked his body over and could not see any obvious cause of death. He was healthy and a big foal. His nose was covered in milk so he had been drinking well. I still have no idea what happened to him. 

The thing with this kind of death, you cannot remove the deceased foal until it’s mother decides it’s time to walk away from it.
She stood out there in the sun all weekend next to him. Head down, nudging him. It broke me. It really did. By Tuesday she had finally walked away, so I took him up to the hill and buried him beside Haze. 


Along with this heartbreak, my workplace had a full restructure due to the severed drowns Australia is currently in and I was at risk of losing my job. It was an extremely stressful time, especially with my anxiety. I had worked really hard this year hoping to move up and finally progress after being there for 4 years. 
Lots of good workers lost their jobs including one of my best friends. Then our work decides to completely change the business and bring in an entire new database. Send only 2 staff left for training and then promote one of them a few weeks later...she had been there 6 months and was never consistent or turned up to work on time.. it shattered me. I worked so hard, they assured me I would be rewarded and nothing. Here I am weeks later, still haven’t had adequate training on the new database and basically went from one of the most knowledgeable people in the business to nothing and somebody else has completely taken over...

We still haven’t been able to afford another car for my partner as he has a bad credit rating from a mistake made when he was younger. His work had sent him away and he has to cover all his meal costs which have been huge as it’s expensive in small country towns. We can’t afford to outlay money on another horse float for my horses and a fe days ago we scraped $40 together for food for the week.

I currently owe our vets about $2000, am behind in car repayments and have about $70 left over from my pay each week after other bills come out. My partner is the same. He had a court fee from something a while ago and he didn’t realise as he forgot to change the address when we moved... they added interest on top of this and then took the funds through his work. $800 in wages in a row taken out... 

I was just so stressed today. I’m not sure why I’m writing this. I guess I just wanted to get it all off my chest. I feel a little better now I guess. I just hope that next year will be better and our bad luck has ended for a while. My heart has been broken so many times this year and I can’t take much more.
I am a strong person however and will push forward.

I have anxiety. Really bad, debilitating, diagnosed anxiety (Panic disorder, and Generalized social anxiety) which I am prescribed meds for that I take on a regular basis.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I hate the meds. I'm a software developer, and I can't really afford the brain fog that comes from taking xanax all of the time ya know? I'm 23 years old, yet the only developer in charge of systems responsible for the flow of millions of dollars on a daily basis.

&amp;#x200B;

 ***I've been doing a lot of research, and I believe my anxiety is coming from a self-centered attitude that is fueled by stress.*** 

&amp;#x200B;

When I'm stressed I get anxious about the stupidest, smallest things.  I always feel people are talking about me, which they probably aren't. I've began to challenge my thoughts when I have anxiety attacks, and it's working slowly but surely. Which is why I'm looking to Reddit (along with  a therapist) to learn from others, and see if they can help me conquer my own irrational thoughts.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've been making progress in how I handle stress, ***but I can't seem to shake the self-centered attitude that everyone is talking about me***. I always work up these crazy convoluted scenarios about people working against me. I know it's stupid, but I constantly have to remind myself that ""No, Jerry isn't plotting against you"", and ""No, Susan doesn't want to get you fired to take your job"".

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I can't be the only one thinking these things. I'd like to know how others differentiate valid, logical conclusions, with delusional ones coming from anxiety. Are there any signs that indicate a thought is irrational? Additionally, how do I become less self-centered to avoid these thoughts in the first place?

57,"One of the most wholesome dreams I've had in a while. Such a nice change from dreams of machinery room floodings, electrical outages, fire, destruction and panic. 

This was one of the nicest refreshing long dreams I've had. My dreams have been so incredibly realistic lately, and it's cool because although I'm not lucid and don't know I'm dreaming I can still control myself, if that makes any sense. 

I can replay it back in my mind with zero effort, as if it's something that happened just all of last week. 

The sad part is, I've not been liking life much at all recently. I'm broke, my family isn't doing well, and my life at work on the boat is a constant busy nightmare of being behind in quals. Don't get me wrong, I love my life normally, it's just been hitting me hard this weekend with everything going on. 

I almost feel guilty for thinking that I'd rather much be in a comma for a while, so I can ""live"" that dream I was having endlessly. Then at least there'd be several good things about waking up every day, rather than constant dread. My PC is gone, laptop crushed from a move, Xbox One S is gone, all because of bills. I have a single game on my phone I play for at least some escapism but even then it's not. I don't even have the money to go out and socialize and just have a beer out with people until I get paid Wednesday. Even then I don't know many of the people here. I'm almost tired of sleeping all the time and just watching movies and sketching to entertain myself or pretend things are all good. 

I hate these 4 day weekends, at least on the boat I can bury myself with work and pretend everything is okay with my shipmates. 

Sucks man, at least the dream I had was good and showed me what kind of good life I will be able to have after the Navy. Possibly. I hope. ",25Nov2018,1

Everything is spinning, moving 100mph, all you remember is screaming in your parked car while rain is pouring.

You almost got kicked out of school because you couldn't take the pressure of why did your love had to leave? The school however, saw your grades and gave that speech of, you have to get your grades up or take a medical absence for your loss. 
Medical absence? That was not happening. 
Your mindset changed when next semester took place. You had to pick yourself and keep going. You had help along the way from family, friends, professors, advisors. 
You knew life overall is amazing, but you pave your way to make it amazing. It's not easy, theres gonna be hills, but every time you reach that peak, you just get better reaching at it to get to that flat pavement.

59,"(f 19) This has been an issue that has bothered me since high school and I thought people would be more mature in college. I am black and  was adopted and raised by white parents, my whole life race and being judged because of it was shielded from me by my parents. This was somewhat unintentional because they never would have even thought of some of the struggles their child would have faced if I were white. For high school I went to a boarding school and found that even making friends was more tricky because there were stereotypes set in stone that made us less desirable even as friends to the opposite race, especially opposite gender. As much as people argue that this isn’t true the amount of times I have heard “I just don’t like black girls, they’re loud etc” is just so infuriating. This has personally stunted the development of my confidence and has forced me back into groups that I want to break away from. I do not want to be defined by my race. That should not have to determine wether or not people engage with me. xx (also i mean engaging as in a normal relationship platonic or not, as opposed to some person fetishizing my race)

I posted this to just try to understand why people are so against trying new things. I’d genuinely appreciate feedback or just anything regarding this issue because it really fucks with people and how they see themselves.

There's often almost no dialogue and no video after the guy orgasms. Even when there's dialogue, it's usually some kind of negotiated thing like a payment instead of something more intimate. While doujinshi is also pretty unrealistic, there is usually some story or context to build up to the sex scene. Also, doujins are often made complementary to well-written stories that the reader may already be familiar with. If not, then no problem. There's still some kind of story building. On top of that, there's just some dialogue that's okay when read but cringey to hear in real life. Not to mention doujinshi you can include stuff that would otherwise be expensive or that people aren't willing to do, like fantasies involving monster girls, or some continuation of an already existing manga/anime like having L and Light Yagami making love instead of war. Not gay, but that can be a pretty fun read.

84,"I’m 20 now, and since the age of maybe 15 I think I’ve been pretty depressed. It comes in waves, and it’s never been so severe as to make me have suicidal thoughts, but I’ve certainly had many days where I wonder what the fuck the point is in living, can’t even muster up the energy to watch something on Netflix, and just have that hollow, empty feeling without a discernible reason behind it.

It probably peaked about 2 years ago for me in my second semester of college. I struggled with feeling bad about myself through school, but it got a lot worse here. If I’ve ever had a stage in my life where I’m sure I was depressed, this was it. I had made no friends there (still haven’t really), I was going out and drinking/taking drugs every weekend with the friends I do have (again, I still do this, but the drug taking thing is like once every few months at most) and on maybe half of days I couldn’t bring myself to go to class. There was a class I had that semester where I went to the first lecture and couldn’t bring myself to go to a single other class. To add to that I was working a part time job I fucking hated, and in my spare time I just felt like a failure. On weekends I couldn’t force myself out my bed before like 2 in the afternoon. It was horrific.

I don’t really know when it happened, but gradually I kinda came out that. I never got help, just one day I realised that for the past couple of months I hadn’t been as fucked up, aimless and exhausted with everything as before. By college starting again I made an effort to get my act together. I started off small, reading everyday, trying to study more, etc. My grades were still fucked from that semester I essentially missed, and I almost got kicked out, but I managed to just get the grades to ensure I could stay in. I worked up the courage to quit my shitty job to focus on myself, and the last year and a half or so I’ve been noticeably better; I’ve started writing in my spare time which always interested me but I couldn’t bring myself to do, started exercising, reading, my college grades are a whole lot better, and overall I just want to look after myself more. Sure I had some bad days, but it was never anything like the cycle of constantly feeling like a complete waste of space I had been in before.

But the last few weeks I have felt myself slipping a bit. There’s days I distance myself from my friends cause I just don’t want to speak to anyone. I feel tired, and despite this I’ve been staying up too late and fucking my sleeping pattern up. I’ve stopped the gym (this is more due to college demands, but I think I could squeeze it in if I had the motivation), can feel myself getting overly annoyed at small inconveniences, etc. The other day going to college I felt the worst I’d felt in months, and was convinced I needed help because I had no idea why I felt so fucking completely shitty. Even though I got out that funk a bit as the day progressed, I still knew I wasn’t quite myself, and since then have been wondering if I really should get some help.

I feel like this whole time what I’ve maybe been doing is using exercise, hobbies, looking after myself and trying harder as a bandage over the fact that I have deeper issues I need to face. It’s like I stopped the bleeding for a while, but the wound is just gonna re-open at some point. So, even though I don’t necessarily feel ‘depressed’, maybe only very mildly, and definitely feel better than I have in the past, I think it’s maybe still worth it for me to go see if I can get some help. Am I right though? Like my plan is to go see a college counsellor and see what they recommend, but is this even a mental health thing in general? I feel like depression isn’t something you just ‘snap out of’, yet for the past year or so it really seemed like I had. The past few weeks have been a little worse, sure, but everyone has ups and downs, right? Is it worth it for me to get help, or would I just be wasting people’s time?

89,"Looking back, I’ve always been pretty lazy about my appearance + I’m fairly awkward. It’s hard for me to make friends. However, I’ve been fairly lucky in the relationship department.

I haven’t been with someone who’s outright disrespected me or cheated on me (that I know of). The guys I’ve been with have made real efforts to be good bfs.

Even when I’ve hooked up and was just regularly dating, a lot of the guys were up for relationships with me and were some stand up gents.

It’s nice.

91,"Apart from the commonly known erogenous zones such as breasts, vagina and butt, there are other areas on woman`s body which can truly turn her on and make her crazy for you.

 

Hair- a gentle run through her hair can be a powerful aphrodisiac for your partner. Also, you can gently massage from her temples to the nape of her neck will definitely turn her on.

Pelvis- being located near the vagina, pelvis is an extremely erogenous part of her body. However, you need to resist the need to immediately slip down her vagina. Also, you can tease her inner thighs and lick the area around her pelvis. This will give your woman the maximum pleasure.

Feet- take some massage oil or lotion. Gently and slowly massage her toes, ankles, and the sides of her feet. Many women extremely enjoy having their toes sucked, but there are also women who find that repugnant. So, before putting them in your mouth, make sure your woman wants that.

Ear lobes- kissing, touching and even lightly biting her earlobes will definitely tap into her desire. This part of the body is quite sensitive and most women truly enjoy having the lips of her man on them.

You can also lick the rest of her ear also, just make sure not to put your tongue inside her ear.

Palms- holding hands is a sign of love and affection. Simply trace your finger along her palm and she will feel delightful shivers.

The back of her knee- it may sound surprising, but this is also a powerful erogenous zone on woman`s body. Gently caressing the back of your knee under her skirt while you are out with your friends will turn her on and make her eager to come home.

I'm probably looking for attention with this post, so don't give me any. I know what I need to do to get my life in order, I just don't take the necessary steps to fix myself.",25Nov2018,1
