We were making [Alka-Seltzer rockets](https://www.imaginationstationtoledo.org/educator/activities/rockets) and the one we made was kind of heavy with paper, I was nervous it wouldn’t launch. We dropped the Alka-Seltzer in and capped it. A small pop, no launch. I said to him “ahh, I’m sorry buddy it didn’t work.” He didn’t even miss a beat, he looked at me and smiled and said “that’s ok, things don’t always go the way we want them to.”

I joined a girl’s livestream today (one of my really sweet followers, I follow her too!) and she COMPLETELY flipped out and started screaming, saying that she admires me so much and how inspirational I was. It was a full five minutes of freaking out and I was just FLOORED by how much she seemed to look up to me, she called me a role model and said that I helped her create her account. As someone who has struggled with low self esteem, social anxiety, and been bullied in school, this was everything. It’s just amazing. It made my day. I’m so amazed that someone could care about my existence so much, that I could possibly inspire someone.
I’m so happy. This is why I run my account, because I hope to make someone think about something or to be inspired to take action. It’s just everything to see that you’ve sparked a change in even one person!!!",12Jun2018,2

9,"I have no idea what this feeling is, it's more a weird realization I've come to and have been going through for a few months. The realization is that every single second is just a memory, remember how three seconds ago you on the main page for this subreddit. Or earlier today when you woke up. Well now you're here and not there anymore, it's all just faded away into a memory. Think about yesterday, all of those events happened and there's no possible way to live through that again. Hell just earlier I was watching Sony's E3 presentation with Etika but now I'm here writing this stupid thought because I have no idea where and what to do with it. Everything we see, hear, and eat it's all just a memory no matter how recent nor far. All we can do is look back. I understand we need to accept it and reality itself. But it's awful when you think too hard about it and this is probably something I'm ironically going to be looking back at in the future. Time is such a weird concept but hey...

14,"He has autism. He laughs pretty often, but mostly at tv shows and movies he watches, and that screen reader he somehow knows how to turn on on Roku. Today I made him laugh for the second time ever in the 2 years I’ve worked with him.

He was reading his book in his fake high-pitched voice, and I told him “read in your normal voice” like I always have to remind him. He said “but it’s not fair” and I said “what if I talked in a low voice like this” and started reading his book in a low voice. And then he started laughing, and looked straight in my eyes (he nearly never makes eye contact unless prompted). I almost cried. It was the sweetest moment I’ve ever had at work.

15,"I'm using a throwaway, for obvious reasons.

Maybe I'm venting to the wrong place, I'm not really sure. I'm pretty down about it. This is a long read, I didn't mean to get so long-winded.

TL/DR at the beginning, for your convenience: I have to choose between an ""ok enough"" but ""safe"" future for myself and my kids to stay with a man I truly love... Or continue to pursue self growth, education, career advancement, and potentially so much more for myself and kids' future (at a higher risk) without him by my side. Feedback and various points of view welcome, or tell me if a better subreddit exists for this.

So I'm 35, mother of 3 girls, ages 16, 11, &amp; 8. Oldest is a trouble child (expelled, talking about trying to start a family, etc), middle is fine (for now, though she's about to reach teen years), youngest is high functioning autistic (Asperger's, but they have now lumped that in with the autism spectrum), with a brilliant mind and huge heart. We live in a rural ""city,"" one with an ever growing population (around 80,000 last census) but clinging on to the old ways, small-town mentality is what I call it. 

When I was younger, I messed up. A lot. No felonies or arrest record or any kind of diseases, but I had my head in the wrong place, dropped out of high school, and started having kids at 18. Not the most admirable, but I don't regret my girls. However now, after years of moving, I started settling down about 7 years ago. Got divorced from my toxic ex husband (he didn't want to keep the house so I got it and actually paid off the mortgage 2 years ago), got my GED, got promoted in my retail job, got a decent car, etc... And eventually got with my current guy in spring 2014. He and his circle of friends were inspirational for me to continue my upward momentum and get a college degree, start a career, and stop working these dead-end jobs. So with his support, along with student loans and grants, I quit my job and went to school full-time. That was 2016 when I started, I got my Associate's in Business Administration in December and am now working on my Bachelor's in Accounting. 

When my bf and I first started dating, we had kind of touched on the topic of eventually moving to another state/city, and he said it's not outside the scope of reality. I realize he has a career he has had for years now, but it's in IT and honestly he can do better elsewhere. We have talked about my desire to move, and our backgrounds are clashing. Having moved several times, I know how to adapt and sieze opportunities. He's lived on the same piece of property since he was 1 (he's 36), and now says he doesn't plan to ever leave here, even if it means I leave.

I have never felt this city would be my end point. I'm feeling the pull now stronger than ever, like I should pick a city, research it, sell my vacant house to the neighbor who has been offering cash for it for 2 years, and just go for it. This small-town city is getting to me... I've had numerous ""thanks for applying but we chose someone else"" emails from places where I've applied to get experience to complement my degree and work toward a career (work + online and night classes). Meanwhile, a girl I know, 27, never worked a day in her life, been married &amp; a SAHM that whole time straight out of high school... Got a basic entry level job in my field at a locally owned company, because she knows the owner.

I'm aware this happens sometimes, but I know it's less likely in a much larger city. Also, this rural city has fewer options for my youngest with her ASD therapy and development. There's a place that's ""ok enough"" but I want her to flourish. That is less likely to happen here.

So, I could stay ""safe"" in my less than desirable location, with mediocre opportunities, and settle in the routine of some boring bank teller or even sales manager job, grow old and hope for the best with my kids, and retire too old to enjoy it, but all with this man I've grown to adore so much...

Or I leave him. I take that big leap. I seek the better career path, take a risk, sell my house as a nest egg to live on  for several months, move somewhere I'm not familiar with, transfer my credits to continue my degree path, and reach for the stars... I know my potential, my goal is to get into external auditing, or perhaps even forensic accounting. I know it's a long road ahead. But I want to leave more for my children than some debt and a funeral bill, and I can't do that at my age without seeking more opportunities. 

I know I run the risk of falling on my ass, I do have family who will back me if I do... though I don't see it getting to that point. I'm resilient. I just can't shake the feeling that if I stay with this man, despite my love and adoration for him...my dreams will be stifled and this one life I have will be a huge what-if.

Any feedback/discussion welcome. I'm ultimately going to choose what I find to be best for my children, and I have a lot of thinking and research to do either way. And please advise if you feel like there's another subreddit to submit this to, maybe one more suited for this type of discussion. I felt this would be a good start.

Thank you for reading.",12Jun2018,1

20,"About a year and a couple months ago, a girl I thought I loved and I broke up. I was really torn up about it for a couple of months and then I stopped being as torn up about it, I could feel myself getting better and wanting to get out there and meet someone who I know for a fact I truly love. I like to believe true love exists, but I think of it more as an unwillingness to give up on eachother and too understand what eachother are going through on a personal level and help eachother through the bad times and give eachother the best memories possible because at the end of it all, all we can ever give someone is memories.  Sorry about going off on the little Rom Com style love spill, I just want to feel that type of love and it’s hard to believe I’m ever going too, it just seems so foreign, not that I’m a bad looking dude (not trying to humble brag) but I could stand to gain a couple of pounds and bulk up, and I want too, I just can never find the motivation to go to the gym, I always say “tomorrow “ and it never goes past that.

It’s extremely entertaining to watch when it’s not you, but he likes to show tactics on me because apparently I’m really easy to read and even easier to manipulate. He’s already promised that he wouldn’t do it to genuinely put me in a bad spot, but every time he does a trick on me it feel super uncomfortable.

23,"I recently moved to a new location and I’ve begun to realize that even in situations where I try to put myself out there, I always end up either by myself or checking out of a group conversation.

To make a long story short, I have been working in a gas station part time and searching for jobs advertised on the internet for over a year now and it seems that the jobs in my commutable distance area are all either care jobs or other absolutely minimum wage positions \- big retail chains, minimum\-wage care jobs, secretary (again minimum wage office work), and warehouse work.

I am starting to absolutely despise this gas station job because of how completely mind\-numbing it is for me, the people there at least appear nice but it is incredibly dulling.

28,"I’ve always been an anxious person but after living the first 17 years of my life with it I thought that I was well adjusted; which I’ve discovered I’m not in the slightest. I think it all stems from separation anxiety between my mother and father bickering and arguing and saying things about each other to me that left me not trusting either. I’d stopped seeing my father about 7 years ago but whenever I see him outside I can’t help but cry and what could’ve been.

Since then my time in high school had left me through many emotional lows and highs like becoming the class clown or everyone in my school seeing my dick (got cegged in the worst of ways and yes I’m aware of it’s funniness) and as you can expect things like that don’t exactly help anxious people. More recently I’ve come out of my shell socially since I left high school for college and have many friends. I thought I was rid of all the anxious thoughts until I got my first job which filled up 6 days of the week and on the 7th I’d go out leaving me with no real free time.

It got much worse around then. I remember having my first panic attack on a bus and trying to keep composed whilst I was trapped in my own skin. I’ve had other things like a constant stream of existential crises making me wonder what my purpose is during life. I’d left that job, moved onto another, got fired last Christmas and have been unemployed ever since. However the anxiety persists, the lack of work in my life made me even more anxious because of the finite amount of money I had and the free time for me to overthink. 

I’ve recently taken up smoking after vaping and have been smoking weed for the first time in years to try and cope. Also started to go back to the gym to have some type of tangible goal. I’ve started to love someone more than myself who used to love me but I had no idea, she dropped out in October or November and I thought I’d never see her again but that wasn’t bad because I barely knew her. Now after 2 and a half months of speaking I love her so much but I crave her presence to the point where my paranoia is making me second guess everything. Her life is actually incredibly busy but instead I’m constantly thinking she’s lying to me and I don’t want this to become a self fulfilling prophecy. She lives far away and has full time work and caring for her family and trying to get custody of her estranged sister and she’s a fighter so I know she’s got this. 

This is making me even more anxious to the point where I’m only thinking about her in my spare time, and now that I have the entire summer off I’m afraid and scared. I had a nightmare that she was lying this entire time and woke up and had a panic attack, the first since my old job. I’m stuck emotionally and I’m scared of feeling like this forever.

31,"I can't continue anymore, I feel so helpless. There is nowhere I can talk about this but here, and I'm on the edge of ending it all so I thought someone might help me to overcome this.

To start it all, I'm an 18 years old guy and I live in a shithole, a country named Algeria in north Africa. My family is poor and I have never even been able to travel. We eat well and I'm lucky we live in a relatively good place in this country but we still really struggle financially and the pay is very low here, I'm talking 200$ a month for a new computer engineer. Dad worked for 30 years as a vet and he gets paid 700$ a month.  So I can't get out of this shithole neither save money to do so and I'm thinking about just killing myself to get a relief out of this. 

What makes things way worse is that my parents are very religious (Muslim) like all people here and I'm atheist, mom keeps telling me to pray all the time and I have to pretend I do, and everytime I talk with my parents they have to mention religion or God. I can't tell my parents I am atheist or they would either kick my out of the house or try to brainwash me and threaten me with all way. I am definitely not able to live outside the apartment we live in because it's impossible to support myself financially, I have no money and nowhere to go.

I think I have few friends but I'm not sure if they are real friends, I don't have a friend that I can talk like this with or he will judge everything I say. Also I'm starting college soon and I'm going to study computer science knowing that I'm bound to living my whole life here and getting paid the salary of a dustman in other countries, maybe less. 

This is my situation right now, and there is way more things that made my life so miserable in 18 years that I don't want to continue anymore. This is a call for help because I feel stuck and helpless and I feel like I need to end it all. The only thing that is holding me back are my parents even if they keep making me want to die everyday by forcing religion down my throat, I still don't want them to be sad that I killed myself, but I would definitely get away from them forever if I could.

It is crazy in high FOMO is a bigger driving factor when making decisions causing you to have a snap reaction. This is something that I have carried with me through out my adulthood, I make snap decisions and regret them shortly after. My job has been pushing R Factor training at us which teaches us to think before reacting among other things and I am just now seeing the legitimacy of these lessons. When making any decisions in life it is important to think about all possible outcomes or bumps that may occur, especially when it comes to finances. Because of my snap decision making I have now put myself in a situation where I need to work full time to pay my bills but I’m also in school.

I had a great weekend planned for us. We spent one night at my family’s lake house, the next going to an mlb game and then to bars in the city, and the last day at the wedding. He spent a lot on travel so I paid for the room at the wedding venue and the baseball tickets. We had a really great time. 

But here’s the thing, he recently broke up with his girlfriend of five years and hasn’t had much luck in the dating game. And during the majority of the weekend, he was really focused on tinder.

We graduated last May, haven’t seen him since. We were drinking beers at the lake next to a fire on a beautiful night, and he was just swiping away on his phone not talking. At the baseball game doing the same thing. Then at the wedding we saw the rest of our friend group we haven’t seen in a while, all of us are enjoying ourselves reminiscing, and he’s just sitting on his phone on tinder. 

Don’t get me wrong it wasn’t 24/7, we still had awesome conversations but he was doing it enough that it really aggravated me. I took this personally because it seemed he would rather go and have a one night stand with some random girl, than enjoy his time with me and our friends who he hasn’t seen since graduation.

- He has talked to my mom about planning a suicide.

- He has struggled with depression in the past but hasn't ever gone on anti-depressants (that I know of). I think he views them as stigmatized.

- He has been to a doctor and spoke about his depression, but the doctor effectively dismissed him and did not offer anti-depressants. I think he's hesitant to speak to a medical professional about this issue now.

- He doesn't know that I know these things, my mom has told me all of this without his knowledge. This makes it difficult for me to talk about them with him, as I think that he would be very upset if he found out my mom revealed these issues.

- This sounds silly but Anthony Bourdain was one of his favorite celebrities, so seeing his take his own life has been really rough on him and I'm concerned it has ""legitimized"" the concept of suicide. He also loves basketball so maybe I could use Bourdain + the recent push of NBA players talking about mental health as a catalyst for change?

- He's lost a decent amount of money on the stock market, but trading seems to be the only thing that makes him happy. I'm concerned it's turning into an addiction at this point though. I think my family will be ok financially but my parents don't have much of a cushion left.

- He drinks quite a bit on a regular basis. Like, 4 drinks with dinner. Not to the point where he loses control but that can't be healthy for body or mind.

I just don't know how to proceed. My mom is so stressed out about this and other issues in their lives and I really want to help. My father is stubborn so I'm not sure how to approach the idea of professional help, which in my opinion he clearly needs. I'm also not sure what type of help he should seek out. Does anyone have a recommendation on how to find a good resource to help treat depression? Or how to approach this subject with my dad?

Thank you all in advance for any advice.

TL;DR: I get attracted way too easily to girls, this makes me scared and makes me loose my self\-esteem.

Hi everyone,

So first of all, sorry for my mistakes, I'm French and I'm learning English.

Well let's get into the subject. After my first and only ""real"" relationship when I was in senior year of high school, I was left kind of devastated, you know... classic cheesy high school love story. But since then, I get attracted to girl way too easily.

Let me clarify this, not every girl I see randomly during the day, I mean, if a girl shows even the littlest proof of interest to me, I attracted to her immediately. This is starting to have a negative impact on my life, as if a random girl comes talking to me, I immediately assume she ""may"" be into me, then I start to freak out, then I stutter, then I tell myself I lost the women of my life (I'm exaggerating, but you see the point), then during the following week I will still think about that girl, until a next one take the spot.

I'm starting to really loose my self\-esteem, and it impact my life greatly as I use to be a very talkative and open person, now I can even approach a girl, as I get really scared and this makes me really sad. I'm like entering in a circle and it makes me more shy every time and it even happened that I cry because.

To end my story, I want to relate to the last thing related to this topic, that happened just today, and opened my life on how this is starting to be a real issue in my social (and personal) life. So I just created my account on tinder this week, and I get a cute girl that super liked me (to clarify, I'm not ugly nor beautiful, just your skinny normal 21y/o guy). So I start the conversation, with asking her why she superliked me when she could have superliked a really good looking guy (in a humorist way, not a diminishing way), she tells me she founded my pictures funny and different. So we hit it off ""pretty well"", start talking were we come from, what we like, dislikes, funny stuff (well... the basics of smallchat). And I start to get feeling for her like very fast (why? explained in the beginning of my post :p).

But as you may know, being ghosted on tinder is something quite ""usual"", so I got ghosted today. And this hitted me quite hard, even though we only started chatting 2 days ago. During the whole day I was really sad, and did nothing at work, thinking about her and then got delayed in my work which will led me to work this WE if I don't catch up.

Before posting this, I started thinking about my life a little bit, and concluded that this is maybe due to a real lack affection, but I have friends, a good family... so I really don't know where this comes from.

Has anyone of you been in that situation, or anyone knows some kind of ""magic trick"" that can help me get my life back, or maybe how to gain a bit of self\-esteem with girls. I know this post maybe not really easy to understand, but with my broken English and my strange problem, I tried to explain it the best I can :)

J'espère que vous passez une bonne journée!",12Jun2018,2

52,"I’ve spent my whole life and especially through my teens and into now (F21) always just being obsessed with at least one person around me, then basing everywhere I go and who I am and what I do on them. It’s always been a boyfriend or a guy I’ve a crush on, or even a friend. I just broke up with my last boyfriend and I’m already thinking of this new guy and I can’t stop wondering what he’s up to, what’s going on with him. I’ve come to a point in my life where logically I think I’m amazing and worthy and want to just be alone - but my mind won’t leave me alone. My thoughts won’t stop being like this and it’s making me not enjoy anything. I don’t know how to just enjoy where I am and what I’m doing or being with friends. I’m always thinking of a guy and what they’re doing. Do I need to just lock myself in a room don’t talk with any possible romantic interests and just one day I’ll stop thinking like that? Or what do I do ?? I want to just be myself and not need to think of a guy or getting with anyone ",12Jun2018,8
