2," I know men deal with these kinds psycho women but as a woman, I am as well. She has been trying to turn everyone against me at uni for the past year. Sending herself fake texts and telling others I sent them to victimize herself, saying I've tried to break her and her bf up, and I was going thru my gmail chrome search history and saw her name being searched up on my Facebook everyday for the past 4 months. The only reason I can shes done this is to see if I've posted her name in my messages or any posts about her. I was confused as hell, so o changed all my passwords and my gmail account (uni gmail linked to fb) and then the search history is gone too so now I dont even have proof. Ffs wtf do I do?

4,"So tomorrow, I’m going to be hanging out again with my close friend that I’ve known for many years, and I am extremely worried about what’s going to happen to me when we eat at the restaurant \- just us two at the table, face to face. 

Because the other time we went for lunch, I felt somewhat shaky midway but it wasn’t as bad as the last time where I was so shaky that I thought I was going to faint so I had to slouch and lean my head against my hand. 

Even envisioning us sitting there now makes me feel very jittery and dizzy. And I have no idea what’s going to happen tomorrow. 

But I’m going to try to not care because I overthink too much on whether I’m sitting or eating properly and if people are looking at me. And the truth is that nobody is going to care except me. Not even her, because she is laidback and non\-judging, and everything will be okay. 

Or at least I hope it will be. 

Just let me make it through lunch tomorrow. ",27Apr2018,1
5,"On election night 2016, I made a silly self post that was simply titled ""Jesus Fucking Christ,"" the top comment was ""I thought we rigged it,"" and my response was ""I thought *you* were gonna rig it!"" 

I've been on reddit for way too long, and it's my experience even deleted posts show up your history, but this one has completely disappeared.

6,"In the last few months I've found out a ""friend"" actually loathed me the entire time we were ""friends"". It has crushed me. Barely starting to get over it. I suppose not everyone, even one that said they were your friend, had respect for you. People lie for their own self interest.

At first I wanted an explanation. Then closure. Now it's been made very apparent that the closure has happened \(spreading gossip and lies about me to coworkers, lying to my face constantly\), and the explanation is that there was never any respect for me.

I am just at the point I am questioning why someone has hated me so much and has never had any respect for me?",27Apr2018,1
7,"The thought that something else was in total control over my mind drove me mad. When ever I decided to give up the habit, and couldn't hold myself back that day I would succumb to that desire and smoke more cigarettes than I usually do. A number of such days later, I realised everytime I failed it was a step back for my self esteem. Yesterday I think I reached an all time low when I felt I could never let it go. What better moment to fight back!!

interesting actually to help me hold my mind) to help me through this? ",27Apr2018,4
8,"So my priest is one of the most brilliant people I’ve ever met. I admire her so much. She emailed several people a scholarly article today about the idea of “the female heretic” in early Christianity, with a message saying “I'm just sending it to people who I thought would be fascinated by it.”

I looked at the other recipients, and every name was either a brilliant clergyperson or an equally brilliant seminarian. So I’m just really honored right now that she sent it to me as well, because I’m just a clueless and confused undergrad, and, if for just one fascinating article, I was counted among all those brilliant people.

This made my day, but I can’t really talk about that irl without sounding like I’m humble-bragging, so I just wanted to share this with the Void because it felt really special.",27Apr2018,0

20,"Looking through old photo albums with my sister in law, I realize how many pictures of herself and her friends she has throughout her youth. 
I’ve always been self conscious, never wanted to be included in group photos or selfies with friends, never let anyone keep pictures of me, never went anywhere fun or did anything cool. Now I realize I have no photos of my teenage years. Yes, *none*. 
I’m still young, but married with children, I feel like the time to look back fondly on photographs is largely over for me. Pregnancy took a huge toll on me physically and I feel as though I will never look beautiful or feel confident. And all the good years, all the memories I have of my friends and my life will dissipate so quickly because I refused to allow there to be reminders. ",27Apr2018,1

When we got here, the line for check-in was out the door and 80 feet down the sidewalk because they weren't running enough desks. They kept coming out and yelling out cities and pulling people out of line.

Well, we arrived at check-in, and they told us we wouldn't be allowed to board the plane because we wouldn't make it to the gate in time.  They had never called Knoxville to pull us out. 

So the plane left without us. Then, they had the unbelievable gall to charge us $150 to fly to a different city four hours away from Knoxville.

25,"Background: I've been ice skating since I was 5 years old.  When I started, it was love at first sight, and I kept with it even after my rink back home closed down.  My mother (god bless her soul) took me to a rink that is 1.5 hours away to help me keep with it, and, because I came to this area so often, I attended college there.  A lot of shit has been going down (both good and bad), and I feel like so much of my energy has been devoted to new things that I don't feel much passion for skating anymore.  I want to keep with it because I only have one more moves test to pass before I'm completed with this set of tests, and I love seeing my coaches, and I don't want to let them down.

My neighbors have a nerdy, college freshman son. 10 years younger than my own son.

My other girlfriends in the neighborhood always joke about how the kid is cute in a dorky, innocent way, but a virgin prude who would not take his nose out of a textbook long enough to touch a girl.

As I went through Instagram, somehow I ended up on a friend of a friend of a friend's daughter, and I saw a photo saying:

Never fuck w/ me in beer pong!!! #skunked

It's my neighbor's awkward, geek son -

He's BUCK NAKED and running down our street -- IN PUBLIC!!! In the photo, he's from behind, but turned towards the camera with his eyes wide and mouth open lol.

This nerd who I've never even seen taking his shirt off at their pool is as naked as a newborn baby, streaking down the street for the world to see with a surprisingly cute, plump lily-white bubble butt!

Probably with his cute little weenie and balls flapping in the air for the world to see! hahaha

This kid never even takes his shirt off at the pool. It must have been so embarrassing for him!! lol

Well, this 57 year old woman blew up that photo of that blushing, bare-assed nerd and used it as a centerpiece for wine night with the girls lol

29,"An hour ago I had my suspicions confirmed that the lovely guy that I’d been dating had been lying to me multiple times even when I outright asked him earlier this week if he’s still living with his wife. 
I met him through and online dating app about 4-5 weeks ago and I’ve met him in person 5 times. He told me he’s been separated for 2 years and they don’t live together anymore. We had great chemistry straight away and we have kept in constant daily contact through texts. He works in a field that requires him to be away for a week at a time and home for a week. 
I became suspicious when he was contacting me much more while he was away working than when he’s at home on his week off. There were other red flags as well, things that didn’t add up. So I put it to him on Monday and asked him if she’s still living with him, he said no and gave reasons for all the red flags I mentioned to him. I still wasn’t convinced because I’ve had this happen to me before and he was behaving the same as the last guy that did this. 
He arrived home today for his week at home and as usual text contact dries up as soon as he gets off the plane. My mind has been dwelling on it all day so late this evening I drove past his house to see if a different car was there to indicate his (ex)wife was sleeping there. I’ve dropped him off at his house once during the day before so I knew where he lived. The 2 cars that I know are his were there (I still believe one of them is hers). I had to park around the corner and walk past to get a good look at the cars, and while I was walking past I noticed his bins were outside. I looked in his general waste and there was a bag in there, curiosity got the better of me and I took the bag and looked through it around the corner. 
There’s definitely a lady living in the house. I found tags off ladies clothing and a receipt from the store around the corner while he was away, so he couldn’t have bought it. 
I returned the trash to the bin and came home. 
I don’t know how to feel now my suspensions have been confirmed and I feel pretty low going through the trash 
TL:DR  Suspicious of a guy I’m dating was still married and living with wife. He denies it repeatedly. Went through his trash. Confirmed he’s cheating. ",27Apr2018,271

I have tried to be understanding, patient, supportive and focus on his needs, while sacrificing some of my own wants and needs. He tells me he loves me but he says he doesn't know what he wants anymore. He doesn't really care about our future together anymore. Part of me knows it's the depression but I feel like there's nothing I can do to fix this and I am sacrificing my own happiness. I don't want to leave him. I just want him to get better.

I know he's the President of the United States, but **HE IS CRAZY**. When you walk down the street and you see that guy holding that sign, screaming at the top of his lungs that the end of the world is near, are you shocked by anything else he might say or do? No, because **HE IS CRAZY.**

So I'm a college senior geek. Always buried in books. About 5'7. Slightly chubby ""hits the books but never the gym"" belly.

I was finally dragged out to a party. ""Come on, you never had fun your ENTIRE college career. Celebrate!"" said my friend Wendy.

I ended up somehow playing a game of beer pong and was randomly matched up with an attractive female rugby player.

I wasn't exactly good at all. Finding myself quickly down 0-7.

Then she spoke up ""Hey virgin boy, you ready to feel the breeze on that bare ass?""

I blushed as people chuckled around me.

""Excuse me?""

""House rules. You get shut out. You run all the way around the block...hehehe...NAKED.""

I gulped as everyone laughed at my reaction.

In a panic now imagining my lily-white-from-the-neck-down-body exposed, I also air-balled the next 3 cups and began sheepishly unbuttoning my shirt.

I went home, slightly sneezing that night from a cold, but thought, whatever, I'll never see these people again.

Then I got an email from Wendy, subject ""LOL"" with a link to that girl's Instagram page.

There I am, in mid-run, from behind, head turned towards the camera with a wide-eyed, open-mouthed look on my face.
