0,"It really doesn’t seem worth it anymore. Nothing brings me happiness or satisfaction. I have no goals and no ambitions. All I do is work, smoke, sleep. I’ve got no lover and probably won’t have one for a long time. I’ve got no real passions or hobbies that I look forward to. I have friends, but I struggle with intimacy and I’m always wrapped up in my insecurities that I’m always worried I’ll lose them eventually. 

I don’t go out. No one invites me anyways. I don’t have any confidence in myself to go do things alone and even if I did, I don’t have the money. 

I’m sick of living life. It seems like nothing but stress and competition and pain. I wake up every morning feeling like shit. I go to bed feeling like shit. I’m just going through the motions waiting till I die. Nothing seems like its worth it anymore. Nothing brings me happiness or satisfaction. I have tried so many different things. I am so done with trying. I want to give up. ",02Sep2018,26

2,"My esports team just fucking blew it and it's ruined my evening.

Now I'm just thinking about how, my self esteem is so low that I can't stand to lose. Sometimes it makes me want to scream and cry like a stupid child. I guess because I have simply been a loser since I was a stupid child.

It really sucks to be over competitive and a perfectionist but literally a loser at EVERYTHING you do. Ever since I was a kid I've been a fat, lonely weirdo loser. So any time I lose now as an adult at ANYTHING it is a serious hit to my self esteem. Idk how to fix it other than, yanno, get better.

Sighhhhhhh I guess I should improve my mood somehow...but I'm just sitting here thinking about how shitty I am.",02Sep2018,1
4,"So today I test drove the Accord Hybrid and it didn't feel like I thought it would. Now I'd like to get some things out first.

**1. Can it work on EV only mode?** Yes for short time, like a mile probably at most. The charge drops very quickly when in EV mode, I didn't notice big drop in AC cooling while in EV mode. If you press gas hard enough, it will exit EV only mode.

**Is there good rear legroom?** Yes.

**Hybrid Conclusion**: It feels more like a capacitor than lithium battery, I really don't know what's under the hood, but since it seems like it will charge and discharge in less than 15 minutes I doubt it's pure lithium, or maybe some high discharge lithium battery, so not sure, just feels like capacitor.

**CVT** I think the hybrid will put less stress on the CVT transmission causing longer CVT life, but I'm not sure.",02Sep2018,4

6,"I have wants and needs i never coonsidered.

I smoked, both weeds and cigarettes, and drunk, from 14-16. Quit when i got a girlfriend (was my decision). 2 years go by, i break up with her for being controlling and not letting me have a social life.

That breakup was in may?

I went out the other night, met a girl 3 years older than me. And shes super cute, and just really nice. 

Thing is, i had a rule, no alcohol, no tobacco, no weed, no caffiene (have been addicted to all before, alcohol and weed less so). I did just LSD after we broke up. 

Now iv broken every rule when i went out, i did all of it, except weed. And that was last night. And since then iv already been for a smoke with this girl. 

So iv smoked, i feel fucking anxious because i like a girl 3 years older when iv only ever dated people my age. (Im 18). 

I know it barely matters but my life took a weird turn the moment i met this girl, and im actually happier now.

I dont want smoking to become habit, nor drinking. And im avoiding weed. And no more caffiene (had a vodka and redbull last night, used to have insane amounts of coffee and energy drinks).

I just feel weird, but happy. Im out my comfort zone i feel like. It was the first time being in a more social setting than ever.",02Sep2018,1

8,It was one evening we were alone outside his nursing home when we started talking about his wishes after he passed. I'm the youngest brother and me and my dad are the closest. He told me he didn't want to be buried underground because he's afraid of being alone in the dark. I was already starting to cry inside and he kept going. He told me when he's laying in bed he has panic attack's about dying and not knowing what's going to happen. I tried to consol him but he went into tears repeating his fears. He eventually calmed down and we went inside as it was getting cold out. I waited on the person help workers to put him in bed and said my good bye. His reaction and thoughts of his fears are mine as well. I think about everything he said every night. I reach the edge off tearing up whenever I think about him leaving me. I'm afraid of my father dying and I miss him already. When the time comes I don't how I'll react but I feel the pain now of it all. I love my dad so much.,02Sep2018,11

That was the first time in my whole life that my head's so freaking hurt that I thought I'm having a migraine or something. I want to scream but yeah sensitive people outside our house might hear so I didn't. I became so irritable and I RESISTED IT SO MUCH and it hurts my head even more. But guess what... after an hour my mood changed so quick that I got motivated to play video games whole night until 4 AM. That was so weird. What can you say about this?

14,"I left for the store to buy dinner, when I noticed a turtle crossing the road that exits the apartment complex. I thought about stoping the car or signaling or doing something, but am shy and deciduous and quickly decided the car should see the turtle, as it was definitely moving and non-conspicuous.

The car didn’t stop. The turtle’s shell cracked loudly twice, and the car didn’t stop. The guy didn’t stop to see what the fuck sounded so loud and weird. He might have done it on purpose.

I yelled and then went to get a bag and gloves to clean the turtle. Its shell cracked on many parts. One of them was missing, and its intestines were showing. It had its head in. I grabbed it and threw it in the trash.

I’m feeling so guilty because, had I not been so shy, I might have attracted the driver’s attention and stopped him from running the turtle over, if just because someone else was watching him. But also because now I am not so sure it was dead dead when I grabbed it. I thought of stepping on its retracted head to stop its pain, but it wasn’t visible and I wasn’t about to try to crush it further. I just wanted it to be over. And I wanted to tell this story.

Sure, it’s only a turtle. But fuck, if I had said something, yelled at the van or flailed my arms like a madman, the little guy would maybe still be alive.",02Sep2018,4
15,"I’ve fallen into a rut. Not with anything specifically, but generally speaking. I don’t slack off or act super lazy or have many bad habits. There just aren’t many redeeming qualities about me. And I’m always super tired, procrastinating, and I feel like I have the body of an unhealthy 40 year old. I’m 18. But today all of this hit me and I’ve had enough. I’ve been doing some creative projects recently and some of my friends are involved with them. They aren’t super interested in it or as committed as I am, so I thought I’d start another project on my own. They’re cool with this except for one guy. And when I told him, he said that I couldn’t do it without them and that it was stupid. So fuck that guy. I was super pissed and hurt, so I decided not only am I gonna do my own shit, but I’m going to do it really fucking good. The best way to get back at people is to prove them wrong. In my heated state I was overanalyzing myself and I felt like shit. Later that day I was watching YouTube and I saw the newest Casey Neistat video in my feed. I fucking love that man. People may think whatever they want about him, but you have to respect his hustle. There was a part of his video where he was talking about why he does all the shit he does and now I’m really jazzed. I know how I’ve tried routines and shit in the past, but this time I think it is different. I just started college and feel lost. If I don’t act like a motivated madman (à la Casey Neistat) now in my life, then I feel certain everything will fall apart and it’ll be 100 times harder to succeed in life. So starting Monday, I’m gonna wake up at 5 am, work out, actually eat breakfast, work all day, and eat correctly. Fuck yes. And that guy who tried to discourage me go and fuck his own face.

I like the idea of being anonymous as well.  Sorry in advance if its a long read. 

sigh, so I got into a fight with this one girl last week for bad mouthing me and my mom. It wasnt really a fight, just the usual drama. I just bitch slapped her, she cried and we made up, said sorry to eachother and that was that. At least I thought so, but I guess not because now for the past few days I've been getting serious death threats and I'm scared shitless. 
I didnt know who she was, or what shes really capable of at the time, she just lived in the same apartments I live at so I'd see her around alot. You see, my town is very small and has so much gang problems that its pretty much taken over at this point, its not safe to even go out at night. Since its such a small place, things go around pretty quick. The threats have gotten pretty insane, I've been getting messages from random ass people I dont even know, they end up blocking me before I could have a chance to see who they are. I've already contacted police about it, they cant do anything unless they actually pull through with the threats. I could add more details but in short, I'm now currently hiding out inside my own place out of fear and I do not know what else I could do, I'm scared. (they know where I live)  I'm not the type of girl to be into gangs and stuff but I stand my ground whenever I need and never let ANYONE talk bad on my mother either. I regret slapping her now obviously, but man.. is there any advice anyone could give me at all? anything! I don't want to risk escalating this further, My anxiety is constant since the first threat, cant eat or sleep, I cannot stop shaking so I'm just desperate at this point lol

22,"I live on a farm in the country in FL. It's hot folks, like the egg is cooked before it hits the pavement hot. I was dressed in a white tank top, some short shorts, and no bra when I walked down the driveway to check on my goats. Didn't matter, I was covered in sweat 3ft into the trek.

One of my dogs was with me. Let's call him Asshole for the purposes of this story. Asshole starts heading for the front gate at a suspicious speed. I call him. He keeps going. On the other side of the gate is a fairly busy 2 lane road full of large trucks and retirees going country road speeds...balls to the fucking wall. I'm sternly calling Asshole, astonished because he's never done this before. I'm not panicking because surely he wouldn't go--Then I'm watching his fuzzy ass squirm under the gate and disappear.

I ran to the gate and started calling, looking for him. It was like Scotty beamed him the fuck up because he was gone. Sweat is pouring off me, cars are zipping by, and out the corner of my eye I spot him. Across the street. Frolicking in somebody's yard.

It took a minute or two for there to be safe time to cross. My stress level was &gt;9000 because he'd spotted me and I didn't want him playing frogger with Ford F250's. As soon as could I sprinted across the road and shut neighbors gate, trapping him in.

At that point a tiny, frail, 80+ yr old woman with careully permed silver hair and matching button up shirt and capris tottered out. I can only imagine what she saw and thought. A chubby red faced whore looking woman in what was by now a transparent white tank top, titties flopping. Short shorts, hair clinging to her face, shaking like meth addict desparate for a fix. Some parts of that description may sound sexy to some of you. I assure you, it was NOT.

I waved, hands out to my sides, because she's probably packing heat. ""Hi! I'm your neighbor, Pinky Swear. That's my stupid dog. Do you have a length of rope?""

""WHAT?""

""HI I LIVE IN THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET, THAT'S MY DOG I'M SORRY!""

""You live in a bus across the street?"" She was both alarmed and completely justified with this statement. I assured her that I did not, in fact live in a bus. I asked for rope. She said she needed to get her husband and I don't fucking blame her.

The old lady, let's call her Maeve, went inside. Moments later a tall, equally acient old man, Cotton, totters painfully outside. By this time I've got Asshole by the scruff and it's taking every ounce of willpower I have not to tear out his throat with my bare teeth.

I explain the situation, then wait 10000yrs for him to hobble into the garage for a rope. His wife, in the meantime, has come back out and is on her phone, on speaker, explaining the situation to someone. I prayed it was the cops because in a small country town the grapevine is more likely to hang you. It wasn't the cops. Fuck.

Finally I had Asshole roped. I carefully put their gate back the way I found it (country 101), and completed my sweaty whorish walk of shame back home.

After cleaning up and dressing appropriately, I put my big girl panties on and marched right back over there with the rope and a carton of fresh eggs from my chickens.

I apologized prfusely to Cotton. We chatted for half an hour before his wife came out. I apologized for making what was probably THE WORST first impression in the history of first impressions. I offered the eggs in supplication. She said ""That's so sweet, you didn't have to do that"".....then the southern lady death blow...""bless your heart.""

So that's it folks. I'm forever the half dressed harlot with an uncontrollable dog who thinks eggs makes up for my moral deprivation.

On a side note, I'm working hard on training Asshole. Thanks for reading.

Nothing has ever made my life enjoyable and I’m still so young it’s unbearable to think I have to keep going. I’ve looked really good and I’ve looked like shit not caring what people think, I have literally done everything possible to try and improve my life including change my own mindset. Nothing works. I’ve seen doctors and I’ve been medicated. I’ve heard every single motivational speech and heard every quote, I’ve listened to Tony Robbins and I’ve listened to les Brown, I understand everything they say and I’ve followed their advice but I’m just as miserable as before. 

The very worst part of this is that I’m not suicidal, I don’t want to kill myself because I don’t think it improves anything and it only causes more pain. This means I’m stuck, perpetually miserable no matter what changes I make. 

Thank you to those with anything good to say but i know these posts attract the usual pos “just stop feeling sorry for yourself” yea like i said I’ve done everything including feel great about myself but that doesn’t change the fact that outside forces can make you miserable. ",02Sep2018,2

When I first joined Reddit I got very angry at times when I made a post about something and rules would be so bent on things the slightest typo or how I asked a question would get I suspended or banned. Later I would avoid those subreddits or just post comments instead of threads. I really like the communities I'm part of. Being anti social in real life and posting opinions people agree with is a great feeling that you haven't lost touch in the world yet, but now that seems to be falling apart. 

I get let down, discouraged, and upset that I get banned for asking a mod questions, that I post the same thing as every one else, if I ask a question and it's removed because I didn't ask it the way they want me to. It's a bend on free speech. I'm not so sure if Reddit is for me any more and even though it's just an internet thing ..it's really depressing. ",02Sep2018,2

29,"My first girlfriend was on the thicker side of things. Wanted me to 'have a taste' in her words. By the time my lips were on her I was on the verge of gagging. 2 seconds and an excuse later we went back to sex and she was visibly upset. Tried it again the next day after she showered, no result. She texted me about it later, so I let her know how things were in the nicest way possible (but they didn't come out that way to her) and she was upset. I broke up with her very soon afterwards, but there was more than one reason for that.

Fast forward a few months. I match with a girl on tinder, again on the thicker side but she was much prettier, very confident, and much smarter than me. I drove to her place and we have sex, it was good. That is all she wanted, but not all I wanted. Despite that, it became a relationship pretty quickly. At the time, I got off work at 11PM, then I drove an hour away to see her, where she had a full dinner ready for me. After that we watched TV while she sucked my brains out.Then we fucked for an hour or so. I'd leave at 5AM, get back by six, go to sleep for six hours, and go to work again almost immediately after waking up. Pretty soon she brought up that getting eaten out was very important to her, I let her know how things were last time I tried this and she was fine with it. Next time I came over, we showered together and I brought this gel product you put on your tongue when you go down on someone. It worked for a minute or two, had no idea what I was doing but it was enjoyable until the scent, although subtle, caught up to me and I was ready to apply more gel. But then she said she wanted to go back to having sex. I expected her to ask me to do it again but she never brought it up. Fast forward a month. Things had started getting worse the past two or three weeks. She wasn't so bright and bubbly and happy like she always was. Just mellow and more reserved. She came over to my place to have sex and she just wasn't into it. I started to become really worried. Asked her what was wrong. She said that she needs someone to eat her out and because I have trouble with that she needs to just be casual. I was too shocked to know what to do. If you asked me what I would do if a girl 'wanted to be casual' I'd tell you immediately that I would dump her on the spot and never talk to her again. It wasn't that easy. I told her we should try to work things out and she went home. Didn't talk to her a whole week. Asked her what was really going on and she wanted to break up with me but for a different reason that isn't entirely relevant to this story.

I start using tinder again, have a few encounters. The sex was risky, wasn't as good, and felt ultimately meaningless. I almost had sex with a vietnamese girl but I didn't have a condom, so she just wanted me to stick it in for a few seconds, which seemed pointless, but I obliged. After pulling out I was about to go down on her. There was  almost no scent at all. I was ready to go until she stopped me and said she didn't get off from oral sex. Gonna cut the story here because it stops being relevant.

The title claimed that he/she was trying to preserve a suicide letter that another redditor had left on that subreddit. Interested, I clicked in. And that's when my life changed forever.

When I clicked into that subreddit, all I saw were two posts; one post from somebody being a jerk and just trying to get karma from the r/RedditRequest thread, and another post simply titled ""hello, goodbye"". I will not name the user here out of respect, you can go to the thread yourself if you want to.

The contents of that post were very sad, depressing, and just makes you want to break down and cry. The user discussed how their plans were to buy their favorite foods and enjoy them, walk down to the beach, and eat more favorite foods, and then kill themselves. They discussed how there was ""good things in [his] life, but not enough to justify living"". They said there was no reason to live, and ""i choose to stop existing"".

When I first read this post, I practically cried. It was so sad and depressing that I just couldn't help it. But now after recovering, I realize something more important: this type of thing has to be stopped.

So after reading this post, I ask of you some favors. Inform yourself of the [national suicide helpline numbers for your country](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines). Subscribe to r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression, r/MMFB, and r/StopSelfHarm. There is a reason you should be doing this.

36,"I have always found it difficult to tolerate the non-sense most people project. And that tolerance is a courtesy that I don't have to extend. So now that I find myself in a brand new world of dis-comfort (more accurately it feels like I died in my sleep one night and then woke up in Hell and couldn't tell the difference). It's fair to say, I was the first to buckle in this situation, due to a lack of common courtesy. What I did for all of you the majority of my life was so simple. It would be effortless for anyone not in this situation to emulate. And not one of you could do it, even for a day. To me your competition is just contradiction at best. Your permission to exist as my equal is beyond insulting, and it can't be measured on any scale. This insignificant difference between us, is just 1 on many.

Tell me, have you accepted your failures? Or just forgot about them? How many of your accomplishments or titles are going to outlive you? If you think I'm a narcissist, then I have to assume that you mean miss-understood. Because that is the only quality him and I have ever shared. But I wont over-estimate your intelligence. What you really think is that I am a person who has an excessive amount of admiration for myself. Is that a judgment? Or an observation? Because if you could view the world with more then 2 eyes you would see who the true narcissist is.

If you know something, then it's fair to say that you can recognize it, even if it's in disguise. Well I know love and I know it very well, it's #1 on my list of values. And I can recognize that the source of you happiness doesn't come from love. Because every ""good choice"" that you make benefits only you. And you would most likely sabotage or destroy anything or anyone that stood in your way. So ya I think I'm better than a lot of you, but I'm not a fucking narcissist. I am awake. And I know for a fact that the Devil struggles as hard as I do, just not with any of you. Because when you were being taught you didn't ask any questions and you blindly accepted everything that you were told as the truth. So please allow me to demonstrate  the true power of Magick weather you believe in it or not.

The standard definition of  ""Perfect"" is straight or cir-metrical, You let me know if you find something like that in any of Gods creations. Trust me you won't, because God doesn't work with straight lines or perfect circles, the Devil dose. For example: Compare a silhouette landscape of New York City to a silhouette landscape of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta. And tell me witch one stresses you out more? If you don't care then you do the Devils work and you're to stupid to notice. I am beyond perfect, as is every other human being ever created. I can understand why Lucifer didn't want to come second to us. It's insulting enough being your equal. I couldn't be second to something who thought so little of themselves either. Your ignorance, is his bliss before it's yours
So I can relate to Lucifer, I even feel sorry for him. Because I feel the same as him every time my success is limited by a series of snap judgments made from people who have an excessive amount of admiration for just themselves. 
 
Somewhere down the line there was a hand shake with a snake and a slave master to control the masses. And with his improved cleverness he discovered that Gods finest work can only be miss-guided or disrupted. And I'll give you one example of how they did it. Spoken and written word is a trade first taught  to mankind from a fallen angel. And with it I can manipulate you, inspire you, miss-guide you or disrupt you. I can make you love and then hate me and then love me again. But only if you blindly accept everything I tell you without question. 

 You are and always will be a product of you environment. Unless you open you mind up to the possibilities of what you're capable of when love is at your source. And then all you have to do after that is accept it and believe it. If you feel limited, it's because you value an earthly desire before love. And now everything in creation will work against you. Just imagine what that snake and slave master have created together. Do not ever humble yourself. Elevate yourself to a level they can't reach, but do it with love. And every step you take forward in the light will scatter Devils and Demons alike.

37,"Lately there has been no interest for me to get out. I don't really like staying here either but it feels like I have no more strength left to push myself over simple stuff. It's hard for me to take a shower, hard to brush my teeth, hard to shave my face. It became hard to go out even for my future wife, I'm starting to worry if she really will be my wife. We're starting to fight over it. It really pisses me off because it feels like no one understands me. It's like if someone tries to push me it gets even worse. I have a lot of issues with my career, a lot of things to fix. I have no idea on how to handle everything especially when there's no motivation for me to go over simple stuff like mentioned above. Whenever my friends call for partying or just to hang out, I feel like this is not what I should do given the circumstances, I don't really enjoy anything in this shitty city anyway. But I'm happy to have guests which is strange, and kind of shows that it's not about being serious with my career situation but issues with leaving home, pushing myself. I have a strong belief that ""heart"" never lies and I'm trying to listen to it, be as honest with myself as possible, which ends up in acting according to my true desires like peace and comfort, but I'm afraid it's going to kill me in poverty and loneliness.

38,"Hello Reddit

&amp;#x200B;

I am working on an app idea, [TaskChamp](http://taskchamp.co) , which is a productivity tool. It helps people to divide tasks into smaller sub tasks and work on them individually . I've myself dealt with procrastination for a good amount of years in life and believe many people too face this problem. We usually loose the track of our goals when start procrastinating things . It's not impossible to think that one must not do this. But getting back on the the track within shorter time duration is the catch.

So, I just spent the past few months researching this idea and have designed a solution around this issue.

This application is aimed for people who want to make most of their efforts. People have different sections of work in their daily lives, so  they need separate working environments .. Browsing and visiting websites are a way to gather bunch of ideas. 

 So you need to make the most of your ideas and their resources (urls) . If you can stack together these and make available and can relate them to individual tasks then it eases your workflow. No more going back and forth the bookmark manager and probably getting lost in it.

When you hear some stories of people finishing tasks and sharing success short briefs, then you also get a desire to get back and work if you aren't already or if you feel down or less motivated.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're interested in this idea then please have a look at the [product website](http://taskchamp.co/) ,subscribe, which is currently in development and will be sooner live.

Thank you",02Sep2018,2

She stopped talking to me after she told me she didn't really want to see me and I ranted saying how much I liked being with her because of my anxiety, so I guess she just got tired of me. Because she didn't do anything wrong, I don't hate her, obviously. I'm not mad, just sad. For a while, when we still talked, I insisted to buy her a ukulele of her favourite colour for her birthday. Now I don't really know if I should. I know she would like it a lot, she told me so, and I'd really want to show her I still care and that she can still reach to me anytime she needs to. But I'm afraid someone's going to buy it for her, or that when I'll tell her I did she'll say something like ""keep it"". I just don't know what to do?",02Sep2018,1

45,"I take online courses for college (19 y/o) and I really enjoy it. I hate being in a classroom and doing standard textbook work, so I decided to take online classes. Not only that, but with a situation at home (disabled brother, more to it but that’s tl;dr) it wasn’t a very realistic option for me to go to an actual college campus, commuting and the like. 

I’ve been doing it a while and enjoyed the freedom that comes with it. But some days now and then it feels lonely. Like I’m missing out on a lot of relationships/friendships with other people. I have some friends that I’m close with, but even then it just feels empty compared to other people. One of my favorite things is mainly gaming so, as you can imagine, it would be difficult to meet people without some sort of club where everyone gathers to at once.

50,"Today I learned my great-great-great grandmother was a slave. It's not uncommon for African Americans to expect to have this in their lineage. But for some reason as I lay here reading my great-grandmothers obituary, seeing it in text made it all too real. I felt the burden and misery from my family's hard work, sweat and tears. I felt the guilt and remorse for afflicting those around me with this vicious cycle of hate and pain that's been introduced to our lives. 
Mostly, the guilt is what stung. I released a bit and cried. I'm in the middle of leaving a very messy relationship because ultimately a deciding factor was that I couldn't keep my hands to myself. I'm not excusing my behavior. This is a pattern that has taken too many generations to try and end. Even if my family won't admit it, we're all emotionally scarred. 
In my family, the women don't get along. My mother, the antagonist who I will rightfully dub ''Firestarter'' after one of her favorite movies, never let me interact with my own family. She was experiencing multiple mental health illnesses that inhibited her from giving me the love, support and respect I needed to become a functioning successful adult. Now to me, I see her mental illness as something that's partially hereditary, partially environmental. This is a newer realization I was able to conclude after finally stopping contact with her and her constant  harrassment. 
To be honest, the only few key things I knew about my great grandmother was that she was in AA, she had lots of wealthy friends who adored her, she prayed before going to bed at night, and she loved bingo. But as I hit 19 and had the opportunity to reconnect with my family who I had been banned from contacting for 10 years. The move? My family just moved her from her independent apartment to a nursing home far inland. As I'm unpacking this womans whole life, my grandmother drops little stories about her life to me. Dusting off the mental mystery puzzle of my family history in my mind, I worked on adding these pieces of information to what I already knew. Telling tales of life on the east coast in the early days of ""freedom"". Slavery was over, but segregation had begun.
A reoccurring theme I've seen and experienced for many black men and women is this feeling of self hatred. Personally, I've struggled with identity and race all my life. For 20 years I had the thought in my head of being a particular mix of ethnicities, which was fed to me by the Firestater. For my 24th birthday, I received a gene test that revealed  my ""true"" identity. I was shocked, learning that all this time, I had predominantly Irish genealogy. Which unlocked a couple more questions I had for myself. 
In 2015 a tragic accident happened in my apartment building. Six young Irish professionals died, crushed to death by the apartment's balcony. Located in such a prime area of my town, this was all over the news instantly. Ol' Firestarter reportedly was one of the first to hear the accident. She started mourning after these poor kids like they were my siblings. Yes we were similar in age, but that was all I thought
we had in common at the time. Photos of them with candles all over the apartment, letters to these dead people who she knew nothing about prior to this day. I couldn't wrap my head around why she was so painstakingly involved in getting justice for what had happened. But once I found that out, it clicked. 

""It could have been you."" 

The words echoed in my subconscious for some time. I always downplayed my terrible life choices and consequences by telling myself 

""It could have been worse.""

As if by some saving grace I could endure whatever it was that was bringing me down with just a few words. Now, I feel like I've dug down to the bottom of the barrel with excuses as to why I am the way I am. I'm all too familiar with how worse things can actually get.

I want to get better. I want positivity and love and affection but like all wants, you don't just get to have it all. It's hard work, determination, and preservation that will get you there.

I'm working harder on how to dictate my life and its events.

55,"People (especially girls) have never really took much notice of me my full life. While I do have a few female friends and don’t really have too much trouble getting to know people, it’s just that it always takes a lot of effort on my end. I suppose I’ve always just been one of those people that isn’t too interesting to others at first and probably gets more interesting the more you get to know me, whereas a lot of people are just outwardly confident enough and have that kind of magnetic quality that makes you want to know them instantly. It means that romantically it’s really hard for me to just have someone be attracted to me straight away, or at all really.

Recently though I’ve noticed this kind of shifting. I think a lot of it is to do with just adding in little habits that are slowly building up my self confidence and allowing me to more easily put myself out there. About a year ago I started reading regularly, I started putting in more effort in college, I bought myself some new clothes, etc. I’ve always been a really small dude (I’m 20 and I’m 5’6), and to add to it I’ve really fucking skinny. A few months ago I started finally putting on a bit of weight and decided to hit the gym, and I’ve managed to put on a good amount of muscle to the point that people I know always comment on it when I meet them. I started getting into a skincare routine, and just generally looking after myself more.

I don’t feel like I’ve changed as a person really, but just that I have more confidence in myself that lets who I am shine through more easily. Last night I really noticed it a shit ton. I have one friend in particular that people always kind of flock to while we’re out, he’s just a really confident and funny dude. He’s one of those guys who also flirts with every girl who crosses his path, and there’s this one girl we hang out sometimes with who he’s shamelessly flirted with for ages now. While I talk to this girl a little cause we hang out with the same people, I wouldn’t say we’re much beyond acquaintances. Honestly before last night we hadn’t talked much, she’s one of those people that’s so attractive that it’s kind of intimidating to talk to them at first.

But last night I noticed she was sitting next to me all the time and just laughing at stupid shit I’d say all the time, even while my friend was doing his usual flirting routine with her. She actually seemed like she was doing her best to ignore him and talk to me instead, which is insane because that just never happens. She was literally ignoring one of the most outwardly charismatic guys I know to talk to me, which just gave me a massive confidence boost. Eventually when we left that bar everyone else walked ahead of us to the club we were walking to and it was just me and her, and what should have been a 10 minute walk ended up like an hour of me and her having to stop every 2 seconds just laughing at the stupidest shit (we were both pretty drunk lmfao). When we eventually got there she kept wanting to dance with me and people were telling us to get a room and shit like that. I didn’t make out with her or anything, she’s just recently split with her boyfriend and so I didn’t want to force anything, but I think it definitely could have happened on a different night.

That’s just one example though, that full night and other nights recently I’ve noticed I’ve been a lot more confident and outgoing. Just small things like smiling at people when I walk by them, striking up a conversation with a random person at a bar, etc. I’ve noticed when I’m out more people, guys and girls, will sit and talk to me. Often if I meet someone who’s a friend of a friend for the first time I’ll end up talking to them for quite a while, whereas before they’d usually probably not want to talk to me and just walk away.

I guess what I’m saying, and what’s helped me is to slowly build up little habits that make you feel a little better about yourself. A couple of years ago I was so fucking depressed that I skipped basically a full semester of college cause I couldn’t get out my bed for class, which just made me feel like a more pathetic piece of shit. Its not easy to get out of a loop like that, and sometimes it really does seem impossible. People will say shit like ‘hit the gym, be more confident, etc.’ as if that’s some kind of cure and as if it’s that easy to change overnight. But the truth is that building up to that is a massive hurdle. I could not have had a regular gym routine a couple of years ago. I could not have talked to that girl last night and made her laugh for as long as I did, and I couldn’t have put in effort to read everyday or even had a fucking skincare routine. I was just too damn depressed.

I find that doing something small and building from there is best. Maybe something as simple as making sure you shower every single day no matter what,  aiming to buy a set amount of new clothes by some date, or even forcing yourself out of the house one night when you don’t want to. Just do something you can look back on and be proud of for getting done, no matter how small, and slowly build from there. People begin to notice somehow, as weird as it sounds, and having people be more positive towards you will in turn give you a big boost to want to keep going and step things up even more. It sounds like bullshit, but really I think just taking baby steps each day to trying to be a little better eventually helps you way more than you imagine it would.
