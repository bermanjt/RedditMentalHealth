3,"So a little bit of background... I was in an abusive relationship with my ex for around 6 1/2 years. I finally broke up with him “for good” about 2 years ago, and moved 400 miles away from our hometown 8 months ago. During our relationship, I dealt with abuse that was verbal, emotional, and physical and it really impacted my self-esteem and my identity as an individual. I thought that freeing myself from that toxic situation would be so liberating; I thought I would feel this sense of elation and be unwaveringly strong and happy afterwards. 

So far, I have felt the opposite and I don’t know why. I’ve made positive improvements to my life- I’ve gone back to school, rented out my own apartment by myself for the first time ever, and am making new friends that are MY friends and not just people in my ex’s social circle. I’ve even started dating someone I’ve been good friends with for a long time, and for the first time EVER I also feel like I’m finally in a healthy, loving relationship with someone who respects me and values me. 

So then... WHY do I feel like a shell of my former self. I’m paranoid and depressed every day of my life. I’m constantly in a state of fear and anxiety and I don’t know why. I escaped the hell I was in before, so why do I feel like I’m still in it? Even years later? Why do I second-guess every move I make, and question the intentions of my friends and everyone around me? Has anyone else ever been in this situation before and felt the same way? 
I know I should probably go to therapy. I don’t know why I even wrote this. I’m a very private person and having my personal problems online for everyone to see terrifies me but oh well...

I realized I'm incredibly sensible to the amount of sleep I get. 

The previous night, after a physically tiring day, I managed to get barely 6 or 7 hours (I'm 22 btw) before being mistakenly woken up by my mother. Woke up groggy and very pissed off, and the whole day passed by like that, feeling costantly tired and accomplishing nothing. 

Now I'm just waking up. Even though I always wake up in the middle of the night almost once to urinate, and this morning it happened too, I just overslept a couple hours more and now I feel much better in terms of mood that it seems crazy. Well I hope this good mood lasts for long. 

When it comes to the amount of sleep I have to get, I become incredibly anxious. It's been several months, maybe a year, that falling asleep has become more difficult because I overthink about it, especially if I know that I need it (e.g.: going to the gym and need to wake up early the next day) 

Probably it's due to information overload, all those articles talking about the paramount importance of resting and sleep for recovery, growth, memory, hormones, mood, etc. made me so anxious that I can't fall asleep naturally anymore.

25,"Got a japanese masturbator sex toy. (turns out my dick was a bit weird: The foreskin was too tight and didn't open or retract enough to get over the head of my dick. I found out something was wrong when it got stuck halfway around the head during my first time having sex without a condom. It was excruciating and was in pain for days...)

So I brought this rubber vagina into the shower, lubed it up and went to town. I felt pain immediately, pulled out and seen my dick head swollen and being strangled by the foreskin. Freaked out. Erection faded and I easily worked the skin back overtop. That was terrifying and exciting. I could barely touch the skin under it without freezing up and squirming. So after that scare I tried again. I'm no quitter, I used a lot more lube and figured I'd let it happen, and just push through the pain and once I cum It'll be good and I'll be able to fix the skin after. I did just that, the skin settled around the base not exactly comfortable, but I was happily stroking the male masturbator away with chills racing down my back for each pump. I came and started convulsing intensely through my whole body, couldn't even bend my legs. It took something like 10 seconds before I moved my hand to take this thing off my dick and I send chills racing through my body freezing me in my spot with every inch. I came again while doing it. Never in my life has cumming felt that good. I calmed down after and was able to finish inching it off with chills still shooting down my back each time. Then I fixed my dick, Cleaned out the rubber pussy, and used it 2 more times that day.

Fuck. I googled things like ""Why does masturbating bring me little to no pleasure"" before.

It's like I'm discovering my dick for the first time and I'm in my mid twenties.

36,"Posting this here as I was told this would be the appropriate subreddit.


To give you a bit of background on me: I’m 26 years old. I have a stable full time job at a well known company earning 68k a year. I am graduating from a well known engineering school next month. I am perfectly healthy, I have an extremely loving family whom I live with, I’m not the most sociable guy in the world but I have a few friends whom I enjoy hanging out with. Now I am not bragging about what I have or don’t have. I am just giving you guys a clear look at my current life situation. 


With that being said, as of a few months ago I cannot help but feel empty/sad. Sometimes it comes in short waves. Sometimes it’s for a whole day or two. I’ve been trying to figure out why I feel this way. One thing I have noticed is I mostly feel this way when I am home and not doing anything or I don’t have any plans for the day. I feel like the world is moving on and I’m not doing anything with my life. I feel that there are people out there enjoying their lives doing fun things meanwhile I’m stuck indoors, bored and alone. For this reason I have began putting a TON of effort to always have plans for the weekend and because of this, I have started drinking more due to most weekend plans with friends usually involve alcohol. I’m honestly not proud that I’ve been drinking a lot more than usual considering before this I only drank occasionally and not every weekend.


Before all of this I used to be okay with relaxing at home and watch tv or play video games. I can’t bring myself to do that anymore. I also used to be very passionate about cars. Loved working on my car and just driving. Now I have zero motivation to even pick up a wrench. It’s very upsetting to me knowing that the one thing I always counted on to get my mind off of any problems I might have, no longer brings me happiness. 


In terms of relationships, my last relationship was of two years with a really great girl. We broke it off 8 months ago. It hit me hard at first like break ups usually do. And then I eventually learned to accept it. I started dating again, meeting new girls. It was fun for a bit but I’m getting bored of meeting new people hoping to have some sort of connection. I also need to mention I ran into my ex gf a few weeks back. It was very unexpected, but when we saw each other things weren’t as awkward or tension filled as I expected it to. We began texting after that and things have been going smoothly. Mostly texting as friends. But we did meet up and had a talk about what happened with us and things got a bit emotional. I don’t know if we are going to try again or if we are going to just stay friends. I guess that is something only time will tell. I also don’t think that her being back in the picture is what’s causing me these feelings as I have felt this way before she was back.



I really don’t know what it could be. I have been tossing around the idea of seeing a therapist. But at the same time I feel silly doing so. I feel like there are tons of people out there with much worse/serious problems than I have. I feel that this is something I just have to grow a pair and learn to stop feeling sad for myself. I’m not sure. I feel stuck right now. 


tl;dr: I cannot get over this feeling of emptiness/sadness. I don’t feel that I am missing anything in my life, yet I am empty. I lost motivation to do things I loved to do, I’ve started picking up bad habits (drinking), I don’t feel genuinely happy with my life even though I know I should.

37,"I'm 22 and moved out at 18. I had a lot of mental health issues growing up and it's only in the last few years I feel I've become myself

A lot of what contributed to my issues was growing up with a lot of conflict. My parents had a messy divorce when I was 8 and I don't remember much before the age of 12/13ish. I'm told it was lots of screaming and shouting. My mother then hit the bottle and was often verbally abusive. I put her to bed enough times as a child while my brother  was AWOL. She's a toxic person. 

Since I moved out we've been in the routine of speaking on the phone each Sunday. These chats last about half an hour and she bitches about her life for all but five minutes, asks what's going on in my life so I keep it short since I'm fed up of going ""yep, yep, uh huh"" and she goes ""okay well if you have no news I'll leave you to it. I love you, god bless!"" And I bury my hatred and say I love her too. If I don't call she will call me and I'll get a passive aggressive ""I was expecting to hear from you by now"". It's 17:15 on a Sunday and I just don't have the energy to speak to her. I want to cut her out of my life but she doesn't know I despise her and doesn't/won't recognise how much she hurt me when I was young. I'm extremely conflict adverse due to my upbringing and cry and shake whenever anyone gets angry so I can't tell her. All I want is to say ""I think you're a bad influence in my life, you're a reminder of everything I've worked to overcome and I'm done""  

A close friend has a similar mother and we stayed up talking one night and realised we've achieved what we have despite our upbringing, not because of our upbringing. It sickens us that they only care about us when it comes to taking credit in our achievements and we owe them nothing. 

I guess now I'm thinking about it I want to vent and give some background 

When I was fifteen she told me she would always be proud of me unless I was gay, pregnant or on drugs. Predicably she took it very badly when I came out two years ago. My 25 year old stoner brother who still lives at home is the golden boy because he's straight and gender conforming. 

She turned me against my father and his whole side of his family. She didn't stop me seeing him but she could never say his name in a neutral tone and it was always ""*your father* is x y z *your father* doesn't do X y z and I do so much"". While he wasn't perfect back in the dark days he's a good guy and it's only now as an adult I'm beginning to build a relationship with him and learning to trust him. Two weeks ago I attended his wedding and I cried during the ceremony because I was just so happy. My stepmother is wonderful and I find myself wishing I grew up with her as my mother. She's so kind, intelligent, understanding, and patient. I get overwhelmed/tired out in social situations a lot and even while I don't know her that well she'll always give me time to slip away for half an hour or so or make excuses for me if I want to sit upstairs for a bit. 

When I was 15 I was suicidal and self harming multiple times a day. I finally told my mum and begged and pleaded with her to get me help. She refused and then used my issues against me calling it a ""blip"" that I needed to get over and wasn't I thinking about what it was doing to her? I clearly remember her telling a story of being a bit nervous on the very steep and long escalators they have on the tube and saying ""you just have to get on with it and stop being weak""

She can never admit fault and can hold a grudge like nobody I've ever met. For example I had to bring my vaccine records to an occupational health check ahead of my course. It turns out I was missing loads (I had my final MMR booster at the age of 19 after a doctor noticed I didn't have it and asked if I wanted to make an appointment for it). I mentioned to her and she was immediately furious saying ""I brought you to all your appointments, the records are wrong"" 

I walked on a broken ankle for three days before she believed me. I was 7 and in tears every time I tried to walk. Fortunately we were visiting grandparents at the time and my granny forced her to bring me to hospital 

With her you're fucked no matter what. My brother and I didn't tell her about my dad getting married and when he let it slip I got it in the neck. If you tell her stuff she doesn't want to hear she will be angry but if you keep it from her she'll be angry you didn't tell her. She's still not over my dad, not in the sense that she pines for him, but that she's still furious. From a drunk chat I once had with my dad it seems like it all came to a head when she was trying to change the locks on her tenants and it was the final straw for my dad and he was done with the bitterness. My entire life I believed he was a bastard and hated him. I almost changed my name to my mother's maiden name as a teenager. Funny how the tables have turned now I see clearly. 

The list goes on and on. I wish I was strong enough to break ties. It's just the thought of opening that box is exhausting.

There’s always a bit of sadness after you finish a big group effort like this but since I’m a senior without another show to look forward to next year this was different somehow. 


During our pre show traditions I just walked over to my best friend who played Bert and we both just broke down and started crying our eyes out. There was this heavy sense of bittersweet impending doom hanging over the whole thing but when the last show started none of that mattered, we just had to do our jobs.


The actors have an earlier call time than the band so when they went to go get ready I went the band room and just broke down. There are so many wonderful experiences I’ve had in this room alone, and pretty soon I’ll never again walk the halls as a member of our band family.


This girl who’s the stage manager of the show this year walked in to get something and saw me and said something I’ll don’t think I’ll forget for a long time.


“Shit John, don’t be sad. This is just the beginning of our lives”.


I teared up a few times during the more emotional numbers but I just lost it again during the last sung line of the show that Mary Poppins delivers.

So I'm a college senior geek. Always buried in books. About 5'7. Slightly chubby ""hits the books but never the gym"" belly.

I was finally dragged out to a party. ""Come on, you never had fun your ENTIRE college career. Celebrate!"" said my friend Wendy.

I ended up somehow playing a game of beer pong and was randomly matched up with an attractive female rugby player.

I wasn't exactly good at all. Finding myself quickly down 0-7.

Then she spoke up ""Hey virgin boy, you ready to feel the breeze on that bare ass?""

I blushed as people chuckled around me.

""Excuse me?""

""House rules. You get shut out. You run all the way around the block...hehehe...NAKED.""

I gulped as everyone laughed at my reaction.

In a panic now imagining my lily-white-from-the-neck-down-body exposed, I also air-balled the next 3 cups and began sheepishly unbuttoning my shirt.

I went home, slightly sneezing that night from a cold, but thought, whatever, I'll never see these people again.

Then I got an email from Wendy, subject ""LOL"" with a link to that girl's Instagram page.

There I am, in mid-run, from behind, head turned towards the camera with a wide-eyed, open-mouthed look on my face.

Instantly, as I am halfway across the street going 15-20 MPH, this guy comes from my right, doesn't even stop, and immediately turns right in front of me going the direction I am going. I honked my horn and since I was in an area with buildings on both sides, my horn echoes off of them, and since this guy had his window down, there should have been no reason he shouldn't have heard me. When he didn't stop, I had to slam on my brakes right out in the middle of the street to avoid hitting him and doing serious damage to his vehicle.

Some things I've heard include (paraphrased, can't remember exactly) people saying their job causes them some physical issues but they have to keep doing it or else they won't get paid (severe muscle knots and having thrown out their back quite a lot at the age of 39, as I recall); being in a job where they abuse the definition or lack thereof of your position to layer on more and more tasks until you're doing three or four times the work for the same pay; getting randomly kicked out of your house by your landlord/landlady and having to scramble like hell or be homeless; being called into work suddenly/randomly and needing to be there ASAP or else; et cetera. As far as good things I've heard about adult life, umm... you can buy alcohol? That's literally the only thing I can think of as I type this.

Is this really how adult life works, where work demands ridiculous amounts of you for little to no return, and even then everything can be upended in an instant for no way that could have possibly been predicted or prevented?

47,"Even after starting CPAP for my sleep apnea, which I thought would yield a treasure of the stuff that's been missing from my life for years, between my ass hurting in ANY chair i sit in because of my tailbone, my tinnitus, and this crushing fatigue right now because now with CPAP i can't sleep past 8-9AM in the morning so if i go to bed at 2 i'm just FUCKED the next day, I can't sit and write. Writing is the only way i'll escape my terrible job and I just can't do it because i can't concentrate. 

I hate this. I hate it so much. Why can't i have my laser focus back? Why do i have to sit here with my eyes literally glazing over from boredom as I write this post? What the hell is wrong with me?",29Apr2018,2
48,"So I’ve gone on a few dates with this girl and I’m kinda new at this whole thing (never really dated anyone before) and in conversation I’ll make a dumb joke or a self-deprecating joke or just say something that makes me look like an idiot and the day after I’ll just find myself regretting saying all those things and wishing I hadn’t. It still seems like she likes me and all so that’s a good thing, but I was just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to avoid dwelling on this or saying these things in the first place?",29Apr2018,1
49,"Me and my girlfriend both have access to eachother accounts and sometimes I see her dms pop up on the top of the screen and one of her friends sent this thing saying goodbye and stuff, and it wasn’t unique to each person it was literally a copy and paste for a whole bunch of people. Like this person was scaring me too like damn, making it sound like they ALREADY slit their own throat or some shit. Saying they lost use of their vocal cords (remember this) and their arm went numb. I checked every time she already read a message so I wouldn’t read the other persons, and this dude said they wouldn’t do it. Like, what the fuck??? THEN THEY WENT ALL “hey wanna   talk on discord” LIKE IF MY DEPRESSED ASS DID SOMETHING I WOULD SLAP THE SHIT OUT THIS DUDES DEPRESSED ASS. LIKE DONT SCARE PEOPLE LIKE THAT BRO. Either way I don’t like people faking suicide. Because I always told someone that I was gonna do it and it fucks with people man, and honestly every time I was just so depressed, but this man went far enough to say all that stuff and that just makes me mad. But I guess they’re alive so that’s great.",29Apr2018,1
