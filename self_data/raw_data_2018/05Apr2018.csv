3,"I wanted to get everyone's opinion on something I haven't been able to shake.  I apologize for the lengthiness of this ahead of time, but I'm so perturbed about it I realized screw it, go big or go home.

I finally met a wonderful guy (yay!) in mid November 2017. He's SO kind that I almost disqualified him at the beginning because his niceness came off as overly strong, that I questioned how genuine it was.   With time, I came to see he comes from a very religious family, his father's a pastor, and the warmth he radiated was a byproduct of how he was raised. 

So things were and continue to be amazing but we had a tiff at the end of December and I can't seem to shake it even now, months later, EVEN with the help of my therapist. Here goes...

At the end of Dec he was with me late one night when he stepped away and left his phone behind. When it rang and a girl's picture popped up, I picked up. (Some background: he later explained before he met me, this girl and he had 1 date, they didn't even kiss, and they decided to be just friends and he tried to be a good example for her kids since they had poor father figures - I figured that's understandable).  At the time, he was constantly telling me I was the only girl he was seeing so I was weirded out a girl was calling him so late at night. 

While he was away I looked in their texts and noticed he saw her for Thanksgiving as friends to be supportive of her sons who were asking if he'd come (which he never told me because he said he didn't want to scare me off so early into dating). As I kept reading the texts, I guess this girl invited him to her Christmas party also and her boys and family were asking about him. He replied, ""Wow that's awesome they all want me to join! I'll let you know!""  I guess their wires got crossed - he meant he'd let her know whether could make it or not. But apparently, she took it as him confirming he'd go, but that he'd let her know the details, what time, etc. 

Her Christmas party rolls around and he last minute asked if he and I could spend it together (we were still kinda new at this pt, only 1 month into dating). I agreed. In the meantime this girl texted asking what time he'd be there, but he didn't reply. Following day when she asked why he didn't reply/show, instead of sharing that he was saw me, he made up a story how he got stuck driving someone to the airport then followed with ""I wanted to see you more than anything."" 

At this point I royally freaked out and he said the reason he made up the story about driving to the airport was because now that it looked like he committed to attending, it'd be easier to  come up with some urgent non negotiable reason why he couldn't make it (rather than look like a jerk that ditched last minute for something else that popped up without giving any notice). Again understandable. 

I do buy the story because when the girl called, she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever, she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there, which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment.

For the most part all of the above I can relate to and empathize with. I don't believe he and this girl had a thing. What I can't seem to shake is him texting her, ""I wanted to see you more than anything"" He claims that he meant it as ""Don't think I was ditching you and your boys and didn't want to see you, I wanted to see you more than anything"" way to soften the blow because he was, in fact, ditching her. 

But no matter what angle I try to look at this from I can't help but think that phrase is romantic in nature and you don't say that to ""just a platonic friend"". Even 4 months later I still can't help but feel that was unacceptable and that's only something you say to your partner. It regularly floats around my mind that he said this to her. When people say how emotional cheating is wrong, this must be the feeling they're referring to.

Anyway I was wondering if any of you had a take on this? I've been in therapy about this and I feel better for an hour, then I fall back into feeling betrayed. I feel as though I'd been cheated on and continuing this relationship means I am accepting a cheater. I realize how crazy this sounds, but I have to be honest with the feelings this is arising me. What I don't know is this stirring up some childhood wounds? Or is this my gut telling me this was micro cheating or emotional cheating? 


A couple things to keep in mind: 
1) I have a similar issue with almost every guy I date. Something happens related to an ex or another girl, and I fixate on it the rest of the relationship. I am in therapy for this (4 years) and it's gotten significantly better but I felt it important to bring up my history

2) Boyfriend is a SUPER nice guy and very vocal about it everywhere we go to randoms. Again, I distrusted him he was so nice at first. He looks for opportunities to help people - where he can do CPR for older people collapsing, etc.  Example:  He lives in WI, I live in IL yet he drives 2 hours to see me, no questions asked, and gets a hotel every weekend so we can see each other regularly. Another example: After he met my friends the first time he wrote them ""I am so grateful I met this amazing woman and now have all these amazing friends. I just really love you guys!"" (My friends thought this was weirdly forward lol) Another example: he was married to a girl who had Lyme disease. They were not intimate once during the decade long marriage, he was strictly caretaker and said that's what you do for someone you love. She eventually cheated on him (he still remained faithful) and the distrust ended the marriage. 

3) He doesn't hide anything from me. He has our picture as his FB default, he regularly posts announcing how happy I make him (to the point this girl deleted him), he never hides his phone - he'll leave it in plain sight when he goes to take a shower and tells me if I want to go through it I may. (Aside from the above when I scoured it and found nothing else, I don't because I don't want to misinterpret things). 

4) No idea if this is relevant but he told me he was exclusive with me since our first date (Nov 17), But we didn't make it official til Dec 23.

5) My therapist heard both our sides of the story, she said she sees nothing wrong with it, that he said that to her without knowing the girl's hidden motives (she was probably keeping him on the backburner based on her emotional reaction to all this) She also said it made sense he did it to to alleviate the guilt he felt with letting down her sons and he did so with the intent of me never seeing it (not gona lie that made me feel worse). She tells me I need to stop intellectualizing to escape deeper hurt and instead focus on the earliest childhood memory of this. I try and usually fail, I feel better for an hour, then revert back to the feelings of betrayal.

6) When boyfriend and I discussed it right when it happened, he claims he never wanted to be with her, he was just being nice combined with that being ""just how he talks"" (to be frank he does throw the phrase ""more than anything"" around a lot in his daily speech).

TLDR My boyfriend bailed on a female friend's (who he went on 1 date with before meeting me but remained friends) Christmas party and blew her off to instead hang out with me. She reached out and asked why he didn't show, he fibbed he had to drive to the airport because he felt it was rude to flake/blow her and her kids off and texted her, ""I wanted to see you more than anything"" to 'soften the blow,  as if to say...don't think I didn't want to see you guys, I wanted to see you more than anything'
^ his words. 4 months later and I feel this was sort of micro/emotional cheating and still feel betrayed and can't distinguish if this is my gut warning me vs stirring up childhood wounds. Also can't distinguish if this was him being an overly nice guy or flirting.",05Apr2018,1
5,"So first of all, I love my job. But teaching ESL/EFL can be rough with certain topics. I tried to set up a discussion from one of the topics I found on r/science regarding social thinking. We got to the topic of ‘entitlement’ and boyyyy was it a challenge to both explain and discuss. It’s a new topic for me to talk about so it makes sense...

I just felt like we didn’t get far in a 1.5 hour class and maybe they felt bad because they didn’t totally get it. I hate for them to feel bad because of my failure.

7,"Just watched it for the first time, going in blind.

I don't think it was bad, but it could have been more. I understood it was horror, for the first nine minutes I did find it horrifying. The bit of text at the start about government nuclear tests, the montage of nuclear basts while ""More and More"" plays, spliced with shots of mutated babies as this droning, oppressive sound becomes more and more apparent. There's a mounting sense of dread. The scene of the hazmat crew out in the desert getting attacked by the mutant, the guy at the gas station. All very, very creepy.

By far, I found the nuclear blast montage with the shots of mutated victims to be the scariest part of the movie. Maybe it's just my own biases, but I find the sheer destructive force of nuclear weaponry and the insidious fallout of its usage to be terrifying, along with the way how radiation just lingers so long and saturates everything.

I thought the movie would hone in on this sense, but instead it seemed to rely more on the shock factor of violence, rape (which I totally think that scene gets overhyped as ""disturbing"" here on Reddit), and gore. I think exploring the concepts of mutation and the degradation of human beings would have been better. I wanted to know more about the mutants. 

Now, the movie did have some things that really worked for it. For one, I love the isolation and hopelessness of the setting and situation. Two, the practical and special effects were always good and I like that the mutants were much like real world mutation in their appearance.

I dunno, maybe I was looking for the wrong thing from this movie after the first few minutes. It was a good movie, I enjoyed it, but I definitely feel a lot more could have been done with the concept. And it got a little too hopeful for me towards the end. I think a *The Mist* style ending would have been better.

Sorry for the very disjointed sentence/paragraph structure, just writing down the thoughts as they come to me.",05Apr2018,6

Last night I did something I’ve never done before. I prayed for my boyfriend to be happier again, and for the next day to be good and it actually was good. 

My band director is usually an asshole during ensemble but today he was happy and we got through the final movement of a professional level composition for the first time, and on the first try. 

Around Christmas said boyfriend got pretty sick and lost 10 pounds during December. Today he reweighed himself and he finally gained back the weight since then plus some and he’s back into the normal BMI range, that made me very happy. I’ve been not so subtly giving him snacks he loves and that’s what I think helped him gain the weight back. Plus recently he’s been eating a lot more than normal, maybe a little too much, but it’s pretty hard for him to gain weight so that makes me a bit happy too. He was never anorexic, but his metabolism has always been fast and I think it’s starting to slow down. It’s nice to see his body frame slowly fill out.

I hope every day gets a little better from now on, but I’m afraid they won’t and tomorrow will be bad like normal. And even though today was good I’ve been writing this out and still feel a little sad. I don’t know why I’m sad, I should be happier right now. ",05Apr2018,5
13,"Here's a thing I find quite weird in my class. I'd be happy if you share any weird or humorous experience of yours.

I'm Vietnamese and recently, we are studying some Vietnamese literature. A few days ago our teacher taught us a text from a story called ""Những ngôi sao xa xôi"" ( The distant stars), which was written by a female author. Basically, the text is about 3 female youth volunteers whose worked was to detonate the unexploded falling bombs thown by American soldiers. (Just so you know, the time the story happened was when Vietnamese-Ameracan war took place). Quite a job, right?

At some points of the story, the protagonist Phương Định (a girl, of course) told about her 2 other volunteers, about how they were different, about the difficulties they had, about the Vietnamese soldiers with stars on their hats- whom she admired and liked best. Overall, it depicted how different people with different circumstances dedicated their lives to protecting the country. 

I have no problem with that. The point is , at a part of the story, the girl said that "" I'm a 'Hanoi' lady ( 'Hanoi' ladies at that time were very proud of themselves for being standardly elegant). Honestly, I'm a quite good-looking girl. Two thick braided hair, a little soft, a high neck, prideful as a lily's calyx.'' The next paragraph, she talked about how she was liked by the gunners and drivers for not being gushing like the other girls with a little I-am-different-from-these-boring-girls way of saying. At least, I see it. ''But it is just that I give myself fine airs. Actually in my mind, the most handsome, intelligent and noble are those who wear uniforms, with a star on his hat.''

My teacher explained:'' Some former students wrote on their paper tests that Phương Định is a very arrogant girl...''. (Well, isn't it right?)  ''But actually, she is not.'' (How teacher??) ''Because she said that she  just 'gives herself fine airs', the truth is, the ones she admired most was the star-having-on-hats men.'' ( Uh, I'm fucking lost)

It was a mind-fucked time for me trying to find connection on this explanation. I haven't understood it yet. Can anyone explain it to me? (If it has). I didn't ask my teacher back.

Also, any comments? Any comment or story is wonderfully welcome. Thank you.

18,"Did not know where else to post this and really wanted to post it. 

My new neighbors are VERY STRANGE. 

We’re a pretty tight community so when they moved in we had a small party for them with the other people on the block so they could get to know everybody. 

They were incredibly... awkward isn’t the word. Kind of confused, I guess, by general questions like “So where’d you live before this?” Or “What line of work are you in?” Or even “You want a ham sandwich or PBJ?” They looked kind of offended like the questions were totally out of left field  and answered matter of factly, not in any way that stimulated conversation. 

Which is why I was not surprised to hear they’d been living in the wilderness. Not in a cabin or anything like that, they had just been living outdoors. 

They have three kids, all really a slip of a thing. Immediate bells and whistles went off when they started stuffing themselves at the party like they’d been wandering through a desert. 

The wife started to loosen up and we learned they’d lived in the woods and her sister called CPS and they demanded they have a stable (indoors) home life or they’d lose the kids (who were being homeschooled but based on the parents’ description I do not know to what degree of reality that was.)  

So they went from under sharing to extreme over sharing in conversation. 

They own a pretty decent house (do not have the first idea how they bought it), and they still all sleep outside. You can see them out there, just laying there, flat, with their eyes shut. No blankets no pillows not even a sleeping mat. 

One of our kind neighbors came and asked if they needed money to buy mattresses and they basically snapped at her to mind her business. 

I think the kids malnourishment was a result of their foraging and hunting for all their own food ineffectively  rather than any sort of deprivation, the parents are gaunt too.  

We brought over food the first few days, thinking maybe they didn’t have the money for transportation to the grocery store (it would be a three mile walk to get to a store and there isn’t very accessible public transport in our immediate area.) They ate what we brought and didn’t stop the kids from eating it. 

They’ve planted a ton of stuff, but not in any way that suggests they actually know anything about the land. They’re just plants scattered all over, and some aren’t even seasonally appropriate. 

I’ve been trying to keep a close eye on how their kids are doing. At the same time, though, I don’t let their kids come by to play with mine. If there is something wrong with them, I don’t need my grandkids to be the first to find out exactly what it is. 

One friend had the kids over right at the beginning and said all they wanted to do was dig holes in the yard with their hands, and she couldn’t get them to stop. To distract them from that  she brought out a snack (bananas) and the kids bit right into it without unpeeling it. She asked them if they’d ever had bananas before and they said yes, so... 

There’s nothing clearly abusive at this point. It’s just **very** strange. 

I don’t know what their deal is. I have never seen them leave for work. They do go out sometimes but not at any consistent times. I’ve been checking the locks on all my windows every night and I’ve taken a pause on letting my grandkids go off in the neighborhood by themselves until I get a better sense of what’s going on with these people. Not because I expect something, but because I don’t know what to expect. 

**tl;dr my new neighbors come from living in the woods without shelter for an indeterminate period of time and are notably socially off. I never see them going to work and they’ve planted a random array of fruits and vegetables, half of which will never grow in this climate. They sleep in the yard without a blanket or pillows, not in a tent. They just lie down outside. I’m uncomfortable, to say the least.** ",05Apr2018,645

Or worse still. My post will be automatically deleted and a bot will send me a instant mail kindly (or not so) letting me know that I have hit strike one, and two more will ban me from the sub altogether.

Fantastic. 

I know rules need to be in place or all hell would break loose. Of course I am not talking about posting completely irrelevant crap to a niche sub. Or posting a link to a sketchy virus-riddled website.

But for God's sake if I am posting something that is genuinely mildly interesting to a sub dedicated specifically to posts of that nature (not to name names, I wouldn't want this to be removed would I?), why do I have to jump through 450 hoops to satisfy the regime that is the subreddits rules?

No screenshots. Great. OK so the world can miss out on my very mildy (un) interesting crap because of rule 4aiii sub section iv.

I don't get it. Why don't they gain weight? Do they really just have a metabolism of steel? I feel like if their metabolism was that amazing, they'd be very very skinny. But they're not. They have bodies of athletes yet they are couch potatoes. Like I'm talking a Netflix binging, potato chip munching life.. yet.. they're gifted.

What gives? If I eat junk, my body looks like junk. How come I can't be given **the gift**?",05Apr2018,10
41," I'm posting this for myself and in hopes that someone in my position will see what I see.

 We've been together going on 9 years. He loves me so much. He means the world to me. We're best friends!

 Recently, I've gotten too comfortable. I had some health issues which effected my energy and ability to function, and as a result, I stopped dressing nice, stopped cutting my hair, stopped doing my nails, stopped wearing makeup, stopped wearing jewelry, and gained 50lbs.

 I know I know.. It's fucking terrible. I see it just like you do. Well, now I do. I didn't a few weeks ago.

 I honestly thought it was ok. I thought it was ok that I stopped doing those things 'because he still loves me'.

 Well I've come to my senses. I don't want to go into detail, but I had a wake-up call, cried for 2 days and now I'm very motivated.

 Moral of the story.. 

 Just because you totally have them, and they love you to the end of the world, doesn't mean you should stop doing all the extra things you did when you were hoping to make them yours.

 I sincerely apologized to him for this, and as soon as I heal from my recent surgery, I'm going to the gym. I have been on a diet, but as of last week, I'm making my diet more strict.

 I'm not going to let this happen any longer.",05Apr2018,2

within your pack a carried weight  
as if the good could be a wheel  
from and to its self be real

from dust to dust, from ash to ash  
that within you will not last  
open up, accept the world  
be beyond your narrow core

from start to end, the whole is vast  
a billion times your short lived past  
forget your hope of being all

43,"I dont even know where to start. Life is rushing at me faster than Ive ever been prepared to deal with. Every time ive tried to find a job ive had a meltdown into an anxious mess. Ive put it off too long. Whether or not I have a job, I wont have a home soon. I have no family or friends to stay with. I dont know what I can do. 

I dont want to give the full details publicly. Ive got a lot of mental health issues. Depression. Anxiety. Autism. Any time something becomes overwhelming, I shut down and quit responding to my surroundings. It's not something I can stop or control but no one understands what i'm dealing with. 

I've finally worked myself up to seek help from a local nonprofit, but the same day I ask to get a ride there is the day I get the notice. I have no life experience. People have always done stuff for me and dealt with this issues. I am completely lost and it's taking everything I have to stay out of bed right now. 

I dont know why I'm posting this here. I just need someone to hear this. I have no friends to turn to right now. ",05Apr2018,9
44,"So we are talking about Aristotle's idea of God, and his reasoning as to why there is no force moving God as God moves the rest of the universe (he is trying to argue that infinite regression doesn't exist). What he says is that something can cause an action without doing anything. For example, as my professor today said to the class:

P: ""What did they have at commons (the place that serves food) today?""

Random student: ""They had cheese steaks.""

P: ""Cheese steaks? Okay. Now Aristotle argued the following: why did you get up to walk to commons? Because you wanted a cheese steak. So the cheese steak actually caused you to move without doing anything. This is what Aristotle thought about God - the stars, planets, and sun are all trying to be perfect like God, so they are moving indefinitely because nothing in the physical world can ever attain perfection. The heavenly bodies are moving because of God. God is the cheese steak of the universe.""

There you have it, folks. Just a funny story I thought I'd share.",05Apr2018,27
