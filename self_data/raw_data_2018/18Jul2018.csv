10,"Over the past two years I began to realize I am a manipulative person. I knew earlier that I \_was\_ a manipulative person. It is easy to realize that; all you have to is admit you were wrong in the past. It is wholly different to count up the number of times you have dismissed the flaws of your past as the past and accept that they are not the only in the past, but also in the present and even the future.

Because people generally do not share their uncomfortable internal reflections I do not know how my sins in personal life weigh against any standard. I have never physically hurt anyone, cheated on anyone, or intervened in anyone's life around their back. However I have withheld my sincere intents in important conversations in intimate relationships and misrepresented the conclusions I wanted others to reach as expected, imperative, or costly to deviate from in order to persuade them to make a certain life decision such as

\* Persuading a girlfriend to move to a certain city with me by making the argument that it was in her interests when I honestly didn't know if it was.

\* Continuing to sleep with someone who didn't want to commit to a relationship, withholding that I wanted to be in a relationship, hoping they would come around.

\* Pressuring my high school girlfriend to defy her family and indirectly her own interests when they forbid us to travel together after graduation, which was hypocritically easy for me because I did not have a close family relationship, and did not depend on them emotionally and financially as she did.

I feel confused about the impulse to throw in statements like ""I want to clarify I have never pressured anyone into having sex with me"" because I fear people will assume that based on how ambiguous my descriptions are and how self loathing my tone is, but if I were genuinely so self loathing would I care if people made those assumptions? I think I believe somewhere, beneath the self loathing, that these sins fall within a range of not acceptable behavior, but behavior that isn't as far from the population mean as it can sometimes feel without knowing anyone else's life. Maybe I know that better than I actually let on and this post isn't self loathing at all. Maybe it's arrogant and grandiose.

I've wanted someone I was a manipulative partner to to hit me up for years. I don't talk to them, I just hope and daydream. But I know they know better now. We were young and naive together and I got away with a lot that experienced people don't buy. I am ashamed when I think of her and in part I think I wish for her to talk to me because then I would know she hasn't been harboring some disgust for me this whole time. We broke up amicably but over time my estimation of her impression of me has gotten worse and worse, which frankly is odd thing to be concerned about, but I know she is honest, and somehow my mind as appointed her the arbiter of whether this shit is just in my head or very real and we haven't spoken since the day we split so the simulations in my head continue.

On a bright note, I would like to share that as I have realized this flaw I have made small but material progress. Now I try to recognize what my intentions are and state them plainly in the beginning if it is possible I might make an attempt to persuade a partner or friend. I came across another situation where a partner was deciding where to move last year and I began my response by saying ""I want you to come to the conclusion that city x is the best place for you because I'd like to be together in city x so I will send you positive propaganda about that city even though I don't know what's best for you"" where in the past I said ""City x will probably have more jobs in your field than city y, yeah?"" even though I had no idea.

I am proud of this change I have made to my personality and I am optimistic I can become better to those around me and form healthier more fulfilling relationships with greater respect for each party's independence.

That's it again, the warm, inviting belief that it's in the past and not the present or future. If I relax and assume these instincts of mine to manipulate others have somehow passed, I will sink back into the casual practice of painting realities convenient for me unrestrained by what's true or known. This is something I have to remember to watch, all the time. Slowly, maybe, the habits will die, but not easily and not shortly.

I think that being older, in my mid twenties now, makes it easier to resist. As a kid it felt like I could just say anything and people would buy it. Adults keep me in check.

Every day, I wake up at 5, get ready for school, drive to class at 5:30 and I have a 3 hour class. I get home, nap for 30min- 1 hour, shower/shave, go to the gym, and another 3 hour class.

16,"Ok I'm sorry for the sort of clickbaity title, but I didn't know what else to put in it. This is also my first post here so I hope it fits - it didn't really fit anywhere else.

Anyway, there is one glaring issue in my life and its causing problems with I think everything I do, and its these two warts on my hands.

I got the first one at least a year ago, since I told no one about it and didn't really notice what it was until a couple months in (I think - the origin of it is really hazy). Even before I realized what it was I used to pick at it in a kind of habit way which is what I'm sure is the cause for it now being twice the size of a normal wart.

This means that I can't really do home treatments with it because it doesn't seem like they would help in the slightest.

I think it is also the cause of the second one, just from transferring the infection over.

I haven't told anyone about these yet and still cover them up with bandaids and stuff, because of how embarrassing it is. Not only that, but since I am a minor I can't go to a dermatologist myself to get help, since it would require my parents.

Even if I did, I am so adverse to pain that just a local anasthetic wouldn't be enough, and I'm not sure that dermatologists will allow you to get knocked out for treatment.

It seems like such a small problem even to me, probably something that with the right help could be solved quickly and easily, but its causing me so much stress and I feel so stuck and helpless and I just wan't to get rid of these warts without anyone knowing.

Maybe I'm just immature or something along those lines... I don't know. All I know is that every time I think about this my gut gets that horrible feeling in it like I said earlier - like its hopeless.

I have decided that I at least need to say this to someone, but because I don't really have any friends, especially ones where I could talk about this to them, I'm just posting it on here.",18Jul2018,2

20,"So I referred my best friend to come work at my company, and she started two weeks ago. I put a bug in my managers ear about her desired pay, which was quite high relatively speaking to the rest of the office. She also had no direct experience in the job, so it was what I'd call ""high"". 

She comes from a corporate company where it was okay to talk about your pay grade. Like just common topic of discussion, like the weather. She's worked there pretty much all her working life. 

We we're cutting the crap today about something the company does to save money and we we're talking about how they probably pay us more to do this task than the money it saves.


That's when my friend busts out, ""Yeah, they pay my (Actual Dollar Amount) per hour for this!!!"" in front of EVERYONE. 

DEAD. Not only is it against company policy, but a lot of people who have been there a long time with more skills don't get paid that much.  Immediately, I shush her, tell her we don't disclose that here.  She's totally confused. She thought it was something you couldn't ask someone else, but you could say it yourself. I say, no, you don't say it at ALL.

Less than a month ago my cousin asked me to take him to the supermarket to do grocery shopping, his car broke down and couldn‚Äôt afford to fix it. So I went pick him and his kids (8, 10 &amp; 14) up and when we were in the supermarket he was telling me how he only had $30 for food until his wife gets paid and how hard is not being able to buy them treats and having to say no constantly. I saw him buy the bare minimum of food and I felt terrible for them. 

I offered to pay for his shopping and told him to just buy whatever he‚Äôd normally buy, that I‚Äôd pay for it so they don‚Äôt go hungry. He replied he couldn‚Äôt accept it because that means he failed as a father and was humiliating for him. 

That same evening he walked over to my house and asked me to lend him 1k to get by until he finds a job. I told him to come the day after for the money. So come the day after and he walks over to my place again, I give him an envelope with the money. He calls a taxi and leaves. I don‚Äôt hear more from him in a few days and doesn‚Äôt reply to my texts.

I go to facebook and see has uploaded pictures of himself doing kitesurf, bragging about joining a 1 week course that costs $600. I go to the kitesurf website to check and the price is correct. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I didn‚Äôt want to be paranoid and judgy and thought there must be some explanation. 

A week later my cousin walks over to my house again, he asks me for another grand. I asked what happened to the grand I lent him and he says he had to use it to fix the car. I caught him in a lie, I went get my phone and showed him a text his wife sent me asking me for money to fix their car because her husband (my cousin) couldn‚Äôt be able to find a job unless he had a car. 

So I told him I saw I saw the facebook pictures and knew he was lying to me. He got all pissed off saying how he‚Äôs a grown ass man and I‚Äôm nobody to tell him how to spend his money. He went on to say how just because he‚Äôs broke doesn‚Äôt mean he can‚Äôt enjoy life and how he deserved a holiday. So I said I won‚Äôt him any money and that he still had $400 left of the grand I lent him, since his kitesurf course was $600, to which he replied Oh well I had to buy a wetsuit and pay for the motel to stay over there‚Äô. 

So he didn‚Äôt use it to feed his kids or pay bills, he just took off to the beach to have a nice week of holidays. Said how he was on me that his family had to go without eating now and left in a fit of rage. 

I feel very sorry for his family, but I have to take care of mine too. His wife is now pestering my wife asking for money saying they haven‚Äôt eaten in days and how selfish we are for not sharing our money with them. My wife offered to buy them groceries but she said she wants money no food, so we have blocked both of them temporarily.

43,"This memory was triggered because I saw something on a death subreddit.

Ever have some questions that need answering but for some reason no one is willing to provide you with them?

I remember when I was a a young teenager around 13-15 years old I met my grandfather for the first time in Guatemala. Now he lived in a dangerous part of the country where not even the government will step in because the gang activity is rampant there. So he had some defenses around and on top of his big (almost mansion sized) home to protect himself if anything should ever happen. 

I did not know this at the time. So while visiting with my mother, father, and sister I decided to muck about on the roof and played with some dogs that where running and jumping across the roofs of peoples homes. A while passed and the dogs go about their journey and I'm left alone and that's when I noticed a few men armed with AKs walking down the street. I hear my name being called and it sounds desperate. So I try to get off the roof and back to my family but I'm taking a path I didn't take earlier. This had metal stairs and it was live.

The moment my hand grabs the handle, what feels a million needles attack my body, I scream like an animal and my vision goes blue. I have no control over my body and this pain is brand new to me and I'm freaking out as I'm trying to tell my body to move... it won't. My vision is fading fast and the world around me turns more and more blue. I look up into the fading sky and as I do the world goes quiet. It's almost peaceful but at the same time I am absolutely terrified as I have no idea I've just been dealt some juicy electricity.

Before my vision goes completely black I see figures standing around me... I do not recognize them... My vision then goes black. I wake up what feels like weeks later in a bed. Vision is still somewhat blue but I am slowly starting to see more colors. As soon as I am able I get off the bed (I was extremely weak) I start to call for my family. No answer. I walk around the home and I find no one. Some time passes and my sister finds me. I ask her where was she and she responds by saying she was in the bathroom. My ass she was... I checked every room and every bathroom in this place and found nothing but a couple roaches. I was alone here but whatever. Sometime passes and our mother, father, and grandpa show up out of nowhere.

 I ask them where they where... they told me they where just beyond this particular door that I have never seen before. Odd but I never really questioned it. Some more time passes after that and its dinner time. Dinner seems oddly silent. I ask what everyone did while I slept and all I got where cold looks and a silent response. No one would tell me what they did but I shrug it off. Bed time comes and off I go to sleep. I slept for what felt like 4 days.

 Once I was up I noticed the home was empty again. I don't care at this point. I then look at the window and see the men armed with AKs again. This time they are heading right for the house.

44,"A legitimate question.

When I was in high school, I got perfect scores on state-mandated tests like the TAKS test (Texas) because we had ALL DAY to complete the test; there was no rush and I could take all the time I wanted. However, I did EXTREMELY poorly on tests with a strict time limit like the SAT and I honestly had no idea why. When I had to do the reading portions, my eyes would look at the words on the page but nothing was making it to my brain. I didn't know what to do since there were so many questions to answer about comprehension from the passage. I guess I just felt overwhelmed and couldn't focus at all to read anything.

The same thing would happen during exams in college. I would do extremely well on homework assignments because I had a wealth of time available to sit down, goof off, and do the problems in very tiny pieces (I got incredibly bored easily). However, come exam time I can't focus and make very low grades on the exams. 

Especially when I'm on the spot doing a presentation, if someone asks a question I'm genuinely always deer-in-the-headlights if the question exceeds 10 words; I can't concentrate long enough to actually process their question.

I've seen some psychiatrists, and they attribute my inability to concentrate to anxiety and depression. But what exactly is the difference between inability to concentrate from anxiety and the inability to concentrate due to some attention deficit problem?",18Jul2018,1

47,"I need to vent. I don't know where else to go. On mobile and being crawled on by toddlers, so please excuse any weirdness in formatting and random wrong words. 

Made a post on confessions the other day. It got removed. Been too depressed to message the mods as to why. It may be as simple as this account is too new and it got flagged as potential spam. Or... I dunno. Got one reply before it was gone. They seemed to really care. I want to believe the majority of the world is made of good people. It's just hard right now.

I know I'm depressed and my feelings are affected by this. I'm on 50mg of Zoloft to help with my anxiety. I wish I had the time for me to go talk to my doctor about this. But I have to take care of everyone else and bend to their appointments and schedules. 

I'm a married mom of 4. I don't know what I'm doing but I feel like an absolute failure. Four boys. Four boys! I don't know what to do with boys. I'm the youngest of 2 sisters. My male cousins are few, far between, and seen maybe up to twice a year. 

The boys are 11, 7, 2, &amp; 1. From now on they'll be referred to by their ages. No PII on Reddit, ya know? (PII = personal identifiable information)

11 is the perfect blend between myself and my husband. Practically 50/50. It drives me nuts seeing myself in this boy. I hate myself and I see myself in him. I do my best to not act out my self loathing on him. I do. I feel like I'm failing, but I try my best. 

7... I don't know what's going on with him and it frustrates me to the point of screaming and crying. All we know for sure is he's ADHD to the point that we can't let him not take his medicine over summer break yet. He has already tried to commit suicide. In front of me and 11. It broke our hearts but we committed him for a week. At 6. 6 years old and tried to kill himself! Where the fuck did we go wrong?! His behavioral therapist and his teacher last year both mentioned sensory processing issues and he could also possibly be on the autism spectrum. I've been trying to get him in to be evaulated... But I'm getting the run around. I had 2 year old taken to the same place and never had this issue. I dunno at this point.

2 year old is autistic. Mostly nonverbal. Has therapy 3 days a week. Starts a developmental preschool in August. On the other side of town. He stims by throwing stuff. He's broken a TV by doing this. Husband has been talking to me about what will happen when 2 year old starts physically hurting me in his fits. I don't want to think about that yet. He already hurts me when he hits or head bangs out of frustration. He's 2 and is learning how to communicate. But he doesn't want me in those times. He wants husband.

1 year old gets semi neglected because I'm so focused on 7 and 2. 1 has been copying 2's stiming behaviors because it's ""monkey see monkey do"" at this age. He just wants attention and isn't getting enough one on one time.

By the end of the day I'm exhausted, but that's when husband wants to bring up the important shit. When I'm on my way to bed because I gotta get up in the morning and make sure the boys are taken care of and get where they need to go. I'm lucky if I have more than one weekday at home. 

Yeah, I'm still responsible for 99% of the housework. The other 1% is supposed to be split between husband, 11, and 7. 11 does that whole 1% and more some days. 11 doesn't get to be a kid as much as he deserves and it makes me feel like utter crap. ... I can depend on 11 for help more than husband.

I know this is part of the deal being a stay at home mom, but I never signed up for all of the above. I never signed up to be roommates with my husband, and where all I feel like is the maid, nanny, and taxi driver. 

I'm overwhelmed with no local support. All my friends over the years have abandoned me. My family that's local has their own problems that they need to deal with.

I have no time to myself. Downtime is spent trying to keep the disaster under control. Husband throws fits like a man sized toddler. Screams, yells, throws shit everywhere. Implies that the mess is my fault. Yells. Brings me down several pegs. Apologies later, but the damage is done. Grew up being blamed for all the wrongdoings in the house. I know this isn't good, and is abusive. But ... With everyone's everything there's no time for a job, and I've been out of the workforce for years. Doesn't matter. I'm not fit to parent by myself anyways.

I don't know what to do. I had to give myself orders this morning so I would eat breakfast so my blood sugar wouldn't crash while watching the toddlers (other two boys are still asleep). I could feel it crashing. I didn't want to eat. I still don't want to eat. 

I dunno what exactly the point of this is. I know I had a reason when I started, but life has happened in the interim and I can't remember anymore.

53,"A little backstory:

The college I want to get into has an average cumulative gpa of 3.3-3.6, however I currently have a gpa of 3.0, but my SAT is in the acceptable range. They say that one of the biggest factors that hurt admissions is a low gpa, and I fooled around too much in freshman/sophomore year.

Ive shown great improvement over the course of  my junior year, and I plan to do the same senior year, but that gpa is a few points lower than it should be. Colleges are usually more lenient to students who have gpa‚Äôs slightly lower than average if they have a good excuse, but I don‚Äôt have one other than the fact that I fooled around too much.

Ive never known my grandfather, he died before I was even born, and he lived on the other side of the world his entire life, but should I make an excuse like ‚ÄúMy grandfather died and I couldn‚Äôt balance school and his death effectively‚Äù?

54,"After about a 4 and a half years break I am back in the GYM. After graduating college i started working full-time and got married so i didnt have time to hit the gym before or after work. One day i decided to change this and started working out during my lunch breaks. This continued for about 3 months and i had to stop for a few months because of not enough sleep. This was 5 months ago. My routene during these 3 months was the following:
Day 1: Chest/Shoulders/Triceps
Day 2: Back/Biceps
Day 3: Legs
Day 4: repeat day 1
Day 5: repeat day 2
And rotating it so every next week i had two leg days instead of one. I have followed this strictly and i havent missed a single workout.

A few months have passed, the baby was sleeping much more during the night and i decided to return to my lunch break training again.

Now is the time to point out that i am the so called 'hard gainer' and my gains during these 3 months werent so good.

A month and two weeks ago i returned to the gym with a new plan - only compund movement routene, working every body part twice a week. And this has worked like a magic for me. I have started with a bench press of 40kg and squats of 20kg now i bench press 70kg(i weight 75kg) and i squat 60kg. The gains from this kind of workout are amazing for me and i cant believe that my body transformed so fast for only a month and a half.

I believe the key is that i push myself really hard with the weights. I have never done that before. It really pays off to push yourself to the limit and although my workouts only last about 30-35 mins i think that this is my way to grow and reach my goals.

For all the hard gainers out there you should really try that workout style and push yourself as hard as you can. Also if you cant find time before or after work i suggest you try the lunch break workouts it works great for me and i do recommend it. ",18Jul2018,1

But these last few days, I've been feeling so lonely...I love being alone, but for some reason it's turned to loneliness and I can't stand it. I don't understand why I'm so picky about a partner and why it's so hard for me to meet people I like who like me, too. I'm convinced I'll never find love. I know you don't need a relationship to live a fulfilling life, but it's something I want to have one day. It's not something I'll rush or force, but I just wish fate would send someone my way soon. Sometimes I feel like something is wrong with me because I've never had a boyfriend. I'm 20 now, which I know is still really young, but what the fuck??? I don't know. Maybe something is wrong with me.

It's funny because if I heard anyone else saying this, I'd tell them not to worry, it's not a big deal, they still have a whole lifetime to find love...but for some reason, telling myself these things right now isn't helping. :/",18Jul2018,4
57,"Ok to start, I'm a 21 year old guy. I don't have any friends or GF. I used to just spend all of my time at my PC gaming, watching TV shows or whatever else. Now I don't even like doing that. I have no motivation to play anything and I can't get into almost any show.

I am studying but currently I have my summer break so I'm not really studying *right now*.

Today I literally spent all day just watching a couple of Twitch streamers I'm familiar with or their VODs, listening to music and browsing reddit. Literally just wasted the whole day on nothing. Like I would have actually preferred to have just slept for 24 hours and skipped today over what I did.

I'm currently just trying to take as many hours as possible at work because at least I somewhat enjoy the work, interact with people there and feel like I have a purpose while I'm working, and obviously the fact that I'll get paid more at the end of the month gives me more motivation too.

I mean tbh I don't even need the money that much, I'm still living with my parents for now since I have no reason to move out (and I'm pretty sure they prefer having me here too). But I mean, you can never have too much money, right?

But I can't just work *every day*, even if I wanted to. And I don't know what to do with the rest of my time.

I used to go to the gym before I started working because that was the thing instead of my current work that gave me a sense of purpose, made me feel sorta productive etc. however at the core of it I don't enjoy going to the gym that much, it was something I felt like I had to do before I started working because I had waaaay too much free time otherwise.

Plus, a worry about the gym that I have is that when I start studying again I might *actually* have almost no free time, so even if I work out right now at summer, there'll be no point to it because I might just stop when fall comes.

Last year I suffered from heavy Imposter Syndrome, constantly over working myself, normally working non-stop other than lunch for 7-12 hours a day, normally riding once or twice for an hour each every day. Combined with the fact that my other co-workers are lazy, this all culminated in me legitimately passing out after working from 6:30 AM to 9:00 PM while barely eating or drinking anything that day. I blame this on myself, and I have since struggled with self-esteem as me doing the right amount of work for a person constantly leaves me doubting myself. I will keep trying though, I‚Äôm not going through that again.  
  
Another person who works and rides here seems to be going through that same thing, though I can‚Äôt really tell.
