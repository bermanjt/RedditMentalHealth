1,"Background: In my group of friends we often argue about what activities deserve to be in the olympics etc (archery, curlying, rifle events ... vs track and field, fighting sports, swimming ...).

If an average athletic person were to be given the technique and knowledge of the worlds best in the activity, and they would be able to compete with the worlds best, then it is not a sport. 

For example if an average person would have the technique of the best rifleman, I think they would be able to compete with the worlds best. While as, if they were to be given the technique of the best javelin thrower, they wouldn't be able to cross 35 m (the elites are 80+m)

2,"Hey guys so a little bit of background. I‚Äôm a senior in high school and all my high school years I‚Äôve been in love with this girl. We dated for about 2 years but her parents are really controlling so we broke up (due to us hardly getting to see each other because her parents are just really controlling. She wasn‚Äôt supposed to date until she was 16) and then wouldn‚Äôt let us get back together when she was 16. I was always very nice and respectful to them and they seemed to like me when we dated but when we broke off and she turned 16, her dad wanted me to apologize to him for ‚Äúhurting his daughter‚Äù even though her and I were on perfectly fine terms. They are very overly controlling and borderline emotionally abusive, really nuts stuff that they‚Äôve done. Me being 16 at the time didn‚Äôt just sallow my pride and do it and apologize even though he has no right to ask for an apology from me. Instead it turned into an argument of sorts in which I was also respectful and said nothing over the line or anything. Point is they hate me still and we cant be together. We‚Äôve still kept in touch and still really do like each other and we always planned and going to the same college so we can finally be together. Fast forward and this being my senior year they somehow figured out which college I‚Äôm going to and refuse to sign her FAFSA if she goes to the same college. I know I‚Äôm 18 and dumb and don‚Äôt know anything but I just feel like we were meant to be together and I‚Äôm devastated. I‚Äôve dreamed of us finally being together after all of this but it was just shattered in one night. I know that this might all sound like high school drama and maybe it is I‚Äôm just so unbelievably heartbroken and don‚Äôt know what to do. ",12Feb2018,1
5,"So I'm a sophomore in high school and realized time just flies by so quickly. My 10th year of school started around 7 months ago and now I'm looking ahead at my calendar. I have around 116 days (June 8) until my 10th year is over. And then I'll be heading onto my 11th year and sooner or later I'll be graduating high school. When I graduated I'll be 18, then I'll probably be off to college to get a degree on something and getting a job or I'm gonna join the military. By the time I'm done with college and find a good job/out of military service, I'll be around 25-28. Then a couple years later, I'll be in my 30s. Sooner or later I'll be in my 40s, then 50s (if i don't die), 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, and 100s.
    
The weird thing about this is that everyone that has been alive, is alive, or is going to be alive has/will go through the same process of aging and dying. A child is born, and at the same time, someone is dying. According to this [population clock](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/), there are around 7.6 billion people on this world right now. And each person on this planet has their own thoughts, feelings, expressions, values, culture, beliefs, views, hobbies, likes and dislikes, principles, morals, ethics, behaviors, etc.

Sorry if there are errors in my grammar I'm coming down off some acid and had this huge mind fuck.",12Feb2018,1
6,"First of all, pardon any spelling or grammar mistakes. 

   So the summer I turned 17 my best (female) friend whom I‚Äôve known for six years got out of an extremely unhealthy long term relationship and I, having newfound freedom, a driver‚Äôs license, and a nice new car, naturally provided refuge from her parents and from the outside world as she went through that. 
   I was naive to the way emotions worked, especially where relations were involved, and so I decided to strike up a relationship with her- we got pretty involved pretty fast, but were never clear on our intentions for the following year- we were both graduating seniors, and she was bound for an ivy league college, while my white trash ass was headed for the military. We chose not to talk about it, but I ended up getting heavily emotionally invested in her- this relationship having been my first serious one, i knew nothing of emotional restraint. 
   She ends up cheating on me a month before she leaves for college, I stay with her because i‚Äôve become so codependent on her that the idea of being alone without her sends me into bordering on panic attack level terror, but I stop trusting her and so it‚Äôs basically a broken relationship for the last month. 
   I feel so broken emotionally for this last month that I barely tell her I love her or anything, and she‚Äôs heartbroken and so I tell her that we can‚Äôt do a long distance relationship because I don‚Äôt trust her. 
   Eventually she leaves and it sucks and I‚Äôm heartbroken but I‚Äôm more emotionally devastated that she cheated on me- I have major depressive disorder and bpd and a nice history of major self worth and abandonment issues, and all of this combined with her cheating made me feel like i‚Äôd never be good enough for anyone ever again. 
   I went into a two month long bout of addiction before ending up in a mental health/rehab center. i worked my way out of the depression and addiction and got everything under control, got my own apartment and steady job and have been getting my life back on track, even getting into a new (healthier, albeit much more emotionally cautious) relationship. 
   I blocked my ex on all social media platforms, but Instagram and some other social media platforms don‚Äôt prevent you from seeing their names on places, and as much as i‚Äôm trying to forget her, her name still pops up occasionally and I still find myself going through her social media platforms and feeling ashamed hearing her talk about her new best friends and how she‚Äôs in love with one of them. I know and have been able to recognize and analyze that the shitty feeling I get seeing her name is a result of the shitty stuff i went through, which I associated with her, and I understand that my ‚Äúattraction‚Äù towards her isn‚Äôt actually attraction but a desperate need for approval, but I‚Äôm not sure how to control or change these feelings.

Sorry for the massive amount of text, I‚Äôve just smoked a bowl and was doing some introspection and wanted to get a few things off my chest. I don‚Äôt like to share stuff like this, i‚Äôm generally a closed off person because i guess this story ends up being a pretty generic one that‚Äôs not very special but none of my friends wanted to meet me at iHop so r/Self gets this round!",12Feb2018,1
8,"I understand I am only 20 (F) and I have the world ahead of me but I have never felt so lost in my life. 

From a young age I have always been creative! I explored film making and pursuing something in that but I almost did it so much...that I began to hate it (you know when you think you enjoy something and then things start to get serious and it just isn‚Äôt for you anymore) 

I am not currently studying graphic design but I am actually the worst designer you have ever met, I love branding and exploring that story behind all those things that make up our lives. Understanding why people do what they do, what resonates with people and how people brand themselves and almost use material things in their lives to represent them.

But back to being lost! I am about to graduate and I just feel like all hope and ambition is lost! My course is filled with people dreaming to be designers making pretty packaging or design for change but all I want to do is work on concepts and ideas that resonate with people. But the idea just feels so silly and just leaves me feeling confused on where to even start! 

 It is easy to get lost in the bubble of university and so easy to lose a dream and sell out but I really don‚Äôt want to do this! 

Does anyone have any suggestions for things to explore? I am not set on design, branding, marketing etc but would love to just try things but have no idea where to start? 

I can‚Äôt say what I dream of doing anymore or what really makes my heart sing to a certain extent! 

Has anyone ever been in the same boat! What did you do to explore and try to find you?

12,"I go to a private school that gives no h*cks what you do at home ^^^^/s so I got a shitload of homework that I‚Äôm not used to getting in public school. I finished it by Sunday morning, and due to the rain I decided to start working out and take care of my gynecomastia by really targeting my body fat and what I want to get better at. I do some forearm curls and bam, vein sticking out of forearm and I feel jacked. 

Later that day I do some research and find a diet to map out so I can dump some of that teenage estrogen. I find not only the ideal things to eat and not to eat, (Man I love Larry and Lenny‚Äôs cookies but soy is soy) I also find that I should switch my deodorant. Axe has toxins damaging to the reproductive system (that can show in gynecomastia) and also leads to estrogen dominance. I ate a huge chicken breast and rice plate that would usually flare my stomach for hours and I saw no bloat, that must mean something good.

TL;DR I talked to nobody this weekend, but I made ends and had time to take care of myself.

13,"I met my current girlfriend online through loveme six months ago. From the moment we wet, we hit it off, and after awhile, I found myself falling for her. In hindsight, it isn‚Äôt really surprising because of how amazing she is. 

So I told her I like her, and she told me that she likes me too. We then got into an official relationship. It felt so great knowing that the person I like feels the same way. I was on cloud nine for about a month until I started thinking that we might jumped into the relationship too soon.

I know some people date for like, a week after dating or something before getting into a relationship, but it got me thinking about how little we know of each other. I mean, it‚Äôs nice to learn new something about her everyday, but sometimes I feel bad about the little things that I have no clue about. We once got into a fight over a show that she loved and I accidentally insulted. What if we‚Äôre not actually compatible? What if our expectations for our relationship are different? 

I‚Äôm really starting to feel like we‚Äôre moving too fast. She‚Äôs already talking about one of us visiting, and I‚Äôve been kind of putting off discussing this more.

15,"I‚Äôm looking to finally move out of my parents‚Äô house and start an adult life on my own. I‚Äôm almost 30, and I feel like I‚Äôm way behind on..... basically everything. Social, career, etc.

I don‚Äôt make a lot of money, but I‚Äôve saved up a decent amount by living at home. My parents want me to consider buying a condo instead of renting, to build some modest equity, and they think I should look into the various incentive programs for low-income and first time home buyers. From what I understand, many condo/apartment complexes set aside a certain percentage of units for low-income individuals in exchange for tax breaks, and I would be taking one of those.

It‚Äôs very tempting, but I‚Äôm concerned about the ethics of it. While I personally don‚Äôt make much money (~30k/yr), I would describe my parents as upper-middle class. My entire life up to this point has been upper-middle class.

Part of me feels like it is not okay for me to pursue low-income housing because of the advantages I already have. Other people have greater need. I‚Äôm debt-free, have a savings account, and can always move back home/go there for free food if I need to. 

On the other hand, maybe I need to start thinking of myself as a separate, independent adult as I shift into this new phase of my life? I really am low-income, and realistically I don‚Äôt expect to ever come close to financial parity with my parents. I‚Äôd also be seeking a 1 bedroom condo, so anyone else seeking the same room would likely be in a similar financial position to me, right? 

Obviously I would be completely honest on my application. If I genuinely qualify, does that make it okay? Or am I being a crappy entitled child of privilege?",12Feb2018,1

25,"Well, lets start with I am prone to kidney stones. A healthy 27yr old male and I average about two a year. Besides being incredibly unpleasant it is also the single most painful experience i have ever had in my life.
 
My normal routine is when I feel the pain starting to come on I jump in the car and head to the hospital where i get pumped full of morphine, zofran and good ol saline. Then after a ct scan to show i have one and am not a junkie looking for a fix they prescribe 3 different things, flowmax, zofran for and the drug of this experience, percocet. Well, this kidney stone stayed around for an unusually long time, 8 days, and happened to be the most painful one i have had to date.

Eight days with different concoctions of opiates coursing through my body, needles to say the last day i had taken the last opiate i needed for the pain and put the others away for the next stone. After about 6 hours i was in a fetal position on my bathroom floor covered in sweat and crying over an ex gf that has been out of my life for a long time while feeling sick. Well this experience was new to me so i started to look at it from a logical point of view and before i knew it i realized i was withdrawing from the opiates.

This lasted for two weeks almost. Never have i ever felt anything like i did while ""detoxing"". I was looking for anything that would ease the symptoms, mainly the feeling of sitting in the sun and then swimming naked in the artic in winter. After two days i was so desperate for relief i thought of suicide it was so unberable, then pulling myself back together i read a post from 7 years ago where someone who was a heavy heroine user turned to weed for some help, so i decided to log my experience everyday. I went another day with nothing as a baseline to my new ""study"", then the day after I rolled a joint. Without adding more paragraphs i will explain my findings and if people are interested i will post screen grabs of the notes from my phone and post them.

After starting to use weed i found that it helped with the issue of sweating, it lifted my mood, made me eat, helped pull my stomach together and even allowed me to sleep for an hour before waking up freezing covered in sweat. To me this was literally life saving. Now don't get me wrong, this was only eight days of use, not even close to the level of use others get addicted too so my symptoms even though feeling unbearable to me are not even remotely close to what they go through for detox. However, this experiment i happened to fall into might, just might, suggest that weed can be used as a way for treatment or rehab. It has now been 7 days since i stopped using weed everyday, now i am back to what i was doing, 3-5 times a month for recreational use and feel like my old self again. It also opened my eyes to people who use heroine and abuse opiates, those seeking help to get clean, the hell they have to endure and possibility of death while detoxing if not monitored, to go through that because of one bad decision, these people do not need to be criticized or seen as less of a being, they need to be helped and maybe this post will catch the eye of someone at some university who wants to do good for people in need.

29,"From late 2013 to 2016, I was making my living playing online poker. I graduated from high school in May 2013. That summer, I was introduced to poker. At first it was a hobby with friends, but pretty quickly, I desired nothing more than to become competitive at the tables and maybe even eventually make it my living. I found online poker on my own, and began to play. I deposited $100 twice to my account, each time losing it all. Depositing another $100 a couple of weeks later, I told myself, ""This is it. No more devotion to poker if your bankroll gets to $0 this time.""

Well, that was the last deposit I ever made- and not because it was all gone. The forums I had joined and the books I had read started to pay off. I played all throughout my college years, dedicating 90-100 hrs per week to studying and playing at multiple poker tables online at one time. It was exhausting, but ultimately worth it in many ways.

I paid my own way through college with poker money and am fortunate enough to say I graduated from college without any debt in December 2016. By then, though, poker was getting harder to beat, and after spending tens of thousands of hours eating, sleeping, and breathing poker, I didn't have the desire to keep up with the best players any longer. I withdrew the remainder of my cash, found a real job, and moved away. 

Since then, I have worked at my job in HR which is what I went to school for. However, I am completely depressed and absolutely hate my life. I feel alone and like no one will ever understand how I feel. 

I can't get back into poker and expect to make a living. The games have evolved so much now and the players that used to be terrible have became really good.

There are billions- **billions** of people who have it worse off than I. I am so fucking fortunate to not only have lived my dream for a little, but also have the life I have now!

Then, during the second bidding round the man the woman fucked over in turn did the same thing that was done to him by her, but he did it to someone else. He won the bid but LOST the game! HA!

Then, when the third bidding round happened  this kid made a bid of $501 and the woman after him decided to be decent and bid $541.... giving him at LEAST a small chance of winning instead of completely shutting him out. He went on to lose his game (which sucked), but he went on to win the spinoff  shutting out the other previous cutthroats mentioned earlier (so he went on to the showcase showdown later).... we will come back to him later.

Then the decent contestant (who gave the kid a small chance of winning earlier) won the next bidding round, sadly she lost her game too.

37,"I just need to let this out... Yesterday at 3:00pm my mother passed away, she had been diagnosed with leukemia in late 2015, and never had chemo she just did natural remedy things. She went to the hospital early Thursday morning because she woke up in the middle of the night unable to breath because shes been battling sinus issues since October, its hard to fight off anything when you have a lowered immune system with leukemia. I visited with her on Friday and she seemed like she was doing great for her situation, walking around and talking, acting normal. Me and my family thought she would get released to go home that night or early Saturday. Unfortunately things took a turn for the worse, with a lowered immune system she woke up with a fever not feeling good and aching all over. Later that night on Saturday I visited her she was in and out of consciousness due to the morphine they gave her for her pain (It made her sleepy) her blood pressure was very low 58/37. As me and my aunt sat there that night different medical staff in and out of room doing things to better her situation. Trying to find veins to draw blood from for test she had bruises all up and down her arms, her blood pressure started to go up which was a good sign. My other aunt spent the night with her and I went home (Oh btw I'm only 18 yrs old) The next day I didn't hear anything from anyone so I just assumed everything was ok.) Around 3:30pm my aunt came over and usually when my moms in the hospital she'll ask me if I talked to my mom today but she didn't this time. She was acting strange just playing with our dog, then tried to call my mom and of course there was no answer. I had a very good idea of what happened but wasn't 100% sure. Me and my cousin then headed over to my Grandmothers where she then asked me ""Who told you"" then I asked ""Told me what"" where she then replied ""That your mom died"" I said "" I already knew because of how everyone was acting"" she then proceeded to comfort me I started to tear up and run to a empty spare bed room of hers laying face down and crying my heart out. The rest of our family came over to my grandmothers so we could all grieve together. I guess Im going to have to live with a family member now since I am still in high school and not self dependent. Its hard its really really hard I stayed at my aunts last night and woke up in the middle of the night and just started crying and screaming into the pillows on the bed thinking about all the things my mom will never see me do. I guess my aunt heard me because she came up and comforted me. Today we go to make arrangements for her. My other cousin is coming in today from Las Vegas and were just gonna talk and blaze, hopefully that will help. Things are just rough right now.

38,"I‚Äôm 22, and although I was raised in a family with religious undertones, I never really believed in the afterlife. Lately however, I‚Äôve been feeling pretty mortal. Knowing I‚Äôm going to not exist anymore really scares me and although people say ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt care before when you didn‚Äôt exist‚Äù.. this is different. I was given life before, never had it taken away. Also there‚Äôs infantile amnesia.

39,"I will write a detailed explanation on what happened to provide background. If you dont feel like reading through all of this just skip to the bottom.

//

I stayed almost 2 years at my previous job. 
At the start, i was the most interested guy you could get. I would watch something a colleague was doing, and when i got home i would google it, etc, so i could understand it better. 
My direct colleagues were amazing people, but there were like 0 chances of progression, and whenever you tried to learn something from more experienced colleagues, your attempt would be shut down pretty fast (from superiors). And given that among my team there was only 1 person that was technically better than me, i lost all my motivation to learn new things. 
Tried to switch jobs for almost 1 year, finally managed to do it, but i feel like i dont have interest in learning anything anymore. 
Its like my subconscious keeps telling me its still worthless to try.
Is there some way i can make myself understand that things have changed?

On another topic:
I had a family situation going on a few months ago. 
Basically my father had depression, never treated it, then he had a stroke, and started saying pretty crazy things, like he would burn down the house and kill my mom. 
He was always kinda chill, and we tried helping him, but unfortunately he stole my mother's car, and then got violent (tried to stab my mother, i stopped him), and went to the police stating i had attacked him, that i stole his things, even went to lengths such as telling my friends that i tried to drown him, etc. 
My mom is living with my aunt because of this. 
Even more ridiculous, my dad's family took the liberty of taking almost all of the stuff that was in the house. Everything of value is now gone, and even some things that had no value like a simple small towel to clean your hands.

Now, when this happened i was living with said aunt. 
So then i was stuck living with my mom, for whom i have 0 patience (i am a very patient person, but when that patience reaches its limits, it becomes hard to even talk to the person, and my mother is very pushy and always has opinions about everything, she is very hard to deal with, specially daily).
So basically i went from having very peaceful evenings, to get home and fight with my mom, almost everyday.
2 weeks ago i found a place to live with my GF and moved there. 
So my life atm is very chill. Except when i got see my aunt and mom. I almost always end up fighting with my mom. 
She IS NOT okay at all. She is pushing everyone away from her, and she cant see it, blames it on me, on my aunt, on my sister.

Now that i have my own space, i realized that i cannot focus as i used to anymore. 
I also get distracted so much easily than before. is there a chance that it is connected to all these events?
What can i do to improve or change this?

How can i convince my mother that she needs mental treatment? Is it worth it to get mental treatment for myself too?

//

TL;DR:

Impossible to improve at old job. Made me subconsciously content with what i know.

Dad went nuts, tried to stab mom, tried to destroy everyone and everything. Things are calm now, but cant focus anymore like i used to.

42,"So I've had this friend for many many years. The last few years, his marriage has been rocky and mostly sexless. I only know what I know from him, and I full acknowledge that my information is one-sided.

So recently, he's been living in a spare room in his house because, according to him, he's checked out of the marriage. They'll probably get a divorce. Now, he's always been not so great with money, but I got some of the story from his wife recently and it got kinda weird.

Despite him making decent money, and his wife works too, the water has been shut off twice because he didn't pay the bill. His car just got repossessed. He's missed several mortgage payments. He's been going to check-cashing places for short term loans. I've estimated that's around $10,000 over a year that didn't go to bills. So where did it go? He doesn't buy a bunch of fancy shit. He's not great with money, but holy shit, how can you be that bad?

Also, he's got an adderall prescription. I don't know if that's a gateway-type drug. (like opioids)",12Feb2018,10
44,"There are times that I get that feeling of ""I want to go home"". But

45,"I will be 30 years old this year.
From age 18 to 26, I was in a beautiful relationship with a man I can't fault. I was so lucky. He really was the love of my life. I can't think of a better person. I broke up with him over reasons I can't really pin down - I think what it boils down to is my 'grass is greener' syndrome. I know hindsight is everything but if only I could go back and grab myself by the shoulders and shake myself. I lost my soulmate because I didn't realise that I had to work at and nurture my relationship. I mistook contentment for boredom and now I'm alone. I had NO IDEA how hard it would be. 
Even though it was my own decision, I think I have still been traumatised by it. If anything, it's worse knowing that I traumatised myself.
In the 2 years since I left, I have had 8 different addresses across several different cities, one short relationship that led to me being emotionally and physically abused, 3 jobs and zero stability or mental resilience. I am now living back at my mums house because I had a breakdown and was not able to continue taking care of myself. I have a job and I am saving up money while also awaiting treatment for my mental health issues. 

I receive a diagnosis next week and I am scared about it. It feels like a death sentence... only worse.

I don't want to be a crazy failure. I don't want to be emotionally unstable and horrible to live with forever. I don't feel able to open myself up to the possibility of loving again because there's no man who can live up to my ex and because - even if I could find something good 'enough' - it's not fair on others to feel this way. I am such a miserable, unreliable person that I feel I have a duty to protect others from me, even if I were to have feelings for those people.

The life ahead of me seems purposeless, bleak and tiring. I don't have a career path to follow because I am an artist. I did a degree in fine art and I work a low-level admin job to be able to afford to keep making work. The compliments and attention I get from my talent are the only things that make me feel happy and real. I find it hard to join the dots across my strewn about life, so I find myself having exciting weekends 'being an artist' and then returning to work at home and feeling unreal and bereft.

I wish I didn't feel so much. I feel completely broken and too fragile for the world. The choices i've made have destroyed my future. I will never find love, nor afford a house or have any real success. Without these things to look forward to, what else is there? How do people fill their lives? It's quite difficult for me to comprehend the idea that others enjoy life. Mine feels like a long, empty road that I just want to end because I am embarrassed and ashamed at my destructive decisions and how little I have because of them.",12Feb2018,1

The relationship is perfect. So is the one with my parents.

I‚Äôm no longer satisfied with the grind. I can‚Äôt see myself going to work every day for the rest of my life. I don‚Äôt wanna do a 9-5, retire in my late 60‚Äôs and buy a modest house in a quiet residential. My life is comprised of me looking for the next getaway.

I hate the concept of money. It‚Äôs the only thing that holds me back. I wish I can just have a nice little ranch in a semi rural area. With chickens and goats and cows. And go on adventures with my lady whenever I feel like. I don‚Äôt want money to hold me back anymore. I want to have residual income to the point it‚Äôs no longer on my mind.

48,"I feel like our culture's inherent taboo about sex and rape has hurt too many people. Too many people virtue signal or stay silent rather than state their true feelings and opinions on sensitive, important topics. And so, because in this culture where everyone can be a victim and a perpetrator of sexual assault, I feel like I should mention important things on sexual assault that may actually help people.

It's incredibly hard to know if someone was sexually assaulted. Emotional trauma, the main pain from rape, leaves no trace. The closest thing to evidence that can prove a rape is if any organ damage or other bodily harm was caused at the time. This is why rape culture and false accusations exist, because there exists no good way to prove or disprove an assault. It's only a matter of time before accusers start to get accused of rape and harassment themselves. (On another note, 90% of prisoners say that they're innocent. We may need to ask ourselves important epistemic questions for other laws that could reveal the immortality of punishment itself. Or at least fix the plea bargain system.)

Therefore, the best ways to help other people with sexual assault is make sexual assault less unpleasant and traumatizing, as well as to make it less appealing. Our culture's taboo about sex, however, prevents this from happening. For instance, there exists very little scientific research (as far as I can tell) on the processes behind how rape causes mental illness and suicide. If that process was more well known there could be treatments that reduce or eliminate the psychological pain caused by rape. There's also the dangerously simplistic idea that rapists rape because of the power. Human behavior is so much more complex than that, and the fact that few people study rapists and their psychology stunts treatment for potential rapists.

Of course, I can't wait for the comment saying that everything that I said is false before getting ostracized from society. But when billions of people are raped, society must do more than just say ""don't rape"". We must be brave and look for the truth wherever it takes us.",12Feb2018,1

51,"I‚Äôm 34, the youngest of 3, my siblings are 38 and 40, respectively. We all live a few towns away from each other. My sister is single and my brother is married with 2 kids, while also housing his mother in law and 2 older nieces who‚Äôve lived with them since their father passed somewhere around 2007. Our Mother, is 77, a widow since 2006, a grandmother of 4, and a cancer survivor. I‚Äôm a stay at home dad, and my wife works full time in corporate accounting. Me, my wife and daughters (5 and 2.5), have been living at my childhood home for the last 1.5 years, and more recently, my wife and I made the decision that we‚Äôd be relocating from New Jersey to Colorado starting in the spring. My wife would leave in April, securing a job and a home for us, then I‚Äôd move my daughters, and whatever belongings I can fit in a moving trailer after my oldest daughter finishes her year of Pre-K. 


I announced this to my mother and siblings, and this past week has been miserable. I‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôm selfish for this decision, that I let my wife pressure me into decisions, from moving to CO, down to having children I wasn‚Äôt ready to have. 


Prior to last week, I felt the relationships between me, my wife, and my family were solid. Now, I feel like a traitor, and that I lose no matter my choice. I try to convince my wife to stay in NJ, then I‚Äôm a ‚Äúslave to my family.‚Äù I go to Colorado and raise my family on my own, and I‚Äôm ‚Äújust going along with any ideas my wife suggests.‚Äù


My wife‚Äôs family also lives nearby, all within several towns of each other, (she‚Äôs the eldest of 3 sisters, the other 2 are both married and have 5 daughters between them). They‚Äôre all super supportive and excited for new adventures for us, even if it means we won‚Äôt be seeing each other as much, or raising our all of our daughters close together, which is something my wife was fortunate enough to experience growing up. 


I hate the idea of leaving my mother alone in the house, she‚Äôs in relatively decent health for 77, however she‚Äôs gone on record saying she plans to refuse treatment for any pressing issues moving forward. I feel like a vulture, essentially waiting for her to die so I can inherit my childhood home. I also don‚Äôt want my daughters to sneak into her room one night and find she‚Äôs passed in her sleep. 


I fully plan on going with my wife once things shake out in CO, I just don‚Äôt know what to do about my family here in NJ. I have basically no support on my side, and now I‚Äôm learning everyone in my family thinks I‚Äôve been bullied into getting married, having and raising kids and now relocating more than halfway across the country. I‚Äôve lost 15 lbs due to the stress this has caused me, I lose sleep and I‚Äôm miserable most of the time. 

Any insight, in my favor or against, would be appreciated.
