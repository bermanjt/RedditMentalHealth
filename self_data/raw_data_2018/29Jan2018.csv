0,"So there seems to be a huge addiction problem in the world that no one is talking about. People that are way to into fitness.


It's to a point where fitness takes over these people whole lives. Like if fitness didn't exist they would be empty shells. They don't even do it for health reasons, you can be very healthy without fitness taking over your entire life. All the fitness buffs I know always seem to be nursing injuries. People are even dying because they've taken the fitness lifestyle too far. The worst part about it is their addiction makes them delusional as they think they're better than every person that's not addicted to fitness.


P.S - I'm in pretty good shape so no need to ""motivate me to improve my life"". I made this post because I truly feel like this is a problem that needs to be addressed like any other addiction in the world.",29Jan2018,0
1,"Yesterday, my SO and I had the idea to take a hike in a popular little area near us. It's a family friendly place where one can stroll along the historic streets and spend the day exploring. Well, this idyllic little spot has a train station parking lot where many coveted spots are. While my SO and I have waited about ten minutes for a spot, I have the urge to relieve myself so I run inside to the bathroom. When I come out I see a blue Subaru Forester with a D.C. license plate (which I have pictures of) very close to my car awaiting a spot. My SO tells me this guy, a 40 something year old Caucasian man with brown hair and brown eyes, has driven up to take the spot we have been waiting for this whole time. While I'm aware there is no reserved spot for us, there is an understanding among moral drivers that you don't take a spot that someone else is clearly waiting for. Well, not this guy. I even got out of my own car to walk to his window in case my SO's signaling of ""hey we are waiting"" and ""no this is our spot"" was somehow miraculously lost with this man. I walked to the window and said, ""I'm sorry, sir (as if I should have to apologize for the obvious) but we have been waiting 15 minutes for a spot. I'm not sure if you didn't realize"" (of course he did, but didn't want to immediately go on the offensive). The man just ignored me and my gaze of immediate confusion as to why he continued edging towards the spot we were waiting for. 

I step towards the outside of the spot thinking 'is this actually happening right now' when my SO continues pulling into the spot. Due to this, the man swings his car wide and almost hits me as he takes the spot we have waited for. Now I have never had someone purposely come at me with their car so I have a mixture of anger and fear. My hands won't stop shaking. I have no doubt this man would have hit me. As less than an inch away I would have been hit and if it wasn't me, he would have hit my car that my SO was driving into the spot. 

I'm in disbelief. How could a man who seems to have it together cut in and take a spot he knows he shouldn't; while almost hitting a 24 year old girl in a parking lot. I walk up to the car as he gets out and say, ""Sir (again at this point saying A-HOLE would have been more appropriate) we have been waiting for 15 minutes, I know you saw my SO and I both show you that we've been waiting, you tried to hit me, before it escalates please move your car"". He says ""tough shit, I'm not moving."" This man won't even make eye contact. I called him out saying that ""you know what you are doing is wrong, you won't make eye contact, and if the situation was reversed you'd be furious with us. Just because we are young does not give you the right to do anything such as this."" He scoffed and said, ""well, my in-laws are waiting for me so I’m not moving”.

Among other things he said:
“I saw you waiting, but there’s nothing you can do to make me move. Maybe you should try for another spot”.
“The world is unfair I don’t care what you want. I’m not moving”.
“If you don’t like what’s happening, blame whoever voted for Trump”.

This man is blaming his scheming, pathetic move on Trump. Uhm, what?

The man thinks he has won but I’m not having this. I’m overwhelmed with emotion that this man purposely drove his car at me over a PARKING SPOT. 

I immediately look for a park ranger, police, anything but due to the location it’s a mixture of confusion for who responds to the area. The dispatcher asks me what happened and says an officer will come by. The man is saying “good luck, the police will take my side over some kids. Besides I’m an attorney in D.C. so I can always get out of this situation”. He begins to walk away to join his family for lunch before my SO reminds him that coming at someone with their vehicle is assault. The man reluctantly walks back fearing that he may regret his actions after all. Around 10-15 minutes later the officer arrives. The officer is an African American male, bald/balding, and giving no mind to the situation. 

He asks each person their side. In his mind, I blocked a parking spot that was fair game. 
Me- “I was off to the side when the man came at me.
Officer- “well did he hit you?” 
Me- “No”
Officer- “So what’s the problem?”
Me- “Well officer, the problem is that he came at me directly with his car.” 
Officer- “Well are you hurt?” 

 knew what this man was getting at, basically saying well if you aren’t hurt then this is a waste of my time. He kept egging me on.

 I replied honestly, “Well I’ve never had someone drive their car at me and yeah I am terrified”. 
“But are you hurt?” said the officer. This was a broken record.

Even the man who almost hit me said, “Oh were you scared I came at you at 3 mph”? While laughing. This man almost hits me and I’m here crying (which is out of frustration, fear, and anger) and he’s mocking me in front of the officer I called in to help me. 

Well, that was his admittance. He even claimed he came at me with his car as if the speed of it didn’t make a difference. Did the officer realize that? No, he continued his questioning of whether I was hurt. I said psychologically, emotionally,  yes (like anyone would, I’m still shaking now. I feel terrified that people will run me down over trivial things like a parking spot. I have no doubt this man would have as he was less than an inch away from doing so).

But most importantly, it not only made me lose my faith in humanity, it made me lose faith in all aspects of it. I knew people like this guy existed, cops like this who don’t care, but this was my first taste of it. And boy it was a bitter one. For some, this was just a meaningless situation over parking. For me, it was the depravity of humanity. A man willing to go so low over a parking spot, to put my life in the way, and for a cop to just say no harm to you, no foul. 

I can’t begin to imagine what others go through, worse or better, but there is no measure when it comes to the individual. For some it can be the worst thing of the imagination, for me it was a parking spot. It doesn’t matter. Life is full of choices. You can’t blame circumstances like who our president is. We all get the choice to be good or bad. But those who are bad justify it, “Life is unfair”. Yeah, it can be. But you make the decision whether to make it better or worse for yourself and others. If you only think of yourself, sure, it can be fair. But at what cost? 
Unless you are the scum of the earth with no soul, moral, or humanity, why bother? When people think of what is f*cked up in this world, do you want to be part of that answer? 

So ‘sir’ who almost ran me down in the parking lot. I hope you realize that you can be better. Better for yourself, better for your family, and better for this world. Don’t blame others; you have the choice. I just hope you make a better one this time. And the same goes for our law enforcement. People call you for a reason, doesn’t matter what you think of that reason (as a waste of time or whatever) you are called to do a job. So don’t make those that rely on you for justice regret not handling it for themselves. 

Shame on you both. I wish you learn your lesson in this life. Luckily, I am the better person. Continued on my way and forgave you for making me lose faith in humanity. 

Edit: tldr; Guy swooped in stole parking spot while trying to hit me in the process. Him and police take a no harm, no foul p.o.v. Made me hate people. But conquered the good in life. ",29Jan2018,1
3,"So my cousin dated this girl for around a year. They were pretty serious. I didn’t see her that often, really only if there was some family occasion that my cousin brought her to, but we always got along really well. They split up a few months back, my cousin’s in a new relationship, and I hadn’t seen her in a long time. I was out at a club the other night though and ran into her. I was pretty fucking drunk, so I don’t remember how we got talking/what about really. I do remember telling her I prefer her to my cousin’s new girlfriend and that he was missing out or something. I think we talked about why they broke up too. Anyway, somewhere in the conversation she just looked at me and said ‘I can tell that you want to kiss me’. I told her that even if that was true, we probably shouldn’t. I don’t even think it was on my mind. Like I always thought she was pretty attractive, but it wasnt anything more than that. 

Maybe I did want to, I don’t really remember what was going through my head, but we ended up making out. After that we danced for a bit and then made out again, so it wasn’t just one little minute long lapse of judgement. I knew what I was doing was shitty and still done it. Twice. Now I feel awful. Like was she just using me to make my cousin jealous? I honestly don’t know. Either way I know it will get back to him eventually and I have absolutely no idea what I’ll say or how I should handle it. I really like my cousin, we get along well, and I just feel like I’ve betrayed him here somehow. I know they’re not dating anymore or whatever, and he’s moved on, but it still just doesn’t feel right to me. My friends just  think it’s funny that I feel so bad about it, but I just feel like I was really shitty here man. ",29Jan2018,7
4,"Ever since I was a kid I just spent my time getting frustrated with video games and sitting aimlessly watching the tv. I’ve been playing guitar for the first time since I was in grade school, and I’m loving it. Trying to be better, no goals but just being the best that I can be.

5,"I'm in college and I don't really have any real friends.  I have people that care about me and stuff but everyone in general people don't enjoy being around me.  I'm kind of the guy that others wouldn't go out of their way to do something with, and I don't really add much to the group when I'm there.  I'm book smart but I always stutter and second guess myself when I talk, I'm not assertive at all, I'm not good with girls, and I'm just awkward in general.  People see me as a guy who just makes dumb comments sometimes and never really take anything I say seriously.  I'm a sophomore and most of my roommates are moving next year without me, partially because of all the things I said before.  I'm involved on campus and am in a fraternity but i still haven't really found any good friends.  I've tried to get more involved with my fraternity but I've lost every election I've ran for and never get on any committee I apply for which really shows how no one in it really likes me.  Last year I really struggled with depression and almost killed myself which may be why people in my fraternity are more distant with me now (cause I try to act normal since I'm not suicidal anymore but they may think I am or something) but I really just want to be accepted and enjoy my time in college, but I really don't know what I'm doing wrong or how to fix it.

6,"I'm 36 and till now, I can't help but feel like I'm a total screw up. Sure, this is the make or break year of my business, and I feel zero motivation about doing shit about anything. I have 18 months to prepare for a major move (emigration) and it seems easy, though I'm dragging my feet about it. I feel zero motivation. I have creditors at the door, and though I can do better, I'm doing zero about it. I'm putting on weight, eating unhealthy, living unhealthy, but I'm unfazed.

7,"What better place to write a selfish, probably arrogant text than r/self? I don't feel good doing this, but I just really need to. Disclaimer, I've just turned 15, so this might be teenage drama. Correction, it is most likely teenage drama. It still feels as important to me right now, so whatever.

The thing is, everyone just seems to be stuck back in 6th grade at some points. I do have some very responsible and smart friends, but sometimes it just feels like they aren't in the same page as I am. I'm not saying I'm a grown up, I definitely have a long way to go until maturity, but everyone looks so much worse!

My girlfriend is what is bothering me the most. Before anyone comments saying ""you are just a kid, it's nothing"", I know she's not the love of my life and I'm most likely going to stop loving her or get the boot in a few months or so, but if it makes me feel bad right now, it's important enough to discuss.

I really like her. I just enjoying being with her. The problem is, although she's a year older than me, she acts like she's two years younger. She is always playing with 10 year olds, doesn't know how to hold up a conversation with adults, acts very awkward and shy around anyone other than her friends, doesn't do anything on her own, doesn't plan anything at all because her parents do everything for her... there are a lot of small things that add up and make it frustrating.

I just don't know how to get out of this mess. I was once told if everyone seems to have something wrong with them, you are probably the wrong one. Maybe it's just that. Anyhow, I still have no one I can talk to and have a decent conversation with.

I kind of regret writing this as it just seems so stupid, but I've nothing to lose here anyway...",29Jan2018,5

- Appalachia is supposed to be something that a hillbilly version of Andy McKee would write
- Lee is a happy and relatively well-rounded fingerpicking song I wrote and named after one of my pals
- The Hits is my first real fingerpicking song. I've written and rewritten it like a million times. It's got a neat chorus and is actually decently technical. It's got a nice locomotive behind it.
- Re-sorted is another song I've written and rewritten a million times. It's about kinda getting fired from a big financial institution I briefly contracted at.
- Anna isn't really a real song yet, but it's named after the name my Mom used to go by. It's slow and somber and came from some weird gypsy folk shit going on in my head.
- Commerce, in General is another one I've written like 10 different versions of. It's only about 1/3 done but it's dissonant and reminds me of pretty much every Andy McKee song ever written.
- The Way It Is is sad and unfinished and supposed to sound kinda like something Justin Vernon (Bon Iver) would write.

13,"So just a little back story to this;

Me and some of my coworkers went bar hopping the other night to celebrate our first couple weeks at our new job together. One of my coworkers brought her friend that just blew me away, she was beautiful. 

Later in the night when all of my coworkers were hammered, me and her were the only ones who weren't so we kinda just talked with each other because you know how it is being sober trying to have a conversation with a drunk person.. it's just not possible lol.

At the end of the night she actually asked me for my phone number but it's been a couple days and she hasn't texted me or anything so I assume she either forgot to save it or something.. idk. Doesn't really make sense to me to ask for someone's phone number if you aren't interested in them, right? I could be wrong.

Anyways, I made her this little thank you card because I truly did appreciate her company. If she wasn't there for me to talk to I probably would've have been home by midnight already because I'm not really the type to go out and get super drunk. I plan on asking my coworker if she'd give it to her friend for me.

this is the card: https://imgur.com/a/XjGKb

16,Just now I kind of had a bit of a break down over yet another redditor suggesting  my agenda would actually be tyrannical if put into place ugh... I don't know what I should do with this relevation. I need to rethink my entire idealogy but how?!,29Jan2018,2
17,"Ok so these last couple weeks I've faced a moral dilemma of sorts. A white-tailed spider made its home in my bathtub. At first, I was afraid - I was brought up with the myth that white-tailed have necrotic bites - but I figured it wasnt doing me any harm, so I let it be. It disappeared, and I thought it had crawled down the plug hole and that was that. I was wrong.

Turns out, white-tailed spiders are nocturnal hunters. So during the day, bath-bro would hide in the plug hole and late at night it'd come out and hunt. After a bit of time, I got kind of used to it. Whenever I'd pull a late one doing some work or playing video games, I'd go to the loo and it would be there - diligently patrolling the bath for prey.

The problem, I realised, is that white-tailed spiders only eat other spiders. How many spiders did I expect to land in my bathtub? Probably not many. At this point I realised that, unless I either squished it or rescued it, I was probably consigning bathbro to a long unpleasant death by starvation, but I decided to let nature take its course. I wouldn't squish spiderbro, but I wouldn't rescue it either. 

It was kind of impressive, the way that it would just keep prowling the bath night after night. I almost looked forward to watching it whenever I woke up to pee. Slowly though, I noticed signs that bathbro wasn't doing so great. It stopped hiding, was the first one. I'd wake up, and it would just be up at one end of the bathtub - I assume not hiding to conserve energy. Then I noticed it was visibly skinnier. It started to lie prone rather than on its feet.

One particularly hot day, I saw it struggling to walk. I figured that was probably the end, but I ran a tiny amount of water into the bath - just enough to leave some splashes near it, and I left it at that. Next day, still not hiding, but visibly 'better'.

Today, a few days later, I couldn't do it anymore. Partially because I felt guilty, but mostly because I wanted to take a bath, the time had come for me to take a stand on bathbro. Normally for white-tails, my go-to is squishing. But I couldn't do it this time.

I found the longest bathroom implement I could (a shower squeegee for those playing at home) and gently pushed it under bathbro's front legs. At first, there was only a very slow response - like it was half dead. This immediate impression was incorrect - bathbro was only sleeping. Once it woke up, it bolted. Eventually though I eased it onto the squeegee and walked it downstairs before putting it into the garden out the back. It was the calmest I've ever seen a spider being put out. Like it was just enjoying the ride.

I'm kind of sad that bathbro is gone, but I know it will find plenty of little garden spiders out the back to munch on. Give em hell, bathbro. ",29Jan2018,3
18,"A few weeks ago I put up some ""fairy lights"" around an item to warm up an area of a room.  These lights are battery operated, not plug in.  After a few hours they automatically turn themselves off, it's part of the design.

However, the lights also turn themselves ON. Is this part of the design?  It's very random. Such as I've woken during the night and noticed them on in the other room, when I hadn't turned them on at all, all night.  Or when I came out of the shower the other morning and they were on, in broad daylight. Another time I came home from being gone all day and they were on.  It happens almost daily and it's just...strange. It's not the same setting each time either (it can be flashing, solid, intermittent et al).

No other lights in my house do this.

So, does anyone else have these battery operated lights (the kind you have to push a button rather hard to get to turn on, and you have a choice of seven settings) and experiencing this?",29Jan2018,6
19,"My mom kissed and flirted with another guy, one of her old classmates. 
I found out  while reading the text conversation they had on her iPad because I thought something was off, I know snooping is wrong but I just had to know. 
They were flirting and meeting up in secret after her work and she told him she doesn’t regret the kiss, so I confronted her about it.. 
she was in denial first but after I told her I didn’t believe her a couple of times she finally told me they kissed and that he was just a flirt and that he wasn’t a threat. She repeatedly told me that this family means everything to her and that she loves my dad very much and so on and so on. So I told her if this is really important she should just cut this guy off and never talk to him again.. at first she tried to convince me again that he wasn’t a threat but after a while she said she’d do it. Now she wants me to not tell dad and I do not want to be put into a situation like that because I love my dad and I think he deserves to know. So I said I’m not gonna tell him for now, but my mom should. I saw that she was really desperate and probably didn’t think of the consequences if anyone found out. She does not want to tell my dad because it would “cause unnecessary negative emotions and trouble and that the whole thing was not worth something that would cause serious issues In the family” 
I don’t know what to do because I don’t want to lie to my dad because he is the best dad ever and I don’t want to take her side but on the other hand she seems genuinely sorry and desperate about her cheating. She told me that if my dad cheated she didn’t wanna know it..

20,"Right so as the title says, I call myself a Socialist because it's easier. Family gathering were a nightmare, small talk that lead to politics was hell, but not because it leads to a disagreement between the other party and I. But because I'd have to go through the whole rigamarole of explaining that I hold SOME socialistic ideals (respect the working class, no one company should be too terribly big, wealth inequality is bad,  ect) but I understand that a purely socialistic or communistic government doesn't work, I'd always use the same examples. Russia under Stalin, North Korea, yadda yadda yadda. But then it gets even more confusing. The other party would say something along the lines of

""Oh well just call yourself a liberal/Democrat."" 

Not that simple. Because I hold some right leaning ideals (guns are good, free college cost too much in taxes, ect). Then the other party comes up with

""Oh well why not just be an independent.""

Oh fuck off with that. Independent parties hardly help anyone, yeah the can lean one way or another, but not nearly enough to influence anything in a major way, if the could effect anything then they wouldn't be all that independent.

About a couple weeks ago i quit my old decent paying job in the worst way possible in order to work somewhere else. I started to work for the new company and it was all well for about a month. All of a sudden i got really depressed and began to lose motivation in everything i did. I faked being sick to not go to work and just stay in bed the whole day doing nothing. It got to a point where i just didn't call in anymore, i just never showed up. I got fired not long after that.

I'm on a lease so i can't exactly leave without paying.My final paycheck was supposed to be mailed to me, but it's been more than a week and nothing has come in.  If i don't pay my rent on time then i get charged an extra 300 every month from then on. I'm on the verge of desperation. My depression is getting bad. Everyday i stay indoors worrying about what to do. I barely get any sleep and i'm scared that i'll end up doing something stupid.

24,"So I feel like I have reached a bit of a low point in my career and I am really torn and have no idea what to do. Therefore, I am turning to you, lovely reddit people for a bit of advice and sanity check I guess. 
Before I get into it, I know that I shouldn't be companing, because my situation could be much worse, and I know there are plenty of people in a worse position than me. I just want to know what someone else in my position might do, and it's always better to ask a lovely stranger on the internet, right?
My situation is that I had a job in PR in a mid-range company. Of course there were some ups and downs, but overall I enjoyed the work there, I liked the people I worked with for the most part, and the money wasn't half bad. However, I am also doing my masters degree in the mean time, and it is in Information systems. So nothing to do with that job - it was purely based off on my bachelors degree. I therefore decided to leave in order to go for an internship in the field of business process management. It has been two months since I started.. and I hate it. I don't feel like I fit in with the team, I do not feel comfortable in the new position, and I do not feel like I am right for the job. I thought it is just anxiety around the change and all, but with every day, I just feel worse and worse. It is affecting my mental health at this point, and I am dreading every time I have to wake up and go back to work. 
I think there is a chance for me to go back to my old position (I have had a meeting with my previous boss). I am really torn on whether I should try to tough it out, or just give up. Please send help!!!",29Jan2018,1
25,"I don’t even know where to begin. My life is completely spiralling right now and I feel so fucking helpless. For a few months there things were actually looking up. I started back at college and actually made an effort to attend class, instead of ditching it and just barely scraping a pass like last year. I started hanging out with this girl I really like. She has a boyfriend, but over the past year we’ve become really close and we’ve both told each other we consider the other best friends. I posted about that the other day here and how much it means to me, and that Im just happy having someone in my life who cares so much about me. It had me so motivated to do better. I took up reading. I studied. I didn’t force myself to work my shitty job as much. It looked like maybe things could look up.

But in the past week or so everything has just got so fucking shitty, to the point where my future looks insanely bleak and my life is gonna be ruined. To start with, I got shitty grades in that semester of college, despite having put in more effort than last year. I’m likely gonna get kicked out at the end of the year unless I pull off a miracle. I’m terrified of the future, like I have no idea what I want to do with my life. If I’m not at college I’ll be working a shitty part time job (that I hate every minute of) full time, and I cannot think of anything worse. But that’s what I’ll be faced with.

In regards to my best friend, she’s in a really shitty mood with me. We’ve had deep conversations before about how people just have sex without thinking or whatever, and how we could only really be intimate with someone we have true feelings for. And I really, honestly do feel that way. But that weekend I went out and got shitfaced drunk and made out with 2 girls in the one night. One used to be a good friend of hers, who she argued with and was annoyed that I kissed. The other girl is just some girl I know, but my friends found me making out with her hilarious and put it on social media, and they won’t stop bringing it up. I feel embarrassed as fuck, my best friend is barely even replying to me right now. We usually talk all day, but she’s outright ignoring some of my messages, and if she replies it’s short and just a way to kill the conversation. She probably thinks I’m just some sleazy asshole, and that I was bullshitting her or something. I just feel like fucking shit. 

I have an office party with the people I work with and my best friend is gonna be there since we also work together. I don’t know what’s gonna happen between us if there’s alcohol involved, I feel like we might argue, which hurts me so damn much. I don’t even want to leave my house right now, let alone go to some party, but I basically have to. A couple of weeks ago I had someone who truly cared for me, I thought I was doing better at college, I was trying to be better. And in a couple of weeks I’ve just fucked it all up. I feel like fucking BoJack Horseman man. I’m just a complete fuck up. I tried to fix shit and I’ve managed to make everything worse. In a few months I could end up being a college drop out, working a shitty dead end job and who managed to fuck things up with one of the only people who really, truly cares about me. I’ve sat all day like paralysed with anxiety about all this, it feels like somebody’s crushing my chest. I feel like utter, utter shit and I don’t know how I can fix any of this. What the fuck is wrong with me man. ",29Jan2018,1
26,"The previous weekend (January 20) I confessed to my friend that I have feelings for her and want to be with her. She said she didn't feel the same way. I told her that was fine and didn't pursue it further. This past weekend (January 26-28) I hung out with her like normal and we had a good time. On Sunday in the morning she called and asked if I still felt the same. I said I did and she told me she wanted to be with me. 

We had a really fun time Sunday evening chatting, cuddling, watching The Office and a movie, and making out. We eat together that night, as in literally not sex yet. However, we did discuss our tastes in porn and what turns us on, and I think we'll be great sexually.  I'm really happy right now. 

edit: turns out she was just upset some other guy didn't want to be with her and she doesn't care about me at all",29Jan2018,74

I'm in a marriage because she has helped me take care of my mom and my kids, and she works so hard every day that I can't abandon her and the kids. I know the advice here is to leave because it'll make them happy but I'm not built that way and I can't make myself think that way.

33,"Disclaimer: before anyone berates me, yes I know that not all guys are like this! I'm sure that there are guys who are genuinely nice.


Ok, so I live in a college dormitory and there's a communal kitchen that the whole 2nd floor shares. At night I usually go in there to cook my dinner and then sit at the kitchen table to eat because it's a nice quiet spot. Sometimes even if I'm not eating, I'll just sit in there to drink wine and watch Netflix on my phone. The aforementioned ""nice guy"" used to occasionally use the kitchen around the same time I did, so here and there we'd chitchat while his ramen was cooking or whatever. I always was impressed by how polite and helpful he was. All of the girls on my floor knew him and thought he was such a sweet dude. 

So, I should mention that I liked him as a PERSON, but I'm not attracted to this dude. Let's call him M. M is not hideous or anything extreme like that, he's just average or a little below. On a scale of one to ten I'd probably rate   him a 4 or 5.

One day two weeks ago I'm in there drinking wine and browsing through Reddit on my phone. M comes in and we chat and get on the subject of horror movies. He asked if there's any horror movie I've never seen and I said that I've never seen the human centipede, I was always too creeped out by the concept. So he invited me to come to his room that Sunday to drink wine and watch the human centipede.

Until that Sunday I didn't realize that his room is right across the hallway from my room. (Like when I open my door I see his door) so I thought oh Lord, that could get awkward. I didn't think this was going to be a date... I mean, we're watching the fucking human centipede. That's no way to seduce a woman.

So its sunday and he lets me in his room and I quickly realized that we were NOT on the same page. He wanted to watch the movie sitting on his bed and kicked his roommate out so we could have ""alone time."" ...ugh. I didn't want to straight up reject him out loud because he lives right across the hall from me so I knew that if he gets upset, shit is gonna be awkward being in such close proximity. I tried to give off non-verbal cues. Throughout the movie I'd sit on the end of his bed or move over to sit on his roommates bed. Each time I moved, M would say ""come back and cuddle with me!"" At one point he asked if he could kiss me and I said ""I'm sorry, this is too new"" and scooted away. He still didn't get the hint..... it didn't matter how much I moved away, this dude just would not get his paws off me. when the movie was over he kept asking me to stay the night and I said I miss my own bed and left.

Throughout the next week I got a few texts from M asking to hang out and I'd either make up an excuse to decline or not respond.

Last Thursday (I think?) I was sitting in the kitchen and M comes in. He says ""the red wine I bought to drink with you is still in my room if you want it, I'm not gonna drink it."" Wine is my weakness so you best believe I'll take two free bottles of it. When we go to his room to get those he gets obviously upset and says ""alcohol is the only reason you're talking to me right now!"" Then he proceeds to once again beg me to get in his bed and cuddle with him. I said no. So he pushes me down and physically restrains me from getting off the bed.

 I said ""no. Get off me. "" (while trying to push him away)

Him: Why?

Me: because no.

Him: why no?

Me: BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO!


.... and then he lets go and I leave.


So here we have the most stereotypical ""nice guy."" he couldn't pick up on basic social cues and physically restrained me from getting off his bed. So nice.....

Today I had an interview for a job, it went really well and they sounded so positive. Then I got a message saying I didn't get the job.

35,"Right now I'm supposed to be doing my homework.

Right now I'm supposed to be paying some late bills.

Right now I'm still waiting for a fucking therapist to call me back. I've called 9 in the span of a week, and only one has gotten back to me, only to tell me they aren't looking for patients.

I have no motivation to even start my homework. It's an independent project and I'm supposed to average 40 hours a week to get all of my credits at the end of the quarter. It's week 4 and I have 41 hours total. I've tried everything. I've exhausted all options and have reached out to everyone I know for support.

Someone told me to write everything down. I did that and it didn't work.

""If something is worth doing for 15 minutes, it's worth doing for longer."" I've tried that. Got nothing done.

I'm out of options. I know I have depression, but this is the absolute worst I've felt in my two years of knowing I have depression. I feel worthless. I feel like I'm failing myself and everyone around me.

I know I have potential, what's changed? What's so different now? Why am I so unproductive and why don't I care anymore?

Last year, I attempted suicide. This year,  I wouldn't even think about doing it again, not because it's a bad idea (which it is) but because that would mean putting in effort. That's right, I'm not even motivated enough to kill myself no matter how worthless I feel.

I'm just existing. I'm just sitting here in my dorm doing nothing, and it's been like that since September.

36,"I work for a manufacturing company with about 150 employees. I work in the HR dept. though I do more of the paper work. My boss deals mostly with the humans and I’m the resources. 

My problem is I have been with this company for awhile now and I still can not name most of the employees just by looking at them. When o started they all introduced themselves, but with trying to learn the job and everything else, most of their names just kind of fell out of my head. 

The weird thing is I deal with most of their files so I could probably name almost everyone who works here, but I don’t know who the hell is who. 
Since I’m one of the younger women who work here, they all learned my name pretty quickly, and I felt bad when they’d call me and be like “hey how’s it going, we haven’t seen you in awhile”. I would always just smile and chat with them. And then just feel bad I don’t know who they are. So I’ve just been faking it. 

I do most of my work in the office so I don’t interact with most of the employees very often, so hoping I would pick it up eventually has not happened. And most days I keep to myself and my work. I’m not the type to go out and initiate conversations. 
Any advice on how to learn these things later in the game after I’ve been working here for awhile?",29Jan2018,1

38,"I met a girl about a year ago during a course. We became good friends, but I knew the second I saw her I'd gotten a crush on her. With that very quick and teenage angst-y description of the situation, here's the deal.

Since the course ended, we continued talking *a bit*, but not for long. I never asked her out because she had a boyfriend (no idea what her situation is now, so I assume they're still together), but we remained friends.

I remember vaguely that we had a conversation that ended with her never reading the message I sent (or she did and I couldn't see it, I don't know) on Facebook. We had talked about grabbing lunch a lot earlier (that never actually became a reality), but I don't think that was the last message I sent her. We're still friends on Facebook, and I wished her a happy new year, but I never continued the conversation.

Now, it seems like we won't be talking again, and I don't want to be creepy and message her. I have been having some serious anxiety that I'll come off as creepy when I do something, so I rarely talk to old friends.

For some reason, she came up in my mind not too long ago. I've been having some love trouble, and I think this has caused her to come up again.

She was more friendly with a second girl, and I was just the late, third guy to the ""gang"". I haven't been talking much to that other girl either, less in fact (mainly because I've been interested in this first girl...). So I can't message her either, and I worry that I'll come off as extremely creepy if I do that as well.

Thing is, I have this urge to ask her out, which is obviously not all right, so I suppress it (and honestly, considering the social faux pas and the fact that it'll just end with a weird stamp on my forehead, I'm not *that* into it). But I can't for some reason get her out of my mind.

What do you suggest I do? Just leave it?

42,"Hi, everyone!

I'm 19yo, soon to be 20, and last year i pretty much screwed all my life up. Dropped out of college, left 3 jobs y less than 7 months, got debts, ended up with terrible person as girlfriend... well, it was not my best year.

Now, beginning 2018, i want (and need) to get my life back on track, but i literally don't know how and everything seems quite wrong in my life. First, i want to go back to college, so i just applied for it again, just have to wait but i'm pretty confident i'll be going in, so i would begin college again around August, but i still have to pay bills and i left my last job back on Nov, 30th. I only have 3 job experiences, all of them in call centers, two of them are 3 months long and one is only 1 month long. I have no experience in anything else, but need a job ASAP, i've applied to every single thing i can but have never received a call or nothing like that. The only interview i've gotten in these months was blown when they asked about my job experiences, since they are too short. Need money now, since i have just enough money to pay 1 more month of my bills. 

I came back to my parents house back in November, before i left my last job, so i'm not paying rent or food anymore, but i ahve to help them with some bills, so that's quite worrying, of course, much more than my mobile plan or such. 

Also, my girlfriend/ex girlfriend (Not sure anymore) has been giving me a lot of issues, but i just can't seem to leave her. I have no friends at all, no one, i've spent the last two months in my room and ocassionally leaving to see her, but i have nothing to do, no one to talk to, and it kills me. I realized i need to get my life together, i have to pay my debts, go back to study, get better in general, go to the doctor since i have a couple of health issues but i cannot seem to be able to get anything done. 

TL;DR: I fell useless, have no money, can't get a job, have no one to talk about besides my cheating ex, my family barely talks to me from time to time and i don't know what to do. Help!

Thanks in advance!

43,"So i’m a 17 year old female, and for my whole life I went to a private school, and half of the school was divided between genders (one half for girls and one for boys),  so i was around for girls my whole life basically, haven’t talked to any guys and guys haven’t talked to me. Back in 10th grade there was this girl who was new and came in a little late into the beginning of the year, and i remember just feeling this weird pull towards her, she’s extremely pretty and is extremely smart. I failed 9th grade math so had to redo it and she skipped that class and went to take 10th grade math lol:(, anyways every time i would see her in the hallways i would stare at her for a long time, she never noticed. I remember thinking about her so much in class, and looking around seeing if she was in the room. We follow each other on instagram and i would (still do) stare at her pictures and wonder how someone can be so pretty, that probably sounds creepy haha. Lastly i remember one time i was invited to some party with my friends and she was there and i remember she hugged me when i was leaving, and i literally went home and cried in the bathroom because i couldn’t believe she hugged someone like me lol. 

The thing is is that i know a lot of girls who are pretty but something about her makes me feel this weird way.

The reason why i asked this question is because i was just on instagram and i follow this girl and i felt the same way looking at her as i did as the other girl above. 

Also this info might help, i can’t talk to anyone about this because i’m muslim, my family is muslim, ALL of my friends are muslims, the private school i went to was a saudi one, the girl i was talking about is muslim....so yeah i’m kind alone in this.  And the thing is is that i don’t want to have these feeling towards girl i just want to have feeling towards guys. And it makes me feel maybe the reason why guys don’t like me or talk to me is because maybe i give off a gay vibe? lol i don’t know how else to word it but i don’t want to feel like this.

44,"I just needed to get this out, sorry if it doesn't fit. I'll remove it if it breaks any rules.

Ive been bullied my entire life, it's a normal thing by now, and I've become kind of numb to it. The insults usually roll right off my back. But today was the first insult that actually stuck with me throughout the entire day, and put a damper on my mood whenever I think about it.

So, last month I had a stroke, at 17 years old. It was the result of my family fighting, and it was honestly one of the scariest experiences I've ever had. It scared my family, and kind of screeched everything to a halt. I had to spend two days in a hospital because of it. It's been hanging over me ever since. It's kind of surreal. I've never felt anything like that, and I've never been the one in the ambulance. I lived on, and everything went back to normal afterwards.

But today, this kid who happens to share my name decided that he was going to use that as his vantage point. He looked at me and said ""I hope you have another stroke and die."" Now I can take a joke about my stroke, but this was an insult. I don't know why it hurts this bad. After all it's just an insult. I wish I could block that out too, but to have someone attack that moment. One of the scariest moments in my life hurt.

I don't mean in customer service. I mean I have a fire inside me that wants to help people. I get extremely upset seeing everything in the news with inequality. Especially towards POC, LGBT community, Woman, and Animals.

 I'm constantly getting different jobs all in customer service because I don't have experience in anything else. I feel like the only opportunity I have is a possibility of management in a retail store, Where I would have to push clutter on people that don't want clutter. As well even if someone clearly can't afford something I am told to push it on them anyways. Every retail store has a way of justifying why you shouldn't feel bad pushing sales on to people. I feel this is not a way of helping people and I don't want to do it anymore. 

I don't feel I'll ever be happy doing this and I don't know what job I could start that will make me feel like I'm making a difference. I volunteer but I don't see any opportunity to make money doing this. Don't get me wrong I'm more than happy to volunteer making 0 money. But I want to do this for a living and I don't know how I'd support myself by just volunteering.
