3,"For most of my life I have never really thought I had anxiety, especially when I was in middle school and learned about things like panic attacks and anxiety disorders. I've always thought that if that's what anxiety is I don't know what that feels like, besides within reason for things like a big exam coming up or something with pressure to perform. 

Lately I've been feeling nauseous much much more frequently and usually when I'm on campus. I mentioned how nauseous I had been feeling to a friend and she suggested it may be from anxiety. I had never even really connected nausea and anxiety. I'm now beginning to notice things about myself that I wonder may be manifestations from anxiety. I oftentimes feel the need to full blown cry when I'm alone, even without any reason - it could be while watching a food video or just home alone doing nothing in particular. I try to keep busy and I usually spend my weekends going out constantly or drinking or doing things, but this year I've tried to stay more dedicated to my studies and side projects and have been going out less. But going out less also makes me feel this overwhelming sense of sadness, and I feel this awful dread when I'm not out partying that feels like it's consuming me.  I know these things are minor, but I am beginning to wonder if I am starting to experience anxiety more and more, if I'm losing a handle of my emotions, and if there is anything I can do about this.

8,"...and it feels good. It feels really good, mainly cuz I just learned Ive already worked my last shift at my shitty winter job!

So I'm a wildland firefighter for the US Forest Service. I make okay money, enough to survive on, but I get laid off for about 6 months every year. In the past year or two, Ive gotten a promotion and slowly started working more than 6 months of the year. This year, I'm poised to work about 3/4's of the year. A good deal seeing as I like my work.

But also, having done this for awhile now, I've established regular winter work. Namely, working for a tree company part time and delivering pizzas. Both are crappy, thankless jobs, but really some of the only people that will pay me what I think I deserve and put up with my fluctuating schedule and eventual return to my normal job.

Well, my USFS boss called me the other day and says we're probably heading to the southeast (like the Carolinas) this next week (as it's fire season there?) and I'll be returning to work either way full time next pay period.

I just went into the pizza joint to check my schedule. I thought I worked tomorrow and had already talked to the manager about my upcoming return to work. But instead... I'm done there. Not fired, not quit, but no longer being scheduled...

Feels good man. I'm having a beer and will soon be back to my career job that I enjoy going to every day.

9,"I’m not seeking for advice. I just want to get the word out. 

My father makes really loud noises when eating. Over the past years I developed this anger because of this. To the point that whenever he starts eating or I get out of the room or I immediately put earbuds and listen to music while he eats. 

This is unfortunately something irrational. I love my dad and I want all the best for him. My discomfort is not greater than his right to live without his son complaining about something so small like that. Rationally, I should ignore and not react badly. Irrationally I get this urge to stop hearing his eating sounds. When he is adding food to his plate I almost always think: come on. He is doing the most human and natural thing to do: eating. His day is go to work, go back home, eat dinner and sleep. So please, I think to myself, let him eat as he eats and stop being a pussy about this. He is doing NOTHING wrong.

And every time I think I’ll let it go, but my negative reaction is stronger than me. I can’t stand it. 

I don’t know if he noticed it. It could be that he doesn’t know. We are both introspective and don’t talk much to each other. But it saddens me to think that he could have figure it out why I act so weird whenever he is eating yet doesn’t say his feelings are hurt. 

I know it is stupid. I really wish my reactions were based on rationality. How can one force oneself to stop getting annoyed by something they know shouldn’t annoy, but it does?",04Mar2018,2

11,"I want to tell you all a story, the story of my grandpa as I knew him.  I might get a little long winded with it, so I apologize in advance for the wall of text.

He was a good man, my grandpa. A kind man.  That's how I would describe him if I had to narrow it down to one word.  After serving in the Navy, he married my grandma and settled down out in the green rolling country in a big farmhouse with a wraparound porch.  So many things in it he made himself, like the railings on the stairs or the kitchen cabinets.  My little brother and I were lucky enough to spend a lot of time there growing up, I'd say over half of the weekends that I was in school, and as often as we could during the summer and winter breaks.  It was surrounded by huge old hardwoods, and a creek ran through the back yard.  He had a little man cave off to the side with a front window, and he used to watch old movies there and ""practice"" on his banjo, which even as kids we could tell he couldn't play worth a damn.  (But that didn't stop him from trying!)

The house as I remember it was always busy.  They knew the mailman's name.  That's just alien to my mind today.  Who knows their mailman's name these days?  There were family and friends coming and going all the time.  Something was always cooking in the kitchen, either for us or for the next door neighbors who were basically like family to them.  My grandma hosted a bible study in the living room for her church friends, and my grandpa liked to get his friends together for poker, where they'd crack inappropriate jokes and let us kids sneak sips of their (alcoholic) drinks, if grandma hadn't already sent us up to bed, tut-tuttering at everyone involved.

And not just people, but animals.  I vaguely remember a goat who died when I was very young, and even after that he was a foster father for dogs for many years, and so there were always dogs of all kinds coming and going in his home, despite my grandma's constant insistence that they stay outside the house.  (Although she loved them too!)  He cared for them all, and was always sad when he had to let them go.  Eventually an old collie/retriever mix named Pepper stole his heart, and he decided that he was too old for more fostering, so Pepper got to stay.  She had a spot on the front porch where the sun would shine in the morning, and my grandpa liked to sit out there with her.

We were close, the three of us. But then, he wasn't the type to just let you not be his friend. He probably could've made friends with a crocodile. He was one of those rare people who could look right down into your soul and see everything that was beautiful in it, pull it out into the light, and hold it up for everyone around to see and admire.  He had a patchy brown and grey beard, and was fond of red flannel shirts and white pocket handkerchiefs.  He wore a brown leather belt with a shiny brass buckle cast in the shape of an oak leaf ([kind of like the bottom one, closest thing google gave me](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0093/9582/products/oak_leaf_belt_buckle.jpg?v=1311702007)), and he always smelled like cedar trees and tobacco. He had this look that he'd give people, as though they were both partners in crime and planning some big heist. His bushy old-man eyebrows would wiggle and you'd see a twinkle in his eye, then he'd wink and give you a grin. Whenever he laughed, it was genuine.  He'd cock his head to one side like he was really thinking over what was funny, then he'd throw it back and let loose this booming laugh that made everyone nearby want to laugh, too. 

He was madly in love with my grandma, and even into their 80's they'd slow dance in their living room, or try to throw little pieces of food into each other's mouths from across the kitchen table with us sitting there watching, then giggle like schoolkids when they (usually) missed.  Not very grandparenty at all, that last bit.  My grandma is crazy about Boston Baked Beans, they're her favorite candy.  She had a small jar of them on the kitchen counter that she'd nibble from, and my grandpa was always hiding it around the house with little hand written love letters taped to it.  One time he handed me the jar with his note on it and said, ""Here son, go hide this where your grandma will find it.""  So, being 6 years old, I immediately ran out to the shed and climbed up onto the workbench so I could reach the highest shelf, and stuffed it as far back behind all the tools and old boxes and jars of tacks as I could get it.  Feeling rather proud of myself, I turned around to see my grandpa standing in the doorway, smiling and wagging his finger at me.

I honestly thought my grandma was going to have a heart attack one time.  I had been upstairs trying to do my homework for the weekend, when I heard my grandpa yelling outside.  I ran downstairs and my little brother was standing on the back porch looking rather sheepish, *covered* head to toe in mud from the creek.  My grandpa was almost crying he was laughing so hard as he got the hose out.  Then he stopped, and that familiar twinkle came into his eye.  ""Actually, boys, I have a better idea.""  Half an hour later, all three of us were covered in mud, laughing our butts off and throwing clumps of it at each other.  When grandma got home, she was... not happy.  But it was worth it.

One of his favorite foods were malted milkshakes, and he had a much-used [drinkmaster](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/b5/4b/5a/b54b5ae8829f72fe7f9b6772e573cd7e--milkshake-maker-drink-mixer.jpg) that he made them in.  It was a tradition that when we came over, grandpa would have milkshakes ready to go.  We'd charge up the front steps, hug grandma at the door and drop off our backpacks, then, usually forgetting to take our shoes off, we'd fly into the kitchen where grandpa would throw his arms out and yell something like, ""HEY, YOU HOOLIGANS!  WHAT ARE YOU KIDS DOING IN MY HOUSE!"" then he'd give us each malted milkshakes to kick off the visit.

He wasn't perfect, my grandpa.  His relationship with my dad was never the best, although there was love there.  Apparently he was dismissive of my dad when he was younger and tried to pigeonhole him into the sort of man my grandpa thought he should be.  He was hard on him, and wasn't supportive of my dad's ideas, so this caused a lot of resentment and bitterness, and even more regret.  But as he always used to say, ""You can't get better if you never make mistakes.""  My dad was into the Allman Brothers Band in the 70's, and so my grandpa had a lot of his old records that he didn't take with him.  Unlike a lot of dads, he actually listened to his son's music and tried to appreciate it even though he was a bit before its time, I now suspect out of a desire to reconcile or atone.  One that he really liked was the ""Eat a Peach"" album, and it wasn't uncommon to hear it playing out in the shed as he was puttering away at some project, with Pepper hovering underfoot.  His favorite song was [Blue Sky,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwyXQn9g40I) and to this day I can't hear it without thinking of him.  It makes me think of that old house and that old smile, overflowing with kindness for the world and everything in it.

He used to take us both to the barbershop in town and we'd go get ice cream afterwards, and he always paid the lady behind the counter for an extra cone, for the next customer. You remember stuff like that when you're a kid. You watch it and learn from it, which is, I think, maybe why he did it.  I remember one time we were on our way to the hardware store for who knows what, and he stopped to help a random family with their broken down car. It turned out that they were on their way to a wedding, so he insisted on giving them a ride to the church (which was over half an hour away), and my brother and I had to ride in the bed of the truck!  He got their phone number and a few days later he made a point to call them and see if everything worked out. He was like that.  

He had an old handmade walnut rocking chair on his back porch that he'd sit in every Sunday evening, and when I was born, he made me my own toddler-sized chair. Every few years he'd make me a slightly bigger one, and my brother would get the hand-me-down, until finally he made us both chairs the same size as his.  We used to sit out there on his back porch in the evenings together, as the sun sank down over the horizon.  He'd plunk down a big burlap bag full of in-shell peanuts and sit there slowly puffing on his pipe, looking out over the world and happy as a clam.  Sometimes we'd listen to bluegrass, sometimes we'd listen to nothing but the wind through the leaves and the frogs and crickets chirruping away down by the creek.

On our weekend visits, Monday mornings were always the worst.  Grandpa would wake us up at the crack of dawn by sitting in the chair in our room and trying to play his banjo.  Grandma would feed us something filling like biscuits or grits, then give us our lunch bags and a peck on the cheek, and grandpa would drive us back into town and drop us off at school.  Every time, just before he drove away, he'd say, ""Don't you kids take any wooden nickels, you hear?""  He'd say that every time, even when we were both older and just rolled our eyes.  After that it was back to life as usual.

Now that he's gone, the world feels like a smaller place. There aren't many people like that anymore. Those calm evenings in that back yard with my grandpa, those are some of the happiest memories I have.  I hope that one day I'll be able to make more with my own grand kids.",04Mar2018,36

13,"I’m a 20 year old female college student. I’m concerned with my moral compass. I’ve never been a particularly principled person, it seems like I would do things that most people wouldn’t based on their principles. But I do feel like I am very compassionate and empathize with people. I am very involved with community service, I feel moved by injustice, and I am interested in humanitarian work. 

I do things or think of things that just aren’t right, and the problem is that I don’t realize they are that wrong until someone recoils and explains it. For example, I wanted my boyfriend to secretly record him and another girl but he, being a very principled person, said that was messed up and wrong. I didn’t really understand how it was wrong until he told me. But even then when he told me I didn’t necessarily see it as such a wrong. 

I definitely am against murder and serious issues like that but I am just concerned that I am truly a bad person. I don’t even realize some of the stuff I do or suggest is bad? Is there any explanation for this? Should I talk to a professional? ",04Mar2018,1
15,"
I am a female in my early 20s who recently bought a house back in July with my boyfriend. I’ve worked very hard from the time I was 16. I graduated from community college at 18 a week before high school, and basically was an annoying  “over achiever” as I’ve been told.

I hit a rough spot for a few years out of high school but that was because I was in an abusive relationship and stupid. The only “pro” out of those years was that I was in a way forced to climb the ladder in my job and make more money for the sucker who was mooching off of me. 
I smartened up and dumped him. I later quit that job because it sucked the life out of me everyday. 
Now I’m content working part-time and going back to school to pursue what I’ve always wanted to do - Legal Research/Paralegal/law.

I own my car. I don’t have much debt other than this house I share, a small personal loan I used to pay off credit cards, and soon - upcoming student loan that might qualify for reimbursement from my current job.

Sounds great right? It is, in a way. However, I’m very lonely. I don’t really like to broadcast a lot of this stuff about myself to people I meet because of course no one wants to hang out with someone who has many of the things we all seem to be working towards. 

The one friend I do have has no goals in life and constantly criticizes me for “waisting my time” with school and having debt. Mind you she lives with her bf in his dad’s house and quits jobs anytime it conflicts with her “fun plans.” 

The other friend I have is expecting her second child, something she already couldn’t afford the first time, got married (again) but this time to an awesome guy. Is just all around busy being a mom and wife, rightfully so. 

So I really don’t have anyone that is on a similar level with me or pace. I don’t really expect or need anyone to be, but I’ve just been hurt by people in the past who seem to hate what I have or pursue. I’d probably hate me too I guess. 

I come from very humble beginnings, my family use to sleep in our mini van so I from a young age was determined to never end up like that in life. I appreciate everything I learned from growing up really poor and have some great role-models in my life that helped me become somewhat successful. 

I just want someone to come hang out with me. Or walk around the neighborhood. Or go to a local event together. Talk to. 
I’m mostly a home body and my boyfriend and I are best friends so he keeps me sane. The only fun things I do involve visiting my grandparents, and my siblings whom I’m close with all moved out of state. I go to the gym a lot when I’m lonely. I shop by myself. 

I need a girl-friend.

I crave social interaction all of the time and I feel bored if I don’t have it..it’s like an itch. I’d honestly rather do nothing with a group of people than do nothing alone and it scares me that I’m not comfortable with just myself anymore. It’s so frustrating that I can’t find fulfillment in anything unless other people are involved but I don’t have any clue how to change it. I don’t think I’m depressed but fuck this is really making me sad. I’ve been alone all day which has progressively made me feel even worse and I hate it. ",04Mar2018,7

I am a young man, 21 years old, studying in a foreign country away from my parents. They are still paying most of my expenses. I have always wanted to get away from them, not because I don't like it around them, I just love the freedom I have when alone - nobody tells me I have to go to bed, nobody can control when I go out and what time I come back home... just the stuff that every teenager would appreciate. Nothing out of the ordinary. Let's get to my problem tho - ever since high school I have been procrastinating a lot. YouTube, Facebook, card games, smoking pot, girls... and that habits didn't leave me when I went abroad to go to university. Procrastinating has become my full-time job. I'm now 5th semester, and I have already switched my study cause I failed the exams and although Im doing a little bit better concerning my education, procrastination has never stopped - I'm still having all that career suicidal habits. I need a change. I have to change - Big time. I have now understood that I can't loose any more precious time and I have to concetrate on the important stuff - studying, getting good scores for my degree in order to be able to qualify for a nice master degree later, staying fit and managing a budget(which I have also been struggling with). The real problem is, I have had the same thoughts before that I need a change in my life but my motivation and will to succeed didn't last longer than 10 days or something. I'm now wondering and I really need an advice, from personal experience it would be best....

I try to eat somewhat healthy meals (most of the time,  though this week has been a write off). I went through the lists of meat: chicken, no; turkey, no; pork, no; beef, no; lamb, no; fish, ugh, no.

I don't eat much bread anymore, I avoid pasta for the most part, and even cheese is seldom had just because these things don't agree with me if I have too much.

I honestly just think I've become a lot pickier than I used to be. Like, if I'm going to spend like an hour cooking something, it better be damn tasty.

41,"It's all because of this girl at my university. I really didn't think too much about her at first, she was just someone I would talk to during breaks. Then one day, we were discussing something with 3-4 other people.... can't even remember what about. She insisted it was one way, I insisted it was the other. Whatever the topic was, she *really* wanted people to agree with her about it, and I was in her way. She actually got offended after that apparently, because she stopped greeting me altogether. I would say hi to her and she would say nothing, just plain ignored me.

I was already feeling insecure when the semester started. I was afraid I would struggle to make friends, so inadvertently offending someone enough that they would ignore me wasn't ideal. Maybe everyone else thought I was unpleasant to be around as well, and I just didn't get that? Maybe I was overcompensating by being excessively familiar and people found it off-putting? In any case, it was something that needed to be fixed.

So I tried to be more distant with her, then more friendly, whatever worked. And I noticed that whenever I could manage to get a normal conversation out of her, or if I said something she found amusing, it would make me happy. And if another guy said something to her that made her smile (highly unusual as she's normally grimmer than a famine in Ethiopia), I would actually feel *jealous about it*. I started noticing things like her eyebrows being lighter than her hair, and that's she's blonde originally. I'm pretty much in full-blown crush mode.

The girl is like 5 feet tall, she's maybe a B-cup and she dresses like the goth kids from South Park. She has a pretty face and objectively there are attractive things about her, but what really stands out about her is how stuck up she is. Is it healthy to like someone because of how bitchy they are?",04Mar2018,0

45,"I live in a house with the woman who owns the house and a younger housemate who doesn't clean up after themselves and can be pretty loud sometimes on calls and games or whatever.

Lady got fed up with him and chewed him out but while she was doing it, she brought up my name and was all ""I don't want her to feel like she has to leave because you can't clean up after yourself."" And I'm over here just like... that was never an option. I suffer in silence. Mutter to myself when no one is around when I'm angry. Avoid conflict and confrontation at all cost.

Now I must also avoid this housemate.",04Mar2018,3
46,That’s almost always my answer when I’m asked that. It’s not true I’ve done things like I travel I cook there have been interesting things that happen at my job. Hell I could talk about Netflix or podcasts and definitely music. I’m not good at talking about myself. It makes me uncomfortable. Like rambling about whatever not having a point while seeing everyone looking at me just staring. “Nothing” sucks. Literally anything is more interesting and fun. Why am I not good at talking about myself?,04Mar2018,3
47,"Why are people always thinking I am some sort of thug/low life/purse snatcher/car thief/terrorist/rapist/kidnapper/creep? 

I always leave the house in jeans or khakis and a polo or collar shirt and combed hair, smelling good.

Is it my skin color?

Is it my social skills?

Is it the way I walk?

Is it my face/facial expression?

Is it my glasses?

Is it a combination?",04Mar2018,2

50,"why do people think life stops after they turn 40 or 50...

came across too many posts lately mentioning age as a 'deterrent' to - *insert pretty much anything here* - (learn new skill/ have fulfilling relationship/ have sex/ get a new job/ start a business...)

what's preventing people from living their life in the moment, because future is not promised to anyone and age truly is just a number, unless you let it to have a hold of you...",04Mar2018,9
53,"Every time a see a train passing in real life or a video of a train approaching and passing in front of me (or the camera) I desperately need to look at my watch or phones clock. I think that it's more than just an ocd-like behavior. I feel the urgency to do it and I always have a strange feeling that It's obligatory to look at the clock and memorize the exact time for a while as the train passes by. 

I do it as long as I remember my self. 

Does anyone have an explanation?
