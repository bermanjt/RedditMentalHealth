1,I have multiple people I want to get ahold of including my biological parents my half sister and an entire family lost in another state. I was adopted as a baby because my parents didn't have their shit together and I lost all contact 2 years ago. I only remember a faint image of my mother and only what I have seen in dreams of my father. I know the image of my mother in my head is right but I can't remember anything of what my father looks like. It is very emotional when someone brings it up because I have a younger half sister who has no contact with her brother and hasn't seen him since she was little. It is also depressing to not know what age she is for sure. I have cousins grandparents aunts uncles who haven't seen me in forever. I don't even know if both of my grandparents are alive. ,19Apr2018,3
2,"Everything in my Life.
What are the parts of my life? 
What is everything I do? 
What is everything I think about? 
Who are the people that are important me? 

When I identify what’s in my life.. can I change it? Make it better? Who am I? I don’t know. Do I want to know? I don’t know. 

Is personality even real? Are there really limits to what I can be because of my personality? I could change so easily. I bet I could. So why does anything that’s going on now, even matter? 

I’m not depressed, I’m not suicidal. I know what those two are, and I’m neither. But everything feels pointless when you think about it. I’ve been taught that to prosper I have to get a good job that pays well. But If true happiness can be found getting little money with only a highschool diploma, then why go to college? Why go and get a better job when the only benefit is money? 

For society? Hah, like I care. I don’t care about society until it causes problems for me. And maybe that’s the case with everything for everyone. Nothing really matters until it’s causing problems. 
But then people say that people matter. 

That there are people who are important and bring happiness... happiness. 

What an interesting word. 

It’s meaning is so loose and has, in reality, little value. But I guess it’s a feeling, and what are feelings? 
Do they even matter? 
Maybe those movies about society without feelings are wrong. Because maybe life is better when you can’t feel anything. 
But maybe life seems pointless when you can’t feel anything. 
But to feel that life is pointless, you’d need feelings. 
Ahh, what a loophole. So life feels pointless with feelings, yet it is pointless without. But hey, maybe feeling is a good thing. 

After all, that’s always the argument. 

The argument being that feelings are good because it means you’re human. I am human. Or maybe I’m not. We’re the most intelligent species, yet we cannot define ourselves. How.. I don’t know. I wish I had a word to describe us, yet I don’t. But then again, neither does the human race.",19Apr2018,3
3,"Yesterday started much like any other, but a lot had changed by the time it ended. I took the kids to school as usual, then my wife and I spent a few hours cleaning the house. I was working on May's budget when my wife noticed a missed call and a voicemail from her lawyer.  My wife sustained a spinal cord injury during a surgical procedure in 2015 and she had filed a malpractice lawsuit a little over a year ago.  We were in the litigation phase of the lawsuit and depositions (that had already been scheduled and rescheduled several times) were about 2 weeks away.  We had been anticipating another delay but the urgency and tone in the lawyer's voice sounded more serious than that.

The Dr's attorney had produced a piece of evidence a few months ago that implied that the statute of limitations for malpractice had expired before the lawsuit had been filed.  In my state the statute of limitations is 1 year from the date the patient suspects malpractice; or three years from the date of injury, which ever happens first.  Our attorney had warned us that the defense would likely use this piece of evidence to file a Motion for Summary Judgement to dismiss the case based on statute of limitations, and that a Judge (or jury) would make a determination based on the information contained in each side's motion.  We had been expecting it but that's not what they did.

What they did instead was hire an expert neurosurgeon from a big name hospital to review the case, and the expert's opinion was that the standard of care was not violated.  The defense then used this opinion to file a Motion for Summary Judgement to dismiss because the standard of care was not violated.  Our attorney told us that in order to even respond to the Motion they would have to hire their own expert to review the case and give an opposing opinion which would cost approx $10-15k.  

Our attorney told us that our case was unlikely to survive a challenge on the statute of limitations, and they were unwilling to front the cost of an expert knowing that.  We were told that we could file a Motion to keep the case alive while we attempt to find new counsel or we could agree to drop the case, and that if we didn't agree to either option they would file a motion to remove themselves from the case.  We were told that there was one other option though, and they went on to describe what I can only call an emotional hail Mary to the other side.  Given no real other options we opted for the hail Mary, and we've been told we'll know the results of that by the end of the week.  

We would've been satisfied with losing after having our day in court, but our day in court was stolen from us for the cost of an expert opinion.  If we could self fund this case we would ride it out to trial, and if we lost we'd lose with honor and integrity. But we can't because the malpractice insurance company that covers the defense attorney's fees is willing and able to outspend the victim to avoid a trial.

This is the 8th malpractice suit against this specific surgeon, all but 2 have been dismissed based on statute of limitations, and my State's medical board has never been notified about any of them. As far as they know this surgeon has never hurt anyone.

Although it had been fun ""fantasy spending"" one of those large malpractice judgements or settlements you hear about, I never really expected to win, I just wanted justice...but there's no justice to be had for the poor.  People like us just don't come into money like that, and when they do, it typically kills them.  So maybe this is a blessing in disguise.  

Feel free to ask me anything about malpractice and I'll do my best to answer based on my experience without disclosing private details about our case. ",19Apr2018,139
4,"So, it hasn't been my first year on reddit yet so I still don't know all the rules. Apparently using the freekarma4u subreddit is a bad thing??? I had no idea. But as soon as I made post, I was banned from r/dankmemes and r/videos. It was explained in pm that freekarma4u is not conducive to a healthy reddit environment, so I was banned.

I pm'd r/dankmemes and told them I was unaware of the rule and apologized. They forgave me and I vowed not to use freekarma again. But pm'ing r/videos, I was ignored. I pm'd once when I was first notified I was banned, and I pm'd again before I went to bed. Four days later and the mods of r/videos never contacted me. So I pm'd a little while ago, and now I am banned from messaging the mods completely. ""Temporarily muted"" for 72 hours as the automod told me. I don't understand what I did wrong. r/videos has not contacted me, and I have been respectful in the pm's. I honestly don't plan on using freekarma again, I just want r/videos to answer me.",19Apr2018,1
5,"I never really wanted to be successful.

I grew up fairly poor and had a reasonably shitty childhood with some early life trauma around my father being arrested when I was 2. Growing up it was my expectation that I would end up dead at 30 of a heroin overdose, living in a loft over a bar somewhere and scraping by playing underpaid gigs for drug and rent money.

I was a poor student; I went to a for-profit university and was a poor student there too. Despite this, I've been...wildly successful at my life. Between my wife and I we're well over six figures in yearly income and even living in a fairly high cost of living part of the country, we're more than comfortable. Nothing illegal, all above board work in a productive field. I'm well-respected at my job and my boss and coworkers like me.

When I was poor (and I grew up quite poor, with my mother working 80 hour weeks when my stepdad was laid off and having to skip meals or get food from food banks), I hated people who were rich. I hated how people with fancy lifestyles would go on TV shows and talk about how they had problems.

Now that I'm well-off, I just mostly hate myself. I hate that I am stressed out by recent renovations, or that I'm worried about my job. I got into an argument online and someone said that I was a centrist rather than left, and it was such a jarring thing that it left me depressed for a whole day. I get stressed out asking contractors to do work *even though it's their job and I'm paying them to do it.*

This is all objectively ridiculous. I'm a logical person. I understand this is all ridiculous. It doesn't help.

I don't really know what the point of this is. I'm just feeling kind of overwhelmed and wanted somewhere to say it. I just feel guilty about being successful, and I don't know how I'm going to make that go away.",19Apr2018,3
6,"Jump to bottom for question without the prompt story. 

I am a daily patron of my local Starbucks in the early morning. Occasionally I will head out to a larger location at night because my local Starbucks has a large turnover of Baristas and when I go during their slower hours there is an 80% chance they'll completely mess up my drink to the point where I won't drink it. So tonight I am feeling like making the drive and head out to the larger location which is about five miles away versus my normal less than a mile. (That's not exactly pertinent but I threw it in for the curious) They're empty. I pull up to the drive through and order my drink. The exchange is polite. I say please and thank you. She tells me my total and before I have a chance to pull up to the window I hear, ""Oh, I know! I had her the first time I closed and I was like crying!"" There is literally no one in the store mind you. It is completely obvious and apparent she was talking about me. So I pull up to the window and she shakily asks me how my night was. I cut to the chase and asked her what she was talking about. She proceeds to (still shaking) tell me about a customer who is picky about her drink. I didn't want to push the issue so I said something like, ""You need to be careful when you're talking about customers. It probably isn't appropriate."" She gave me my drink and said have a good night. I'm not going to make a big deal about it but I am curious about other people's experiences. I don't feel like I am picky about my drink. I do, however, feel like I want my drink made right. I'm spending six dollars for one drink and I tip a dollar (occasionally two) every time because I know they work hard. It probably takes a couple minutes to make my drink, the least I can do is make sure I tip them. I feel for them because I don't perceive it to be the easiest job. So for regular customers with a regular drink.. is your drink made correctly every time? If not, what percentage if time do you ask for a remake? What percentage of time do you not drink your it because it is made poorly? 

I always have such a hard time asking for a remake. I hate doing it which is why I just bite the bullet and take the hit a lot of times. There was a time where 80% of the time I went to my local Starbucks they were messing up my drink. Now they know me and make it perfect almost every time but that is only during morning hours when the people with the most longevity are there. Now I would say one or two out of ten drinks is made wrong and it has been that way for a while. I really had to advocate for myself to stop getting crappy drinks. I have heard from other stores that my local location is disorganized and a bit of an embarrassment but in my limited experience elsewhere, they don't seem to be that much better. I compare them to a local business and no Starbucks measures up to this cafe as far as consistent exceptional product.

**Tl;dr**-For regular customers with a regular drink.. is your drink made correctly every time? If not, what percentage if time do you ask for a remake? What percentage of time do you not drink it because it is made poorly? 

If I was a Starbucks owner I would want to speak to my regular customers to hear their experiences. I know if my regulars are happy the chance of others being happy is a good one. I know Starbucks is closing for racial bias, which to me feels like they're over shooting, but I honestly feel it wouldn't hurt for them to close again for ""perfecting the art of the expression"" like they did a decade ago. I do feel like they need to set a better bar because I feel like I, as a customer, am taking the hit and now not just financially but personally by being labeled as a ""picky"" customer.

7,"I know no one gives a fuck but I need to vent.

I've been a pretty anxious person since I was around eleven years old (I'm 18 now). I've never sought help for it because I'm an idiot, and because my I've had awful experiences with therapists and psychiatrists. I get those annoying symptoms like chest tightness or feeling like you're being choked. I also get stomach cramps, and this is something that's been bothering me a lot lately. Yesterday I got super anxious all of a sudden and I almost puked in the middle of a hallway (in college) because I was feeling very nauseous and light headed. I made it to the bathroom though, and stayed there for a while trying to compose myself to go to the classroom again. This happened twice that day.

I've been dealing with physical anxiety symptoms for a long time but now I'm just really pissed off. If my heart is beating hard and fast and it feels like there's someone sitting on my chest I don't mind it. But throwing up is just very inconvenient. (I wish I wasn't so indifferent towards my mental health).

I'll try to muster up all the courage I have to make an appointment though. But I really don't want to spend all that energy telling my parents why I'll be seeing a therapist (and probably crying while I do so because I'm fucking fragile), and then telling the therapist all this shit and more. And having her ask me why I feel this way and me saying I don't really know.

8,"Hi, I know by the title 99% of you guys reading this have probably already judged me and thought I was some juvenile delinquent or some kid who was too stupid to understand the concepts being taught in school. However, your assumptions were wrong, hahaha, sorry.

I hate school. No, I take that back, I hate the *education system*. I hate having to study compulsory information that isn't in my personal interest. I view high school as a way to get good grades in order to get to university, it is not a learning space for me, at all. I haven't learned a single thing of interest other than math and science (and my teachers couldn't even teach these subjects so I taught the concepts to myself through khan academy, go figure). Sometimes I feel like the things I learn at school are really basic and I don't pay attention in class because I can teach them to myself. 


I am an extremely self-motivated learner and I don't really see a point in showing up for school if there is no reason to. As long as I maintain my high grades, I am happy and content. I have a lot of things that I want to work on and do (like learning how to invest + coding an app etc) and school hinders my ability to do these things. My school is really disorganized and unproductive, we do nothing some days at school, and I just feel so utterly useless when I am there. I always am thinking about how else I could have used my time. I skip school according to my classes' syllabus so I know when and when not to show up (so come on days where assignments are given, tests are given, important lessons are happening etc). 


I just want to get to university. It will finally be the place where I can do what I want and study the things I am most passionate about and interested in, even if it'smore challenging, I will enjoy that, because I am finally learning something intersting. I hate to say it, but I've taught myself more things online (programming, maths, physics, marketing, economics etc) than in highschool. The only thing enjoyable about school is the social aspect. I like talking to my friends, the community aspect is very nice. 

I wish I could do homeschool but my parents won't let me, plus majority of universities don't recognize it which really sucks. Plus, since I skip (without my parents premission) whenever I feel like it, my parents get really angry and they think I skip because I am lazy, but that's not the case, school just bores me. Am I wrong for skipping? wtf can I do???

10,"Hello there, so, as said in the title, I think my high expectations for myself are driving me mad. I dream of living comfortably as an artist/illustrator and with the time passing by I feel like this is out of my range.

Basically I’m in my early 30s and I spent the last couple of years working on personal stuff and my portfolio and I wasn’t even able to find a graphic designer position the last time I actively looked for work.

And with time flying, hiding the holes in my curriculum is becoming like the Amazon delivery guy putting your KitchenAid package under your doormat. So I guess working for a career is a bit game over for me.

I also suffer from a bipolar disorder and hyperhidrosis, which both greatly impacted my life.

The first one with its manic phases made most of my few friends steer away from me (I was totally nuts, thinking being a god and obsessed with numbers), and then drowned me in a depression that I’ve never really left since. The second is more rampant. I’ve had sweaty armpits (even in winter!) since puberty and this got me to draw away from social life little by little over the years, to the point of quitting my last job (a graphic designer one) mainly because of it. Each morning taking the metro for 20 min was enough to get my armpits and tee-shirt soaked thru. One year of it, a pretty boring job (even if it was in luxury stuff near the Eiffel Tower) and summer coming back, I decided it was enough. To tell you, hyperhidrosis makes you sweat more when it’s hot but it’s mainly related to anxiety. So you’re anxious of sweating and that simple fact makes you to actually sweat. What a nice deck life gave me! Sad face.

There’s one good news though, I learned that it was possible to get Botox (yeah like the freaks lips) injections reimbursed (yeah I’m in France) if done in a hospital. I managed to get an appointment… in October! 😭 Summer will be hard again but this appointment still gives me a little hope.

Note that before having my bipolar disorder I used to make do with my sweat problem, but when the disorder appeared and ruined what I had in life, that made me focus more on the sweat and soon withdrew from everything. Trying to create a new life and new friends proved to be harder than I expected.

As said earlier, I then spent the last years working from my fapcave with a kind of “all or nothing” setting, aiming for excellence but I guess I just barely do good stuff. I used to switch between long working shifts and some time off. But over time the working shifts reduce and it’s becoming long times off.

You can check out some of my recent work on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/couillard.sors/).

I know I shouldn’t focus on numbers but I can’t help it and see that there’s not much people interested in my stuff. And I don’t want to become just another bitch running after work for nickels just for the sake of working.

Especially that due to my conditions I have some financial help from the government but if I decide to go freelance again I’ll lose a part of it, so better find paying work.

Note that I tried changing tactics this winter and did found a place working for free in a non-profit organization. The team was nice but the work wasn’t much creative and I lost motivation, so I kind of sneaked out like a raccoon after eating your cat food.

Over time my last few friends stopped talking to me as I guess they got sick of me saying every time that I’m depressed.

One of the last things a friend told me is that I was too hard with myself. She also said ‘with others too by the way’ but I didn’t really understood this one, as I don’t talk with anyone anymore and I’m usually left without answers.

So when the mood goes way down like theses times I try to also think of worse situations, like I could be black, gay, disabled and in Russia, but that doesn’t really help.

I’m also accompanied by a psychiatrist, I blah-blah my life, get no judgement but that pretty much sums it up. She also pointed me towards groups of people with conditions like mine. But going there felt like a noodle necklace making workshop and turned out more depressing than being alone. 
I used to be throwing parties in old prisons and being involved in illegal stuff for fucc‘s sake!

One last thing, ads featuring drawings of my ex-girlfriend (who I dumped like trash btw) recently popped out all over my city and this reminded me so much of what I’d like to do that’s it’s been really frustrating.

So I’m finally turning to Reddit, and expose myself to the wrath of the internet, but whateves.

I guess it’s a bit of a « What’s the meaning of life ? » question and I don’t know if 42 can help, but at least it helps me to write things down.

Thanks for reading my shit.",19Apr2018,2

15,"** I originally posted this in “Off My Chest” and received some good advise from 1 user but wanted to hear more opinions. I think I may have posted in the wrong forum originally***

This is my first time posting and I hope this is the appropriate forum. If not, someone please advise. 

So basically as the title says, my abusive ex stepfather wants to have lunch or dinner and I’m considering it. I haven’t seen or talked to him for over a decade. 

Trigger warning: Domestic Violence. 

The story is a long one so I’ll summarize as best I can. My mother was married twice. First to mine and my older sister’s father, then to my younger brother’s father. I am the middle. My dad was never really in the picture (he was a philanderer, druggie, and alcoholic— he has his life together now with a new wife and 13 year old daughter so that’s good, but he has never been nor will ever be considered my father). 

Anyhoo, my mother remarried my ex-step father when I was a toddler so he was my “father”. He was a completely wonderful and charming man who made special breakfast hamburgers and would sing on the weekends while doing chores. He was great during the honeymoon period of every cycle, but then as abuse cycles go he’d become mean and abusive. The abuse ranged from mental to emotional to physical. He battered my mom mostly, then me. My brother was the favorite cause he is the biological son who could play basketball. My sister was next in line because she is smart, pretty, social, athletic, and all around perfect. I believe I was targeted simply because unlike my siblings (whom I love dearly) I was the odd man out. Not athletic, not social, kind of a misfit, and a little weird. My sister calls me an “acquired taste” :o) 

So the cycle of abuse continued until I was about 13-14. Two years before that he packed us up, moved us to another city where my mom had no family and we knew no one. My mom thought if we moved to be near his family, that would make him happier. What it ended up doing was trapping and isolating us further. My mom’s family was not very supportive and believed that what happens in the home stays in the home, so they were no help when my mom explained the abuse. She felt trapped. 

Just to note, all dynamics of domestic violence are different. But in this case my mom stayed because she thought he at least wasn’t hurting the children. I hid how he treated me, only telling her about it after the divorce. He was both verbally and physically abusive towards me but I won’t go into detail. 

In 8th grade, he decided to leave our family for a trial separation at the end of which my mom told him not to come back. So there we were, a single mom and 3 kids in a city where we knew no one and had no support. But my mother is a thug and a soldier so of course she kept this family alive and thriving! 

Over the next couple of years we struggled a lot but had each other. My younger brother however had some other issues festering. As a 10 year old boy who loves his father and is supported in his basketball dreams by his father, the divorce and ensuing struggle was difficult for him. At our house he’d eat meatless spaghetti all the time ($1 for pasta, $1 for sauce= beautiful bulk meal to last a couple of days). At his dad’s he’d get steak and burgers and go to NBA games... you get the picture. So without going into detail, my 10 year old brother did what he had to do to “make sure he got to live with daddy”, which led to my mom getting a restraining order delivered to her (on Valentines Day) forbidding her from seeing my brother. My mom fell in to a deep depression and gave up, going through the motions of her day to day life just to keep my sister and me alive.  It was a very bad time for us all. We did not see my brother for a while. She gave up custody during a very nasty divorce cause that’s what my brother wanted. We saw him maybe 1 or 2 weekends a month after that but I’m sure you can surmise how uncomfortable those weekends were. 

Well, anyhoo, jump forward a decade and a half. We are doing wonderfully as a family. My sister and I are thriving. My mom is happy, in a relationship with a very nice man (she’s in pain a lot due to some nervous system related disorders, some of which were probably caused by the stress and turmoil of living that past life). We have a pretty solid relationship with our brother, who does not live in the same state as us. My mom has worked really hard on forgiving him and even though she mourns those lost years of his life, she loves him and he her. Their relationship is a work in progress. 

So, I’ve given all of this background (thank you to those who stuck with me through this 75 page essay of a story!), to say that Bettlejuice (as he’s called cause anytime we accidentally mention him 3x he contacts my mom... it’s really crazy how that works!) once again texted my mom and said he’ll be in town soon and wants to have lunch with the 3 of us. My mom didn’t respond, she never does of course. She’s working on forgiveness in her own time. She has given my sister and myself the go ahead to reach out to him if we want to though. No this isn’t a test of loyalty, she loves us and never wants to make these kinds of choices for us. Even with my biological dad, she never spoke poorly of him cause she didn’t want to hurt us or do force us to choose. She let us learn at our own time and pace. That’s just the kind of woman she is, a good, selfless person who has had a hard and unforgiving life. 

My question to this forum is, “Should I go?” I haven’t seen or talked to this man since I was 14/15 and I am now 30. I don’t hate him, I feel sadness when I think of how he has affected my mom and family though. But I don’t hate him. Regardless of all the BS we went through, he was still my “dad” you know. And even though I didn’t mention any of the good times, when times with him were good, they were really good. But the bad times were really bad. I guess I’m just curious about what he wants to say. I don’t have the urge to rub in his face how well my mom, sister, and myself are doing without him. Or to yell and scream at him about how he almost destroyed us. I don’t feel like being vindictive or petty or angry or resentful. I don’t want to reestablish a relationship. I’m just curious. I know my mom won’t be mad at me if I do or don’t. I don’t know if meeting him will serve any purpose at all.

We talked nonstop everyday. I know your insecurities and your doubts. We do still flirt in messages tho you’re upfront that u see me only as a friend. That didn’t stop me, I’m still hoping that maybe one day you will realize how much you mean to me.

Then few months after almost a year of talking to you everyday, your messages stopped. My messages were left unread. I still tried to reach you out but then after I saw you online and still left my messages unread, I stopped.

I diverted my attention to people around me. Friends and family. I moved forward with my life and made the adjustments.

Then you went back, like nothing happened. Like I didn’t talk to you for weeks. You were so cool about it. You’re back and you’re happy.

I wanted to ask you so many questions but I don’t think I have the right to ask you. I waited for you to tell but you act like nothing happened. 

Then one day you decided to tell me that you met someone. Part of me is happy for you. I know you deserve someone who you love to care and be with you. I know how much you longed for that kind of relationship.

But then other part of me is upset that u didn’t told me earlier. You let me talked to you so dearly while you are talking to her. I was clueless. You left me hanged around while you’re figuring out what will happen to the both of you. You told me you meet her that’s why you didn’t had the time to talk to me a month after you’ve been together. I felt betrayed and guilty.

You have been really a good friend and confidant. I would have never imagined you to betray me. I know you didn’t intend that but I couldn’t stop feeling betrayed. For now I am upset but I’m sure that time will heal me.

I still wish you all the love and care that you deserve from the person you love. I hope both of you stay happy and I hope to meet you again soon, when we’re better. I hope to see you again to hug you without feeling hurt and sad that we ended up strangers again. You will always have a big space in my heart.",19Apr2018,1

If I got to pick, I'd dream of the times you and I got high or drunk, just us. Then we'd walk the empty city at night to stock up on pastries from the shop, come back and watch movies from our childhoods. 

But the image of you I can't shake is coming to your apartment at 2 in the morning, slamming on your front door, screaming your housemates name. And then blood everywhere when he let me in. And you sat there in the hallway, slumped over and pale - wrist elevated. 

My heart breaks for you. The tears always come when I remember how you laughed about it to the paramedic when he tried to determine the reason you did it.

Then the next day I emailed  her again and asked her could I get a bus pass for the first week of work as I worked a week in hand and apologised again also about my misunderstanding and she replied ‘that’s fine graham, don’t worry, if you want to come in to office before 5pm today I can sort this out for you’. Later that day I  went in to my advisor and I sat there about 10 mins (I thought she’d of wanted rid of me quick tbh?) she asked me about getting to work and how much it usually costs etc. I felt bad and there was an awkward silence as she was writing the paper form out for the bus pass, so I apologised again she then said 'it's alrigggghht' (but sounded annoyed or maybe a nice way of saying it idk) I then explained my manager questioned me about it and she seemed surprised like wtf and said 'did he?' And then she said 'just we have to contact them to confirm your employment' Then I said 'Its ok I understand' and she went quiet as she written the paper form out for me then just asked when I’m next in (my new job) I said tonight and she said ‘tonight?’ Idk why.  A moment later she passed me the form and I stood up to go and said thanks, then she leaned forward slightly sitting down with her hand out and said 'awwwwwwwwwww, awwwww (more like rrrrrrrr) (it was prolonged than what I typed like an gap filler tongue tied I think) and said a few things then I said ok and slowly walked away (out of nervousness) she then said 'let me know if you need anything else' I just said ok and slowly walked away and then she said ' oh..and I'll stay in contact to see how your getting on, I'll contact you by email if that makes things easier for you' and smiled (I mainly Contacted her by email) (she said it all upbeat and bubbly) I said 'oh ok thanks, great' (I'm really shy)she said 'awww ok' then she turned back around sitting on her chair and said 'oh and...(I turned around) well done' and smiled and then turned back to her computer. she said well done a lot since I got that job

I’m a sophomore undergraduate majoring in hospitality management. I’m employed with two jobs. The first I make $9 an hour and the other is $8 an hour.

I’ve been wanting to leave both my jobs and get one new job that is more in my career field, hospitality. However, being a full-time student, I’m going to have scheduling conflicts.

For the past few weeks I’ve been applying to numerous hotels and restaurants and I recently got an offer as a front desk agent at a hotel about 45 minutes away.

I returned the phone call and they wanted someone who can fill the role of morning shift (6:30a-2:30p) and midday (11a-7p). Obviously, I can’t.

My professor told me he’s hired some people he really liked but they had conflicts too but he adjusted their work to fit their personal life because he liked them so much.

The AGM asked me if I can change my school schedule to revolve around work and at the time I said possibly but now I realize I shouldn’t.

The AGM still wanted to interview me regardless. The interview will take place next thursday.

My question is: if my interview is successful and I’m offered the job, should I take it even if it interferes with school? What would you recommend I do?

44,"Hello,

I’m currently studying a 3 year film course at university (UK) and am 2/3rds through it, however since the start of the 2nd year I’ve lost all interesting in wanting to follow this career path, I still find some of the aspects of filmmaking and theory interesting but I can’t see myself using this degree for anything career wise- the thought of even trying to get a job in this industry doesn’t interest me at all. 

At the start I was very adamant to get a job in the industry and pursue a career in filmmaking but this has changed whilst studying it, it could be the course, it could be me, I don’t know! 

I’m going to finish the course because I don’t quit once I’ve gave so much time and effort to something, and besides I really enjoy university life. 

My main interests lie in tech development, computers, hardware etc, I’m a very tech savvy person and really enjoy it. If you offered me a job at Apple/google/Tesla or any of the big tech companies I’d take it straight away-But I feel like I’m never gonna be able to get into that sort of thing as my degree won’t be in that sort of sector/industry. (I acknowledge those companies are very hard to get a job at anyway but I used them as the ideal job). 

So what’s next ? What steps can I take to ensure that I’m not left with a degree which is “worthless” to me, cause part of me really feels like it’ll be a dead end trying to get into the tech industry without a degree suitable to those jobs.
Any advice/discussion/real life experience is appreciated!

50,"In 2005 I had an operation to help control my eating. It's called a Lap Band or a Gastric Band.

Chose that one because unlike the other gastric operations you don't spend the rest of your life on supplements since there is no reduction or removal of the part that actually breaks down the food so it can be turned into what you need.

All it does is make my emotional eating impossible since I get full ridiculously fast now so no more eating 7-10 overstuffed meals a day because I hate existing. *Hurray!*

One of the downsides is if you aren't careful and eat too fast pieces of food can either not be chewed enough and be slightly bigger than the hole created by the band or it's a type of food that just congeals into a mass that again doesn't fit the hole. Like rice for instance. It's been 13 years and it still happens to me multiple times a week, you would think I'd have learned by now but I digress.

Sometimes it sorts itself out and other times food just piles up. When that happens it becomes pretty uncomfortable;

A not quite pain but definitely pain in the chest , ungodly amounts of saliva being produced as the body thinks lube will help and occasional heaving.

In that situation I have to find a way to get rid of the obstruction, which usually involves the anorexia finger. Unfortunately it doesn't always work, it will definitely get rid of everything above it but not the obstruction itself which I assume is wedged in the hole.

Thing is though I have no way of knowing whether it's still stuck until I try to fill it up again and since I don't want to waste more food I go get some water as a testing method which brings me to the title of this post.

Without fail if something is still stuck, I will physically be unable to drink a glass of water, my body will instinctively force me to swallow the water in very small portions. At that point it becomes a game of try to get the obstruction to budge in one direction or the other, sometimes I have to drink water and Anorexia finger myself multiple times and other times I have to drink water and just hop in place for a bit.

And just like that once it's gone I can chug an entire glass of water with no problem. I find that completely weird.",19Apr2018,2
51,"Hey. My name is Max. I have been living my entire life up to now in an emotionally abusive household. I have a narcissistic father and an enabling mother, and was raised to accommodate them and cooperate under any circumstance. Everytime I refused and wanted to do things by myself, I got punished in form of shame, alienation, neglect, and then encouraged by my mother to ""just keep going"" and ""not to worry about it,"" because ""that's just how things are."" And those interests that could potentialy be (financially) exploited later in life were encouraged heavily, as was overall school work, so I was molded into an achiever who ought to ""make the family proud.""

So, I never learnt how to live for myself. I am unable to develop any prolonging interest in a random hobby. I tried playing the drums, doing Karate, playing the ukulele, calligraphy, reading, programming, and many more. I even lost my passion für videogames, which used to be my only refuge.

53,"As we approached her, coming down Fremont, I thought, *A nun shouldn't be in such a place*. And then, on second thought, I realized no place on earth probably needs a chaste and godly person more. That's when she turned around, her enormous breasts dangling exposed from her black smock, the nipples covered by Xs of white tape. *Oh*.

""You should get your picture with her,"" my wife said. For the tenth time that day I silently celebrated marrying someone with a sense of humor. I shuffled up to the nun with a few bucks in my hand and asked for a photo. She was stoic. Cold. She had the act down perfectly. Or was genuinely dead inside. You never can tell in Vegas.

After we took the picture, I casually said, ""Thanks. I hope this brings me luck. I need to start winning."" She touched my elbow and looked me hard in the eye: ""No one wins here, my dear. Just make sure you have fun.""

I glanced again at her breasts, then at the 60 ounce beer in my hand, then at my small group of friends, and I knew she was right. I felt it deep down in my soul.

A few minutes later, I was belly up to a craps table in the Golden Nugget, losing again. A full table of shooters hit a 7 immediately after setting a point. We were trapped in a death spiral. Then it was my turn again, and I felt no faith in my heart or my wallet. But I remembered what the nun had said. ""Okay, enough of this shit. How about we have some fun, guys?"" I got some soft cheers and some uncomfortable grimaces from the superstitious types that never say anything ever.

What followed was the longest round of shooting I'd ever seen. Of course, that's not saying much because I had only started playing the day before. But the boxman was impressed, and he had the look of a guy who is rarely impressed. I hit my point more times than I could count, and, more importantly, I was hitting some of the exotics that foolish people had bet on. The positive energy around that became infectious. When I hit all the numbers, I won someone 150/1 on their $5 bet. I seemed to only hit numbers hard ways. As I hit my third 12 in a row, winning some stranger over one thousand dollars, I wished the nun could see me now. Without trying, I'd become a martyr. The prodigal son for her religion of fun. These shooters had stolen from me with their terrible play, and yet here I was, still giving to my children--giving them the golden nuggets of my love.

Meanwhile, I was winning only modestly from small bets on the pass line and odds. On my tenth 6/8, the guy to my left mumbled that I had to get in on those, but I respectfully declined. My friend who played poker professionally for years used to always say, ""You have to gamble to win."" I always knew he was right, but you have to have money to gamble to win. And I never really have money.

Also, I had become keenly aware of the mojo of the moment. I am not superstitious. I do not believe that betting 6/8 would have changed the length of my run. But I do believe in a rhythm as an end in itself, as something that is inherently beautiful and to be cherished. In a short time, I had established a dogma. My Hail Mary wasn't words and beads; it was a sip of beer, a quick plastic jangle of dice, and a toss. Over and over. And I was converting people. The strangers walking by paused in wonder. Even the boxman and the dealers began to question their faith; maybe I was a truer god than the House? And especially my fellow shooters. I had turned their water to wine, and they believed in me. When one of the dealers had to mumble to me that I couldn't drink and drive, one of my disciples spoke up, ""You let that man do whatever he wants."" Everyone laughed. Except me. I just tossed my dice.

When it finally came to an end, everyone cheered for me. My take was modest, but I felt like a rich man. The nun had been right. ""Just make sure you have fun."" ",19Apr2018,1
