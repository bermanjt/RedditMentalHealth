For the last 8 years I have been with the most amazing young woman. She's strong, smart, funny, beautiful, everyrhing any man could ask for in a woman and then more. She came into my life when I needed her most and stayed with me through some of the hardest times of my entire life. The last 8 years were some of the shittiest years but she made them... Not shitty. She showed me so much, taught me so much, loved me, believed in me, trusted me, wanted me, and wanted the best for me. It was wanting the best for me that brought things to an end.

For the last 4 years I have suffered from chronic depression. I've had intense high moments in my life and then insane lows. The depression stopped me from doing everyday things. It stopped me from being me, it stopped me from loving myself, trusting myself, it stopped me from doing all the things for myself that she could do for me. I've been in and out of jobs and college. I've lied to her, broken her trust and she always forgave me. Always sat with me and told me we could get through it. Finally, after 4 years of the seemingly endless cycle, my depression finally took its toll on her. Withering away at her emotions, feelings, thoughts, at her core.

December 21st, 2017 she had to end the relationship. It wasn't bad, I understood why she was doing it. I understood everything she felt. Did I agree with it? No. No way in hell. She had been in my life for 8 years, of course I wasn't okay with it. She told me something along the lines of ""if you are going to get better, you need to learn to do it without me. You need to learn who you are without me. You need to learn what your life means to you.""  we agreed to stay friends and still speak with each other. I mean, we have been best friends for basically half our lives, how could we not stay friends? It was hard on me, hard on her, rough for us both. I could see it in how she reacted to me physically and emotionally. She was clearly distraught being around me and talking to me. She told me that we needed to take a break from talking and seeing each other. I respected her wish and reluctantly agreed. A week goes by and she finally talks to me. Another week and another hello. Another week another hello.

I hate the idea but the break up was the push I needed to seek help. I joined a therapy group at the local psych Hospital. The therapy has since helped me deal with this break up, my past, and my depression. I'm taking anti-depressants and they are working as well, it's going well. I told myself and I told her that I was doing this not just for her but most importantly for myself. I want to be better and happy and content with who I am.

January 22, 2018 Therapy has helped me realize many different things about myself and this relationship. It brought me to the conclusion that if I'm to become any better, she and I can't be friends, we can't talk, not now at least. Today I asked her to meet with me and she did. We ran errands, visited with out cats, and then got down to brass tax. I told her how the break up was affecting me and what it was doing to me. What it was going to do to me and what I hope it does to me. I told her I loved her and that I was thankful for everything she has ever done for me. I apologized for everything I couldn't give in our relationship. I told her that she has been the most important person in my life to date and that everything she given me in this relationship will stay with me forever. She reciprocated these feelings and thoughts. She told me it was fun. I retorted with ""it was more than fun. It was beautiful, it was amazing, it was perfect. Despite our flaws, fights, and our differences it was perfect."" this is what finally brought her to tears. She has never been emotional, and I've only seen her cry a handfull of times. We sat there and cried together, held each other, and thanked each other for everything. I love this young woman and will always love her. I will never forget her or anything she has done for me. I will never forget her parents whom took over when I didn't have my own. I will never forget her brother, who I consider my own. I will never forget our six cats either. I love her and her family. I wish her nothing but the best and she felt the same. We hugged one last time. No, it wasn't just a hug it was an embrace. It was the final embrace.

I'm not sad that this relationship ended but I am wholeheartedly happy that it happened. I couldn't have wished for a better relationship with anyone and I am happy it ended as peacefully as it did. Thank you Liana, thank you for everything.",23Jan2018,2
1,"I don’t want to live like this man. My life is always either in one of two stages: I’m not attracted to anyone, and I just cruise through doing the bare minimum to get by and being really bored with everything. This has been most of my life. But twice, a girl has come along that will just kind of click with me. The times this has happened I’m never outright attracted to them at first. But after getting to know them a little, a switch flips in my brain, and I end up head over heels. And it starts a spiral that goes on for a really long time. Months and months of just my life just being shaped around wanting to be with them, and wishing it would happen. While I’m not silly enough to think it’s love, it’s far beyond a normal crush. I can imagine a future with these girls, as stupid as it seems.

The first time it was easier to get over, because in all honesty it was an impossibility that anything was gonna happen. She just obviously didn’t feel the same. We messaged everyday, but it was more because I was forcing it. Hell, we never even hung out in real life. If I saw her in the street or in school we’d act like strangers. I always knew deep down I was grasping at straws, but I fooled myself into thinking just maybe there was a chance. It took me telling her how I feel, and that leading to us never messaging each other again for me to get over it.

And I did. And then girl number two entered the scene. She’d been a good friend for a while, but something just clicked. She came out of a relationship, I just got over the first girl, and I just kinda realised we’d been getting closer for months and I never even considered how great she was. We talked more and more. I didn’t want to make a move in case it scared her off like the other girl, so I just waited. I just wanted things to progress naturally, I was done trying to force a relationship where it wasn’t gonna happen.

And then she got a boyfriend. And still we kept getting closer and closer. And here I am, almost a year down the line, best friends with a girl who’s in a relationship and who I have secret feelings for her. Sounds like some cliché movie plot, but in real life it’s just shitty. Every day we talk all day, like close friends tend to do, and every day I feel like complete shit because of it. Like I’m an asshole. Her boyfriend must hate me. I keep letting this shit continue because I’m too scared to lose her out my life. 

At least the first time this happened I had the option of just telling her, cutting contact and pushing past it. We never really connected. I was more into the idea of her, I didn’t really KNOW her. But this time it’s different. Me and this girl message each other all day everyday. We hang out a few times a week. We’ve been there for each other in shitty times. I’ve seen her at her petty and insecure worst, and she’s seen me for the lazy and aimless piece of shit I can be. She’s thanked me for being in her life before, and I’ve opened up to her more than anyone else. I value the friendship a shit ton. I can’t just let that implode by letting my feelings get in the way. I can’t tell her, it would just cause an insane amount of drama. But at the same time my feelings are there. And they only get stronger. I can’t even think about getting with anyone else cause it just feels wrong. I only feel worse about it all every damn day. And I can’t get over her, it’s been almost a damn year and I still feel the exact fucking same.

Anyway, really my point is does anyone else get these insanely strong feelings? How the fuck do you quit this cycle of obsession and self-loathing? For real, I’m scared I’m gonna live my full life stuck pining after girls who are simply never gonna feel the same. It’s like I get tunnel vision when it comes to relationships, and everything else in my life goes out the damn window. How do I stop this shit, and is this normal?

He was only 57 and I'm currently living the same destructive lifestyle he was living. I feel like there's certain moments in people's lives that make them quit bad habits and I just hope this does it for me.

9,"Got to vent. Man, I just want to live comfortably and to be able to afford what I want to do. I’m a 21 year old female with dreams of being in the film industry (no, not what you’re thinking). Being on set in a big tv/movie production would be amazing. And even creating my own business out of it. That’s the end goal... Just living, breathing film.

So your advice is probably... “well, just go do that?” Yeah. Only I can’t afford it. I have the very very basic tools and actually have been filming people and trying to do my own thing (youtube/instagram @LoreiaFilms lol) but I work a low wage job.

Today I actually went and looked at a technical college for dental/medical assisting. “How the fuck did you get into that?!” you ask? Well. My parents are both in the medical field, so I have a bit of leverage, but it’s still no guarantee. Dental could land me a really job easily. Both programs are 9months of my life, and FUCKING EXPENSIVE. And Film school is actually WAY MORE EXPENSIVE. So I would have to work full time and go to school full time in order to.............afford a comfortable lifestyle to............fufill my actual dream.

I guess I’m just stressed on what route to go. But I have to think quick because time is ticking! Oh, anxiety.

TD;LR -- Tech school + full time working (no time to film anything) &gt; A good job &gt; film school/internships/equipment/business (the safe route) OR Film school + full time working &gt; in limbo of not knowing if I’ll be stable but still doing what I love but also still broke ???

The last time I returned was during late December last year, I was there, shooting some pool with a friend and we were thinking of making that arcade into our official hangout for our newly created retro gaming club, but I guess that's for the birds now.

It was the last of thee olde arcades, where it was strictly about gaming. Now I have to settle for fake and generic barcades where drunks go lean on machines rather than playing them and you can't even take your kids or younger siblings. I'm so sad.",23Jan2018,2

27,"I'm not someone who is generally seen as all that optimistic, but Jesus, a good deal of reddit discussion, and I'd guess a majority (or at least a plurality) of new subreddits are dedicated to making fun of others. See /r/trashy, /r/niceguys, /r/justneckbeardthings, /r/insanepeoplefacebook etc, etc. Any sub where the purpose is to point out fringe cases of ""cringe"" and ""insanity."" Not that the behaviors demonstrated in the posts of those subs are acceptable, but it is quite easy to understand the point, and the constant flood of screenshots of awkward text messages is just exhausting and creates this strawman, over-representing the most extreme fringe behavior, probably giving many readers a false sense of ""self-awareness."" It is much easier to look at unsolicited dick pics and think ""at least I'm not that"" than to dedicate yourself to serious introspection and address the latent sexism and problematic behavior many Redditors display. 

Often these subs fall into just plain high school style bullying. (I'm looking at you /r/cringeanarchy). The relentless mocking of behavior of anything abnormal, such as furry culture, is nothing more than childish and further demonstrates this desire for ""self-awareness"" where they satisfy their own insecurities by mocking those they feel to be below them. The obsession with normalcy, bullying anyone who dares step outside of societal norms, demonstrates the ingrained reactionary, anti-progressive nature of much of Reddit. And do I even need to mention the sexism and racism these kinds of subs get into? (/r/indianpeoplefacebook is an example of racist mocking which is not called out nearly enough). 

On a slightly different note, subs like /r/2meirl4meirl which normalize depression and mental illness, sometimes to the point of romanticising it creates an echo chamber of negativity, often with a mindset which discourages seeking help. The trend of nihilism and depression in pop culture, although maybe breaking stigma, is not helpful to those struggling the most with mental illness. While it may feel relatable and comforting to anyone who is a bit stressed out or sad, it again is a normalizing force and can discourage those who need it from seeking treatment, due to the perception that everyone else feels the same, so they must be fine. The hyperbolic pessimism so central to current culture has become annoying and meaningless. It is no longer funny, edgy or clever to say life sucks or that the world is dying. Instead, think about how you can change that. Acknowledge the bad, but acceptance is counterproductive, and at this point, quite frankly, annoying. 

Contrary to what you might think, I despise /r/wholesomememes too. In the exact same way as 2meirl4meirl, it overplays its shtick to the point of being totally asinine. The forced ""wholesomeness"" becomes totally obnoxious and meaningless, at this point their is no sincerity behind it. Without context, forced positivity means nothing.

Instead, we should encourage spaces like /r/anxiety, where both ill and healthy people interact meaningfully. It should be ok to be negative, but to counter it, there should be sincere and meaningful discussion which validates, and tries to support those in pain. Culuturaly, this trend of comedic negativity is unsustainable and unhealthy, and I believe Reddit reflects that. Can we turn meaningful openness about oneself and ones emotion into the next cool thing?",23Jan2018,200

31,"TL:DR Can you divide most people into one of two camps in regards to how they consume information: direct source vs trusted source?

There are obviously and endless number of ways to divide something as diverse and expansive as media. You can divide it as narrowly as the media and individual consumes and as expansive as all information communicated to others. That being said, in a more general sense, is there a “new media” and an “old media” forming? 

This distinction would be, I think, “old media” being traditional news broadcasts, well established newspapers and news outlets. Whereas “new media” would be something like direct from the source? More localized, less formal. If someone wants to know Lil Wayne’s stance on racism, they would go to interviews, blog posts, and likely his songs to ascertain the information, rather than something like a trusted source...

As I write this, it feels a lot like secondary vs primary research. They both have they’re positives and negatives. Secondary research from a trusted source is more expedient and thorough. Likely more thorough than someone could do on there own. The negative being that the information is presented through someone else’s lens rather than the consumer him/her self. The opposite is true for getting the information from primary sources.

I've been out of country since mid August, and I'm return at the beginning of July.  Naturally, as I expected, that makes it harder.  Until December, I was completely fine, but then from December 11th through the 17 I was sick.  The unfortunate side effect of being sick is that you have time to think.  I've had the opinion for years now that downtime and thought, is simply bad.  It always becomes existential.  While I was sick I got a ton of anxiety and had a couple panic attacks, my first ones ever.  Since then, I've been slowly feeling better, until today when, on the car ride home from a normal day at school, I felt the depression coming back, stronger.  Over the next six hours I went from that feeling of normal, to depressed, to extremely nervous and in tears, to thinking I couldn't go on another 60 years, to calm but still in the depressed state of mind, to feeling normal again.  I feel like I consistently look forward to sleep the most because it's easier than being awake.

I've become quite self conscious of these feelings and that just makes them stronger.  I'm gonna try keeping a journal, not thinking about the future, reading more, and keeping my mind exercised in other ways.

I'm posting this here because I came to the conclusion during a conversation today, that I'm not alone in my feelings.  But nobody goes around telling everyone how they feel because it makes them vulnerable.  To be quite honest, I don't want to do that either.  It's understandable.  But I thought that doing it through Reddit would be easier because it's anonymous.

Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar, and Clinical Depression runs in my family. my mom has all three. heres the huge part of my problems recently. ive been having vivid/realistic dreams. so real feeling that i feel the pain both physically and emotionally. i wake up in real life thinking what happened in the dream was real and that it actually happened. for example, over the weekend i had one about one of my closest friends passing away. i already had one pass this year and this one on top of it would have made it so much worse. i woke up thinking this as fact and i was so depressed for a little over a day before i realized it was a dream. ive read this is a sign of borderline personality disorder but im not narcassistic in the slightest and im not abusive mentally or physically in my relationships. please help",23Jan2018,6
