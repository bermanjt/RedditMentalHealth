0,"I notice most people my age have already either been through several relationships or just yearn to be with someone all the time. With my case, I‚Äôve never dated anyone or been in a relationship and I‚Äôm honestly okay with doing it for the rest of my life as of right now (or at least well into my late 20s, but who knows what could happen). I have not met anyone else that is like this. Is it more common than I am thinking? Is anyone else in the same boat? What‚Äôs it like for those that actually do practice it?",01Nov2018,1

2,"  For the past few years as I've been out of school since the 6th grade. I'm lacking in many ways considering my academics and common knowledge. I've been working on my grammar, history and a little bit on my spelling. I think I've been doing well with my grammar too the point of using it in nearly everything I post. If you're good with grammar I was hoping if you could point out any errors I made in this post so I can work on them. Recently I tough myself the difference between ""Too"" and ""To"" and I've been trying to get use to using them in the right places. I personally think that my grammar is at the very least above average but I could be wrong.

3,I‚Äôd be in the red most days. I fill up just a bit when I share a laugh with coworkers or do my job well. A little more while laughing with my loved ones. A little more when my dog is napping against me. But I get sad and remember shameful things and I‚Äôm running on fumes again. I have just enough to be at a quarter tank to get through the day. I haven‚Äôt had a full tank since February-August 2017. I was so happy and content every day. I was single for the first time in a decade and excited to get breakfast by myself or a beer at the bar solo. Things got pretty fucked up and complicated after that.

4,"This is more of a rant, but, basically she's basically a rage-aholic and it's made me a super stressed out, afraid person even when I'm not around her. Talking to her about anything is impossible, I'm 25 and I've spent my whole life attempting varying approaches. Regardless of how I word a statement, she'll interpret it whichever way she wants to. She never has talked with me, only at me. 

I'm a capable, 25 year old adult and bitching about my mom's failings is of course, ridiculous I realize. I've held 3 jobs in the past, and there is no excuse for being currently employed. 

I've paid rent in the past and while she was a tad nicer to me, the constant rage/drama still put me in a constant state of stress/fear. I'm halfway through the semester, so I can't simply change to a part-time school schedule in order to have enough time to start working a full-time 40 hour a week job to support myself and move-out.

8,"Yep, you read the title correctly. She's an emotional wreck, particularly the last several months. My last attempt to tell her I was going to get a part-time job sent her into a full time panic attack which ended in me sleeping in my car that night. 

I quit my last job because the stress of working 30 or so hours a week while going to school full-time. I ended up seeing a therapist. 

I feel a lot stronger right now and more capable like I could handle it. I technically don't need to work because my parents can semi-afford to support me, but I realize that it's entirely inappropriate/not good for my own development as an adult to leach off my parents without helping them back financially. 

I think the most common advice I get is to ""simply tell her that I've improved and I feel ready"" but TLDR, she's a rage-aholic that can go fully ballistic from the slightest provocation. There is NO communicating with her. 

Either I have her full blessing or she will make my life a living hell and probably even try to get me fired.

If I were to leave with nothing, and become homeless, that would make finishing school completely impossible.

Serve 20 years in the USMC. Get benefits, move to Sweden, renounce my American passport(citizenship). 

Why renounce my citizenship? Well, (I haven‚Äôt done much research into this so my info might be off)  as far as I know, being an American you get taxed on your income, doesn‚Äôt matter if that income is earned in the US or outside, you still get taxed. 

I‚Äôm only 19 so, of course nothing is for sure. Still have a lot of years to live so opinions and tastes change.

16,"My ex isn‚Äôt physically doing anything to mess up our relationship or break us up. He lives far away and I haven‚Äôt had contact with him in a year. He doesn‚Äôt even know I‚Äôm in a new relationship. But he‚Äôs still destroying it. 

I am now in my second serious relationship. My ex was my first. All I learned about how relationships should function came from him. Constant manipulation and lying were the norm. I was gaslighted to the point where I couldn‚Äôt trust anyone including myself. I‚Äôm almost certain I caught him cheating over snapchat. It got to the point where it was painful to even watch him talk to other girls because I was certain he wanted to be with them instead of me. My trust issues and self esteem were out of control and I was emotionally abused to the point where I couldn‚Äôt leave him. 

Eventually that ended and I moved away. It‚Äôs been a year and a half since we broke up and my life has been getting better and better since then. I have a whole new group of friends, and now I‚Äôve started to see this guy. He‚Äôs so great, he‚Äôs funny and caring and kind of has this innocent way about him where I  know that he would never want to hurt me.

But I‚Äôm still paranoid. Constantly. Sometimes I forget about how great of a guy he is and start to think that he‚Äôll do the same things as my ex. I shouldn‚Äôt have any problems with him being friends with other girls, and I wouldn‚Äôt if it weren‚Äôt for the history with my ex. He has given me no reason not to trust him but whenever I see a snapchat pop up on his phone from another girl, I‚Äôll get anxious. When I see him talking to other people, even guys, I‚Äôll get scared that something is wrong because of the old tactics my ex used to pull. 

I shouldn‚Äôt have anxiety over a great relationship. One time, my ex screamed at me for telling him that I was worried that he was cheating but that I didn‚Äôt even believe the evidence. If he was capable of that, then I‚Äôm scared of what my new boyfriend could be capable of. What if I presented my fears about him cheating and he acts the same way? I‚Äôm just so scared of him leaving me for someone else, because that‚Äôs what my ex did. Had to get this all off my chest. ",01Nov2018,1

I'm in the process of getting a psychological evaluation so hopefully I get an objective answer. But generally, I just feel so discouraged, there must be something about me that causes these setbacks. My self esteem is correlated to how people perceive about me, and is destroying me inside.

21,"It's been a frustrating period at work. I'm on the verge of quitting. It's a pretty toxic workplace...

but I messed up today by letting my  work frustrations spill over into unfiltered comments. I butted into another conversation talking about whether supporting Chick-Fil-A is homophobic or not and stated that while Americans have the freedom of speech, you must also be accountable for your speech. So if you take a stance against gay people, then you must be accountable for that. I used an example: ""If I came out to say that I hate black people, then that's my right to say that. However, I must be held accountable for my words. I don't hate black people though.""

Then I overheard another conversation about the challenges of adopting pitbull dogs and I butted in AGAIN to say how pitbulls are discriminated against in our society, and if they were people, they would be like black people, because they are unfairly treated and discriminated against even though they're the same as everyone else.  I'm pretty sure that offended the black people in the room, and I regret saying it. I regret saying everything today. I should have just shut up.

I work in a workplace that is pretty diverse with people of color (as am I), but for some reason, everyone's really iffy on issues of abortion, LGBTQ rights, etc. I don't know. I should have just shut my butt up. God, why did I say those things? I don't want to hurt black people by saying hurtful things! I should have just shut up....

23,"For some context, I live in the suburbs in America. It‚Äôs safe to assume everyone in my classes has access to the internet for free. We‚Äôre all adults who have chosen to go to college. 

Yet I find so many of them totally clueless about things that don‚Äôt affect their demographic. If you live in the US and have watched any news or swiped left on twitter to the trending tab, or have any friends on Facebook that have political opinions, you‚Äôve most likely heard about some of the violent attacks that happened this last week. Including the synagogue shooting and the guy sending bombs in the mail. I can respect that people have differing views but I can‚Äôt understand why people just don‚Äôt know about this stuff.

In my honors communication class, half of the students didn‚Äôt know about those last two events. All it takes is reading an article or watching a news segment to at least hear about it. I am so disappointed when they don‚Äôt even have an opinion and can‚Äôt add anything to the discussion cuz this is the first they hear of it.

If any of you guys want to avoid that, all you have to do is watch the news. It‚Äôs hard to have a discussion when half of it is just explaining what words mean and the basic facts of what happened.

My mother is schizoaffective. She is in the bottom 5% of functioning. Her psychotic episodes now come every 4-6 months and last 6+ months. My mother is my best friend, and I know every time she comes back that I am going to lose her again. It's a grieving process that never ends. It brings up unrelenting trauma and loss that I experienced as a child experiencing her illness. My parents were divorced, she wasn't diagnosed, and she got custody of me. I've spent my entire life unable to grasp the way she is taken away from me. The horror as they continue to let her out of the hospital and she roams the streets. The fear that she will become violent with herself or someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, I thanked God every time she would get better. For bringing my best friend, and my mother back to me. Now I know I am only being punished. I know I will lose her again to this awful disease. I know I will get the 20+ calls a day from her alternatively telling me how much she loves me and claiming that I am possessed, that I am evil, that I have been raped by every male member of my family (I haven't). 

&amp;#x200B;

I will be torn, remembering her fear the last time she came out of her, her desire to never have to go back into it. The hope as she asks ""do you think this will be the last time?""

&amp;#x200B;

I will stand in horror, again, as the doctors and police turn a blind eye to my pleas for help.  As they let her out on the streets over and over again while she is clearly still psychotic. I will come to the numbing truth that the only thing I can do is turn my phone off and hope she doesn't die. Hope that I'm not missing her last call to me. Listen to her voicemails professing her love for me. Listen to her voicemails telling me how evil I am. Listening to her voicemails in which she believes I am whatever diety she believes is her lover. I will wonder if those are the last messages she'll leave me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll secretly hope that this will all be over, that her death will bring peace. I'll hate myself for thinking that. I'll wonder what I did to deserve this. What she did. 

&amp;#x200B;

What kind of therapy is supposed to get me over trauma that is ongoing. There is no relief, not even when we get her back. Only dread for the next time. And no help, no explanation, no understanding from anyone or any part of society. It is a hidden pain. It is a shameful pain. It's a pain that consumes, and yet is never addressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would give anything to have had her leave us from cancer. That memory would be sad, horrific even--but it would still be her. She would still be with me, and my memories would be of my mother.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have some specter of my mother--some possession--who will likely die alone and homeless, who I will likely hear for the last time through a voicemail spouting off about evil and rape after months of distancing myself from her. And without the ability to place the blame on anyone. It isn't like she is selfish, bad, evil. She is the kindest, most generous person I know when she is herself. I wish she wasn't. I wish I was able to hate her. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I would give anything to have my mother back. I try desperately to go back through my life and wonder what it was that I did to make this happen. I used to believe the experience was meant to teach me, meant to make me a better person. It's just a brutal repetition that leaves me unable to function as a human being, unable to create any real relationships, unable to grieve properly for a mother that is still alive yet very much gone from me.

from my mother who was a stripper and meth addict. he ended up being a really shitty single parent that did the bare minimum. he never found time for me. never talked to me or played with me. he would send me to girl scouts or Big Brother Big Sister to get me out of the house. he yelled at me and always grounded me for no reason. he took so much happiness out of my childhood. he‚Äôs been abusive only once. we can‚Äôt be near each other for an hour without having screaming cussing fights. all i had was my cat. my dad got me a cat when i was 5 and she became my best friend. i would do anything to have her back. she would follow me around the house, i gave her petting sessions multiple times a day. i slept with her. i fed her natural food (grain free wet food no byproduct). i loved her to death. i pampered her. she was always there for me. she would come up to me when i was sad or crying to cheer me up. she always knew. on 10/6/18, her kidneys failed and i had to take her to the humane society. she was the only good thing i ever had in my life. my childhood died that day. i had her cremated and i have her ashes and special cat urn coming in the mail. this is my first experience with death, i‚Äôve never even been to a funeral. i miss her more than anything. she is a part of my void. i was molested twice in freshman year of high school by my ex boyfriends best friend (but we were dating at the time). my ex didn‚Äôt believe me the first time, but did the second time. none of my friends at the time believed me. my ex best friend from high school is now dating the guy that molested me even though i told her what happened. anyways, the second time, my ex broke off his friendship with his best friend, but i found out a few months later they became friends again behind my back. i cussed him out for an hour as our break up and never really got over it. on 11/4/17 i was raped. i had just gotten in a relationship on 10/31. the guy that raped me was in one of my classes at university and we were good friends. i‚Äôve been over to his place a few times before alone and with my boyfriend. however, that weekend, my boyfriend was out of state on a field trip, and i felt okay to go alone. i trusted them and had no reason not to. him, his roommate, and roommates girlfriend were there. we played a drinking game. when i reaches my limit of 5 shots i told them i didn‚Äôt want to drink anymore. they peer pressured me into drinking more for about a minute one of their main arguments being ‚Äúaw cmon, do it for the sake of the game!‚Äù i trusted them, so i had 3 more shots. i weigh 105lbs. i was spinning and stumbling and when the game was over i was exhausted. i wanted to go home, but thought of someone driving by and seeing me drunk, and picking me up. i chose to stay the night there, and went to my friends room because it was only 10pm and they seemed like they were going to stay up later since they were all in the living room on the couches talking. i went to my friends bed and was about to fall asleep but he walked in. i woke up and he got in bed with me and put his arm and leg on me almost cuddling me. he started saying sweet things i don‚Äôt remember but it was to try and set the mood. i didn‚Äôt realize what was happening until he was on top of me and aggressively pulled down my pants and underwear at the same time. i started freaking out and saying all kinds of things like ‚Äúno, i can‚Äôt do this. i have a boyfriend. i don‚Äôt want to cheat. i can‚Äôt cheat!‚Äù he didn‚Äôt listen. his response was ‚Äúyou boyfriend pressured you into the relationship‚Äù i didn‚Äôt respond because i was in shock. all i thought was ‚Äúbut you‚Äôre trying to pressure me into doing this right now!‚Äù i was way too terrified to say it, but i wish i did. when he took his pants off is when i REALLY started flipping shit. i started squirming more and getting more frantic. he was way too strong for me and how intoxicated i was. i could barely apply any force on his chest to push him away. i felt helpless. i gave up easier than i should have because i felt like it was a cycle. i couldn‚Äôt stop the guy that molested me. too many parallels between both guys. a foot taller than me. stronger than me. sophomore while i‚Äôm a freshman. anyways. at this point i said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt even have a condom!‚Äù three times to try to convince him to stop. he didn‚Äôt care about my boyfriend, i was stupid to think he‚Äôd care about a fucking condom. he wasn‚Äôt even erect. he forced his soft di** into my vag*** and it was the most disgusting feeling i‚Äôve ever felt and i hate thinking about it cause i feel it all over again. it didn‚Äôt last long i don‚Äôt think, but when he was done i laid on my side and either passed out or blacked out. i don‚Äôt know for sure because i‚Äôve never blacked out from alcohol before. all i know is i went unconscious. i don‚Äôt know if he went to sleep after or did things to me. i don‚Äôt know if i want to know. i

struggling too much. i feel like there‚Äôs no escape. i thought i knew the kind of person that would do that after being molested twice. i feel fooled to have been raped. i never feel safe anymore and can‚Äôt even trust myself to protect myself. i‚Äôve had nightmares. i can‚Äôt sleep without my boyfriend because my anxiety will keep me awake. from my home life to that, are all the reasons i have 10

I don't want to write about Trump, but I don't want to write even more about a sense of conviction I've been experiencing. I don't want my Trumpian conviction of my perspective to win the reigns of how I steer my life. I don't want the totalitarian sublimation of my experience to occur.

I feel like I'm being hammered. Just yesterday I was the one actively seeking out every possible news article on every possible thing with their despotic and terrifying prospects for our future. The intellectuals I respect or who've had track records of getting things correct were all singing similar tunes. Mind you, they still are, but I was getting the brunt of the 20 page in depth interviews and hundreds of hours of their speeches. Even if you're just grazing the news landscape, you're probably familiar with the percentage of animals we've managed to make extinct, domestic terror is at an all time high, and in practically every ‚Äúadvanced democracy‚Äù some form of right wing nationalism or extremist position is setting the pace and agenda.

At work, I get to hear example after example of ingrained and proud ignorance do everything in its power to tear down the systems in place trying to help as well as their own stability. Little helpless kids I interview eventually lead to their parents which now get to act as visceral reminders that someone I've encountered or thought positively about is getting routinely abused or indoctrinated, and the best I'll have for most is a superficial plan that acts as a kind of prayer to incriminate deeper if they again fall into our net.

The all-encompassing nature of work is another kind of pound. Mind you, I don't describe the things I do above because I'm a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person who's looking for an excuse to breakdown or loses any sleep. I can spend 7.5 hours a day, exceedingly easily, interviewing kids, talking to idiots, or bouncing between a courtroom and places to go to lunch. That's the point. I have my ‚Äúdistraction.‚Äù I have my ‚Äúobligation.‚Äù I don't need to pay excruciatingly close attention to my teetering society because I'm going to be slowly breaking down an idiot's intransigence over the next few months who's doing everything in her power to lose their child.

How often can you really sit and think on what it means that this touted symbol of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù and ‚ÄúWestern Civilization‚Äù is being steer-headed by 25% of radical fascists doing irreparable harm? That the whole of the human experiment is threatened by those who, routinely, celebrate the chance to kill each other en masse or applaud those who are in fact killing each other already? We're under the spell of those so possessed of their...I struggle to even call them ‚Äúideas‚Äù as I think those reside in people with the capacity to think independently and recognize objective evidence. We're watching, not just the failed-to-learn lessons of history, but the active dismemberment of even the capacity of how to learn and protect or cherish to begin with.

I really, truly, believe that. I don't think this is an ‚Äúelection‚Äù issue. I think it's a group psychological one. I think it's a biological one. I think we've so massively outpaced our ability to cope and rationalize, that the deathly serious and violent irrational forces that killed or else are behind all of the proud ignorance. It's with that same blindness we charged into the battles that our ancestors came out on top of. We're not contending with ‚Äúnationalism,‚Äù we're provoking survival instincts that are fully capable of destroying everything in their path. They're dying to prove it.

I find myself too actively cheering for ‚Äúcollapse.‚Äù I want ignorance to suffer, but my same exhausted sentiment is going to speak to that much more undue suffering for ‚Äúthe rest‚Äù who won't deserve it then anymore than they do now. Maybe we all don't deserve extinction, but the idea that we wouldn't vote, or pay attention, or stay awake at the wheel will not go ignored. Jordan Peterson phrased it brilliantly in another interview of his I watched recently. Reality has a way of snapping back when you try to bend and distort it.

Reality, so named, remains the word at the center of all of my interests. It's what I always hope to discover in writing. I was right, for example, that I didn't want to talk about Trump. I had to. His insane reality has beaten on my door from the moment I shut off whatever I was watching 2 seconds after the Mexican crime and rapists comments. The insanity of humanity I had a front seat for when I ‚Äúdebated‚Äù religious fundamentalists. I didn't need to take that class again. I also didn't feel particularly ignorant of what's physically happening in the brains of the ‚Äúconservative‚Äù and the ideologue. It's a large pile of individually easy to understand forces.

What's the reality underneath? To me, it's the antagonistic force. The blunt force trauma of proud ignorance doesn't provoke me anymore. The idea that not only might I never be able to overcome it, but that it's going to obliterate everything I care about, that provokes me. When I have a fantasy land of little elves running around my chest working hard to dig deeper and deeper for a cavern suitable enough for my sunken heart, there's a problem. What's the larger pattern? If I hear the same idiot ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù from the same ‚Äúyouth‚Äù just in a different language and a different country, what's my take away? When I see the same story reported about war-ravaged Africa or the Middle East, what didn't my parents get from the message when they were 30 that I'm supposed to in order to keep the flag of progress waving and flame of hope lit? What does it say about your prospect of ‚Äúhope‚Äù when you find yourself empathizing with the feeble, yet communal, delusion of the faithful?

Faith is one of those words I've heavily lambasted. I define it as belief without evidence. The ability to trust in, not something simply ‚Äúunseen‚Äù or ‚Äúunproven,‚Äù but often demonstrably false. Faith is the ‚Äúbless your heart‚Äù polite ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to life's otherwise terrorizing circumstances. Jordan Peterson has a different definition. He says that faith is believing in the ‚Äúbest possible outcome‚Äù from telling the truth. It's the conviction that no matter the consequences, you won't getting a better one by delaying or distorting the circumstances. It's another of his ideas that's stuck with me for quite some time, because I think it's also something I deeply believe.

‚ÄúMy‚Äù truth lies in my ability to use as many words as it takes to talk around a sense. I'm made of the same incredibly dangerous and full of potential forces as every balls-out ignorant person I meet in life and on screen. I imagine myself in different hats attempting to mold myself to whatever crazy forces might show up at my door. I try to plan for navigating a whole host of futures I would consider less than ideal to downright terrible. I try not to let how I actually behave in the world manifest as an expression of my baseline hopelessness. It's true I will act in spite of it. It's true that I think the worst is yet to come.

I just don't know what more to do with it. That seems like the kind of epitaph on my living grave. ‚ÄúI don't know what else to do, so come what may.‚Äù I feel I'm sort of defaulted to a form of detached Buddhism or something; I'm ‚Äúenlightened‚Äù by the prospect that my eventual death will lead to a cosmic balance to all of life's indignities. I'm at once entirely responsible for the world, and utterly detached from it. I'm a conduit for waves I can barely perceive but for their dramatic retellings in the labored voices of those drowning in them.

I have this problem when I'm bowling. You think this won't transition well, but hang on. When I'm ‚Äúfeeling it,‚Äù I keep my eyes focused on the part of the lane that nets me the most strikes. I have a little routine where I sit in the pocket and don't think about tripping over my toes or cranking my wrist incorrectly. Unfortunately, in some weird kind of way, in order for me to continue doing well, it almost has to feel like an accident or that I'm watching myself. I have to be deeply enmeshed in the song I'm listening to or conversation I'm having, and the strikes have to be an afterthought. My nature quasi-panic likely-disorder will kick in almost on cue the moment I start to *care* or ‚Äútruly focus.‚Äù Perhaps you might call it amateur choking. Even when I think I know where to look, how to hold the ball, slide my leg, and prevent my wrist breaking, I don't seem to know what to do, and the ‚Äúsolution‚Äù resides in maintaining my occupying my attention with ‚Äúsurrounding stuff.‚Äù The strike happens in the moment the ball leaves my hand. To take my mind off everything but that moment seems to be the relevant exercise in improving my score.

How might this scale? Is the fate of democracy won or lost at the moment you vote? Or, are there a million and a half other things that can be occupying your mind which ensure your vote means what it's supposed to? My disposition isn't mostly dictated by the insane and ignorant so much as it is the moment I choose to respond to them in the best way I know how after I've explored all the noise they seem to be creating around me. I don't need ideas I don't have to work for. I can't settle for ‚ÄúPeople are basically good‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou have to believe‚Äù or ‚ÄúJust save one person!‚Äù It's always complicated. It's significantly more complicated than bowling a strike or keeping your eyes on the same arrow for each throw, right?

Again my mind is repeating the ‚Äúunderlying needs‚Äù line from my recent job training. Why are we at your door? Anyone can call in a report, but what's going on that you're not proud of talking about? Who might we refer you to so that we never have to come again? I have an underlying need. I need there to be meaning behind the things I do. I need you to recognize I showed up at your door, not the agency I work for. Better stated, I need to walk away with a perspective that transcends ‚ÄúIt's just policy!‚Äù I need to know that your ridiculousness deserves what it's asking from me. I want to take away new windows into exploring the totalizing influence of proud indignant ignorance and how to engage with it a million different ways before the moment I have to open my mouth.

If I could fix it with a snap, it'd have to trigger something in me, not make them disappear. But like I said, I don't really know what else I should be doing.",01Nov2018,1

I realize that I spend a lot of time on my phone. I just intend to check something quickly and get sucked in. Another problem I have is skin picking. I literally spend at least an hour a day just picking at bumps at my skin, tweezing hair on my body. It‚Äôs not even for the sake of cosmetics, I just...do it. Why???:?

46,"Alright, so, I've been very introverted my whole life. Something clicked this year and I've been changing to hang out more with friends. I still live with my mother and a friend of hers together, and I will probably not be able to move out any time soon, as I'm planning on improving my education first instead of making money.

My mother has been depressed for a long time now (she's 48) and has been on anti-depressants and in therapy on and off. A couple years back she lost her mother to cancer, and I'm now her only living relative, so she clings onto me like crazy because she fears that something will happen to me. I know she tries to stay strong and let me live my life, but sometimes she just snaps, and it's incredibly hard for me, because I feel trapped.

I've been looking for a good therapist for her, and she always agreed to seeing a therapist. But yesterday she said that she doesn't want to see a therapist and to leave that decision to her, just as she leaves my decision to go out with friends, despite her being scared, to me. She also lists that the cost to go to the therapist is too high (public transportation) for us to afford it as a reason, and that she is scared to go there alone. I offered to go with her, but she said that I couldn't do that every time there's an appointment and that it would drive up the cost to get there even higher. I tried finding a therapist that's closer, but to no avail. She also says that her enduring me going out so often is already like therapy.

On top of that we're living in Germany and with media fear-mongering 24/7 because of immigrants her fear is up to 11. (thanks a lot, media)

I just feel at a loss. I want to help her. I want her to feel better, and secure. I don't wanna feel trapped or guilty for going out. What am I to do?

48,"I won't reveal my current age but I can tell you it's not 13 anymore :)

I will probably downvoted or even banned as it seems to be forbidden to criticise metal music. . I wanna speak up. I'm not the only ex-metalhead on this planet and I'm sure there are many people who wasted their youth listening to music they didn't like because they wanted to be cool so badly. I get it you like the music, but if you have the full ''metalhead uniform'' don't deny wanting to be seen. If you didn't you would just wear normal clothes to blend in.

If you're just starting into metal because you think it's cool my advice is don't do it. I'm not saying all metal is bad or that metalheads are worthless, what I'm saying is ignore people who tell you do this do that or you're a poser. If you like metal fashion but not music, that's totally fine (but please don't tattoo all over your face).

Please if you're a teen enjoy your years. I would do anything to wake up a teen again. Also don't criticise your generation and how bad your music is. I thought so too, but guess what: every decade has a good share of good and bad music. The reason we hear no crappy 80s music is because they only play hits.

*Quick story on how I became a metalhead (you can skip too)*

*I've always been a tomboy and was attracted to alternative scenes be it emo, rap (it's weird for 7 year old to like rap). It was more the fashion rather than the music. I secretly always admired pop music, especially the catchy pop music. I still do. In my tweens I've litteraly been a mixture of a tomboy and a preppy girl depending on my mood. I went from Lady GaGa to Black Sabbath fan in a matter of seconds. I was a little nerdy so I had a hard time finding friends. There were a couple of metalheads in my class when I entered high school and they seemed like really cool people. Metalheads like to boast about how welcoming they are. I also loved their fashion. When I told them they just awkwardly laughed at me because I was mainly known for my good grades and thought of as spending all the free time studying. Because I didn't wanna be known by my nerdiness, I decided to ''transform'' into an actual metalhead. I began by listening classics like black sabbath, continued to mainstream like metallica and slayer. I ended up listening a lot of black metal, but I hated it. Eventually I forbade myself listening to pop, EDM, rap, and even classic rock and Glam Metal (I still love it, yes I said it). Having most crushes I had on metalheads also made me so much more dedicated. The point is I never liked most of metal music. Sure Iron Maiden is awesome but so is Madonna. And hate me for saying this I don't care, death metal is just a bunch of guys screaming and a guitar repeating same 3 chords all over for 10 minutes.*

Well let me tell you, in your 20s metal music won't make you cool anyway. You may seem like an awesome uncle Jack to a few 16 year olds but within your age group you're the immature one.

The point is I feel like I wasted my teens. I was on my way to become a pretty girl myself and I secretly loved the pop music but instead I insisted on all my friends to listen to metal. I thought I would be so cool etc. I lost some of friends as I was very untolerant during these years. I also didn't care about my appearance and never learned to put on make up or dance(I thought I was too cool for that). All I want is to wake up, be 13 again and enjoy some teen pop. I really wanna be a teen again. I would learn modern dances, sing. I would have eaten better and exercised more. I would go to so many rave parties i missed because i was convinced I was too cool for them. People tell me I'm cute and I was much cuter when I was a teen. I developed early wrinkles due to bad skincare and bad eating habits (metalheads are too cool for this). Had I not been a metalhead and had I lost some weight instead of listening to this crap I could have even done some modelling. I missed it all and it makes me so depressed. I really wanna go back to my teenage years and live my teenage dream. If you read my posts you may see I'm low-key starting to follow my dreams now but the point is if I talk about them like I could in my teens I would get laughed at now. It's much harder once you're past the golden age.

60,"My name remains undisclosed, operating under the username of Barret_t. I am documenting this as a form of escaping my own conscious mind. If you can imagine a situation where you are sat in front of your computer and your mind is hovering in front of you, above your computer screen - away from your body looking back at yourself. Just picture it. Picture looking down on your mindless body of skin typing away on a keyboard, going from moment to moment - day to day, doing the same thing over and over again. Your conscious mind looking down on you - in an 'out of body' way.
¬†
I often think about things like this in order to 'escape reality', In a sense, it takes some of the stress out of a working day and helps you look at how you are, who you are and what you are doing at that present moment in time. It makes you think about how insignificant all the little things that frustrate and bother you are.
¬†
You sit there, laughing at your pathetic self, getting worried and stressed over things that are ultimately meaningless. At the end of the day, you go back to your neutral self, mindlessly going from one thing to another. It's a scary concept, but until you sit back and realise that you can be at one with yourself and think about things that really matter to you, you will never be happy. There will be things that niggle at your mind all day and night that don't go away because you spend ALL DAY - EVERY DAY thinking about them subconsciously.
¬†
Reach your higher mind, I beg of you. Reach a point of consciousness where you can truly see what REALLY matters. Family for example; spend time with your family as they will not be here forever and, in most cases, they are the most precious gift in your life. Speak to people that have thoughts, interests and points that interest you. There is no point in devoting your time to listening to somebody other than yourself drool on about insignificant toxic things going on in their life, that also, do not ultimately matter.
¬†
I suppose the primary message here is spend your time doing things that bring you happiness and regularly reflecting back on your life. Otherwise, all you will end up doing is looking back at yourself, similarly to how you are now, but in 40 years' time, wondering how your life would have turned out if you'd just allocated your time to doing things that matter, rather than doing things that don‚Äôt. Almost being angry at that 'mindless body of skin' for not reflecting and spending too much time acting unconsciously.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/comedywriting/comments/9t03dy/looking_for_a_writing_partner_to_make_an_adult/e8sx0ph) are the comments that caused it.

Also literally the *only* rule of the subreddit is ""Don't post videos"".

&amp;#x200B;

This was the moderators message in the ban:

&gt;Start your own subreddit and you can do things your way. That's what I did. Now I get to ban people like you who try to tell me how to run my thing which, by the way, doesn't even matter at all...

And this was my reply:

&gt;Authoritarian much. I guess this community isn't allowed to criticise or have an opposing opinion with you around, didn't think that this small amount of power would corrupt but who am I kidding.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah just wanted to know if I was stepping over the mark, if mods can be like this and you've got to deal with it, or if the moderator of this sub is being a dick doing as they please",01Nov2018,1
64,"I don't have very many personal thoughts that I keep to myself. I like to thoughtvomit all of them into anywhere that'll act as a word-garbage receptacle. Perhaps I'm an idea communist, I feel like things go best when knowledge of a given situation is publicly held. Given this, I feel like it comes off like I don't have any filter, I'm kinda immature, etc. And I'm probably like that internally, but I'm so different in real life, around these people. 

I'm a *character*. 

That's my identity. Around [S], I'm that weirdass caricature of whatever that personality is. Recently, I've become more normal-human around my old friends, but I'm still often a caricature of myself, though identifying more leftwards has somewhat disjointed me from that. Around you, I'm my internal dialogue. Around Alex, I'm a subtle variation on that caricature. Maybe I can be more of a correct social human sometime. 

I feel like I've thought all of the thoughts that I've had to think. I haven't had any real new feelings recently, excepting a 10 minute pang of sad nostalgia for that past relationship. Recently, I've just been. Now, changing the dominant hormone in your body might induce something like that, so I realize I might have a while to wait in that regard. Otherwise, I haven't been unhappy at all, it's honestly been pretty good. But it's been a constant background low level happie that's somewhat foreign. Other than that, my mood is like, err... TV static? 

Doing that thing, most of my already minimal dysphoria went away. Which I guess would make sense, but it's kinda weird to not have strong dislike-ful feelings towards maleness, that would push me towards doing this. Oh lord, talking with parents is gonna be hard. Extended family might be even harder. Some of that extended family, I can't imagine even maintaining a relationship with; I'm probably going low/no contact with them, on my mom's side. 

[city] is so niiiice. 

I feel a bit like I'm living life in the third person, and I don't think that's primarily related to disliking maleness. I feel like it's because of the way I've goaded myself into thinking. I honestly don't dislike it. It lets me feel the emotions of me, while making slightly more rational, big picture decisions. But it makes me bad at *being* human. It reaffirms that I picked the right area to study in, though. 

I can't imagine what you're going through, holy shit. You, in the first person, has to endure the shit that your parents are trying to push on you, while maintaining schoolwork, [activity], friends, and most importantly, your happiness. Feel free to rant as much as you like, you have all of the right in the world to complain about that bullshit. If you *want* (not just need) anything, any time, my mom is really cool and understanding. Feel free to complain as much as you'd like to her. You're doing really well, given all the shit thrown at you. I'm privileged as fuck; I honestly have it easy. But you're kicking butt. 

I have no more major thoughts. I guess, it's somewhat concerning that professor didn't email me back about where on her team I'd be, but I can just email her. I have exhausted my thoughts here. Even then, many of these are redundant. Oh, I kinda wish I was a writer. I like writing. I'd prefer not to write in this style, as a career, and I know I can avoid that. But this style lends itself well to doing research. Creative writing/getting really friggin good at jazz improv/acting/directing/composing for ensembles would all be really dope. I can communicate emotions, through those. Not this bland, ""here is a factual statement, here is another statement. Given these two statements, this other statement must be true"" sort of thing. Though that's really efficient, but super dry. 

Okay, no more thoughts. Oh wait. I don't have feelings for [A], even though she's really cool and a really good friend. I think she's religious, and she's kinda apolitical, which immediately contrasts with my identity. I can't say I'm close to that many more girls. I tend to enjoy spending more time around girls, anyways. Which is unfortunate given [major]. 

I'm being really repetitive, wow. But it reflects life.

65,"I remember a couple times browsing this sub after hours and it's a lot of depressed people, which makes sense because at night some people can't sleep. They're tired and when you're tired you're more likely to get sad. I wonder if this affects academic performance as well? At least for STEM careers. I have a friend who says you shouldn't go to college unless you aspire to get a degree in something technical or medical, she believes that if it's neither one of those it isn't worth it putting yourself in debt for a career that isn't going to pay off when you graduate? I know that lawyers make money but there are more chances of becoming a cheap lawyer than a cheap doctor. I know I have my own problems with lawyers because the career seems kinda sleazy... know someone is innocent but you're trying to prove them guilty? And vice versa. Although of course we need lawyers for the wrongfully convicted. In any case, criminals with money can get away with virtually anything. Rich people can afford more expensive ways to cover up their crimes as well. A rich serial killer is a perfect serial killer (unless mentally stable) though one can argue that one who has desire to kill isn't mentally there. But that brings up the question of the nature of man. Violence has been a big part of history in humans. Ever wonder if it's primal? Some people argue rape can be primal instinct as well. This idea was first presented to me by a woman with rape fantasies telling me that they are more common than we will ever know among females. I wonder how true that is, I personally don't believe it is a significant majority of women like she claims, but it also wouldn't surprise me. I just know that everyone has dark thoughts about one thing or another but who knows? Some people however spend too much time thinking about their dark fantasies and this affects their drive to be a better person. I mean, if all our ancestors thought about was raping each other, it'd been more difficult to build a civilization. But there is something fishy about civilization itself: like I was telling my girlfriend, I believe 100% that man is capable of building a civilization, but a scientific civilization? Vast with technology? It seems off. I mean, I believe we invented the wheel, but did we invent high tech?",01Nov2018,1

",01Nov2018,1
69,"I'm writing because I don't want to. Specifically, I'm writing because I don't want to write about Trump. But it's worse than that. I don't want to write about Trump, but I don't want to write even more about a sense of conviction I've been experiencing. I don't want my Trumpian conviction of my perspective to win the reigns of how I steer my life. I don't want the totalitarian sublimation of my experience to occur.

I feel like I'm being hammered. Just yesterday I was the one actively seeking out every possible news article on every possible thing with their despotic and terrifying prospects for our future. The intellectuals I respect or who've had track records of getting things correct were all singing similar tunes. Mind you, they still are, but I was getting the brunt of the 20 page in depth interviews and hundreds of hours of their speeches. Even if you're just grazing the news landscape, you're probably familiar with the percentage of animals we've managed to make extinct, domestic terror is at an all time high, and in practically every ‚Äúadvanced democracy‚Äù some form of right wing nationalism or extremist position is setting the pace and agenda.

At work, I get to hear example after example of ingrained and proud ignorance do everything in its power to tear down the systems in place trying to help as well as their own stability. Little helpless kids I interview eventually lead to their parents which now get to act as visceral reminders that someone I've encountered or thought positively about is getting routinely abused or indoctrinated, and the best I'll have for most is a superficial plan that acts as a kind of prayer to incriminate deeper if they again fall into our net.

The all-encompassing nature of work is another kind of pound. Mind you, I don't describe the things I do above because I'm a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person who's looking for an excuse to breakdown or loses any sleep. I can spend 7.5 hours a day, exceedingly easily, interviewing kids, talking to idiots, or bouncing between a courtroom and places to go to lunch. That's the point. I have my ‚Äúdistraction.‚Äù I have my ‚Äúobligation.‚Äù I don't need to pay excruciatingly close attention to my teetering society because I'm going to be slowly breaking down an idiot's intransigence over the next few months who's doing everything in their power to lose their child.

How often can you really sit and think on what it means that this touted symbol of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù and ‚ÄúWestern Civilization‚Äù is being steer-headed by 25% of radical fascists doing irreparable harm? That the whole of the human experiment is threatened by those who, routinely, celebrate the chance to kill each other en masse or applaud those who are in fact killing each other already? We're under the spell of those so possessed of their...I struggle to even call them ‚Äúideas‚Äù as I think those reside in people with the capacity to think independently and recognize objective evidence. We're watching, not just the failed-to-learn lessons of history, but the active dismemberment of even the capacity of how to learn and protect or cherish to begin with.

I really, truly, believe that. I don't think this is an ‚Äúelection‚Äù issue. I think it's a group psychological one. I think it's a biological one. I think we've so massively outpaced our ability to cope and rationalize, that the deathly serious and violent irrational forces that killed or else are behind all of the proud ignorance. It's with that same blindness we charged into the battles that our ancestors came out on top of. We're not contending with ‚Äúnationalism,‚Äù we're provoking survival instincts that are fully capable of destroying everything in their path. They're dying to prove it.

I find myself too actively cheering for ‚Äúcollapse.‚Äù I want ignorance to suffer, but my same exhausted sentiment is going to speak to that much more undue suffering for ‚Äúthe rest‚Äù who won't deserve it then anymore than they do now. Maybe we all don't deserve extinction, but the idea that we wouldn't vote, or pay attention, or stay awake at the wheel will not go ignored. Jordan Peterson phrased it brilliantly in another interview of his I watched recently. Reality has a way of snapping back when you try to bend and distort it.

Reality, so named, remains the word at the center of all of my interests. It's what I always hope to discover in writing. I was right, for example, that I didn't want to talk about Trump. I had to. His insane reality has beaten on my door from the moment I shut off whatever I was watching 2 seconds after the Mexican crime and rapists comments. The insanity of humanity I had a front seat for when I ‚Äúdebated‚Äù religious fundamentalists. I didn't need to take that class again. I also didn't feel particularly ignorant of what's physically happening in the brains of the ‚Äúconservative‚Äù and the ideologue. It's a large pile of individually easy to understand forces.

What's the reality underneath? To me, it's the antagonistic force. The blunt force trauma of proud ignorance doesn't provoke me anymore. The idea that not only might I never be able to overcome it, but that it's going to obliterate everything I care about, that provokes me. When I have a fantasy land of little elves running around my chest working hard to dig deeper and deeper for a cavern suitable enough for my sunken heart, there's a problem. What's the larger pattern? If I hear the same idiot ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù from the same ‚Äúyouth‚Äù just in a different language and a different country, what's my take away? When I see the same story reported about war-ravaged Africa or the Middle East, what didn't my parents get from the message when they were 30 that I'm supposed to in order to keep the flag of progress waving and flame of hope lit? What does it say about your prospect of ‚Äúhope‚Äù when you find yourself empathizing with the feeble, yet communal, delusion of the faithful?

Faith is one of those words I've heavily lambasted. I define it as belief without evidence. The ability to trust in, not something simply ‚Äúunseen‚Äù or ‚Äúunproven,‚Äù but often demonstrably false. Faith is the ‚Äúbless your heart‚Äù polite ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to life's otherwise terrorizing circumstances. Jordan Peterson has a different definition. He says that faith is believing in the ‚Äúbest possible outcome‚Äù from telling the truth. It's the conviction that no matter the consequences, you won't get a better one by delaying or distorting the circumstances. It's another of his ideas that's stuck with me for quite some time, because I think it's also something I deeply believe.

‚ÄúMy‚Äù truth lies in my ability to use as many words as it takes to talk around a sense. I'm made of the same incredibly dangerous and full of potential forces as every balls-out ignorant person I meet in life and on screen. I imagine myself in different hats attempting to mold myself to whatever crazy forces might show up at my door. I try to plan for navigating a whole host of futures I would consider less than ideal to downright terrible. I try not to let how I actually behave in the world manifest as an expression of my baseline hopelessness. It's true I will act in spite of it. It's true that I think the worst is yet to come.

I just don't know what more to do with it. That seems like the kind of epitaph on my living grave. ‚ÄúI don't know what else to do, so come what may.‚Äù I feel I'm sort of defaulted to a form of detached Buddhism or something; I'm ‚Äúenlightened‚Äù by the prospect that my eventual death will lead to a cosmic balance to all of life's indignities. I'm at once entirely responsible for the world, and utterly detached from it. I'm a conduit for waves I can barely perceive but for their dramatic retellings in the labored voices of those drowning in them.

I have this problem when I'm bowling. You think this won't transition well, but hang on. When I'm ‚Äúfeeling it,‚Äù I keep my eyes focused on the part of the lane that nets me the most strikes. I have a little routine where I sit in the pocket and don't think about tripping over my toes or cranking my wrist incorrectly. Unfortunately, in some weird kind of way, in order for me to continue doing well, it almost has to feel like an accident or that I'm watching myself. I have to be deeply enmeshed in the song I'm listening to or conversation I'm having, and the strikes have to be an afterthought. My natural quasi-panic likely-disorder will kick in almost on cue the moment I start to *care* or ‚Äútruly focus.‚Äù Perhaps you might call it amateur choking. Even when I think I know where to look, how to hold the ball, slide my leg, and prevent my wrist breaking, I don't seem to know what to do, and the ‚Äúsolution‚Äù resides in occupying my attention with ‚Äúsurrounding stuff.‚Äù The strike happens in the moment the ball leaves my hand. To take my mind off everything but that moment seems to be the relevant exercise in improving my score.

How might this scale? Is the fate of democracy won or lost at the moment you vote? Or, are there a million and a half other things that can be occupying your mind which ensure your vote means what it's supposed to? My disposition isn't mostly dictated by the insane and ignorant so much as it is the moment I choose to respond to them in the best way I know how after I've explored all the noise they seem to be creating around me. I don't need ideas I don't have to work for. I can't settle for ‚ÄúPeople are basically good‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou have to believe‚Äù or ‚ÄúJust save one person!‚Äù It's always complicated. It's significantly more complicated than bowling a strike or keeping your eyes on the same arrow for each throw, right?

Again my mind is repeating the ‚Äúunderlying needs‚Äù line from my recent job training. Why are we at your door? Anyone can call in a report, but what's going on that you're not proud of talking about? Who might we refer you to so that we never have to come again? I have an underlying need. I need there to be meaning behind the things I do. I need you to recognize I showed up at your door, not the agency I work for. Better stated, I need to walk away with a perspective that transcends ‚ÄúIt's just policy!‚Äù I need to know that your ridiculousness deserves what it's asking from me. I want to take away new windows into exploring the totalizing influence of proud indignant ignorance and how to engage with it a million different ways before the moment I have to open my mouth.

If I could fix it with a snap, it'd have to trigger something in me, not make them disappear. But like I said, I don't really know what else I should be doing.",01Nov2018,1
70,"a flat line stretches between my reality and the truth i‚Äôd strip my teeth to live consciously.  every now and then, let‚Äôs say once a day, could be more, i do an inventory of the mundane, then bury my head inside the secular, profane.  i have a brief spell of rebel vanity i use to divert stuff into my gut, i‚Äôll erase propaganda from the back of my eyes, unchoke my throat of gross futility and popular white lies.

I don‚Äôt know, but I want to know. I want to be clear about things. I want to run away, with nothing, and be free. I want to empty my mind, and be in control again.

I want to escape this country, I can't even be myself here, I have to wear a mask everywhere I go to gain people's approval

No one cares if I died anyways, the world doesn't care, it's the truth I'm not trying to play victim, we are but biological machines, we don't matter, all that suicide prevention bullshit is stupid, if someone decides to end his own life let him be, he is done with this life, he chooses to end it, don't stop him and let him suffer for it ",01Nov2018,1
87,"I lost my father in law recently, he had been a very prominent figure and a person who always motivated and had really good vibes in my life since I got married 5 years back. He was quite healthy and wasn‚Äôt too old either, it was cardiac arrest and it gave him very little time to reach hospital.

It happened on 2nd of last month so It‚Äôs been a month now but I still can‚Äôt seem to go back to my normal routine, my wife is currently on leave to be with her Mom but she will be back soon and I am quite worried how to support her when I myself can not feel normal.

I haven‚Äôt watched TV/YouTube/Netflix anything in last one month, have not had any alcohol and no songs or any parties. I know this could be due to the shock but is it normal ? I am working and do not have any problems doing my job and understand my duties and responsibilities so I am not worried about that, the only fact I am worried about is I cannot enjoy any usual stuff people involve themselves in like drinking/listening to songs  watching tv/movie/youtube. The only thing I am doing right now is either working, talking to colleagues while at work or posting stuff on Reddit. I don‚Äôt even meat my friends or go to office parties.

I hope things will get better with time and I will be able to take care of my wife as this is 1000 times more difficult for her than me. God give courage to anyone who have lost their loved ones.

91,"Every single one of my friends, almost all of them, they don't give a shit about what I have to say, every time I want to open up about myself they always give me a one word reply, something like ""yeah"" or ""that's great"" and it's annoying because it makes me feel like they've given no thought to what I have to say. I try to put some thought to my replies so it's extremely frustrating having one sided replies with people. Of course I'm expected to listen... but when it comes to my interests? People seem to fuck off!!!

Honestly I suspect the reason for it is because I'm not talented or pretty or anything other than average and people understandably are selective about their friends, if I was somebody more talented and famous I'd have people listening more closely to my words lol",01Nov2018,1
92,"Hello, I‚Äôm a high school student. I already made a post about this but I need more help. I broke up with my ex boyfriend over a month ago. We both still go to school together and I see him around occasionally. However, I can no longer stand being around him. We used to hit each other during our relationship and we were both also pretty addicted to doing sexual things, which really hurt or relationship. I would try to make him have sex with me quite often, which never worked but I was persistent, and he always guilted me into doing stuff. He got to his breaking point when I was joking with him and said I would cheat on him if he went of to do stuff in the military so he moved out of my parents house and now he seems much happier. I‚Äôm not and I am suffering. I am dealing with the constant guilt of the things I‚Äôve said and done to him. I still love him and I know that‚Äôs hard to believe since I bullied him and treated him like trash. Even if he hurt me too I still don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an excuse for anything. I don‚Äôt feel like the same person I was during the relationship.  Seeing him or thinking about him immediately ruins my day and I can‚Äôt focus on anything else. I‚Äôve been thinking about confessing to the counselor about this and hopefully break free and never have to see him again. Even though I love him we aren‚Äôt meant to be and it hurts to see him when I know I want him back so bad but he doesn‚Äôt want me. I don‚Äôt want to hurt him anymore and I want to get away. What should I do? Please help. ",01Nov2018,1
93,"I had this dream last night. It is currently 7:46 in the morning.

I guess I will start by a brief introduction. I am a high school student and I am an Asian.

So I always had a crush on this girl. She is white. She seemed nice and we had conversations occasionally. I missed a lot of chances. For example, in my freshmen year, she asked me these exact same words: ""Hey ____, did you ask anyone to the dance?"" I wasn't thinking and simply replied, ""I won't go"" although I knew that I had to go to the dance.

Anyways, the dream started with my normal high school life. I think that she knew I had a crush on her, but I never showed any signs. I don't talk to her in the hallway. I never hung out with her during breaks or lunch. I didn't look at her at all during classes like an ignorant fuck.

So one day, I was walking down the hallway and saw she and one of my best friends(let's call him Bob) going into the staircase. I saw them making out. I didn‚Äôt really feel anything else except minor jealously. I just walked away.

However, then afternoon, I started to feel ‚Äúnot right‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt know the reason. I started to ask Bob what happened. He simply just said that they were dating now. Things moved on. Nothing really happened.

Fast forward to the future(still in the dream). I participated in our high school reunion. I met Bob, and his wife(same girl), and another friend(let‚Äôs call him James). We talked about a lot of unnecessarily stuff, I do not remember what exactly happened, but I do remember about James telling us about our high school life. James knew that I had a crush on this girl. He also knew that I secretly write letters to her back in high school(which is not true irl). James said that he knew where the letters are. Since the reunion was at school, James was able to find the letters. I don‚Äôt remember what happened next, but the last thing that I remembered from this dream was James saying,. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt take the chances, but he did.‚Äù

‚ÄúTake the chances‚Äù, ‚ÄúTake the chances‚Äù, ‚ÄúTake the chances‚Äù. It kept on repeating in my head.

What if I took my chances. What if I listen to the dream and take my chances?",01Nov2018,1
