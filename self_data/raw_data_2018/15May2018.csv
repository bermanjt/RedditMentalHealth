0,"Sorry if this is in the wrong place or too graphic. TW: suicide, sexual assault.

What are some dark thoughts you have but don't necessarily want to share with friends? I'll start by sharing two of my own.
When I feel sad and or depressed I have such an obsession with death, I google pictures of suicides, insane flesh wounds, how to poison yourself, all sorts of stuff. I fantasize about ending my own life in a myriad of ways (please don't redirect to suicidewatch, I am not suicidal). If I feel hurt by someone I wish they would physically hurt me too to match the emotional pain. If I get hurt by a man I've had a relationship I sometimes wish he would assault me physically and sexually and hurt me visibly and physically too. Obviously I don't think i ACTUALLY want that in real life but..

1,"I picked up this habit after a really stressful event happened when I was about 30. It’s been nearly 5 years. I got into the habit of only smoking when I drank, but really enjoying that sensation. I became addicted to it. So, I’m turn, I started drinking more and more. It became a cycle of wanting to get high from the cigarettes and from getting drunk. 

So I started doing it way too often. When I had free time, I’d ask myself, what can I do now? Oh yeah, let’s get drunk. And then I’d smoke nearly half a pack at once. 

I’m tired of that lifestyle. I’ve had enough. 

I don’t judge others because they have better self control. But I don’t. So I threw my cigarettes out. And I’ve stopped drinking for now. And I’ve started biking and doing some exercise. 

We’ll see where that goes. ",15May2018,422
2,"so last monday my boyfriend and his friends (all college) decided to take a last minute trip to miami for rolling loud and to be on the beach etc. this is finals week for me so sadly i couldnt go and when he first brought it up to me, i was uneasy. said i had a feeling something was going to happen to get him or one of his friends in trouble, but he insisted it would be okay, so i said okay. hes been doing great and enjoying himself, keeping me updated etc, still involving me as much as he can while 1000+ miles away. well, last night i fell asleep pretty early and woke up to lots of texts in a row.  “we just got pulled over, i got searched, policeman brought me my ID, now we cant find my wallet and the [600+] dollars in cash he took with him/made down there”. they had a busted headlight, so i told him to be careful driving at night because thats such an easy way to get pulled over. thats not the reason they got pulled over though. they got pulled over because his friend was going 115. im mad at his friend. anyways, i have been supportive of him so far and helping to think of spots it could be, but theyve been looking all day and...no luck. his ID was in his wallet, but the cops didnt bring him his wallet, just his ID card.. I thought they might have taken the cash but his social security card was also in his wallet so i dont think they would have taken it without informing anyone. im upset with him but i know he already feels bad and i dont want to say anything to him to make him feel worse because in believing what hes telling me it really does sound like an accident. im just trying to figure out what we do now. hes stuck in florida, 10 states away, and i dont know any way to get him home other than a greyhound ticket which is probably what we’ll do. but what about him losing all that money. i know he didnt mean to and that things get misplaced sometimes but it was our (mostly mine) money that he took to be able to pay for gas and the festival and what not. thank you, any advice is appreciated 


tldr: bf went to florida without me, took 600 dollars, lost his wallet, now what do we do ",15May2018,0
3,"This afternoon, I set up a date with what seemed like a reasonably nice, reasonably attractive guy. I started looking forward to it. Then, he told me I was a brat for not wanting to talk in detail about whether I'm ""as delicious"" as I look. Way to not make a girl feel pressured. I'm 25. No one has called me a brat in 10 years. 

The last date I went on, my date talked about how he thought all the poor people in my neighborhood should be removed from their homes against their will because they're ""stealing all the jobs"" even though they don't work. The guy before that, I had started to really like. We'd been on 6 dates. I thought I could deal with him being a little arrogant sometimes (no one is perfect), until he told me that he wished he had my problems because mine are all so easy to fix. I could go on, and my stories aren't even as bad as a lot of the ones I've heard.

I really didn't think it would be this hard. I'm a smart, financially stable, generally nice, and definitely not crazy, woman. I model as a side gig sometimes, and am reasonably fit. I have passions and hobbies, and the thing I love most about being single is how much free time I have all to myself. I live in a big city where there's lots of eligible bachelors, and while I'm definitely not perfect and am not to everyone's taste, I'm pretty dateable.

I have been single for almost a year. I have chatted with countless men, have been on just under fifteen first dates, and have come even remotely close to starting a real relationship only once. I am exhausted. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to be alone, but I'm tired of unsolicited dick pics, awkward silences, and perpetual disappointment.

I am afraid of missing out on someone good because I've become too cynical. I find myself thinking that a guy is too good looking, or has too nice a job, to be into relationships, so I don't want to bother investing time. I'm afraid that I'll start thinking that my standards are too high, and I'll end up like so many women I know who have had their lives ruined by men who didn't deserve them.

I've taken breaks. I've just gotten back into dating after a two month hiatus where I just focused on myself. I enjoyed that time, but I still feel lonely. I feel like there's no other options- either I give up and be single for years (maybe forever), or I keep dating and hope I get lucky- all the while getting more and more convinced that I'll never find what I'm looking for.

I feel like this wouldn't be as hard if I wasn't a woman. There's always going to be lots of women ready for a long term relationship if you're an attractive, sane man with a job and any interests at all. You don't have to worry about losing a good match because there's always more. As a straight woman, I don't feel like I have that many options. There is not always a good match right around the corner- they are desperately hard to find. Yes, there are plenty of women not into longterm relationships, but the older I get, the less of them I'm seeing. I don't want to accidentally get stuck in a relationship because I feel there's nothing better. I'd much rather be alone than do that. 

I'm exhausted.",15May2018,19
4,"My last post was just a week ago. I said how things are getting better and that my psychologist cried because I’ve told her I’m managing depression way better. 

Well today I met with a girl I really like. We talked a bit and then I asked if I can say something. I told her how I feel about her, she took a big sigh and said she’s so happy to hear that. She’s having a very hard time these days and she really likes me back too and that she always thinks about me. We kissed, went to hang out with a bunch of friends, didn’t tell them anything (but laughed whenever we looked at each other) and when I brought her home we kissed again, and I felt like she really wants it. Like she’s really happy with it.

I JUST got over my ex. We broke up on very good terms, but the depression coupled with the break up killed me. As I said in the last thread, a month ago (almost exactly a month ago. At 10th of April) I was on my kitchen floor crying at 2 am, thinking that maybe killing myself is the only way out of misery. I’ll say it again, it’s not over, life’s still not where I want it to be, but fuck lol. Who imagined that so much would change in a month!!! It’s crazy.

6,"So let's start with he is a junior employee. Smart kid but very lazy and I suspect has a drinking problem. Come in my other worker another junior guy extremely hard worker and just as smart.

Lazy guy decides to take on a task that was supposed to be for me and if not it was supposed to go to other guy. Sadly we where both buisy and he decided he wanted to do it.

Come 3 days later nothing had been done. He had been coming in late and leaving early and taking long breaks all week. Nothing was getting done and other guy decided to pick the task from him.

He than told on him to me (I am not a SR nor his boss nor was I involved with this task at this time) I said yeah man idk that sucks. I went back to work. A couple of hours they decided to book a meeting to talk about that task. And lazy guy start starts complaining and saying how dumb it is that we want to do it the hard way. He doesn't understand why we have to work so hard on something so easy. 

Hard working guy I can tell is feeling attacked and i just snapped.

I told him in a very hard tone if he actually would have started the task and not sat on his ass for 3 days this wouldn't be happening. And that he should learn from this situation.

But I said it loudly in my parenting voice. I treated him like a child. A couple hours later I apolagizEd to him and everyone who was in that meeting.

7,"I had rough on and off break up with my girlfriend or the past year and a half. And the only person I can stand most the time aside from my now ex-girlfriend, is my best friend from since we were toddlers. But now my best friend and my girlfriend are starting a relationship. I started at a new school last year and had to leave all of my close childhood friends. Everyone at my new school seems to not want me around, I’ve started to feel like a real outcast. I can’t help but feel like I pushed the people closest to me out of my life. To add to that my Dad moved out and my sister went away to college and it’s been really hard on my Mom so I hate feeling like another burden to her whenever I’m sad.

8,"So I'm going to keep this post a-political, and I'm not going to share which side of the debate either of us are on for the sake of conversation.

I see a lot of fake news on my Facebook news feed. A lot. It's easy to scroll past most of the time. Sometimes I click on the original thread and I'm disheartened at the amount of people who eat it up and run with it. 

One of my coworkers shared some clearly fake news on his posts yesterday. It was just waaaayyy to easy to pinpoint it as fake news. I Google the topic, and find a specific webpage that labelled the story as totally fake. I just couldn't stop myself this time for some reason.

I went back, posted the link to my friend's post, and commented, ""This is how fake news spreads. People just share stuff without even looking into it. It makes me really sad to watch."" It stayed up for about fifteen minutes, no follow up. I double check later and I can't even find his profile anymore. Gone. I figure he blocked me, even though he never seemed like the kind at work to do something like that. I noticed I still had him on messenger though, which made me think. 

I spoke to him at work today, and told him I apologize for calling him out, and I didn't mean to offend him, but it just made me sad to see fake things being spread like that, and if he blocked me, that was fine. He stops me and says, ""No, I didn't block you, I deleted my Facebook.""

I was kind taken aback and asked him why.

He says, ""Because apparently I'm not above sharing fake news. I hate fake news, I think it's awful, but I straight up shared fake ass news and didn't even think twice about it. I thought it was totally real, and it wasn't, and who knows how much stuff on there I see that I just assume its real and its not."" 

I was almost a little shocked TBH. Usually when you call someone out, esp about politics, they still won't admit they're wrong. This guy admitted he was wrong, believed and shared fake news, and removed himself from it, all from my comment. 

Dude, I felt freaking awesome all day because of that. I can't even explain it. I'm just happy for him.",15May2018,2

13,"The other day, I went running for the first time in a while. I hadn't gotten halfway down the street when I see these two kids doing tricks on their skateboards as an old Indian lady walked by. They waved and smiled at her, but as soon as she turned away, the two shitheads dropped their skateboards and started walking behind her, mocking her with a cheesy Indian accent.

When she looked back at them, they would stand up straight, smile, and say ""have a nice day"" all cheery and go right back to what they were doing. She turned her back again and one of them picks up a rock that was about the size of a fist and chucks it at her. It missed, but just the fact that he would throw a rock at a harmless old lady who had been nothing but pleasant to them made my blood boil.

So this is gonna sound a bit pathetic, but last time I was on my own and away from my family I fell into a pretty deep hole of depression. I was in a bad roommate situation and I had a lot of my own unresolved issues. I think I'm a better, more healthy, person now but I also know I sometimes struggle to be social, which I think was a big part of my demise a few years ago. I didn't realize how being isolated was chipping at my self esteem and mental health. 

I don't even know if I'd consider myself an introvert, I'm just a little awkward and social outings make me nervous. It was an easy way to get the point of the question across. I know that I enjoy being social, it's a matter of actually going through with it. I like being by myself but I think I take it too far to a point that I feel unproductive and unhappy trapped in my head. 

 I'm going to school and working but I want to make sure my life doesn't end there. 

I've created some rules for myself to keep me together.  

- I am going to have a routine where I make sure I swim, lift weights, sing and play piano several times a week. 

- I am going to have a rule where as long as I have my homework and studying done, I am at  going to do something social at least once a week. (I.e go to a meetup, dance classes, a show, etc.) 



I mean, this sounds sustainable right? Obviously not everything is going to be flowers and sunshine, but basically the plan is to keep myself relatively  healthy, happy and productive. ",15May2018,3
16,"So, yes, I went cold turkey on Twitter. I did some network related stuff on the network of my house, and now twitter.com is blocked in any gadget or computer here. 

I'm addicted to Twitter since 2009. Since I was 13 years old. And I don't know exactly why, but since then I never stopped using it. I just like to post my useless thoughts somewhere. 
But recently, my ex broke up with me, and he is a Twitter user too. Obviously, I blocked him right away, but block in Twitter doesn't help too much: you still can see the tweets from the person, and everything else. So, since I can't control myself, and I have some anxiety issues, the only thing I saw I could do to prevent myself from hurting more (since he looks like a whole other person in Twitter, and that is horrible to see) was blocking Twitter. 

Not only I was stalking him endlessly, I couldn't stop putting negative thoughts in my page, and at the slightest sentence that remembered me of him it was like a trigger of bad thoughts to me. 


But now I'm suffering because I have this urge to post what I'm thinking, and I can't. I wish I could just tweet and not be able to see what other people are tweeting, but there isn't a way.

17,"I'm 22M and I'm about to graduate college. Ever since I was a kid, I could remember my mom getting into verbal altercations with everyone around her. The first time that I could recall was when a neighbor wanted to pay our babysitter more and persuade her to work for them instead. I was 6 at the time and all I remember is that it got so heated that I couldn't be friends with my neighbor anymore. I'm just going to list all the events that have happened to paint a picture of how she's acted most of my life:

*In second grade, she got mad at another friend's parents and caused that relationship to end quickly

*In fourth grade, she demanded to see a manager (yes, picture the stereotype) because their bathroom was under construction and the nearest one was KFC. I nearly pissed my pants because we had to wait to see the manager

*In fifth grade, she nearly chased my sister's ex in her car telling him to never come to our block because he broke up with her while she was in the hospital

*In seventh grade, she called my bully's mom to negotiate and figure out why the bully was picking on me

*In high school, she met with my ex's mom to have a conversation about why we broke up

*At high school graduation, she had to turn around and quiet the people behind her because they were too loud. The people that she shushed were my friends and that was so fucking embarrassing

*I can't go to movie theaters with her because if people talk too loud, she'll make it known she's not happy with that

*She called my college because she didn't like an email that one of the advisors sent out (this caused me to meet with the advisor to see if I was offended) - most embarrassing time of my life

*I can't get on the train with her because if someone's too close or has their elbow push against her slightly, she'll react and push back or curse at them. There was a time that people Snapchatted her and there was nothing I could do. It's happened multiple times and people have called her ""crazy lady"" on the train. It breaks my heart, even though I understand where they're coming from

*I apologized to one of the people she freaked out at and she got so mad at me that she made me walk home from the train station

*Two weeks ago, I felt ill and didn't go to class. When she called, I just woke up and had my ""morning voice"". She was able to tell right away and started to ask if I went to class. I started to lie and she threatened to call the school to make sure I went to class

Those are just a few instances, but what the fuck do I do? I love my mom, but she's caused me so much stress and I'm always on my guard whenever we go out together. I understand that she wants to play a ""momma bear"" role, but I'm too old to have her invade my life. How do I tell her to fuck off and to not be so irritable? Yesterday was mother's day, but I just had to reflect on all the shitty things she has done, albeit with good intentions. Are all moms this invasive and protective?

18,"I'm personally not afraid to die. I surely don't want to right now, but I'm not as terrified about it as I once was. I think now that I'm almost into my thirties, I have more of a lax view about the end of my own life. I want to live though. I want to continue taking care of my wife and daughters.

I've become more afraid of the death of others than my own, with good reason, I'd say. My three year old daughter was born with five critical heart defects. She doesn't have a left ventricle, is missing two valves, has incorrectly wired and very undersized arteries going into her lungs. Four times her heart has been stopped. Three were for complex surgeries. Once was when she had severe heart failure and went into cardiac arrest in front of me. She wasn't supposed to make it past birth, yet here she is. She tries to act like nothing is wrong with her. She tries to run and play like other kids her age. When she;s sick or feeling bad, she won't tell me because she's afraid of being taken to the hospital and being stuck with needles again.

My youngest daughter hasn't been born yet. Even she has her own problems. Her heart has a hole. Could lead to just a murmur. Could lead to surgery. I suppose I'll find out soon enough which it's going to be on a few weeks. This wasn't supposed to happen though. We had genetic testing done on our three year old. We were told over and over again that it was a fluke. A pretty damn complicated one, but still a fluke. 

My wife has developed pretty nasty gestational diabetes. It isn't supposed to be anything too uncommon, but it's progressed enough to where she's now insulin dependent. Even that wouldn't be an issue if it weren't for insurance. As of late, I've been feeling uneasy about her. I can't pinpoint it, other than the diabetes, but something feels off. I don't know exactly how I would function if she were to pass. 

It feels like death is dancing all around me, but leaving me myself alone. I suppose it's one of the reasons why I'm in the middle of becoming a paramedic. I'm not naive enough to believe that I can stop it, for any of them. Not entirely. But if I could prolong it for as long as I'm alive, for my girls, for my wife, for anyone, it would be worth it.

24,"About 3 months ago I started to get anxiety headaches and when I would turn on the tv and watch, I would, almost uncontrollably, think all of the words coming from the movie or talk show, approximately 2-3 seconds before the words left the speaker. It made my headache worse the longer I did this and I had a weird feeling like my mind was trapped in the near future. It only happened for like a week and a half on and off.

Now I’ve started to have another thing happen to me that has only happened a handful of times prior, but now it’s happening in a different way. Closed eye visions. I’ve had a couple long and existential ones in the past before and one very short one. But now when I close my eyes to rest or go to sleep, about 3 days out of the week I will see a flickering light, usually a little bit to the upper right in the darkness of my closed eyes. After watching it or after that happens, I start to have visions of opened books, And the sentences are literate and I can read them. I also see phones with walls of text that are literate and readable. Those are the only two types of visions I’ve been having mostly. The first vision I had of this type was of something different, but I don’t really want to talk about that one now.

I’ve looked online and it’s all psychic stuff. I am a believer in Jesus so I don’t seek to get into that.

I’ve heard of the Akashic records (or God’s library) and it’s not impossible that’s what I’m seeing and that doesn’t seem un christian, to have visions of books and writings. 

I kind of hope it keeps happening, it seems like I have asked God if I could look at the akashic records before, when I heard about it through Andrew VanWyngarden.

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this and want to talk about it? I’m open to talking about any weird experiences.

She's incredibly anxious about a lot of things, and as a result of that wants to spend all of the day with me everyday and when we're not together I have to hover over my phone responding to her constant texts so she doesn't get upset. She also will get incredibly angry whenever something doesn't go according to plan or something.

     One time we wanted to go to a store and when it was closed when the website said it would be open she tore up my hoodie that I share with her, started biting her hand hard, and started driving really recklessly which had me really scared. Another time we wanted to see a movie and it turned out they weren't showing it at that location even though I could have sworn it said so on the website. She started yelling in the car that I was retarded and that she wishes she never met me while biting her arm and hand. Usually when I can't keep from crying she gets angry at herself and starts hitting her head against stuff. After something like that happens she'll hold me close and say that she's very sorry for hurting me and that she's trying to get better. This used to happen occasionally but after some really dumb high school thing happened she lost a lot of the people she thought were her friends it's been more and more frequent. The way she pleads to me to please not leave her and how I'm all she has left makes me want to comfort her when that happens more than I want to break up with her. She also gets jealous whenever I try to have fun with anyone who isn't her. You get the idea but what I'm saying is that the relationship is very stressful for me, and I've wanted to break up for a while. However, I decided to wait until when she graduates from high school so at least we don't have to share a class after, and every so often we have a really nice day that makes me forget about it.

     The thing is, I've been thinking a lot about this other girl lately. I know almost nothing about her except that she's very cute and likes a lot of the same music I do. Obviously I don't think I'm in love with her or anything but I've wanted to ask her out. I'm even more afraid of breaking up with my girlfriend than asking her out. I know she really is trying to get better and she's been seeing a therapist for a month now, but I really don't think I can take it anymore. I don't think anyone will ever love me like I know she does and a lot of times I feel like, besides her problems, that we are absolutely perfect for each other. I feel so torn and I cry every night when I have to think about it in bed. I don't even know if this girl would agree to go out with me and if she did I don't know if she'd put up with all the stupid stuff I do like my girlfriend does. I feel so confused.

     I know I said earlier that this would probably be really long but I feel too upset to keep typing right now. Maybe I'll keep writing later and post it separately. Thank you very much to whoever read through all this dumb high school drama and might comment some advice or whatever else.",15May2018,1
28,"Some of us are blessed with pristine bathrooms on every floor of our workplace, ones that are cleaned on a regular basis, scrubbed so well you can eat off the seat. Others have to share their shitholes with the general public and would consider themselves to be lucky if they find a toilet WITHOUT shit or piss on the seat.

Sometimes the one you always use is occupied and you have to search the rest of the building, only to end up with the one next to the boiler room that hasn’t been cleaned in months. The lights don’t work, the soap dispenser is empty, and you’re sure you heard cockroaches behind the walls. Other times, that one boiler room bathroom is actually the secret clean one that only a few people in the entire building know about, and you just found yourself a diamond in the rough. You thank your lucky stars and you never speak a word of it to anyone.

Sometimes the toilet paper you’re stuck with is the shitty thin type that tears as you wipe your ass. The see-through type that rips at every square as you pull it from the dispenser. Nothing gets my blood boiling more than having my 20 layer toilet paper mass tear with my finger plunging a centimeter into my own asshole. Other times you are blessed with the expensive multilayered kind that is holy enough to be used to wrap a pharaoh.

And during the poop, sometimes you suffer some friendly fire in the form of piss and shit water splashing back onto your ass, as you curse your god and ask why he has forsaken you. Other times, you get one single unbroken log that slides painlessly out your butt that can easily be cleaned with one wipe (although you always do two just in case), and you’re in and out of there like a fucking SEAL team taking out an ISIS cell.

Anyways I hope you really think about your daily shits at work and how it can take your mood to the highest of the highs or the lowest of the shitty lows

30,"Perhaps due to past incidents, I’ve stopped trusting people and giving them my true authentic self. Completely. I don’t know how to tell people about myself, how to talk about my day, my interests and my life without somehow feeling embarrassed and lying and hiding some part of myself. 

Even now, I don’t feel comfortable texting one of my ‘friends’ and talking normally. I just feel bad for doing it, and I feel like I’d be judged or offend someone.

31,"I am so sick and tired of being autistic in this day and age. No one really cares about what ableism is, or how it affects disabled people, so I feel like I'm all alone in my struggles. And if I dare to breathe the tiniest whisper about wanting a cure for my autism, I'm yelled at by the majority of other autistic people for wanting some sort of autistic genocide. (Most autistic people these days are part of the Neurodiversity movement, and that movement is very, very anti-cure, since many autistic people think that a cure will eventually be used to eliminate autism entirely.) So I have to keep all of my stresses about being autistic bottled up inside, day after day, with no one to vent them to.

What's worse is that I live in an apartment building specifically meant for disabled people, and the staff members here don't seem to care about my emotional pain, either. One of them even recently said that she feels like her workday is harder than mine, even considering the fact that I have Asperger's. That seriously hurt. I mean, she is black, and she did grow up in some unfortunate circumstances, so I do feel like I have some white privilege compared to her, but that doesn't mean that the pain and struggles of growing up autistic don't matter. Nor does it mean that my everyday stresses don't matter.

I do have a therapist and a psychiatrist, but I can only afford to see the therapist once a week, which isn't nearly enough, and my psychiatrist is located pretty far away and he has a really busy schedule, both of which make it hard for me to see him on a regular basis. So I'm all alone most of the time, seeing as I have no real friends to speak of. Even at work (I have a part-time job as a Library Page), I'm alone. My autism causes me to have difficulty with small-talk, and my chronic pain disorders don't make it any easier since I often have brain fog due to them. So I'm pretty much an outcast at work, and I hate that. It hurts so much when I see my coworkers happily chatting with each other and I feel like I can't join in.

It's just getting harder and harder for me to keep holding on these days. A week from today, I'll be turning 31, and I can't help but dread that day. What's the point of wanting life to continue and wanting to keep getting older when you're as miserable as I am?",15May2018,4
32,"Why do men cheat?


Well just like any complicated subject like this, there is not one clear cut answer to why a man cheats. However, if we did have to break it down to one of its simplest forms the answer would be, because a man is a man at the end of the day. That's a broad statement to grasp though right, especially if you're not a man. All you really have to do is understand the basic concept that men and women are completely different. The way a man thinks, the way he expresses his emotions, the way he loves, the way we as men do everything, is just completely different from a woman. Men are simply hardwired differently. It’s not like any man wants or desires to be a cheater. No man just wakes up and says I'm going to cheat today. But when you really begin to break stuff down to its core, you have to understand that monogamy is something that is unnatural if you really look at how we are made up biologically. It has always been programmed into us that you are supposed to find one woman and marry her, etc. I do believe in monogamy and that without it, life would be pretty messed up. I would hate it if my girl ever cheated on me, but if you take away all the cultural norms and social norms, monogamy is something that was not hardwired into us from the beginning, it’s something we constructed and decided to all abide by. 
Even though a man could be the most faithful person in the world, he still has that natural disposition to not be monogamous deep down inside him. As long as he is strong willed enough to fight all of these natural urges that he has to go through and believes in strong morals and wants to live his life in a positive way, then he may be one of the few who never cheat. Very few men are this strong though, unless they had a really positive male figure in their life, or they are super religious, or something else that kind of forced them into being this perfect male who never has bad thoughts and never even contemplated looking at another girl. People are not perfect. Every man is going to fall short at one point in his life. I don’t care how good of a person you think your man is, I’m going to tell you that your man has fell short at least one time in some way. He has either contemplated what it would be like to have sex with another girl, flirted with another girl, actually had sex with another girl, whatever the case may be, he has fallen short in a way that would really damage you, I guarantee it. Even the most faithful man, if given the perfect window of opportunity, the idea of stepping out on his relationship would at least cross his mind, and more than likely he would  probably would even act on it if he knew he could 100% get away with it. 

We all know the classic saying that, all men cheat, well its true. Of course not all men are cheaters, there are a lot of good men in the world, but I guarantee that your man has pictured himself having sex with another female at least once, if not damn near all the time. Focus on that I said “pictured” himself having sex, not actually even thinking about acting on it.  It's just how men are built. We are sexual creatures, and I don't care if you are the finest woman on the earth, there is always going to be something that will catch a man's eye. Not to say that he actually will pursue it, or lust after it, but just biologically, a man's hormones are going to always be at work. If he sees a beautiful woman he is going to automatically be aroused, that's something that is out of his control. The only thing he can control is whether he pursues this feelings or acts on his natural urges. 
Cheating is something that I think I should define before I dive a little deeper. I'm going to define cheating as doing or saying anything to any other female that you would not do if your partner was in the room with you. So that can be as simple as flirting or full blown having sex with another person. Of course flirting is not on the same level as having sex, but to most women, they bundle all this type of stuff into the same severity level.  Men are exposed to temptation all day every day. Women on social media are basically just naked these days and it's become more acceptable for women these days to wear more revealing clothing, have sex freely, etc. Women are sexualized, and everyone understands this. It's sad, but true. Women are the most beautiful thing on earth and should be held to higher regards than what they are, but the way society is today, they are seen more as objects and toys for men and our kids are taught this from an early age. If a young man is not raised by a man who teaches him how to love a woman and respect a woman, they won't understand the concept of being faithful to a woman. A woman can tell a man how to be a man, but she can't teach a man how to be a man. I don't think not having a man in your life is an excuse for wrongdoing, I'm just saying it can definitely play a part in why some men don't fully understand why it's important to be faithful and how detrimental cheating can actually being on a woman. 



If someone is going to cheat you would think they would cheat because they found something better or that they are unhappy with their current relationship. You probably would think this other girl either is better looking, has more money, makes him happier, etc. However, the weird things is that most men cheat down. Cheating down meaning that the person they cheat with is probably not as good looking, or doesn't have as much going for them as the person that they are with. So why would a man cheat down? Well its very simple but not simple and is something that you shouldn't really overthink. A man just likes what he likes. That man probably doesn't even know why he is attracted to this female. It's just how things go sometimes. Attraction is a weird concept. You can’t rationalize it, define it, analyze it, or make sense of it. A lot of the things we do as humans simply don’t make logical sense. 



When a woman cheats it is completely different than a man cheating, even though cheating is cheating at the end of the day. This can seem like a biased concept, but women cheat way differently than men cheat. Women are much more emotionally attached people, they do things with more purpose behind them, they don’t do things just willy nilly. So when a woman cheats there is definitely a lot more meaning behind it. Men are the complete opposite from women, so when we cheat it possibly could be completely meaningless and dumb. There could honestly be no real underlying reasons he cheated besides a man was just being a dumb man. Men are stupid is definitely a true saying. We are smart but we can definitely be very stupid. Don’t get me wrong though, cheating is cheating at the end of the day, I’m just trying to put out the fact that there is definitely a clear distinction between men and women and how they cheat.



Cheating comes in many forms and happens for many different reasons, so we're going to focus on just one particular type of relationship where cheating just makes no logical sense. We are going to focus on relationships where everything is going good, but then the man randomly cheats. I'm talking about things are going so good that the couple has been together for years and are working towards marriage, etc. I'm talking about a relationship where the female is also doing her part and there is no reason for him to step out on his relationship. This woman cooks, cleans, has sex whenever you want to, is loving and caring, etc. What would possess a man to cheat on someone who is basically doing everything they want and need a woman to do. It makes no sense right? This is kind of a stupid analogy, but ask yourself this question, what man in their right man would cheat on Beyonce? Well Jay-Z did, and I guarantee you that when he was cheating, he wasn't doing it because he didn't love Beyonce, or didn't think that she was the most beautiful woman on the face of the earth, or that he didn't want to spend the rest of his life with her. He probably just wasn't thinking. When a man has actually started to step out on his relationship, he is not thinking about his woman at that point in time. He is only thinking about the now and not thinking about how he is really putting everything on the line. He is being selfish to be blunt, but that’s how men are sometimes. Men just think about the fun we are having for that time being. We know we love our woman and that she is the one we are always going to come back to at the end of the day. We think our girl won't find out, and that we can have our cake and eat it too. However everything that happens in the dark always comes to the light, but we think that we have the game mastered and that it won't happen to us. 



Men know how to not be emotionally attached to a woman, which is why a woman cheating is completely different than a man cheating. Men can have sex with a female without being emotionally attached to her at all. Women probably think they can do the same thing, but I guarantee you that if a woman allows you to have sex with her, she is going to have some type of emotional attachment to you whether she chooses to or not. So even though men know that cheating is wrong, we try to rationalize it by telling ourselves, I’m not emotionally attached to this girl so I’m cheating but I’m cheating cheating. If you get what I mean by cheating cheating. This is honestly how we feel. Like I said, we know who we want to spend our lives with and that the girl we are cheating with is just being used for our own selfish purposes. There can be a gamut of selfish reasons such as they want to experience something new sexually, they’re bored, they’re going through a rough patch in their relationship, and the list goes on. I guarantee you that the reason is never because they don’t love the person that they are with. Women will take a man cheating as, he never loved me, there must be something wrong with me, etc. This is why a lot of relationships don’t survive after infidelity has occurred. That woman is hurt that her man stepped out of course, but the major underlying reason that this woman can’t move past this is because she is literally damaged. She feels like her whole relationship was a lie. That her boyfriend never actually really loved her, and that something about her must have not been good enough for him, because he felt the need to step out on his relationship. That is not the case that man never stopped loving you and still cares about even though he did do a whole bunch of bullshit, but a woman could never understand that because she can never understand the thought process of a man. 



Men  are not very emotional creatures. We can easily block out certain stuff, not think about things, and move on. We can definitely be selfish creatures at times too, and will do what will make us happy even though we run the risk of hurting someone else. We also lie to our girls way more than you would think. We think that we are slick enough to the point where that person won't get hurt though, because they'll never know. Our intention is to never just hurt the ones we love. We are very good at lying, and will always go by the saying ""what she don't know won't hurt her."" I guarantee you that a large majority of men would cheat if there was a 100% chance that they would never get caught. Men are scared of women and know that you a female will find out everythingggg even if we know we took all the proper steps to cover our tracks. Some men decide to take that risk though and some don't. Some men have got it like that where they actually have access to females that may be interested in them and give them a window of opportunity, but some men aren’t as good with the ladies. They may never have windows of opportunity, so they don’t even see it as a possibility of being able to cheat, even if they wanted to. There’s so many dynamics to all of this. Some men may cheat just because the opportunity presented itself at the right time. Some men don’t cheat just because they don’t even have access to a female to cheat with.  


I think a very important factor in cheating is windows of opportunity. Women in general are always approached by men on a daily basis. They have ample opportunities to cheat on their man if they really wanted to. Even if you are not the best looking girl, you are going to be pursued by men a lot. Men don't just have women coming up to them complimenting them, asking for their number, asking them on dates on a frequently reoccurring basis. So when a man finds a girl that shows she is interested in him and is giving him a window of opportunity, that's going to feed that man's ego. All men are egotistical to a degree whether they think it or not. Every man wants to be alpha. Every man wants to be the guy that every girl wants. Every man likes a challenge, and feel accomplished when they do something they didn't think they could do. So when a girl feeds this man's ego, it's something that is hard for him to turn down because it's fueling him this egotistical drive he has as a man. Women are used to turning men down left and right. It's not hard for a woman, especially one who is very good looking, to have her pick of men that she wants. Women really hold all the power at the end of the day. Men don't have it so easy. Most men have to try hard to get a girl to like him. They have to go out of their way and work hard and try to convince a girl to even give him a chance. So if they find a girl who is giving him an opportunity and is attractive to him, they're going to take that easy route and see where it leads him. Everyone enjoys getting attention and feeling like they are special. Everyone wants to feel like someone likes them and admires them. If men had women coming at them left and right all day every day, then there would probably be a lot more cases of cheating then there already is, I guarantee it. 



Getting back to the fact of why men will cheat when everything is going right in their relationship. There is never an excuse for cheating, but these are the basic reasons why. To simply put it, men get bored, men have egos, men are sexual creatures, men like the excitement of something new , men can be selfish, men don't think, men feel like they aren't a man if they haven't been able to have experiences with multiple females, men are egotistical. 


Jumping onto the topic of having experiences with multiple females. Most men feel like the goal is to be with as many females as possible. The more females you have under your belt, the more of a ""man"" you are perceived to be. It is a double standard, because we know if a female has a bunch of men under her belt she is looked down on and seen as less of woman. However, as we know, even though it is a double standard, it still is going to be the general consensus of thought, and that it's going to always going to be seen as an acceptable thing for a man to have been with multiple women even though we know this is not something that should be praised.


For young men, if a man doesn't get that feeling of wanting to have multiple experiences out of his system before he starts a super serious relationship that he knows he 100% wants, then he has a strong chance of being one of those who fall short when a window of opportunity presents itself. Before a man commits to marriage with one woman for the rest of his life, if he feels like he missed out on something in his life, he is going to try to get that out his system before he basically ends his life. Getting married to a woman basically means his life is over. When I say his life is over, I don’t mean that in necessarily a bad way. I mean it as in he knows that he is no longer living for just him, and that he has no room for fuck ups; if he’s a real man who’s actually serious about marriage of course. So from the thought process of a man he’s going to think, “ok… I really have plans of marrying my girlfriend. I really didn’t get to do all the things I wanted to do before I jumped into this relationship, and now I actually have a window of opportunity presenting itself through this girl who is interested in me, so I might as well take it because my girl won’t find out, I’m still young and honestly don’t know 100% what I want, life is short and I need to live it, I need to explore all possible routes before I commit to something as serious as marriage, because that means my life is over once I make that decision,  and I know love my girl so I’m just going to enjoy this while it lasts and at the end of the day I’m going to come back to my girl. 



TL;DR All men cheat or at least have contemplated it. Men don’t cheat because they don’t love their girl. There are a lot of factors that play into why he may cheat. There is no excuse for cheating, but taking into account the way a man is hardwired, it’s something that is bound to happen in a lot of people’s lives at some point, whether they are aware it happened or not.

36,"Does anybody else get jealous with their SO? I know I do. Most of the time, when I get jealous, its generally because my SO is having fun, and I am not participating. But, there are all forms of jealousy that manifest themselves differently. This post will be a bit long, but I challenge all of you to read it, think about it critically, and apply it to your lives in ways that matter. I will include a TL;DR only out of obligation. I have edited this six times and every sentence matters. So here goes:
As humans, most of us love fire. Fire is warm, its food-providing, comforting, and it always changes. Adler (2013), a writer for Smithsonian.com said: “Wherever humans have gone in the world, they have carried with them two things, fire and language” (par. 1). The same author continued: “It is, of course, impossible to imagine a human society that does not have language, but—given the right climate and an adequacy of raw wild food—could there be a primitive tribe that survives without cooking? In fact, no such people have ever been found” (par. 1). 
I guess fire and communication are the raw form of humanity. That being said, how do I transition to notes on jealousy? 
Jealousy = forgetting. Period. And comma, Forgetting is human. As humans, the fire in a relationship is always subject to rain. Adler (2013) stated: “As they [humans] traveled through tropical forests they hoarded the precious embers of old fires and sheltered them from downpours” (par. 1). It is with idea in mind that I can transition responsibility to maintaining fire in a relationship, with notes on jealousy (a personal emotion and a crippling state of mind), and with an idea of kindling. 
I’m a sucker for the thrill of a new relationship. The lovey-dovey stages, the pink cloud, the honeymoon, whatever you want to call it. It is so sexy, hott, and quivering with anticipation. And as a human, I long for the burning, engulfing nature of a roaring flame. While fire is important, it need not be always roaring and to assume that it will be is irresponsible to fuel sources. Humans are born with limits. The limits are yet unknown. The ability to build fire and communicate enhances our understanding of them, but they are ever present. For my age [M26], I’ve been in two long-term relationships (both over three years) and both times I was dumped. I’m currently in an incredibly healthy, yet relatively new relationship (almost 9 months). She challenges me, she demands challenge, and she enraptures me. In the words of a fine poet of our time (Carl Carlton, 2002), “ She’s a Bad Mama Jama.”
The other night, she went out with a co-worker of hers while I was working (yes, we are on opposite work schedule as she maintains a 9-5 and I’m a bar manager). I’ve met this dude several times when I bring her lunch/coffee/snacks at work. He’s cool. Viewing relationships from my past, I initially felt a little weird about it. I realized that I wasn’t jealous because I was worried that she might fall for this guy. I was jealous because he got to hang out with her when I couldn’t. I had to remember that I trust her completely and that the weird feeling I was having was only because I wasn’t a part of that miniscule segment of her life. She also brought me dinner while I was at work, texted me to tell me that I was hers, and affirmed my turst. And that’s just it, when we’re in love, we want to be involved in every part of people’s lives. But the jealousy comes from insecurity—often not from misbehavior on the part of your SO. 
Do you remember when you met the woman you are with? Or are no longer with? Or the woman you dream about being with? In the first couple weeks, after meeting, she might say, “I’m having lunch with a friend.” In those stages, it would be weird for one to say: “I’m not comfortable with you eating lunch with somebody else.” 
It should always be weird for one to say that.

Here’s why. And here’s what is missing in most relationships today (other than complete disregard for syntax). HUMANS KEEP FORGETTING TO ALWAYS PROVIDE EACH OTHER WITH THE TWO ESSENTIAL THINGS THAT ADLER (2013) IS TALKING ABOUT: FIRE AND COMMUNICATION. People are supposed to feel jealous. They’re supposed to “communicate” about it – not yell about it and certainly not “wound” about it. They’re supposed to be challenged to impress their SO. But they’re looking at “drinks with a friend” all wrong. If you’re treating your SO the way that they deserve to be treated and vice versa, building fires together, and communicating, then what are you worried about? Maybe your SO will compare you to the guy/girl that he/she is having drinks with, maybe he/she won’t. But if he/she does, its biologically natural to do so, and instead of focusing on how its “wrong for he/she to compare me to him/her,” I challenge you to focus on letting him/her know that you are the best for them. Do this by waking the fuck up everyday, doing THE MOST YOU CAN, and expressing your joy for them. BUILD THE FUCK OUT OF FIRE. WHEN IT DWINDLES, CARRY IT, TREASURE IT, AND SHELTER IT. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, ALWAYS BE KINDLING. YOU’RE STRONG (and even if you’re not) FUCKIN NEANDERTHALS FIGURED IT OUT. 
I mentioned “forgetting” earlier saying: “Jealousy = Forgetting” and essentially “Forgetting = human.” When you’re jealous, you’re forgetting that your SO chose you over EVERYONE at some point. If you’re not worthy of their choosing at THIS 	point, then work on it. They will likely give you a grace period to fix things. Also, challenge them to work on themselves so that they don’t forget that YOU CHOSE THEM TOO! This is only plausible through working everyday on communicating properly. Otherwise, one’s perceptions could perceive expectations as unfair categorization—which leads to jealousy that isn’t challenging—but rather, detrimental.

38,"Aside from the reddit admins, I don't think I've run into a single person who likes the redesign.

First of all, here are instructions for maintaining the legacy reddit experience as long as possible:

1. Use old.reddit.com. They're indicating that they will not maintain this subdomain, but perhaps if enough users remain on it they will reconsider.

2. User uBlock origin to remove the annoying orange ""visit new reddit"" button in the upper left. Use the element picker to isolate that button, and block it on all pages.

3. [Message the moderators at the beta profiles subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/profilesbeta&amp;subject=%5Bprofiles%5Dopt-out&amp;message=Please%20opt%20my%20profile%20page%20from%20the%20beta), and tell them you want to opt out. They may no longer honor this request, but if they do it will allow other users to continue seeing the original user page format for your account.

4. At the very bottom of your account preferences, check the box for ""View user profiles on desktop using legacy mode"". This will allow you to view all user profiles in the original format.

Generally there are two motivations for a site to dramatically overhaul its front-end design. Either the existing design is too difficult to maintain, or they believe the new design will bring in more revenue.

Considering the bare-bones structure of the legacy format, I doubt it was particularly difficult to maintain. I think reddit is trying to become a social network.

Most sites don't grant users the opportunity to continue using legacy formats. We should take advantage of the fact that the reddit admins are permitting this. If you don't like the new redesign, follow the steps above to maintain your legacy page view. 

It's pretty damn unlikely the redesign will ever be reversed. But perhaps if a significant number of users cling on to the legacy site format, they'll at least continue to maintain it.",15May2018,10

40,"When I was a kid, I didn't have any friends, but I was in all the advanced programs and kept my self-esteem up by being at the top of the class. Then another girl got moved up a grade and simultaneously moved me down to second best. In our small school there were usually only 2 or 3 more kids in our advanced classes and she and I had every class together, for 6 years. 

I wanted to be her friend since we were always together and I was really lonely, but she was too good for me. She was smarter, faster, prettier, skinnier, and had more friends. She thought I was gross for having crushes and I was constantly feeling the pressure of not being the best; not even being good enough to talk to her. Of course I gave up after a few years. (She still won't talk to me; I had a formal interaction with her recently and she just ignored me.)

Now I'm 20 and she's 19, and I came across her instagram recently. She's a Mormon so of course she's at BYU now and just got married like last week. She plans to be a missionary &amp; mother with the rest of her life.

This feels so weird, since she was always so confident and self-sustaining. She used to make me feel disgusting for having crushes, but now she's married in her teens and probably just going to be a stay at home mom for the rest of her life. She's taking the dependent route and also absolutely absorbed in Mormonism, which is a questionable religion, especially for someone who used to make me feel stupid.

Kinda feels like she's being a hypocrite, and like nothing about this even matters. But of course, if I was being moral and right, I wouldn't have cared about someone's opinion back then, called their religion questionable, and judged their life choices, anyway. I'm just feeling confused after harsh treatment from this girl for so many years. ",15May2018,5
41,"So in the UK, when the sun comes out and it’s a little warm. It’s an excuse for everyone to get some beers in and have a couple in the sun. Even at midday on a Tuesday - if the suns out, it’s fair game. 

So I got home at about 4pm and there was an older gentleman in a shirt and and jeans, bit scruffy, having a few drinks (a four pack - just one open) at the end of my street. I think nothing of it because it’s very warm out.

I go about about 20 minutes ago, and he’s moved to the end of the road parallel to mine and he’s now leaning up agains the street sign, with what looks like his last beer, talking to himself and seemed pretty drunk. 

I don’t know why, but I really want to help him. I’ve been quite lonely myself recently and this could be him just needing to talk to someone, however there also could be a million other reasons he his doing that... I don’t know. What should I do? 

TLDR: drunk guy talking to himself at the end of my road. Should I go check if he’s okay? ",15May2018,3

43,"I work in a warehouse in Georgia. 70% of my coworkers, unfortunately including the ones I work with on the daily, are complete assholes. They're constantly making fun of me and I know it's just because I'm different from everyone else there. 

I've been there for six months now. All the assholes there are middle aged or older guys. They just don't lay off. They have done nothing for their entire lives except work at low paying jobs with no hope of doing anything better. I know I'm better than them and I think that may be a factor to why they're dicks to me.

I'm a straight male. With a girlfriend that they have seen. Everyday, I'm called gay. Everyday, they make fun of me saying that they caught me cuddling a guy on break. Everyday, they have stupid shit to say to me. Everyday, someone throws random objects at me in attempt to hit me. They talk shit about me behind my back all the time.

I don't do anything wrong. My boss tells me I do a great job at work, I study for school on my breaks when I'm feeling it. 

I would love to hit them. But it's definitely not worth losing my job over. People always ask me,"" why don't you stick up for yourself?"" ""Why don't you kick their ass?"" 

Easy response. I don't want to lose my job over something stupid.

Now we have a house and a kid. I'm in a living nightmare, with someone who doesn't understand me, doesn't listen to me, just shouts me into silence when I have an opinion on anything. Doesn't let me have my say on our sons wellbeing. But is perfect in every fucking way but the way he treats me. 
Everyone I meet tells me how good of a dad he is, and he is... 
Now I've a choice of pretending to be happy when I'm miserable or splitting up our family. Sell our house. Back to my mams because rent is so expensive. He's never going to leave me in the house. He won't ever leave.
I honestly starting to believe he has a narcissist personally disorder. Maybe not as bad as most, but he ticks about half the boxes. 
I had very very bad depression for years, I got myself out of it. He was nothing buy sympathetic when it was bad and was always there for me. I'm out of it mostly now, but he is not supportive what so ever if I ever get upset about anything. He shouts at me. One time I had a complete breakdown and he called all sorts of names and told me to go see a doctor. 
It's like he wanted me to be that mess, and when I got myself back he didn't want that person. He wanted the vulnerable me.

How do people go on their own. I can't even afford the debts and bills outweigh my entire wage. I earn more than him though. That's the only positive I have.

I understand the PSAT is just a practice and probably not many people take it but still it did pretty good. 

I never try in my classes I don't study for tests and I get the same grades as those who work their balls off. On tests where people try really hard on I walk in without studying and score in the top 5. What I'm trying to say is that sometimes I really need to work on something but I just blow it off because I feel I can fix my gpa down the road or I can use the ACT to back me up. I feel like I may be afraid to apply myself on simple assignments. But on tests where it really matters I score so much higher and the teachers think I cheated or just not applying myself during class. My parents know I'm smarter than I show people and they push me to actually try and I respect that but I just can't. I blame procrastination but it could be more.

College freshman virgin nerd here.

To my horror, when I got to college, I found out I was in the oldest dorm they had. This meant instead of the type with showers with private stalls, it was the type with showerheads in an open area.

I was TERRIFIED to shower with the other guys. To the point that I would drive home 30 minutes to shower at my mother's house.

I'm about 5'7, not fat but a chubby belly, with a small package and a big white butt.

Finally, 3 days ago, I decided to try it.

I reluctantly undressed down to my little blue boxers. Took a deep breath and removed them, quickly covering my exposed lower body with a towel.

I then timidly walked towards the steamed up shower with 12 other guys in there, hung the towel on a hook, and walked buck naked past everyone to a showerhead.

There I was, naked as a jaybird, blushing red, and soaping myself up under the hot water, looking both ways in panic.

I was actually doing it!!

Then, a larger boy walked in, saw a friend of his and said ""Move over, small stuff!"" and SLAPPED my naked butt hard as I scurried off, blushing, soapy from head to toe and dripping wet, to another showerhead about 20 feet away as everyone laughed.

I flinched as the water came on cold, but I finished my shower, toweled off and left.

My friend Sharon of course thinks it's ""the funniest story to imagine I ever heard.""",15May2018,1

61,"So I got broken up with about a year and a half ago. I actually talked about it last night on this sub in a comment thread of another post. This guy drove me NUTS. Gave me that, ""I know we're meant to be together forever,"" feeling. But still, we remained broken up and I was still so attached. 

About six months after, I met a guy at a concert. It was the first time since I met my ex I had felt spark with anyone. He was so cute and handsome and seemed like he had an amazing heart. We had a really steamy month together, extremely romantic and just everything I ever dreamed of. The communication was great, and he was more into me than any guy I'd ever been with.  

But alas, I knew I wasn't over my ex at ALL. I still thought about him every hour of every day. I still wanted him back so bad. I knew if he hit me up, I'd be in his bed immediately. I didn't think that was fair. 

I broke it off with Mr Perfect, being as honest as I could ever be. He was very sweet about it, but sad. 

A year has gone by since then. My relationship with my ex is deader than it ever was. They've started playing ads for the annual concert we met at and I started thinking of him. A lot. I thought about how stupid I was for giving that man up, for breaking it off and hurting someone who was so absolutely pure at heart. 

I suddenly missed the ever living piss out of him. I wanted to tell him I'm so, so sorry. I knew I didn't deserve any remorse or anything. Maybe he blocked me. 

But I did it. I texted him and told him I'd been thinking about him, and I hope he's well. 

No response for two days. But today, he finally texted back and we've been talking and catching up all day. He said he had to really think about it before texting me back, understandably.

Last night I was jealous of her talking with one of our college friends (ive been jealous of them two since they’re best friends), because since I had access to her account I could see her messages on messenger (terrible idea i know), I noticed that she was talking to the guy quite actively at that moment rather than talking with me. In the guy’s defense, he has always been kind to my girlfriend and has been a good friend to both of us, but i always sometimes feel that she visibly enjoys his company more somehow. I know it’s wrong for me to control my girlfriend and I should stop this right now. 

I feel like the main reason why this is happening is that whenever I give or love to my girlfriend, I always somehow expect her to return it to me or stick to me. I feel entitled to all of her time and efforts and happiness. Back when we were flirting and dating I would always give and never expect, which was why that was the happiest time of our relationship.
