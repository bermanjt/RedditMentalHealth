4,"This horrible nightmare started for me in the beginning of summer, right when I got back home from college. I was looking at myself in the mirror and I noticed that I could see right through my hair. When I ran my hands through my hair I noticed that I didn’t feel as much hair. I couldn’t even style it the same way I used to. As a result of this, my entire summer has just been sad. I spend most days just in bed feeling sad. And the few times I do hang out with my friends, I just act like nothings wrong. I used to love working out and dieting and all of that, but now I don’t even want to go to the gym, it’s pointless. My parents just laugh when I bring it up, to the point where it gets annoying. My dad went through the exact same thing at my age and was done balding at 22. He was noticeably bald when he was 20. But he came from a time and place where looks didn’t matter as much. He just simply says going bald has no affect on your life. I highly think that’s untrue, at this day and age. Realistically, no 18 year old girl wants to date someone who is balding. There’s no way around it. Just seems like I have to put my life on pause for 3 years. The sad part is, I tried everything I could to improve my looks and actually ended up looking decent. My parents jokingly tell me to get rich, but I don’t want to get used for money. I know looks aren’t everything in a relationship, but I want them to be physically attracted to me. If I was rich and ugly, I think I’d rather just be alone. I really don’t know what to do, it’s almost time to go back to college and I’m really sad. I recently tried rogaine, but got side effects and might stop soon. Doctors tell me I’m too young for propecia. Really felt like I needed to vent on here, guess I’m looking for some advice.",15Aug2018,42

8,"I am not vociferous enough. By the virtue of my genetics, short of outright bloody war, I am a coward. That a percentage damnable by my white oppressors mars my genes, my voice and my skin and my existence are not enough of a battle cry. In his opinion, I could scream more desperately; so my whiteman makes me scream more desperately. I endured his lashes so far, for he would take my child from me, with his family’s lawyers andhis family’s stolen prestige.

Gods give me a lover so brown and desperate as me. Gods give me an Eddie Vedder if he’s not a black man. For I fear the hand of the white man, as I have felt his hand on my face when when he promised me nonviolence, when he promised me a love of my darkened skin.

9,"A hundred years ago, my sexy black granny got doinked hard enough by the white guy who owned her sharecrop to bear his kids. It’s been straight downhill since then. She married a guy who happened to be a Blackfoot tribesman, and had yet more kids, and from that point forward, our family was FUCKED.

And yet, the eldest son of our generation recommends genocide against us. My own husband and the father of my daughter beats and berates me for what is, in essence, my heritage. I do not fight it hard enough, this current of politic; that my very existence is an affront to the Trumpian mind makes no difference, for I do not scream it.
Fuck you, white libtards. Fuck you hard. I like leftist shit, but I vote moderate, and one of your popular voices screams against me, beats me, when I say his white liberalism needs an education in bkackness and brownness. But I am still married to that voice, so the owner of that voice rips me asunder and gives me broken feet and broken hands.

You are the poison, white folks, your fearfulness about your beliefs poison me and my daughter. Fuck you fuck you fuck you white men and your white desires. And goodbye, because I meant this reddit account to forget all about you, and here you’ve ruined it with further violence against me.

11,"I can't stand my mom. the faces and noises she makes make me furious. almost irrationally mad. She is narcisisstic and really good at gaslighting and reshaping reality to where she never did or said anything wrong. she wants me to be her tiny baby and depend on her, but i'm 19 and I just moved out of my parents' house. she will not let go. I am an only child and she is always up my ass, while i am used to being along and prefer being left alone. She always held my hand and did shit for me when I was young, and now I am trying to learn how to do things by myself but she is STILL doing shit for me and i feel like I will never be able to depend on myself.

today, she texted me. we talked, ran out of things to talk about, and she told me to call her later so we can chat. I hate talking on the phone. she tells me useless things and then tells me everything that i've ever done wrong. i have done my best to reply to her and EVERYTHING, but i got irritated thinking how bad I hate talking on the phone. Being like every other teenager on this earth, I made a post on facebook saying I didn't like talking on the phone. 

my mom lost it. called me, cried at me for half an hour, and then told me if I didn't come see her on thursday then she was taking my car back. it was unpleasant, she told me how i treat her like shit, and how hurtful i am. at one point she said after i finish getting my shit, she would never contact me again (which she has done before.) 

I just want to be left alone. every time she does this I want to get even further away from her. At this point I don't want to patch the relationship. without my dad while i was growing up, I would have been miserable. when I was young (4-6) we would get in disputes and she would get her shit and leave for hours. over an argument with a fucking baby. She always makes me feel like shit and I had to seek therapy to learn how to deal with myself and her. 

I don't know where else to post this, i'm just upset and angry. i got so frustrated earlier I cried and I can't think about anything other than this woman dangling my own car over my head so i'll talk to her. she makes me want to kill myself. ",15Aug2018,2

13,"First of all I just wanted to say I don't want to sound braggy, but this is quite unusual for me so I wanted to share with someone

I'm 19 yo and I'm a ""regular guy"", but I don't approach girls a lot because I'm pretty shy, so for me to talk to a girl it takes some effort, and normally I only do it If I'm very interested in her. But today, all of a sudden, this girl  asked my name before the class started and then she just came to me by the end of the class and asked me for my phone number so we could... ""talk about the homework"" (but there isn't any homework). So I gave it to her, even tho I wasn't very interested in her, it was kinda weird at the moment, but it also felt like a compliment, so afterwards I felt pretty good too.

Do you girls do this often? And boys, do you also feel a bit embarrassed when something like this happens, or am I just too shy?",15Aug2018,0
14,"Rehearsing feels like cheating to me. Anyone can practice anything and be good at it with enough time, but since that skill will ebb away without constant maintenance it feels like a temporarily propped-up boost rather than a baseline skill. 

Like studying for your high school certificate or A levels or whatever they call it in your country, you study your absolute mind out for a month beforehand to boost yourself up and pass the test, but within a few months you'll have forgotten most of it. So if the test was say, history, that exam doesn't show how much history you know on any given day, it shows how much history you know if you study history all day every day for a month. 

For a real test of what you know and are good at, tests with 0 warning make more sense to me - it's a test of what you know, not a test if how much time you're willing to sink into preparation. Not to mention, the ability to improvise and act under pressure seems like a much more valuable skill, especially in the era of information we live in now - memorizing dates in history is a cool party trick but its also at your fingertips at a moments notice.

17,"My high school orientation was today(10th grade). This summer I have been developing better habits and coping skills, diet, fitness, self-care, all of that good stuff. 

In past years, during the school year, I was so depressed and I failed a lot of my classes.. but I guess music is what kept me going.. anyway, I’ve been determined to change that and develop better habits. I was determined to do good and be successful.

But today at the orientation I was a ball of anxiety and cried on the way home. Everything feels just hopeless. And I keep trying to tell myself positive and uplifting things, that everything will be okay..

Another thing that I think has made me this overwhelmed is probably..

Well I had a best friend for 7 years, and she’s an awesome person, but last year she kind of went down the wrong path; dating older people (seniors), doing sexual stuff, weed &amp; alcohol..

I honestly don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s just generally not the type of people I would hang with I guess?

Anyway that’s not the point. She started getting really attached to her boyfriends, and when the first one broke up with her.. that escalated to me calling 911 for her because she took a bunch of random pills. 

Then she stopped going to school in January ish, then got another boyfriend.. at that time I hadn’t really talked to her because she wasn’t in school. 
And then in may, I was out of town, and her and my sister were hanging out (we were all friends).

Basically the night she was “hanging out” she was on our home phone the whole night talking to her boyfriend, and then there was a bill from GCI because she was talking for a long time. With her boyfriend. While at her best friends house who she hasn’t seen in a long time.
To add to that, she was helping herself to our food and leaving half eaten things everywhere.
So regarding the phone bill, my dad ended up calling her mom to talk about the bill.. and her mom grounded her. 

Then she took that out on my sister, and texted one of my sister’s best online friends bad things.. kind of venting about the situation and putting my sister in bad light, even though that friend was my sister’s friend and not hers. :I

This is all stuff I heard from my family, so it might not be that bad? But still. 

Basically, at that point she just wasn’t being a good supportive friend. She was a little mentally abusive to my sister.. an example is, they played video games a lot together, and she never wanted to play games that my sister wanted to.. but then she herself pressured my sister into playing pvp type games which gives her anxiety :I

Anyway.. this summer I decided I wanted to cut her out of my life, because:
Can’t really trust her, she isn’t a positive influence, she’s not supportive or uplifting, and she’s not fair to her friends.

But today during orientation, I was practicing my locker combo, and she showed up. Her locker is right next to mine. 
She was with her mom, and we greeted each other..
I almost felt like I should treat her like nothing happened. 

But the first thing she said was,
“do you hate me?” 
And I right away said no. 
But she had this creepy look on her face.. it might have been my imagination.. 
Adding to that creepiness she’s super possessive with her boyfriends, has kind of violent tendencies (cut up a squirrel one time and vented to me about it..), and last year we talked about how she might have bpd or is bipolar or something.
.. I really hope she’s getting some help. I tried the best to be supportive for her last year but I really couldn’t help. So I hope she’s at least gotten a therapist.

Anyway, yeah, that situation was really overwhelming and stuff.. especially because I haven’t confronted or talked to her about things in forever, and all of a sudden she’s the locker right next to mine.

During that confrontation, her mom was like “aw you guys, hug it out!” 
And I said awkwardly,
..”I don’t know if I should hug you or not..”

I just feel so overwhelmed.
The general school situation and me worrying about failing again..
And the people.. people everywhere.. so obnoxious... and socializing................

I need to talk to my friend about this situation. I need to tell her why I think we shouldn’t be friends.

She probably has felt really abandoned though, I never said anything to her during the summer... she tried talking to my sister but my sister blocked her...
And she texted me but I never opened the texts because I don’t want to betray my sister...

If I talk to her face to face, I’m afraid I won’t be able to keep my cool, or what if she lashes out... what if she starts rumors about me? I really don’t want anything dramatic to happen.. I just want to stay low like I always have. :(

I might voice call her?
I have therapy tomorrow, I’m sure that will help me sort my thoughts.. maybe I could voice call her during therapy.

I’m just so anxious, thinking about what will happen... 

But I know this isn’t the end of the world. I can talk to school counselors and get a different locker, and I only have band with her.. 
and I have so many positive things around me, I can’t let this one thing ruin the school year for me.

To anyone who has read this, thanks I guess, this is a bit awkward. 
:)

Ive been giving it my all and in 21 years, all I have found that I am good at is absorbing irrelevant information and Super Mario Sunshine. That's about it. Four years spent trying to be a somewhat decent chef down the drain because I fall on my face every time. I have no passions anymore because food service and my own shortcomings have beaten my love for cooking out of me.

I hate that this is who im becoming and ive been hating myself more and more because of it. like... is this just who I am and ive been keeping it quiet the whole time? am I just a ball of rage that's going to keep exploding towards people who don't deserve it?

I don't want to just turn complacent and kill time at some job that's as meaningless as the rest of them are to me until I erode into nothingness. Why is that expected of me?

Im tired of settling, im tired of people who act like children, im tired from not sleeping at night, im tired of having dreams but not knowing where to even start, im tired of sucking at everything i try, and im so fucking tired of being told what my life should be and that I have to just sit here, smiling and nodding because i don't have the money to just leave and find a way to make my life mean ANYTHING to me.",15Aug2018,2

They also announced a looooot of new reforms that I really don't understand. They are forcing people to register in a system called Carnet de la Patria so they can get bennefits and this has been going on for a while, a new cryptocurrency, etc.

* Unfit... I never eat and never exercise. I just sit around. I’m a formless heap of pale skin and hairiness. I’m too scared to go in the pool topless unless at night. I don’t have gyno or whatever, I’m just formless

* i dont have wet dreams or random erections or sexual thoughts very often. I hope I’m normal and I don’t have hypogonadism or whatever. It worries me

* girls are so beautiful and I want to date one badly... not for sexual reasons but just because it feels right, there’s no other words for it, talking to a girl I have a crush on makes me feel like I’m taking a drug. If you’re a girl you’re lucky to be naturally beautiful 

* University... I’m somewhat smart (I’m just being honest I don’t want to brag at all) but uni stresses me out. I hate exams and the idea of exams. And my country is so ugly and not intellectual. I need to move to Paris or Barcelona or Stockholm once I’ve finished my BA/LLB

* facial acne... fucking acne!! I’m sick of it. Stupid cunts tell me it’s normal. I’m sure it is for some, but these people have no idea of the psychosocial implications it has for me. Seriously unattractive 

* schoolwork is useless shit just making me wait. I just want to read books and discuss ideas, this low level antediluvian comma-fucking crap really annoys me

* I’ve got a hideous face, no jawline, massive forehead, ugly lower third (chin etc) and a bulbous tip on my nose. I’m too poor (obviously) for plastic surgery for all that and I don’t want to ask my parents for some money with it.

* Mum dad and sister all have mental disorders and tiptoeing around them is very stressful. Mum and dad are also very mean

* I have no money of my own to spend on things I need 

What I have going for me:

* Lucky enough to be born into a wealthy family. I would thank God if I were religious for this every day. I don’t take it lightly. I have a safety net most people don’t have. 

* I’m 6’2. This isn’t to imply that there’s anything wrong with being shorter of course but I like to be tall because I’m into fashion and most avant garde fashion models are tall and lanky like me. So that’s nice 

* Pretty smart and creative, this doesn’t mean much though unless you can put it to use in something 

* A decent no. of friends 

Maybe I’ll edit this more and add some stuff later on as I think of it

44,"So, im in my late teens and ive know this girl the majority of my life and ive always been in love with her. Ive had a couple of girlfriends who loved me but i couldnt love them back because I loved another one and thats largely why they ended.

And thats why im cutting my ties with her. I need to move on. She has stated she has loved me before but at those times i had girlfriends. Now she's got a boyfriend (that i hooked her up with lol) and I feel i cant be in a friendship with someone I love so much romantically. Im gonna confess and then proceed to break my ties with her. I feel cruel but I feel like shit whenever I she is around me (which she has been the entierty of highschool, same class) so is it really cruel to prioritize myself? I dont know honestly

Anybody here got any experience with falling in love with close friends? ",15Aug2018,0
45,"I’m in my mid thirties and I don’t know where I should go from here. I have a comfortable life: decent pay, benefits, house, family, etc. The problem is that I am very bored. I feel that I am a motivated person, but my job no longer challenges me and there is no room for progression. I have ALOT of down time, but I can’t leave. The best way to describe it is that it’s similar to a long layover at an airport terminal: you’re bored and you can’t leave!

I have a business admin degree but no experience in “business” things. I have 14 months left of the post 9/11 GI BILL. I can’t quit this job without taking another one (bills to pay). What should I do?!

I feel like I need to prioritize, and let go of this one event, but that feels like a huge, disgusting failure to me. 

I’m already stretched thin. I’m not sleeping, I’m barely getting time with the kids/spouse, I’m delivering lackluster work to new, prospectively referring clients. 

Part of me says the rational thing to do is to resign, but the die-hard part of me says that’s the pansy way out, suck it up and suffer (and let your work and family time suffer) for the next eight weeks.

And it's a job I needed to leave anyway. Just... they beat me to the punchline. Oh well, 'tis the way the cookie crumbles sometimes.

But this does mean that while I look for a new one, I'll have to go back and live with my aunt rather than in my own place. And she has an enormous dog that goes after cats, meaning I'll have to take my cat back to my home state quite a few hours away and keep her with my parents until I can find a new job and living situation in my current city.

I feel like I failed my kitty. She's 1 year old, I've had her since October, and she's already lived in 3 different places (4 if you want to count the shelter she came from). No, these aren't due to me getting and losing jobs all the time, it's due to life circumstances (broke up with boyfriend and had to move out). And though they've all been with me, I did have to leave her with my parents for \~3 weeks to figure out a living space in the new city, and when I came back home to pick her up she wouldn't look at me/interact with me for the first few hours. lol.

I just fucking hate that I have to drop her back off again. A few weeks ago my parents got 2 new kittens and I hope that doesn't add to my cat's stress, but feel like it will. Yes, the huge bright sides are that I don't have to give up my cat for good, and I have so much support from family for this difficult transitional time. But still. My poor kitty :( I'm sorry Cora Belle, damn. Feeling sad.",15Aug2018,4
50,"I don’t think masturbation is bad at all, and I think NoFap seems awfully cult-y and a bit of a weird sub where guys place the blame for all of their personal problems on a single aspect of their life. Despite this, I recently started to realise I probably watch porn a little too much, and decided I’d try see how long I can go without watching it. I’m a 20 year old virgin, but I’ve had a couple of opportunities where a girl has been throwing herself at me and I could have went for it and was just too nervous, with my awkwardness kinda overpowering any urge I had to just take the chance. I kinda realised that subconsciously I probably know I can safely return home and watch porn without having to put myself out there and take a chance. Despite the weirdness surrounding NoFap, I kinda wanna try going the 90 days without masturbating just as a kinda test, to see if I can actually do it really and see if there’s any truth at all to any of the so called ‘benefits’, and if it maybe gives me that extra little push to put myself out there more. I’ve already went 3 days without porn or masturbating, so I just kinda figured while I try go without porn I’d go the full way and see how things go. Has anyone else actually done NoFap, and can give me a more realistic and less insanely biased idea of what I can expect?",15Aug2018,3

54,"A year ago I began talking to a girl who was a Junior (a year younger than I). We flirted a bit while I was on vacation for the summer but I never imagined I’d like- or especially love her. After talking back and forth for a few days and sleepless nights, I decided I wanted to see her as soon as I got back home. After my plane landed and I got home around 10pm, I told my parents I was going out to get a burger before bed and drove to pick her up. She had a bad past with guys and had a tendency to keep them away from her family so I picked her up around the corner. We talked for two hours while waking through a park and both realized it was going to be more than a fling. Fast forward 11 months of a beautiful relationship where we did everything together. She was my best friend and I hers. I’ve never spent so much of my life with somebody, all the while knowing it was going to end. The expiration date was August 13th, the night before I flew away to college. We both agreed that it was best to separate, despite how much we cared for each other. She would still be in high school, while I would be a thousand miles away in college. It was the mature and smart thing to do. That didn’t make it any easier though, as each month closer to the date we would mention it and spend an hour or so reminiscing about all the good times before settling back into our usual routine. The last week has been hell. Loving her so much while knowing I had days was difficult to say the least. We tried to not spend the last 3-4 days talking about it, but the elephant in the room was far too large to ignore. The last night together, August 13th (Monday), we sat in her car at the park around 11pm and talked about how happy we had made each other. As we came to 11:30 (a half hour before I needed to be home) we both started to cry as we hugged. I wasn’t sure if I was going to cry because I rarely do, but I knew immediately as time ran out that I didn’t want to leave her. After it was time for me to leave, we stepped out of her car and stood between my car door and her. We hugged, audibly balling and knowing I had to leave. I felt like I was having my heart ripped out of my chest. She could barely speak but begged me not to leg go. I almost carried her to her door and helped her in. She looked at me from her seat while crying and it was the hardest thing I’ve ever done to say I loved her, I’m sorry, goodnight, and close her door. I barely got home that night as I couldn’t see through my windshield. I cried on the flight to college while covering my face with my sweatshirt. And I feel empty now, wondering how I can possibly go however many months without her when for the happiest year of my life, she was the biggest part. I dont know what to do, who to talk to, or how to feel better. The thing is, we both love each other, and I don’t WANT to get over her. I still want to be with her. But I can’t. She’s gone, and my imagination runs just as wild with jealous thoughts as it did when I wasn’t broken up with her. This is cliche and probably a carbon copy of many of your experiences, but I feel like there’s pressure building in me that will explode if I don’t get it out. I love her. ",15Aug2018,11

57,"for about 15 years of my life, my family was poor, but still, life was fun. it had its ups and downs but there was always a ray of hope. my father was a smart man, always full of new ideas for his work (he was a carpenter). he would see an opportunity, he would take it and make his ideas come true... and well... his ideas always worked! 

So, having him, assured us that our money situation would be solved and we will reach the dreams we have for ourselves. 

it did get solved. by the time i was 15, we moved to a bigger city, had money at our hands and life was ok. 

along with this, throughout these years, my mother boosted us (specially me) with confidence, always talking about our big future, how successful we're gonna be and stuff like that. she was a woman that loved luxury and having successful children was the most beautiful jewelry she had her eyes set on. 

I think they did their parts well, both mom and dad. but now I see us, my brother, my sister, me, and I wonder, was the result any good?!

My sister, a beautiful soul, a painter, not much income, married to a good (yet simple) man. could be count as a success, well, being simply happy is a good way of life! but I know my sister struggles with depression, same as me, but always putting on a much brave face, holding the emotional attacks in and trying to be strong.

My brother, owns a rich business, going up on the road of luxury, making his mama proud. but he has his dark secrets too, he ends up falling in love with the wrong girls, insisting on marrying them too soon. he's depressed, he's anxious, he's so hurting and he can't even see how he's hurting, I feel that he's extremely smart, extremely introverted and extremely sensitive but also so clueless about psychological matters, to the point that he has no idea what an emotional mess he is.

Me, a law student, received scholarship from our number 1 university, moved to capital to pursue higher education, ended up spending two years having absolute fun and doing the things I love most (sex and drugs!). been trying to get back to being productive now that it's my last year, it's been going good. but yet, I know that I'm also depressed, anxious and full of doubts and episodes. yet I also, like my brother and sister, put on the brave mask, stay strong and try to function. It is hard getting up in the morning to carry the burden of existence, but we get up, we carry it, we do it happily, we've accepted it, but yet... it hurts.

It makes me wonder...

59,"I go back to uni in around a month for my second year. I'm living in a rented house with 2 other mates and honestly I'm fucking more scared then when I first started.

There's a lot of things but a couple mains things is that one of these mates is a heavy weed smoker, which is fine I smoke occasionally, he smokes up every day though. And I'll be down to smoke with him some times but I know he's going to ask every day, I know I can say no obviously but I feel so fucking bad. Like we were going to live with a group of 5 of us, the other 2 were also daily smokers, unfortunately they dropped out. But if he had them he could smoke with people every day, and I feel like when he realise I won't and realise who I actually am then he'll hate me and hate living with me.

Another thing is i fell out with a lot of people last year at uni, my whole original house and most of my friends. There was a lot of drama and the group got split. And then there was this one person, thought we were so close, but I realised we weren't, and I was only a backup friend for them. I snapped and we completely fell out. Again minor. Things but this is a small uni, like what if I see them out at the club, what if I never go club again, like I know if I'm in the club in the smoking area, I'll see them, and they'll give me dirty looks and ruin my night.

And my final point is, I'm scared of not making any new friends, like it was easy when living on campus, but now I'm not. I'm so awkward last term I didn't really speak to anyone in my classes. I guess there are sports and societies but first year I tried out for American football and ended up breaking my wrist on the first training session. Like how do people make friends, I don't know I made my friends. The people in living with now was a huge coincidence and just happened. The other friends I fell out with I made because I lived with them/ our neighbours.

Like what if this year is so bad, like what if I'm just stuck in my room all day slowly going insane. Or I end up smoking every single day just to keep the couple friends I have now. Which isn't too bad but I'm more of a going to the club person whereas they are the more at home stoner types.

66,"I hate having to say this but I’m an asshole. And the worst part is it’s so difficult for me to fix that. I’m usually a pretty nice guy but sometimes I just lose my patience with the people that I should be looking out for the most. For some reason I feel like acting like I’m tough or don’t give a shit about others is a real turn-on. It’s not. But my mind doesn’t want to let go and understand what it means to be a kind, respectable fucking human being. I guess it’s because I’m tired of feeling so defeated and taken advantage of by so many people over the course of my life but for some reason my mind thinks life works in absolutes. Maybe it’s an OCD thing, I don’t know, but it’s bad. It causes me to not understand there can be a happy medium, I think it’s one or the other and if I find somewhere in between I get confused and stressed out. Meaning, for example, either I have to be a genuine person looking for a relationship, or a fuckboy who only wants sex. Or, I could be kind, empathetic, understanding and look out for others, or an asshole who *tries* to act like a nice guy but just keeps flexing his life and the partying he does to his own fucking girlfriend like only a pathetic loser would do and think that being cool is the most important thing right now because that’s what life’s about.

I just forgot the things that really matter in life and what it means to be an adult. I was actually 20x more mature when I was 16 (18 now). What the fuck happened? I want to be mature and actually act my age like I used to but nowadays I’d rather just get fucked up with friends, party and act like a total dick.

67,"I don’t know but I had this thought a while ago and I can’t seem to get rid of it. 

My ancestors had to have the courage to immigrate to America. Every single thing that all of my family did before me all resulted in me being here right now. They all had to move exactly where they did, have the exact same personalities as they did in order to pursue what they did and for life to take them where they ended up. My parents met in college and so many things had to happen for that to even happen. They had to be as smart as they are and have the same interest in going the same exact college where they would meet. They met at a coffee shop on campus and if my mom had just stopped to go to the bathroom or had decided to skip coffee that day, they wouldn’t have met. They had to fall in love like they did and decide to move where they did which is where I grew up. They could have moved anywhere but they moved to this exact area and I went to this exact school. Because of that I’m friends with the People here. But if I had had classes with other people I could have completely different friends and be a totally different person. 

And getting my dog. He’s the love of my life. He had to be born exactly when he did and I had to have been allowed to get a dog the exact day that I was (on Christmas my parents told me I could get a dog). And the next day we went out and got him after a ton of looking online. If I hadn’t gone on those exact websites and contacted that exact breeder, then I wouldn’t have had the dog I have today.

70,"At the start of this summer, I was really into running. I'd go out every day or every other day and run for about an hour or so. I'm not a veteran runner, I just found it a lot of fun and relaxing. I would run at a fast pace but I never really felt tired so there would do days where I went twice as far as the day before.


Well right before our family vacation, I wanted to get in one more long run. Obviously this was a mistake because during the run, I felt a sudden and sharp pain in the exterior of my knee. Ever since that day, I've been unable to run for more than 3/4th of a mile at a time. 


It's a sharp crippling pain that makes walking and even standing up difficult for the days following a jog. I've seen a physical therapist since then and had some X-rays taken but they couldn't find anything wrong with the structural integrity of my knee joint.


So here I am in August feeling a sense of longing for the exercise and solitude of a good run. I tried going earlier today but my knee gave out again and I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get back home. Now I'm sitting at home, drinking some cheap wine and feeling a sense of pitying myself. I lost about 20 lbs this year and actually fell under 140 for the first time since highschool but I'm up 3-4 lbs since the injury.

71,"2 days ago, I was backing out of a parking lot and another person backing out of their spot backed into me. I know she did because I stopped and saw her coming in my backup camera. I panicked and couldn’t pull forward and it just happened. We exchanged info, but not insurance and went about our way. We did not file a police report. 

I get home, tell my husband and begin the days long discussion about how we should present this; if she is going to file a claim etc. Hubs thinks it’s best that we state the accident happened while I was in the store, didn’t see accident and file under uninsured motorists.  This is because I only got the woman’s name and phone number. We decide not to call the other person and decided to just take care of the claim for my car on our own.

I call insurance file claim, get appraisal, schedule repair for my vehicle all on my own. There is no contact from other lady. About 30 minutes ago, I get a call from her insurance company. I feign an injury for my child and quickly end the call so I can call my husband to see his advice (although said advice hasn’t helped so far!).  My husband hasn’t answered because he’s likely in a meeting. If I follow through with his, her insurance company will contact my insurance company and my false story will be out.

What should I do? Do I fess up to my insurance company the truth of the story because they will be contacted by her insurance company? Do I call her and agree to do repairs without insurance, offering to pay (in my opinion she is at fault)? I am drowning in guilt and know I should have to the truth in the first place...

72,"(Note: not everyone's anxiety manifests this way) As a child, I did not have anxiety. My mother had serious anxiety, would freak out over things easily, worried something bad would happen to me, etc. but I was overall fine. Then I turned 13 and I guess that's when it decided to show up, hiding in my body until my hormones went insane. I think it is half from the chemicals in my body, and half from my mother whose anxiety slid off onto me as well.

It was like I was suddenly went clinically insane. I started to worry about all kinds of things, even things that weren't realistic. I was vomiting. I wasn't eating or sleeping. And, of course, because my poor parents suffered from seeing me this way, that made it worse. I would feel terrible about how scared it was making them and the cycle would rigorously continue.

Here's a handful of examples of things that caused me worries: What if I have schizophrenia? What if I fail school and end up alone with no friends for the rest of my life? What if my parents died suddenly? What if I start seeing things? (thus the first question) *What if this never goes away?* And no, I never saw anything, but I was terrified I was going to. Being that I was 13 I was still easily scared of imaginary things. I was scared I was going to be haunted by ghosts or demons or something. Dumb but like I said, I literally went insane. I couldn't sleep, thinking something horrible was going to happen to me. (I used to read a lot of scary stories, and they never bothered me until then, so that's where my imagination came from).

Anxiety causes physical symptoms. Oh, boy does it. To this day I've had other illnesses and nothing beats the suffering my anxiety caused. My heart was constantly racing (you feel the thumping through your shirt), I felt hot and cold all over, like a fever. My chest would feel tight like someone was sitting on me, I'd have no appetite, bad nausea, dizziness, feel faint, and could not bear to exist.

I sat in my doctor's office and cried. Please, please tell me this isn't forever I begged him. I knew there were resources but what I wanted was for him to lie if he had to and say it would definitely work. At that moment, in the office, I came to the horrific realization that if nothing did indeed help, there was no way I was going to live the rest of my life like this (i.e, suicide). That was terrifying for 13y/o me (or any age). It was, for me, a potential terminal illness. And then I would worry about worrying.

I realize now that probably my biggest fear was indeed going insane, since I started to worry about schizophrenia and seeing things and having my reality changed. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy in a way; I'd worry about going insane, and go insane worrying about it.

But there is a happy ending. I'm 20 now. A few months after all that started I went to therapy and was put on medications. Therapy helped but honestly what saved my life was the meds. I was put on Ativan and it literally saved my fucking life. There's a huge stigma around meds and I get why but I was made to feel bad for taking them by some people but I don't feel bad anymore. I will have GAD for the rest of my life, but it is no longer debilitating. I have a good social life, I'm doing well at college (gonna be a junior) and I would say that I still have anxiety but not as bad. My last panic attack was in October. I can function and be happy and that's all I've ever wanted. I've accepted it's part of my life.

For other anxiety-sufferers out there, my heart hurts for you, and I wish no one had to have this horrible illness. Especially those that do not have access to therapy or any kind of mental healthcare. I am so sorry. I wish that there was more that I could do. Thanks for reading.

73,"So I've probably smoked 10-15 cigarettes my whole lifetime and found myself fucking disgusted every time. It tastes like shit, it smells like shit and it doesn't even give me any kind of a ''high''. I just feel normal except the fact that I wanna puke from the taste/smell. How the fuck do you get addicted to it? ",15Aug2018,4
74,"Crippling self doubt was so ingrained in me I didn't even realize it was a problem for a long time. This year I've done so much work on getting away from depression that I'm finally able to see how negative my thinking was. 
A Cognitive Behavioral Therapy exercise I did revealed a very negative core belief I had about myself: I thought I was unloveable. I felt that even when people seemed to like me, they were just being nice. Often, I felt like my old friends only were with me because they felt stuck with me. There was always something preventing me from accepting that I might be fun to be around. This mentality really discouraged me from meeting new people or following up with people I'd met, because I didn't see any point. 
The CBT told me I should set up a scenario to test this fear and record how accurate it really was. 
I'm actually a singer and I perform my music occasionally (I don't have stage fright, just people fright) and I decided my goal would be to attend an open mic by myself. Just the thought the open mic made my stomach squirm. Playing in front of fellow music peers and having to talk to them seemed impossible, they'd just realize I was no fun to be around. Well....
It. Was. A. Battle. And I didn't just dive in headfirst on my first try.

First time I went with a friend
Second time I went again with someone I knew. 
One night I didn't want to go and friends made me (thanks).
I was tentatively feeling things out for myself, and it wasn't that bad. But a voice of doubt often chimed in with,
""well, you're only comfortable because you're with people you know, you could never make it on your own. You're still no fun to be around and theres no way you can make new friends.
But! Hey! I'm the one making the rules, so why wasn't I allowed to get familiar with the place before I went on my own? -Another realization that I was being too hard on myself.-
I finally went out on my own and convincing myself to roll out of bed, commute over there and sit down was almost agony. But when I got there I talked to strangers and sang my songs and talked to even more strangers. And they liked me! Sure I was awkward sometimes and didn't always know what to say, but I really enjoyed being around these creative people. 
Just a little thing like going to an open on my own was a huge success. I realized that so much of my self criticism is distorted pessimism. I'm finally starting to see a newer, brighter reality.

76,**I'm a straight 19 year old mate and my best mate kissed me and gave me a blowjob on a night out last week. Now I feel all awkward and guilty but at the same time I feel like I enjoyed it. I've been ignoring him since and i think he's str8 too. I'm freaking out and I dunno what should I do. Help please!** ,15Aug2018,3
