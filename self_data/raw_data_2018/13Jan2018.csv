0,"I'm 23. I'm in my fourth year of a three year degree. And I just got the news I failed a mandatory course so I won't be able to graduate this spring. My acquaintances are busy applying to and getting accepted into MIT and Cambridge while I'm struggling to even finish a degree. I've already told all of my family that I'll be graduating this spring and seeing and hearing their disappointment when I tell them that's not happening will be one of the most difficult things I've done in my life. The worst part is that when I was younger I was ""the smart kid"", placed in the top 1% of my country's standardized math tests in middle school. It just all started falling apart the last later high school years and I never really got back on track since. My family and especially my mother are already so disappointed in my poor grades and slow progress because they had such high hopes for me in the beginning.

On top of being an academic failure I have no real friends and no social life to speak of. I leave the house to meet other people maybe once every month or two. Needless to say I've hardly even spoken to a girl/woman other than my mother for like three or four years.

My only hobbies involve video games, wasting time on the internet and watching anime at this point. 

I know reddit likes thinking everyone, especially in pity party posts like this one, has depression but I don't really feel depressed. Just unmotivated like I've given up or stopped caring about anything.

2,"All this corruption. Money rules the world. ISPs, spying, police brutality, unfair wages. If someone brings a call of action to my doorstep, saying we're going to start some shit, I am right there. I've marched before, I'll do it again. You call it a government, I call it a regime. This shit all needs to end, I'd rather risk my chances in the wild west than live complacently in a fucking nanny state. If anyone else is ready to make heads roll and change the status quo, count me fucking in. I'm sick of working to make 25% of my underpaid earnings. I live in a state where the government doesn't do shit for us. All the things taxes pay for, suck. I'm speaking of Michigan.

Theres literally vigilante groups of citizens who go around and fill potholes because our roads suck so much. My insurance costs more than my car payment. I get fined thousands upon thousands of dollars for a weed charge, meanwhile teachers don't get paid for shit. When. Does. It. End? Does no one care? Apparently.

If I didnt have more to live for, it would be heads fucking rolling, red earth motherfucker. Sorry for sounding r/iamverybadass, but come on. This shit has got to stop, and soon, otherwise we're going to have a full-scale civil war on our hands, or worse, no freedoms at all. I would DIE for my freedoms, would you?

Ban me, I literally don't care, but I'll have you know this is the voice of the people. The people who aren't afraid to speak. The ones who aren't overly worried about their 9-5 shit wages who hold them JUST above slavery. This is a call to action, people! Let me know how you feel! Comment your feelings!

3,"So, before I continue, I am sharing this because I am looking for some sort of advice on this interaction. So please, read the first 2 paragraphs and click on the link to read the conversation between my friend and I.

So the link below shows a conversation between me and my buddy Jeremy from today. It started because I made a Facebook post talking about my bad day yesterday and how I was in a bad mood. The thing he was talking about was my number 4 comment: 4. I found out that I have to pay a co-pay on everything because the idiots at the department of social services decided it was a good idea to switch my healthcare plan to something else that I did not want.

Little bit of a back story: I have been on disability for 5 years. I suffer from major depressive disorder severe recurring, anxiety, insomnia, OCD, odd, and ADHD, which is why I am on it. I have suffered with the alphabet disorders my entire life, and the depression, anxiety, and insomnia are all within the past 6 years (it will be 6 years come labor day). I have had problems with Medicaid and Medicare for about 4 years. More details can be found in my conversation.

8,"People who come to the US illegally are forced to take low skill jobs.  I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/7pkm27/how_do_you_feel_about_people_who_lie_on_their/)  a few days ago about lying on a resume to get a job and most people said they wouldn't because it was unfair for people that were playing by the rules.  Does the same logic apply?

Employers are breaking the law by hiring them and by hiring them they keep the wages artificially low.  Also these workers typically don't have health insurance or any other benefits.  Businesses complain they can't get people to work but won't raise the wages of jobs that people don't want.  

If the person is unable to get a job they will be more likely to turn to crime.  This makes everyone less safe because illegal immigrants can't get help from the government such as food stamps.

Citizens need to fix their own country otherwise what's stopping this from happening forever?  We allow legal immigration.  We immigrate people like the Syrian refugees whose country is in conflict.  

I'm conflicted.  I feel for people trying to get a better life but are they really accomplishing anything by coming here illegally?  I don't know, maybe they were homeless where they came from.  It seems like a short term solution to a problem that won't improve for them.  What are they going to do if they get hurt or when they get old?  They don't pay taxes.  Their kids need special teachers.  It seems like a bad deal for everyone.

10,"I don't usually remember my dreams. Almost all of the nightmares that I can remember involve me running from something that's chasing me slowly but always knows where I am. These nightmares are sometimes in haunted houses, or in tunnels, or once in an abandoned skyscraper. Those are dreams that I wake up to and go ""wow, that was weird.""

But now I've started to get Sleep Paralysis, and it's fucking with me a bit more than that.

If you don't know, there's a system in your brain that keeps you from moving when you sleep, and it can mess up. If it's not working when it should, you get sleepwalking. If it's working when it shouldn't, you get [sleep paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis). Basically, you're awake and aware of your surroundings, but you can't move.

It sounds freaky, but that's not what's fucking with me.

One of the things that happens when you get sleep paralysis is hallucinations. You can get strange noises, or sensations like tingling, or even seeing things that aren't there, usually with a feeling of fear or dread. One of the common symptoms is seeing a figure in the room or at the window, that you can't do anything about because you *can't move*.

That sounds really freaky, but that's *still* not what's really fucking with me.

What *really* fucks with me, is that I always wake up immediately afterwards, and I'm still in my room. Any of my nightmares before this took place in places that were definitely not my room. When I woke up from those, I knew the nightmare was over, because I was in my bed.
But now I have a nightmare about lying in my bed in the dark with a creature nearby filling me with dread, and I wake up lying in my bed in the dark *and I don't know where the creature went*. And in my sleep-addled state, I really can't tell what's real and what isn't.

Last week I woke up at 5:15 and there was something muttering and giggling right behind my right ear. I kept wanting to reach back and brush him off, and I couldn't understand why. And then I woke up again at 5:30, braced myself, reached back and there was nothing there. I was in full fight-or-flight mode that whole morning.

Two nights ago at 3:00 there was a man who was too tall and too gray, wearing an arctic parka standing at the foot of my bed. He looked a bit like Snoke. He was grinning and just kept tapping the bed with his finger, a quick rhythm. And then I woke up again and he was gone.

Those are the recent ones. I've only had one other, and it wasn't nearly as creepy, but it fucked with me even more.

I was lying in my bed, talking to one of my friends who was sitting on the side of it. I don't remember what we were talking about, and more worryingly, I couldn't tell which friend it was. I couldn't see his face or recognize his voice, but I knew that he was a friend... somehow. 
I could feel this uneasiness growing as we were talking, and then there was a loud *BANG!* noise and he vanished. I was terrified, not for myself, but for my friend who something had happened to, and looked through the house to try and find him. After a while, bewildered and scared, I went back to my room and to sleep.

The best I can figure is that I had sleep paralysis, imagined this ""friend"", and then a loud noise, dreamed up or actually real (maybe something falling over) woke me up. He vanished because I woke up, but to my sleepy brain, my friend had just disappeared into thin air, and that's terrifying.

I guess that's what's so terrifying about this. In those few seconds or even minutes before I unfog myself, I believe that the dream is real.

12,"My Dad passed away recently, very unexpectedly. He was my world, he was my best friend and we were very closed. He was my only family here in the US so this makes this extra hard.

15,"Hello. I don't really know what to say here, or say about myself, but I know I'm not happy. I don't know why. But I know that my friends, that I still really think I love, feel like strangers to me. In fact, everyone I should hold dear feels distant from me now. The few hobbies I used to have and enjoy don't bring me the same sense of satisfaction anymore. I've taken up some recreational drug use in college, but now not even alcohol or weed makes me happy for long. I feel like I'm always just trying to distract myself. I feel so directionless.

I don't feel like I can be honest with even myself about my emotions or desires, to the point where I don't know what I really think or believe about most things anymore. Around others, I usually just try to strike a balance between being helpful and being unnoticed, because people might not like or criticize me if I go too far out there, or make some kind of mistake. I was never an eccentric person or anything, but now I catch myself trying to present myself as milquetoast as possible to not offend anyone.

There are some, maybe a few, things that, intellectually, I know I must have going for me, socially speaking. But even then it only takes me a moment to twist all of those around in my head to make them detriments against me somehow, or ammo for the hypothetical people I imagine parroting my own anxieties. I constantly feel like I'm at the bottom of the totem pole in every room I am because that's where I feel like I deserve to be. Speaking about myself is one of the hardest things I can be asked to do, since I don't feel like I know myself or trust myself to know me.

I don't really expect this to find an audience. Maybe writing this down for the internet will help me feel like more of a whole person, but I doubt it. I don't want to keep thinking my friends dislike me. I'd like to be the kind of person I think is worthy of love, but I know I'd never let myself feel that way even if I didn't already hate who I often am.

23,"Asking here and on legal advice because I'm not really sure what to do. Based in the UK. I left a company a while back, and while I already knew that the boss had groped a few younger female staff members, they had decided not to report it, and while I didn't personally agree, I respected their decision to stay quiet. 

After chatting more with a few of them, including the majority of the young female staff and some of those closer to his own age, every single one has either been at least propositioned, groped, or in some way had sexual advances made by the manager. 

A few selects include him arriving alone in the early hours of the night when a single staff member is on night shift, inviting her into one of the empty rooms, and telling her he ""wouldn't do anything she didn't want to"". She stood outside the building where members of the public were still passing by until he left. 

After one night out, a few staff members, including the manager, returned to the main office building, as it was a fair mid point between everybody's houses. Turns out that he sexually assaulted one of the female staff after she had thrown up in the bathroom. 


The woman in the position beneath him has reported him to HR, however HR have told her that this must have been a lie, he's been there since the company started, and most of these staff are only on 11 month contracts. 

I've been speaking to them about it, and none of the younger staff members want to report him, they've all just agreed to do everything in their power to never be alone with him, and to advise all the new women coming through to just be a bit careful. 

I don't know if I'm in the right here, being a guy, but I don't think that's good enough, and while I don't have any of my own evidence, I've just seen the texts about the propositions and multiple stories from different people about the same events that do match.

Everybody believes that eventually he'll do something worse, yet nobody wants to actually report him, as if it did not fully work out, and even if it did, it would likely ruin their career or at least make life insanely difficult for them. (We're all in the TV industry, your career is based almost entirely on who you know and how much they like you).

Is there anything I can do to either report him anonymously, or convince any of the other members of staff to report him? I don't know if I'm meddling too much, but I feel that it's kind of shit.

27,"Hey. College student here. I've been getting to know a gay friend for over a month now (I'm bisexual). A couple of days ago, I confessed to him that I was starting to develop feelings for him beyond a friendship. I told him that I had no expectations after this conversation, but the only expectation would be to continue our relationship. I also told him that I would honor and respect his decision. He was honest and replied that he had no sentiments beyond a friendship. I thanked him for his honesty, and hoped that our friendship could live on, to what he replied that he'll always be honest, and that I should relax, that that will never happen (affecting our friendship). We told each other good night and that was it.

Thing is, I was thinking that I should try another approach, but many months should pass before I try once again because, as I typed, we've only known each other for over a month, and I shared this with some friends, and the majority of them told me it was too early. I've read stories about couples that have been rejectec before, but time passed and the other person eventually started developing feelings beyond a friendship, and they gave each other a chance and it worked.

I am no longer on Tinder (that thing doesn't interest me anymore), but when I did I talked a lot about sex. I'm not sure if that means I'm an amateur or creepy or both. I realise it's Tinder so people go there for that (unless they say otherwise), but I can't shake off the feeling. I've also been on other dating sites (this was all a long time ago though) and said probably the same things as I did on Tinder (almost). I know those places aren't meant for hooking up, but I was probably a desperate virgin and had no idea what to do.

33,"Since years touchscreen keyboards are used by the millions. Now I do not know if it is just me, but their performance, even in 2018 with an 8 core cpu and gigabytes of ram, is dismal.

There are so many announcements here and there about AI/machine learning and what not, and I find them awesome. Anyway due to those I am even more disappointed by the performance of touchscreen keyboards.

Every damn time I write a long text, that is longer than 2 or 3 sms, the keyboard (gboard, swiftkey or flesky. I tried them all) starts to be really unresponsive. The suggestions for the word I write stop working, the autocorrect increasingly fails the more I write.

At the end I am forced to write very carefully with one finger and then pick the suggestions if they come up correctly. The t9 algorithms in comparison were way better. It is not a ""idealized memory"". I tested the t9 on a old nokia 3109 classic recently.

This is even worse if I write a fairly long text (1000+ characters), as if the keyboard is processing over and over the entire content of what I just wrote. I find it ridiculous that writing a text of a couple of KB on a modern smartphone feels way harder than doing it on a calculator with few KB of ram (that has no qwerty keyboard and something like 256000 bytes of ram or less).

Now I know that writing software that predicts what we want to write is not easy at all, but I would expect that after years the results would be somewhat acceptable. Especially since it is a software used by millions of people daily. 

It cannot be that is always fault of my fingers, either on a 5' phone or a 8' tablet. It cannot be that the touchscreen keyboard become so sluggish and imprecise the more I write.

I’m solidly anti-Trump I’m just about everything (and centrist overall, ironic shoutout to r/dirtbagcenter ), but I wanted to list the ways that r/politics drives repeatedly drives me crazy. 


1) “OBAMA WORE A BROWN SUIT” being the go to top comment on 10% of all trump posts. Yeah he also did some crazy shit, that’s like posting “TRUMP HAD TWO SCOOPS” on any negetive thread about the next president. But mainly it’s repetitive and semi unrelated, and least come up with new and creative ways to annoy me.


2) It’s literally all trump posts. Like, actually all trump posts on the front page upwards of 90% of the time. He’s important and does a lot of crazy stuff so if a good portion of the page is trump all the time I get, but there is more to American politics than finding a new way to say “Drumf bad”. 


3) Even when they are forced to discuss politics they don’t actually know shit and it’s hilarious. Cue people thinking because a republican doesn’t like [Trump thing] that they’re now a progressive, and the backlash when it turns out they’ve been the same normal republican this whole time.



4) I just want a sub whose main purpose is to discuss politics and not determine that whatever situation makes Trump look the worst is the truth within 5 seconds of any article being posted. The truth will make him look plenty bad, but people abandon all logic and common sense whenever there’s any doubt. Just looking at Fire and Fury, there are numerous things that are highly questionable and some outright falsehoods in there from an author who has long been criticized for these issues. Yet there isn’t even the slightest hesitation in believing every bad word about Trump as gospel.

51,I'm so unbelievably lonely and despite having friends in the past I am no longer in contact with them and I never see anyone other than my colleagues at work. I'm miserable and I'm afraid it will get worse as I get older and I will eventually die sad and alone. I've tried meeting new people and I just can't find people who like me enough to stay in contact. I think I'm just forgettable.,13Jan2018,2
52,"Some background: I'm a freshman in college. I'm gay and have never had a boyfriend. I tend to be introverted, but I despise that quality of myself. 

Again, on another weekend, I'm going to be spending it by myself as I listen to the people around me make plans to go out and have fun at parties and what not. I've tried going out twice to parties with a group of girls, but I've never been let in. It felt pretty demotivating, so I stopped trying. I don't even enjoy being around a ton of people and drinking. I wanted to try it in case I actually did enjoy it. And to hopefully meet some new people.

A lot of the time, I feel really lonely. I have one close friend(a girl), but otherwise, I don't have any other close friends. She understands a lot about how I feel and that I really want someone to be intimate with. I want something that's more than sex, but that's impossible to find it seems. I've found guys who want to hook up, but nothing more. 

I've only hooked up with one guy so far in college, and he only pretended to be somewhat interested in me so I would keep coming back for sex. When my friends forced me to accept this, it hurt tremendously. I don't know how to deal with this well and it makes me feel like I'm going to be taken advantage of over and over again. 

I really wish I was able to write more about this while keeping myself composed, but I just can't anymore. 

TL;DR: I want to be an extrovert, have fun in college, make good friends, and find someone worth spending time and effort on. ",13Jan2018,2
