3,"My mother had been abusive for so long. At some point I just stopped considering her my mother. She turned everyone in my life against me. Over the years she got my everyone to hate me. I because the family's ""do you want to end up like ___?"" And ""don't call me a ___"" hint hint my name goes in both of those spots. 

My dad never really got involved. He didn't contribute to the abuse but never lifted a finger either. Up to now he was the only one keeping me here. He held everyone off from eating me alive figuratively speaking. Today he finally joined in and kicked me out. I have a time limit to get my shit out and leave the house. 

I was already planning to join the marines but I'm currently in the process of joining the mariens. It'll take a few weeks then I'll enter the delayed entry program which will take a while. 

Before this I was thinking the only option would be to head up to Washington since my aunt offered a while ago to let one of us live with her so I was thinking maybe I'd take her up on her offer. 

Today, a few minutes ago my aunt texted me. She said ""hey if you ever want to come live in Washington you could come live with me, I have a spare bedroom"" the same aunt I was talking about. This just made me so fucking furious. 

That fucking son of a bitch has no fucking balls. He has been letting my fucking mother toy with me and watching her abuse me mentally and physically and has never don't shit to stop it. And now he calls his sister to take me in?? After kicking me out?? Fucking fuck you ballless bitch 

My ""father"" has never had the balls to stop my mother I have had enough of this bullshit. My mother for some fucking reaosn hates me. She got everyone I cared about to hate me and the fucking person who I had left who I called a ""father"" has had no fucking balls to stop it then when his wife isn't looking he calls his sister to take me in? 

Before any of this started I had always planned to move away and never speak to them again. I planned to make an exception with Dad and once in a while make him a phone call. Fuck that. He never was a father to me why would I? He didn't have enough balls to get his wife's claws off of me so why should I?

He then came back, mimed us giving him blowjobs and started shouting in my face racist comments about these girls who were sitting across from us. I tried to pull away but his face kept following mine, so I pushed him away and told him to fuck off. When he came back to say sorry a few minutes later I told him to fuck off. Apparently that makes me “angry” because I don’t accept his apology and want to be left alone. I don’t have to make YOU feel better by accepting your apology.

&amp;#x200B;

Last couple of months have been weird. I've been broken up with my ex over 3 years and I thought I've gotten over her. In these 3 years I've accomplished a lot of things on a personal level: I got a job in a field that I would only dream about in the past, and I've moved to a new company recently where the benefits and pay is on a level that I thought  achieving maybe in a life time. Actually I haven't accomplished a lot of things, this is the only thing, but before this job I had nothing going for me. I was super anxious about my future, I used to drink a lot and just hang out and do drugs (which is great, no judgement). Cut to the point. There's been some signs that I have some feelings still for my ex, but I think that now it's certain. Recently my ex started talking to me and couple of weeks later we went to this festival together. Actually before that I invited her to my birthday and she came and I was so happy and thinking this must be some kind of a sign that she's into me also (even though I knew that she probably has a boyfriend; wasn't 100% sure) . Basically we started talking again and I was thinking that this could lead to somewhere and I had this crazy thought in my head that we're gonna get back together and this time everything is gonna be super great, because we've both grown and learned stuff about ourselves and that were gonna get married and get children and damn... The night of the festival... after the festival we went to this park where we used to go when we were dating. We had couple of beers with us and there was this two-people swing where we used to sit and hangout. We were sitting there and listening to music and everything was just perfect. And then she told me that she probably has to go home. And she called someone, and I realized it was her boyfriend. She told him to pick her up. And then I had this reality check... That basically the last month, all of the time I've been thinking about her and us - it was just all in my head. It was an illusion I created for myself and she probably doesn't see it the same way at all. So when she ended the call, I told her that ""I know it's kind of a fucked up thing to say right now, but I think that we shouldn't see each other anymore...because I still have feelings for you"". (Mind me, I was pretty drunk at the time and I felt that it was a perfect time to say this, because I just couldn't go on living in some kind of a hope that MAYBE-SOMETHING-SOMEDAY will  happen).

And we talked for, I think maybe 15 or 20min about it. And actually it felt great because I told her things that I couldn't when we broke up 3 years ago, because how the things ended back then. But telling her how I feel now (and have always felt), was great actually, kind of a closure that I needed or something. I told her how much she meant to me. How she is a really big reason why I turned my life around and got a job and an apartment that I always wanted. How, when I saw her on my birthday after all these years, I couldn't even focus on her words when she was passionately talking about some book, because when I watched her expressing herself, all I could just think of, was that she is the fucking coolest and sweetest person on the planet and I just wanna experience every aspect of her... I  watched her body language: how she was moving her hands while she was talking and how she reminded myself to me. And then I saw her watching into my eyes and smiling - it was plants and trees being reborn after decades of darkness.  All I could think of was that there's no one in the world I give shit about as much as this girl... Well, actually she's not a girl anymore, she's a woman now. And I'm just a boy from the past.  


I'm kind of a afraid that this girl will always be the love of my life.

23,"I'm not sure what I'm looking for, because if I knew I would've been on my way to find it. Basically, any tips, information, references, books, whatever that may help is welcome.

The problem:

I don't feel alive. I'm never in the moment and always thinking / planning what WILL I be when something WILL happen - and that causes me to go through life chasing undefined things forever. The reason I know it is forever is because I'm not chasing anything specifically, I'm just postponing ""living"" for later. 

What I'm afraid about is that I remember doing the same thing from earliest age... That is one of the few things I remember, unfortunately. Reason being that in the process of rushing and ""not living"" I failed to build any memories and I basically don't remember most of my life (not just early life, but for example, I don't remember how I felt 3 months ago).

It's like living on auto-pilot, or not living my life at all. However, I remember that I, for example, have been on a vacation, or visited a friend, or read a book. However, I don't remember, nor can recreate how I felt on the vacation, how I felt about the friend, or what the book was about.

And most of the time I think that all people are similar to me. And when they share memories or express feelings about things in the past I'm left amazed and start questioning them: ""wow, you really remember / feel / think about this?"" and they wonder wtf is wrong with me, so I just continue on auto-pilot switching the subject, because I can't put what's happening into words.

And I can't even now... As you see, this post is pretty much rumbling, so sorry about that. If I get an idea how to formulate it better I'll edit it with a TLDR containing 2-3 sentences with the condition. But for now, life feels like a rush, I almost have no emotions (including when things happen to me or people I love (weddings, successes, deaths)), and I feel living every day like a separate entity in my life, independent of the other days / years. I'm not sure if it's lack of mindfulness, not being satisfied with life, childhood trauma, or if I should be diagnosed, but I would love to feel alive or present like in the rare occasions I did.

And btw, I know that people are seeing my condition. I experienced / heard how people who love me are giving me vague advice (like ""enjoy life"") or talking between themselves about my situation (""he should enjoy life more""). Just mentioning this at the end to clarify that it's not just a feeling, but it's also something that is portrayed and exists in the real world. 

I'm basically absent. Looking like Adam Sandler in Click, I guess. And that's the only role I can relate to, as he postponed life while chasing other goals. The only difference is that I have no idea what my goal is.

24,"Long story short for context - GF of 2.5 years broke up with me, regretted it after a few days and we got back to talking; can tell it wasn't an act of malice and more a stupid decision, but nonetheless we've both been currently single for a few months and she's been to a nightclub a few times while enjoying being single and getting snapchats and facebooks of guys there which I don't have an issue with. Think it's cool she's talking to other guys as ultimately if she finds someone else she'd rather be with I'd push for her to be with them any day of the week but do still love her.

However, she's been worried/annoyed with the fact it seems like so far all that's happened is she broke up with me and is playing the field while I've done nothing; I'm not a confident or extroverted guy and though it's been 2 months since we broke up, haven't really felt the need to go asking anyone out or joining a dating website.

Ironically enough this happened while I was travelling to London to go on a date with her as that's where she's currently working. Was meant to get there near noon as she had half a day off and then an issue on the tracks led to me being cancelled. However, I made it a few stops over before I had to ultimately head home.

With it being a Friday on UK railways, it was hectic and a crowd of people were just standing around so I veered to the side, where I then saw someone who I thought was pretty cute. I was standing nearby and she was sat next to a bench with a dig and was playing with it a fair bit. Every now and again she'd look up at me and I'd smile in a polite way, but at the very least in the corner of my eyes I could see her look at me when I wasn't looking and I was doing the same to her.

Time passes and eventually as the crowd is moving through the gate, we're standing close to each other and we still give each other friendly glances, but it felt a little too clear that at the very least I had interest in her and vice versa. I was tempted to just bite the bullet and say 'Hey I'm sorry to bother, but I just thought you looked great and wanted to see if you'd like to swap numbers or something?' but I'm no Casanova by any stretch and ultimately we just kept looking at each other until she walked to her platform and I went to mine.

Obviously this could've been nothing, and maybe she had a boyfriend or was just being polite to some weirdo that was looking at her, but I did enjoy the whole thing mainly due to the principle of it all. I've been worried I'd just be a stick in the mud until my ex decides whether or not she wants to be with me or otherwise, but that experience just made me realise that other people might be interested in me and there's no harm in at the very least chatting to other people.

I still don['t really know what I want, but that felt like a decent confidence boost yesterday and now I can at least take away the fact that if my ex decides she doesn't want to get back with me, I've not just sat around and waited for her to make a decision and can make strides to being more confident in dating.",25Aug2018,1

I instantly knew what this was about. It was an attempt to get me to come in to look at a new/newer vehicle and to trade in my old one. They keep sending me shit in the mail trying to do the same. 

So I cut to the chase and flat out asked if this was to get me to trade it in and get a newer vehicle. 

I also told her I dont have a lot of minutes on my phone and I dont want to waste them because she was taking too long to get to the point. And that I am not interested in trading it in and buying a newer vehicle. 

She wouldnt take that as an answer and starts in on asking why I want to keep it. At that I blew up and told her because I like the vehicle and she comes back with some spiel on if I knew of all the features of a newer vehicle (that was the same model as my own).

We both still love each other very much and want to have a future together. He broke up with me because he is moving away to school 3 hours away. His reasoning was because he needs to adjust to his new life and figure himself out. He does struggle with mental illness and I completely understand why he ended things. He also said he would rather break up now and get back together rather than him go away and we have a fiery breakup because we didnt adjust well to not being able to talk as much as normal.

He promised to me that he wants a future with me and that he loves me. He also said that if I were to ever come to him while he was dating someone else, he would drop the person for me because I am what he wants. He isn’t actively seeking out another partner, he did also say he doesnt want to let anyone get close like that to him but he also said that he cannot predict the future and guarantee that he won’t find someone else

Am I making a mistake by still keeping him close to my heart? Im afraid that Im going to end up getting hurt again and my friends don’t seem like they want to tell me the truth so I want strangers to tell me whats actually up.

28,"I've just been looking up Lookism on Google right now and what shot to the top of the results was Lookism.net, the internet's main incel forum which is fucking disappointing. I scroll down and find either people ripping another asshole out of these incels or a limp article about a lamentable fact of life which the author is quietly greatful they'll never to have suffer from. 

I'm coming from a place of mental health problems and physical insecurity. I've had to deal with being treated less than a person, bullied and even vilified because of my atypical appearance and symptoms. Yet in this era of social justice I find I've fallen through the net.

Im unfortunately white, straight and male but also shy and a little odd. I feel I'm perceived as the acceptable prejudice in our society, not benefiting from the paths of redress other minorities now have. And I'm not lamenting this shift towards tolerance as I'm under no illusion I would suffer even worse under the Old Patriarchy. I think the main problem is I'm still being exposed to it's lasting effects and toxic expectations.

This however appears to put me in a practically invisible or ignored minority of men who effectively share most of our experience with Incels but have not succumbed to their *type* of bitterness. I don't know how I'm suppose to deal with that. The only people who it seems actually care about this issue are those guys with their defeatist, bigoted worldview. It's like I'm being offered up be society as a sacrifice to the beast, to become a convenient villain whom no one will lament over. Only problem is that it's not my nature! 

I just want to contribute to society, work where it's appreciated and give my insight to others. I've taken steps to seek greater independence and purpose in life but unfortunately my appearance revealed itself as an impediment. I've been called slow, slovenly, seedy, creepy (of course!), a weirdo (the bad kind) and a loser. Plenty of other smears including false allegations, extreme comparisons and specific targeted insults towards my features like ears, eyes, hair and headshape. The latter one could be due to flat head syndrome. 

I know we can't fix society overnight but it would be nice for men in my situation to be engaged with in a non-toxic way and have other right to common dignity recognised. We need a discussion about Outsider males of all backgrounds that is open public and constructive that will ultimately lead to reaching out and seeing what they can offer the world.

29,"Here's a fucking rant and a half.

What the hell happened to privacy? Just because I tell you something, does not mean you have the right to tell the family because 'we're family'. Fuck family means nothing. Its just a bunch of people who think they know whats best for you because they've known you longest. Somehow that gives them a step up and plus 1 from the extra years they've been on this godforsaken rock to tell you that you're wrong. Nothing is about experience for the younger ones. No. Its a case of 'learn from my mistakes'. Well. Well. Well. What you don't realise is this:

I learn from your mistakes not by you telling me what to do, but by your actions themselves. What you tell me not to do is the tip of the iceberg compared to the depth of information you have provided me by simply being 'yourself'. Don't speak. I already know I want to be nothing like you. You don't have to tell me.

Funny too, how most advice given by family is founded on fear. Don't do this. Don't do that. You'll hurt yourself. Don't risk it. What if that happens? 

Well if it happens, I give you permission to tell me 'I told you so.' Is that what you fucking want to hear? No of course not! I care about you. Nah. You care about the indirect impact on the group. On the family. When one member is down. It affects the rest. It is only natural to want everyone happy. Not for their sake. But for the groups. For yours. 

Groups are another topic that honestly destroy my fucking soul but I can't right now.

I just want to say, dear family, stop tying your emotions to mine. You're so worried about what damage to my physical body could do to my mind that you don't realise you're doing the greatest damage of all. Fear. Fear causes the real damage and guess whose drip feeding that to me.

A stranger really.

32,"So this morning i had to drop my mother off at the airport and on the way back i decided to stop for McDonald's. While i was eating this guy comes up to my truck asking what year it was and offering yard work if i had any to be done. He said he just came her from mexico and hes living in his car and I genuinely felt bad for him because he looked pretty down. But dealing with this kind of thing 85% of the time I go to that McDonald's i just said i couldn't help him out and left.

As i was leaving another woman stopped me talking about how she needed a ride about ten minutes away because her mother just passed and rambling about god this and that so I figured ten minutes isn't a big deal so i let her have a ride.

I don't really know why I said yes.

Turns out the ride was actually 45 minutes filled with nonstop ranting about her entire life story (She tells me she used to be a prostitute and addicted to crack for ten years.) and basically begging me for money and food. I stop and get her an orange juice and a sandwich because i swear to god she didn't stop talking for more than 10 seconds the entire 45 minutes. Even after i bought her food and took an hour and a half drive for her she gets pissed at me when i don't give her cash.

It went something like:

""By the grace of the sweet lord baby Jesus could you please spare me some money I only need 61 dollars""

""No i'm sorry i really cant help you there I gave you a ride and bought you food""

""Did your mother tell you she didn't want you at the age of 12 years old (insert 3 minutes of similar lines)""

""No, I feel you""

""So you're just gonna come out here and tell me no when you don't know about my life and god is going to deal with people like you in the long run so its off my chest. people are never out here helping each other and i never take advantage of anyone so i expect the lord to return the favor to me (she told me someone paid for her hotel the day before took her to breakfast)""

At that point i just said okay because honestly i had no response to that so i just said ""Alright.""

Initially I was glad that i could help someone out but in the end I really don't feel good about it i just feel really taken advantage of. You know, I turned someone down that has stumbled on hard times and is actively trying to get himself where he has to be in life and then helped someone who had no intentions other than taking advantage of me. I don't really have a purpose for this post I just don't really have anyone to bounce this off of in my personal life.

35,"my mom and i are very different people, we tend to disagree a lot and it always leads to a fight because we both think each others way of thinking is illogical or inaccurate. yesterday we were talking about dying my hair, which my parents arent allowing me to do. whenever i ask my mom why am not allowed to dye my hair she says its because am too young (17) and she doesnt want my hair to get damaged. iv talked to her plenty about this topic not because i wanna dye my hair but because i want her to open up a little more and stop being so uptight. its in my moms nature to live very safely and am the opposite, i want her to stop perserving everything and live a little more carefree and in the moment. she was telling me that she thinks am too young to already be damaging my hair, when am 30 or 40 and graying is when ill REALLY need to dye it, its not necessary right now because am still youthful and healthy and she ended it with ""but thats just my opinion and i dont know about you or what suit you best"" and i finally felt like she was seeing things from my perspective and ALLOWING me to have my own perspective instead of forcing her opinion down my throat. i felt accomplished. it didnt turn into an arguement because i felt like she understood me and understood how and why were different and accepted it, i feel like this is a step closer to me growing up and having a little bit of independence. it feels great",25Aug2018,2

37,"I started college days ago and am already having a pretty hard time making new friends. I absolutely hate when people say ""College is the best 4 years of your life. I wish I could go back to college. The time is all yours, use it wisely and don't let it go to waste."" It completely fucks me up when I hear people say that and always sends me into a panic. It's not their fault, it's just not easy for me because I've struggled with pretty bad social anxiety for awhile. I downright just don't know how to talk to people based on other people's demeanor towards me. I bear multiple personalities but inside I mean very well. But apparently I just give off a vibe that makes me seem like a self-entitled douchebag? Maybe it's my body language, or perhaps irritating things I might be saying of which people notice, meanwhile I think nothing of it.

Whatever the case, I'm just terrified of being judged and overthink it and just end up keeping quiet and when I'm put on the spot I freeze up and start sweating. I can improvise pretty well and make decent conversation but on the inside I'm freaking out, worrying about every single word I'm saying to whoever I'm talking to. Who do they think I was in high school? Do you think I'm a loser, pussy or an easy target? Do you think I'm a self-righteous asshole that doesn't give a shit about other people in the worst way possible?

I can take a hint when someone just ""doesn't fuck with me"" but when I didn't even do anything and *most* people have that perception towards me (I think), it just makes me sad and self-conscious.

So since I ""can't let this time go to waste"", can anybody give me some tips or some help on how to be more socially confident? Drugs have helped me but I don't cope well with their withdrawal/comedown well at all.

The most common answer is to just not give a shit what people think and be yourself but, I've tried that and I'll admit it works and helps me feel better but sometimes it's just not that easy, most commonly when I'm meeting someone new (which is exactly what college is) because when I ""don't give a shit"" I come off as a douchebag and when I do give a shit I'm a pussy. I just don't understand why it's so easy for everybody else to be so likable and I'm just not.",25Aug2018,1
39,"I'm 21 years old and I'm afraid to fall asleep most nights.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At first, I was scared of the dark. I can't stand being in the dark alone in silence. I will end up checking if there is something in the dark that will get me. I generally never slept alone most of my life so that could be why. I slept in my parent's room until I was high school (small house). When I moved out for college, I moved in with my brother and we slept in one bedroom to save on electricity for airconditioning. Now that my brother has left the apartment, my boyfriend sleeps over most nights. For most of my life, I have always been with people when I go to sleep. On nights I'm alone, I have to sleep when the sun comes up. Even then, I'm deathly afraid that I might somehow.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At first, I could sleep alone in the dark. Eventually, I get so scared that I'd sleep with the lights on. Eventually, even the lights on wasn't enough and I'd need the sun to be up. Eventually, I need to just pass out from sheer exhaustion to fall asleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what it is I'm scared of at this point. But it's an incredibly terrifying feeling I get when the fear really gets to me. On nights that it's really bad, my vision starts to tunnel and I feel like I will pass out from the fear. I end up frozen on the bed and I can't move. I can't close my eyes because I feel like if I do, I will die. But at the same time, my vision is slowly starting to become black and I feel cold sweat start as a chill goes through my body. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Most nights, I'm too terrified to sleep. I don't know what it is, but it has really hindered me from having a clean sleep hygiene. At least most nights, my boyfriend or my brother sleeps over. But on days they aren't here, I just can't go to bed without feeling like I'm going to die.",25Aug2018,2
40,"All the retail clothing stores around me are probably unethical, chocolate and coffee is unethical, and animal products/meat are cruel. Phone manufacturers are evil corporations. I feel like I should vote with my dollar, but there is literally no easy way for me to find out whether every employee connected to a company is looked after in many aspects. I can subsist on rice and vegies, but the only way to not support unethical products is to quit civilisation altogether. I’m just not sure if I could survive in the wilderness.",25Aug2018,4
41,"Long story short for context - GF of 2.5 years broke up with me, regretted it after a few days and we got back to talking; can tell it wasn't an act of malice and more a stupid decision, but nonetheless we've both been currently single for a few months and she's been to a nightclub a few times while enjoying being single and getting snapchats and facebooks of guys there which I don't have an issue with. Think it's cool she's talking to other guys as ultimately if she finds someone else she'd rather be with I'd push for her to be with them any day of the week but do still love her.

However, she's been worried/annoyed with the fact it seems like so far all that's happened is she broke up with me and is playing the field while I've done nothing; I'm not a confident or extroverted guy and though it's been 2 months since we broke up, haven't really felt the need to go asking anyone out or joining a dating website.

Ironically enough this happened while I was travelling to London to go on a date with her as that's where she's currently working. Was meant to get there near noon as she had half a day off and then an issue on the tracks led to me being cancelled. However, I made it a few stops over before I had to ultimately head home.

With it being a Friday on UK railways, it was hectic and a crowd of people were just standing around so I veered to the side, where I then saw someone who I thought was pretty cute. I was standing nearby and she was sat next to a bench with a dog and was playing with it a fair bit. Every now and again she'd look up at me and I'd smile in a polite way, but at the very least in the corner of my eyes I could see her look at me when I wasn't looking and I was doing the same to her.

Time passes and eventually as the crowd is moving through the gate, we're standing close to each other and we still give each other friendly glances, but it felt a little too clear that at the very least I had interest in her and vice versa. I was tempted to just bite the bullet and say 'Hey I'm sorry to bother, but I just thought you looked great and wanted to see if you'd like to swap numbers or something?' but I'm no Casanova by any stretch and ultimately we just kept looking at each other until she walked to her platform and I went to mine.

Obviously this could've been nothing, and maybe she had a boyfriend or was just being polite to some weirdo that was looking at her, but I did enjoy the whole thing mainly due to the principle of it all. I've been worried I'd just be a stick in the mud until my ex decides whether or not she wants to be with me or otherwise, but that experience just made me realise that other people might be interested in me and there's no harm in at the very least chatting to other people.

I still don['t really know what I want, but that felt like a decent confidence boost yesterday and now I can at least take away the fact that if my ex decides she doesn't want to get back with me, I've not just sat around and waited for her to make a decision and can make strides to being more confident in dating.",25Aug2018,0

We were young, 18, I had never had a successful relationship (read: past history of relational manipulation and abuse), and it seemed like a decent choice in next steps. But I didn't want to. 

Is it still rape if I never said no, even though I never said yes either? I was scared and confused and unsure, but I was also curious. Does that mean I wanted it? My body responded even as my mind panicked, does that make it less involuntary?

43,"I'm almost 40, never married, no children, and over the past twelve years I have lost my entire family.  I am afraid to love because, well, I don't want to have to lose anyone else.  Ironically, I am also afraid to not to love because I don't want to be alone.  Things were so bad after my last family member died that I moved to a neighboring town, but that didn't seem to work.  I hated my job, I wasn't succeeding at it, and I didn't like the town.  

Finally, it became so bad that I had to make a decision; leave today or live and die this way.  So with $600 in my pocket, I abandoned 90% of my property, packed up my truck, my cat and dog, and moved almost two thousand miles away.  I went from the east coast to a desert, and left every one and everything I knew behind. 

I had a feeling from the previous months that something Big was going to happen.  I have always had faith in God, but the death of my last family member seriously made me question everything about believes in God.  If you've never lost your entire family, then you haven't the faintest clue what it is like.  Anyway, my little sixth sense (God telling me it was time to move on) was in full bloom.  I began looking at houses, just for fun, but still I knew something was going to happen, long before I knew that I was going to move.  In fact, and it may seem like a rash decision, I made the actual decision to move in a week.  I told God that if he wanted me to move to help me get my sales.  He did!  Of course the company only provided me with half of my bonus (claiming that half of my sales canceled their orders).

I quit my job a few days before I actually left for my two thousand mile journey (in a truck with a bad egr valve and bald tires).  I was excited, scared, and I felt supercalafragalisticexpialidotious about the entire thing.  As the days counted down, I went through a cycle of three stages (1) This is great, a new adventure, a new life, (2) This is for the best, maybe, and (3) WHAT THE HECK WAS I THINKING!!!  I threw away a job I've been at for almost three years, I'm leaving my friends, There's no guarantee that I will find a job!.  As the days counted down my every waking hour cycles around these three stages.   I had literally gone all in and it was not the time to back down.

It took four days for me to make my cross country journey.  While on the road itself I felt safe.   Even during those long stretches where you would not see a car for hours.  I felt safe.  There were residual hauntings (so to speak) of crazed mad killers who tortured people, black eyed children, and every urban legend ever invented about a single traveler moving across country (not to mention the fact that I, to sleep, would listen to creepy true life horror tales - many of which were from reddit).

The farther away I got from my old state and everything that was familiar, the more sanguine I became about the whole thing. For the first time in years, while on that road, I was at peace. 

Now I am in my new state and my new town.  Despite having the occasional bout of depression (once again if you've never lost your entire family, you do not know what this is like), I am happier than I was 2000 miles away. ",25Aug2018,0

46,"Today a couple hours ago I was at marine PT on a Saturday. After I finished one of the thingies we were doing forgot the name but it's a combat version of the PFT. I was like ""damn"" for a couple of reasons. 

Little background first tho. When I was really young my parents became abusive and I developed severe depression, social anxiety, selective mutism and a bunch of other smaller problems. Throughout my whole life I have let my anxiety get in the way of me doing things. I have literally never had friends, I never had a childhood, never had any fun etc. I didn't even talk at all since u had selective mutism. When it we did something in school I would always out it off and let others go first and I'd go last etc stuff like that, just very shy in general oh and id get discouraged and give up so easily.

In 8th grade I was 5'7-9 at 250 pounds. By 12th grade I had lost most of that weight and a year after I finished highschool I hit my lowest weight 157lbs at 6'0. I've always wanted to get into weight lifting but I was always too shy and introverted to even attempt to try it. I've been weightlifting for about 5-7ish months and I've gained anywhere from 15-25 lbs of muscle. Currently I'm 170 lbs and since I started I've also lost more fat. 

I've also always wanted to join the marines but again, my anxiety didn't even let me pick up the phone. Much less walk into the recruiters office. I've been trying to join. I drove up to Washington from California to get my birth certificate because I didn't have it. I've also never missed a PT session at my recruiters office. I went to MEPS and got disqualified for astigmatism. I'm currently fighting that DQ and going for a waiver. 

So, today at the combat thing PT I finished the course in 2:51 minutes. I said damn for a couple of reasons. 1. The last time I did the course my time was 3:30 and the course was smaller. 2. The passing time is 2:35min aka I failed and 3. Because I wasn't the last one to finish, wasn't nowhere near the last person. 

That just made me realize how much I've worked for. I told my anxiety and depression to fuck off, I've lost so much weight, I stopped letting my anxiety get in the way, I don't give up nearly as easily as before. Scratch that, I don't give up period. 

In the last year I've worked my butt off so much both in school and in my personal life. A few weeks ago I went to visit my old HS teacher and the guy couldn't even recognize me. I had to tell him who I was.(I didn't care  about my appearance either..) my parents kicked me out of the house yesterday yet I still went to PT. Fuck my parents, if I didn't need them growing up then I don't need them at all. By the way, I volunteered to go first at PT, something that would've been unthinkable of when I was in HS. 

I mean like holy fuck. When I touch my arms, back, legs, stomach, etc. It's not squishy like it's always been. It's actually firm. Tbh Im really surprised with what I've accomplished, didn't know I had it in me especially without the support of others. But here I am, homeless yet happy as fuck :)

47,"Several months ago, I decided I wanted to perpetrate a hoax and make a little internet mystery out of it.  I was planning on doing a trip to Montana this summer, so I chose a relatively arbitrary spot on my trip route in the mountains, split it into pieces that needed assembling, and then shitposted it on several subreddits chosen from \/r/random, until eventually one of them took an interest.

Someone quickly realised they were imgur links and assembled them into the map.  I removed any name markers from the map, but despite it being in a remote location, others quickly regognised the exact spot as an island on Lower Aero lake.  

To keep the juices flowing, I decided to continue to spam additional pictures of the location a few more times.  Anyways, I decided that I wanted to try to see if I could trick a large group of people to go to the location all at once.  Knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get there in late October or in the winter, I decided to start posting a time without any context that was shortly after my trip, 09:00 July 1st, 2018.  

To my joy, apparently there was enough visibility and interest in my posts that several people who live within a few hours of the place decided they would make the trip.  Anyways, by this point I didn't really know what else much to do, but I wanted to make sure interest wasn't lost and forgotten over the span of the months leading up to it.  The only other significant post I made was sometime this spring, I made up some conversation and hid it within the frequency spectrum of an audio file, which people also quickly figured out.  The contents of the conversation reflected nothing of reality and I was just BS-ing it on the spot, but it was enough to keep up the interest. 

Anyways, now comes June 2018.  I left for my trip with a friend.  After a couple other planned stops along the way, our original itinerary was to head out for Lower Aero lake on June 25th.  Due to some remarkably poor planning on my part, we didn't get to the trailhead until late in the evening, so we decided to stay in Red Lodge for the night and take one of our alternative routes instead.  Instead of driving back to Cooke City the next day, we took the West Fork of Rock Creek trail, hiked up towards Sundance Mountain, turned back, and camped for the night in the Quinnebaugh meadows.  Anyways, we never got to leave a little trinket on Lower Aero, and instead of spending a few more nights in the Beartooth mountains, we decided to get an earlier start on the rest of our trip up in Glacier.  

The next time I got on the internet wasn't until July 6th, so boy was I surprised when I learned that over a dozen people made the trip.  I tried to keep up the hoax for a little longer, but it was pretty damn obvious by that point that this was a troll so funtime over.  

Then someone posted a video of their trip, and it looks like everyone had a good time despite my shenanigans, so now I figured I'd go ahead and make this post.  

Tl;dr, yes I was just a troll, no there was no hidden treasure or spooky thing on the island, no I was not part of the group that showed up, but yes I was in the wilderness nearby a few days prior, and I'm glad everyone had a little fun out of it. ",25Aug2018,12

49,"I need someone to listen. I’m sorry this is long, I tried to condense it. Please bear with me.  
  
I underwent trauma 6 years ago. The sort of trauma that had me playing this morbid mental game where I would consider who I would trade places with…and some of those people were paraplegics, the blind, those with AIDs, any type of cancer I’ve ever heard of, and on and on. Really the only people I wouldn’t trade with are the severely mentally disabled and those with locked-in syndrome. Statistically, this trauma I sustained increases a person’s suicide risk by over 5 times normal (for life…every single effect from this trauma is permanent).  
  
I planned to kill myself. Down to the last detail. I only waited because I was trying an experimental treatment that may have helped me. For 18 months I was committed. For 18 months I had to look my mother in the eyes and cope with the knowledge that I was going to inflict her with pain so bad she would never be the same, happy, carefree person she was her whole life.  
  
That destroyed me. I saw a psychiatrist once and decided they could not help me.  
  
The reason I am still alive? I’m still trying to figure that out. My trajectory was one that lead me to read all day, every day. Philosophy, science, fiction, anything. Mostly philosophy and science. And I would introspect, literally for hours, discovering myself, forming ideas about my ideas, ideas about my formation of ideas. I started to journal the fruits of this behavior. And then one day I realized that my commitment to suicide had slipped below the threshold of doubt. I didn’t think it was prudent anymore, about 4 months from the date I planned to do it.  
  
Over the next 4-5 years I developed into someone who is genuinely content with life. I am kind to people, I am among the top 1% of engineering undergrads in my 4th year, I have a patent pending invention, and a company worth quite a bit. The only “off” thing about me was an on odd sort of mental callous. I struggled to feel emotions beyond the slightest magnitude. I watched my grandfather die and couldn’t cry. Not even close. And, very strangely, I would occasionally feel intense emotion over somewhat silly things. I watched a youtube video about the NASA Challenger explosion and was overwhelmed with sadness…cried harder than ever before.  
  
The last bastion was finding companionship. I really didn’t think it possible.  
  
About a year ago I proved myself wrong. Not only did I find love, but it was with a woman who I had known for years. She was my “dream girl” since the day I met her. I used her mentally as my measuring stick against which to compare other women that I considered dating. I always considered her off limits. No way would she settle for me. She shouldn’t settle for me.  
  
But she did. And for the past year she has massaged my self-image into one that is indeed worthy of her. I am not young. I thought I knew how great love can be. She showed me I didn’t know a shadow of what is truly possible. She showed me what history’s poets have written about since the word was invented, the absolute height of human experience.    
  
She singlehandedly completed my revival; from the nadir of my life to the peak.  
  
About 45 minutes ago she said to me over the phone, “I can’t do this anymore. I’m done.”  
  
Never once has she given me any reason to think this was on the horizon. Not a clue. The reason she said this is because she thinks that she is toxic for me. Without great detail, we are long distance at the moment and she is dealing with one hell of a family problem, and it bleeds through into her mood and behavior often.  
  
We had an argument yesterday, not a particularly bad one, and she ended the argument poorly. She hurt my feelings. She knew she acted irrationally, unfairly, and didn’t apologize till this morning. I let her know last night in a text that she hurt my feelings, and how. I ended it with “I love you. Call me in the morning.”  
  
And this morning she thought, for the first time ever, that she was too toxic for me. That she needed to spare me until she was “better.”  
  
I kept her on the phone for 2 hours. I truthfully and vehemently made the case to her that the net effect she has on me, always had on me, is enormously positive.  
  
She believes I delude myself to believe this, but that an objective 3rd party would clearly see she is bad for me.  
  
I asked her to call someone who spends a lot of time with me and ask them, “in secret,” what they thought about my mental status. Play dumb, say you are worried about me for X reason, and ask them in confidence what they observe. There’s your 3rd party.  
  
I told her to let me make the decision for myself about what is good for me. I told her to think about the vows we have made to each other…to be there through sickness and health. To weather this storm, clinging always to the fact of how happy we make each other, and make it through to each other no matter what.  
  
2 hours I talked. For 2 hours I was reduced to terror and desperation I haven’t ever known, committing every neuron in my brain to convincing the woman I love, who loves me, to stay. It worked. She agreed to continue so long as I promise to tell her if her “toxicity” becomes too much. I did.  
  
And now I am shaking. I don’t know what to do. She’s the only living person who could comfort me right now, but she is the source of this. I haven’t felt like a scared child in a long time.    
  
I don’t know what to expect from writing this. I don’t want to confide in someone I know, but I need help. I’m so frightened and confused.  
  
I know many of you will rightfully speculate about the integrity of this account of things. If you have anything to say to me, I ask you to please assume that everything I said is the exact truth. Please suspend any skepticism about her propensity for the truth, or my ability to detect lies. She can’t lie to me. She never has. Considering that possibility is going to introduce so many variables that any chance I have of reacting appropriately will vanish to zero. I need to save Us. Reacting appropriately means preserving the most beautiful, cherished thing in her life and mine.  
  
From here, I don’t think I can. The implications of that statement are so heinous I actually don’t believe it, emotionally. Intellectually I do, and when the two consolidate I am fucked.",25Aug2018,6
