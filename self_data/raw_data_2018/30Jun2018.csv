0,"I'm 18. I worry about stupid things like having no friends, or having friends that only tolerate me. I worry about my love life, about not enjoy enough and making the use of my time both productively and socially and for fun.

Ive been so engrossed in my own life and problems, I barely ever appreciate my family. There's my parents, my 2 brothers and 2 sisters. Recently its come to me, that I should be spending more time with them and properly creating bonds with my parents, which in recent years I haven't had.

The main reason I know I will regret this is that if any of them leave this life for whatever reason, I will go on in life knowing I never made the effort, and carry this regret. I love all of them deeply. I just worry sometimes about getting too close to them. I dont trust many people, have a hard time with it.

Just wanted to write this down somewhere.",30Jun2018,1

2,"This is my first time posting to Reddit, but when I saw this sub I just needed to. 

A little about me : I'm a popular, outgoing, and smart guy, top of my class and social group. I'm always seen as ""perfect"" as a student, and sometimes as a person.

But that couldn't be farther from the truth.

The truth is, I hate myself. I hate every single aspect of my being, every nuance of my creation. I've hated it since I was 8. I'm 16 now, not very old at all. The most surprising thing is despite my consistent hatred, and inability to love myself, I will always greet others with all the love I can muster up. And as always, that never works out, and my trust is betrayed.

My family is horrible. Now, the members aren't the issue. It's the environment. And the cause? My dad. He's insane. He's always furious about anything and everything, he's always screaming and degrading me no matter what I do. Nothing is good enough for him ever. And whenever he's off on a business trip or something of the sort, the environment is amazing... Except for the fact that my mom misses him. How she could connect so much to such a being I'll never understand.

Another wonderful aspect of my cursed being is my ""friends"". I show them what I wish I could be shown, yet  am never greeted with the same. They always see me as a goal to reach, or an obstacle to get over instead of a friend. And that shows, a lot. Im not allowed to leave the house either, so it honestly is a miracle I even have social skills. I just am social by nature, and it's torture to remain at home constantly. But what can I do?

My dad also never stops making me do his work. It's business stuff that he can't be bothered to do that ends up being my responsibility. Should I express my inability, I'm called useless, and a waste of life. Should I inevitably mess up, I'm called useless, and a waste of life. See where all my confidence comes from?

My loneliness has recently led to becoming addicted to porn. Not beating off, but just watching intimate videos. Being the religious person I am, this crushes me, but I just can't stop. I get the attention of many girls, but can't proceed with anything so they struggle for a bit, and move on. And to be completely honest, I have a very fucked up tendency to enjoy their struggle. Their absolute commitment of love towards me fills my lack thereof, and I just feel less empty. And when that supply is cut off, I am suddenly took again by emptiness.

The only reason I'm writing this post, is to inform people that don't know me, that most likely care more than those who do, that I have become extremely suicidal. I've considered many ways to kill myself, and have the means to do so. There's only one thing stopping me, and it's my mom. I just love her so much. Shes my whole world, and nothing can come between us. She's my best friend, the closest person to me, and the only one who truly loves me. I know it would devestate her, but I feel like she's better off without me. I've tried to talk to her about my feelings but broke my facade and ended up crying and just completely ruining her. I've done her enough harm. I've had enough harm done to me.

TL;DR I have a very fucked up life and can't take it anymore. I feel like I'm tormenting the one reason for my being, my mom, and so I plan on taking my life. Came here for a possible word to give me hope.

5,"I met this girl a while ago at my young adults group. Immediately we hit it off. The first few times we talked only at the group, sharing stories and making each other laugh. I asked for her number and she gave it to me. I suggested going for a coffee and she was all about it. 
Before we go any farther I should mention she’s from Germany and I’m from and currently living in Canada. 
I don’t have much experience dating or courting but I could tell that she liked me and wanted to be around me. She’d text often and confided in me and asked for my help with some of her problems. 
When I asked her to be my girlfriend (the first time I’ve ever done it face to face with a girl) she explained that she wasn’t sure if she could stay in Canada. She was trying to get a working visa and if it all panned out she would love to be. We grew closer over the short months but nothing seemed to be going right with her visa and it was another hard process to get her education all sorted.
Long story short her visa was accepted but her education never transferred. This meant she could t get a good job doing what she loved. While this saddened me I truly know that I love this girl and that she wouldn’t be happy here so I encouraged her to find a job back home. 
Well she did find a job, and she’s leaving a lot sooner than we planned. I’ve never experienced something so happy and so sad at the same time. 
She’s the first girl I’ve ever could truly be myself around and I feel like because of her I’ve grown a lot. I’m happy that she’s going to be happy, but I’m sad that she has to leave to do so. Any way I’ll always have her in my heart and I know she’ll always have me in her’s. 
I’m thankful for our time together, and if anything I’ve learned is that love lasts even though life is fleeting. I don’t know where to go from here but I know things will be better in the future. 
I need to take time to heal and refresh, but I just thought I’d share with you guys. Love is worth it no matter how short time is.",30Jun2018,2
6,"Two of which were relationships, both of which consisted of, unbeknownst to me, the other party starting a relationship with someone else, knowing full well how I felt about them. It wasn’t cheating because we weren’t technically “together”. I’ve lost about 2 years and 7 months to them because “they didn’t want to hurt me” so they never told me until it was far too late. 

The other is with my mother. Someone everyone should be able to trust and talk to, but that’s another story entirely.

7,"This is going to sound crazy. My sister thinks I'm reading too much into it. 

I, along with one other person, work from home permanently. Everyone else goes into the office every day. Over the past few months, at the end of group calls, these two women have been going out of their way to say bye or thanks to me. How horrible right? So what makes me feel like the butt of a joke is that they say it when I have been particularly quiet, they say it in an almost sing song voice, and it's always followed by giggles.

I think one of my bosses may have been the first to do it - she may have been frustrated that I am often quiet on group calls. However, these other two women have picked it up and run with it. I feel like I can't say anything without sounding completely irrational, but it puts a damper on my day when it happens.

Despite my quietness, my bosses love me because I do quality work. I always get glowing reviews and have hardly any supervision. I have been there for over 10 years and have never encountered anything like this before.",30Jun2018,4

14,"It was flattering at first, this younger guy (early 20’s, I’m late 30’s) told me I’m beautiful and “age is just a number” and that he really likes me and wants to date me. That was a week ago. Two days later, I was getting a little tired of the messages (the amount of them, particularly), then we actually worked the same days (different departments, overlapping shifts). I started seeing him every break/lunch, even breaks that happened some time before his shifts began, then he started walking me out to my car during his lunch, and sending messages just as often. It went from flattering to smothering. Yesterday I wasn’t in the mood to deal with him, but there he was during my first break, 45 minutes before his shift began! I ended up leaving campus for lunch, but he found me for my last break, and after work. I had some shopping to do (we work in a store) and he kept sneaking up on my, then giving me awkward hugs. One day he kept tickling me, until I snapped at him to stop. The next day, he asked if he could tickle me even though I hated it, because he found it so amusing (um, NO!). During those days that we didn’t see each other, he asked if he could give me a surprise kiss after work (we’d only been talking via PM and only just met shortly before, having had all of one conversation the day this all started, about Marvel movies!). I told him no. He always wants to hug. And not short, friendly hugs. Long bear hugs! I had today off work. He’s sent me a couple messages, not nearly as many, but I haven’t read them, because Facebook tells you your message was viewed, as he pointed out to me. I don’t handle situations like this well. When someone comes on too strong, I retreat. But I work with him, so how’s that going to work? If I tell him that he’s coming in too strong, will he actually back off, or will he change his tactics and still try to get me to date him? I worked hard at my job in order to get the position I currently have, and most of my friends I met through work (moved here a year ago). I am learning a new position, about to start an intense internship, and I don’t need to be stressed out by a borderline stalker at work! I really just needed to get that off my chest.

15,"In september last year I was top 3 in the class and never got any praise when everyone else did. Didn't know why but thought whatever. I'd miss 1 lesson and she'd basically tell me I don't deserve to be here and I'm not impressing her, when other classmates missed half the week consistently and she'd literally make jokes about it like 'Partying too hard Luke?' I thought that was weird but thought whatever. One time I literally coughed and she told me off, and one time I literally yawned and she told me off, while other classmates could throw paper in the bin from across the class, have loud conversations, do no work, and again she'd just make jokes about it. I thought that was odd but thought whatever. So I'm fucked up the head and had to get sectioned at the start of the year. When I came back I had to sit exams on 3 months worth of missed, and scored grades B, C, C, with a C in her subject. No praise, even when the class average is around a C, and I'd just got that, after having been absent for 3 fucking months, just coming out of an extremely dark period. 


So now I'm not just thinking 'whatever' and I'm like what the fuck is this woman's problem. We get assigned a homework, a timeline, of 35 significant economic events since 1990 and to make notes on each event. She said around 4 pages was enough for the whole thing, and it was due in 2 weeks. I do 18 pages, 18 fucking pages, on about 10 of the events, about 8 of these events I had zero knowledge of previously so had to wrap my head around some in-depth shit, and I give it to her 1 week early to show my progress so far. She sits me down, and basically tells me I've wasted my time, there's no way I even did any of it, there's no way I even remember anything in it, and that basically, again, she's worried whether I should not only be on this course or the college at large.

16,"My mother has beautiful, beautiful curly hair and has *always* been complimented on it by random strangers in public, family, etc. I’m mixed but never learned how to properly do my hair and damaged it to no end by straightening it for 7+ years. No one had ever complimented my natural hair, and it made me really sad as a child. I don’t feel that way now anymore, but I’ve been wearing my hair naturally again to try and get it to grow. 

Today I was on register, and a customer I’d rung up a few minutes ago came through the line again to purchase something, and while I’m ringing her up, she tells me my hair is so beautiful. I didn’t realize how emotional hearing that would make me since I’d really only felt *bad* was when I was a lot younger, but her saying that left me on the verge of crying. I thanked her so much and complimented how absolutely beautiful her kids were. She told me she doesn’t know the right way to do her kids’ hair yet, and I laughed and said my mom didn’t either. I could tell her kids were mixed similar to me, and she looked at me almost relieved and began asking me questions about hair care.

Looking at it now I've never been able to just relax when I'm alone. I feel like I always have to act like I'm around others and it's always bothered me but I never really wanted to do anything about it. I also tend to talk to myself out loud when I'm alone as if I'm talking to someone else for example I'll say what I'm doing, I'll speak my thoughts, I'll have full on conversations with myself and I'll even come up with opinions or responses that I'd feel the people i feel like are watching me would say.

25,"I will preface this by saying I'm not religious by any means and I try to explain everything in life if I can by the most scientific or logical means possible. However, this is me breaking with that part of my character to reflect on something that happened last year, maybe 11 months ago.

I was new to town, but the town wasn't new to me. This is and was my grandma's birth place and place of death. It ended up being where my uncle died, as well. And lo and behold, I am now here spending my days in this lifeless town of gossipers and peddlers.

I met an acquaintance's boyfriend once for Thursday dinner. He had a ragtag group of friends who would come here and there, not necessarily every week, but they tried to make it weekly. I met a disabled farmer and his significantly younger wife, a closeted lesbian, a sad old man, and one very religious, very naïve upper midlife lady. For the sake of anonymity, I will call her Paula.

Paula was the daughter of a very well-connected man in town. She could basically get away with murder, and she sort of seemed like she had. She was simultaneously with it while being as religiously anachronistic as they come. I enjoyed talking to Paula because she was an enigma in my view. She smoked and cursed and used to be a drug addict, but she was a woman of God — with a capital G — who professed her love for her Prophet whenever she felt the need.

Paula was Pentecostal. For those of you who don't know, this sect of Christians practices glossolalia (a term Paula was astounded I was familiar with as a non-believer!) Glossolalia is, to put it simply, speaking in tongues. For Pentecostals, it is a rite, a sign of adulthood. A child flails in a panicky, seemingly nonsensical seizure of ejaculatory hokey-pokey. But to the religious, this is not a fleeting rite, but a lifelong infliction.

I learned just by talking to Paula that sometimes she would speak in tongues mid-sentence and continue on as if nothing had happened. She would later tell me that she simply didn't notice it when it happened anymore. However, there was one night nigh my birthday, a warm, muggy Texas evening, in which my view of her changed.

Paula and I were speaking outside as she smoked a cigarette — God only knows what about — when Paula suddenly interjects in the middle of a thought, ""ben hayata shemesh."" I paused. She continued on with her thought, but noticed I had not replied. Paula snapped like smelling salts in my face. ""Hello?""

I asked her to repeat what she said, so she went on about whatever the topic at hand had been, but I stopped her. ""No, I know *that*, but what you said in the middle."" It took a solid minute of back and forth before she realized what I meant. ""Honey, I don't ever even notice when I'm speaking [in tongues] in the first place, let alone repeating it.""

""You spoke in Hebrew,"" I said. Paula laughed wryly and confided a story to me in which a pastor had told her she had excellent Hebrew after hearing her speak. Then, as well as now, she had no idea she had even spoken. ""בן, היית שמש. Son, you were a sun. That's what you said."" I started to cry.

""I am only the messenger. Whatever He needed to say to you is yours and yours alone.""

I started to bawl. I had only been learning Hebrew for a year up until that point, and I had barely even touched the past tense in the language. ""Son, you were a sun.” It was impactful, meaningful. I had felt so lost the entire spring and summer since my uncle had passed. I had felt flung into a level of adulthood I simply could not comprehend.

*בן, היית שמש.*  
*Son, you were a sun.*

Reliving that moment now even gives me goosebumps. It may be meaningless to everyone else, but it meant the world to me then, and the fact of the matter is I needed to hear it. I was a sun. I still am. I am a glowing work of art in all my own miserable, East Coast, esoteric way. And I need to remember that.",30Jun2018,0

I am disabled and agoraphobic with panic disorder. I go on walks to try to improve my mood but it isn't working anymore. My options are otherwise extremely limited. I'm just surviving, nothing changing. I'm often thinking now that this isn't worth it. ",30Jun2018,2
27,"I taught school for several years. Once in a while, I'll Google the names of a few memorable former students to see where they ended up and how they are doing. No, not creepy stalker mode - mostly looking for news articles that mention achievements or life events like marriages, etc.

A kid popped into my head tonight, somebody I hadn't thought about for years. It was my first teaching job, right out of college. He was in my 5th grade reading group - one of the smartest kids I've ever encountered in the classroom. But he wasn't arrogant about his intelligence. Just a lovable, incredibly smart boy. And the articles online showed that he remained that way through high school, receiving community awards and excelling in clubs and activities.

And then he committed suicide shortly before Christmas. He was 19. I'm crushed, but it's not really about me. I haven't seen him in nearly a decade. His story doesn't belong to me. But it brings the suicide epidemic to the front of my mind.

How do we slow down the spread of self-harm and suicide, especially among our young men? The tentacles of suicide reach farther than they know. It doesn't just affect close family and friends - it seeps into the culture and  plants seeds of itself in others. Every time a young man commits suicide, it seems more normal. Others see it and think it's terrible but typical, and eventually another one gives in.

We have to break the chain. We need to interrupt the cycle. The wasted potential is staggering.",30Jun2018,106
28,"Without going into too much detail, my relationship has significantly changed with my partner of 5 years over the past couple of days. Regrettably, I no longer see the woman I could trust more than anybody else in the world and feel empty, alone and as if I’m drifting aimlessly into the wind. 

As a nervous, socially anxious man coming up to 30, I have placed all my metaphorical eggs in this relationship basket. She is my best and pretty much only friend. Without anybody else to confide in I feel truly lost and like a weed within the flowers. 

It made me think about the lack of female platonic friends I’ve ever had in my life and whether this was an abnormality. I’ve had plenty of male friends over the years but I’ve never been close to a woman I wasn’t dating or wished to date in the future.

37,"We’ve been together for 3 years.

My girlfriend found various packs of cigarettes while cleaning the house and she decided to keep 6 for her and give the rest away. I’ve asked her “why are you keeping 6 packs? you’ve stopped smoking. give all of them away”

She got instantly angry with me and said she can do whatever she wants and I’m not her father. I’ve tried to explain to her that I don’t want to tell her what to do, but I’m just pointing out the fact that I don’t see the point in keeping all these cigarettes.

The thing that really bothers is that the last time she started smoking again for a brief period of time, she instantly said I needed to help her about it. 

So, basically when I try to tell her something in advance she tells me it’s her life and that’s none of my business. But then when she’s in trouble it becomes MY problem and I need to solve it.

What should I do?

Bills, mortgages, divorce, unemployment, responsibilities. I’m so dumb I don’t think I can handle all that. I don’t even know what a W2 is.

Outside of all that I don’t want to be... grown up. I don’t wanna end up as some shallow 30 year old millennial laughing along to buzzfeed articles about “90s kids things.” I don’t wanna be 50 and shitting on all the younger generations. I don’t even wanna be some 25 year old making memes about his own unemployment and social failings. From what I’ve seen with the adults in my life that’s how I’m doomed to be. I don’t want to turn into the very things I hate.

Here’s why despite my best efforts I’m probably gonna fail spectacularly at adulthood:

• Career: I work two jobs which I got only after extensive networking and literally walking into places to hand in my resume. Most people I know just have a job without all the effort. When I need to find an actual job in like a year I don’t think I’ll be able to.

•Basic Life skills: this is the one area I’m good at. I can cook, clean, and stay on top of my school/work schedule. But these are very small things.

•Socially: I have friends but I don’t even know how I made them. Like I can’t remember. Going to college scares me because if I can’t remember how I made my current friends how do I make new ones???

•Being mature: I wear ripped jeans, Love Shane Dawson and Jenna marbles and I get in fights with my parents about curfew and college applications. So I’ll let you decide.

•Romantic life: Nonexistent atm. Probably not gonna change.

All I know is adults keep saying there are no jobs available and our economy is trash. Pop culture confuses me sometimes and I don’t wanna be the type of person who posts about needing an “adultier adult.” I just wanna smoke weed with my husband in our financially comfortable home after a long day at My tolerable job. Also with no student debt. Unfortunately with the way the world works that may never happen. :(",30Jun2018,35

I had been up all night, working on a paper for class, and I was watching the sunrise, enjoying a cigarette after my hard work. I got a call from my 11 year old cousin, which I didn't answer because it was so early. She called again, and then texted saying that it was an emergency so I picked up that time. I'll never forget the words that came out of that sobbing little girl's mouth: ""Daddy died"". I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I didn't understand at first. She told me before anyone else.

46,"I’ve had really bad depression for 11 years, it started in 3rd grade. Initially, I was really sad but as time went by I stopped feeling anything at all. 

For a huge portion of my life I started to “live” through other people. I couldn’t be happy myself but I started to notice that when I was around other people and saw them happy in general (laughing, smiling etc.) I’d get happy. I wasn’t like “happy” but I was happy at the fact that they weren’t depressed? If that makes sense.. 

Anyway, yesterday I was at the gym with someone and in between sets the guy said “hey, want to see a trick?” And I said “yeah go for it” and the dude started doing this thing with dumbbells. He did it, then a second time and he fell so he got up and started doing it again when he was done he said “idk just something I’ve been working on for the past 2 days” (up to this point his back was facing me) he turned around and my dumbass self was smiling so fucking hard lmao. Idk the guy was so happy and energetic and that just made me feel all fuzzy and happy inside.

is it normal that I've spent the last seven month being obsessed with the words ""Khal drogo"" to the point where I keep saying them all the time ?

like, a friend comes up to me and he's like ""hey dude how are you"" and the first fuckiING thing I say back is ""khal drogo"" and then I try to laugh it off and actually answer

like

kkhal drogo has degenerated into a private joke between me and my friends by now, and the only explication to it is ""oh yeah well our friend right here is fucking stupid so he's just obsessed with the way these words sounds and keep saying it all the time""

AND IT'S NOT the first time too ! Years ago I used to be obsessed with the word ""Couscous"" and I would say it all the fucking time too, especially when I'm alone, or when I sing a song I would replace the lyrics by stuff like ""flying couscous under the dome of light"" (I don't know why I make that stuff up)

Surprisingly enough I was a rather popular kid in my High School in which I was known as the master of couscous, yeah it was a weird time but I have a lot of fond memory about it

Important thing is 

what the fuck I think I should seek professional help I mean it's funny but I fear the day I'll be in a serious situation and the only thing that'll come out of my mouth is ""khal drogo is burning through me""

what are your opinions on the matter ?",30Jun2018,3

49,"Sorry for the long post.

So, when I was 15, I was in a “relationship” with a 27 year old. It’s too much to go into how it all started but his mother and my mother pushed me into it (they were best friends at this point) and he never said no. He knew I was 15 and even called me attractive when I was 14! Anyway, things kicked off. I got pushed into the idea in, around, June. We all fell out because his mother thought I was seducing him to get him arrested when the whole thing wasn’t even my idea. Anyway, that was in July. He contacted me again in August and everything happened from there. I loved him. At the time I didn’t go to school because of my neglectful mother so I had no friends. Nobody for my own. But he knew that. Took advantage.

Anyway, this “relationship” went on in secret for 6 months. He’d force me to sneak out to his house at night otherwise he’d tell my parents on me. I got caught at his once, and because of the entire argument, my mother hated him so she wasn’t impressed. Instead of facing my mother, etc. he talked me into jumping out of his bedroom window because the lights were on downstairs so they may have seen me in the silhouettes of his curtains seeing as we lived close enough to see his house out of his window. I sat up there and looked down and changed my mind. He didn’t approve. He shoved me out of his upstairs bedroom window. I fell a long way. Suffered quite a few injuries, obviously. But I told my mother it was my idea to jump so she wouldn’t know I was there. Whether she believed me or not, that’s what was told to the hospital when I went. Of course, social services got involved but they never did much and were gone without a few weeks. I never wanted to get him in trouble. I thought he was doing it for the sake of my safety. 

I couldn’t sneak out for a few weeks because I’d cracked my tibia so badly, it killed to walk. I spent most of my time in my bedroom. We lived in a bungalow at the time so he could easily access my bedroom window. Once, I fell to sleep at around 11 without telling him and he called me 52 times and send over 130 texts. He turned up at my window, banging so loudly. I got up to open it and found out it wasn’t even the first time he’d been outside that night. 5 times before, apparently. This was where I started becoming more and more inquisitive about who I actually loved.

I started sneaking out again and unfortunately, bad things happened. He forced me into things that I was not ready for. I was still 15 and he’d tried talking me into it before but I guess this time he’d just had enough of waiting. I kept going back. I don’t know why. He never looked at it as rape, just thought it was okay. I tried telling him I was asexual, so I wasn’t interested in sex anymore but he never listened. I got pregnant at the end of September and lost the baby in October.

I didn’t even know I was miscarrying until the 3rd week of bleeding. I couldn’t tell anyone and I just had to cope. I told him that it should never have happened and he was acting so sad because he’d “lost his baby”. He bought me pills which I never took because I started to lose trust in him and had no clue what I could’ve been feeding into my body. I started to think “if I can’t even take pills my boyfriend gave me, who am I in a relationship with?”

Nothing happened after the pregnancy scare. I still snuck out to his house as his blackmails became more vicious. “I’ll tell your mum you begged for it”, he knew he was losing me.

November was the last time I snuck out to see him as he’d become homeless. He’d told his friends he was seeing this 19-year-old with the same name as me. Just after Christmas, his mum mentioned me to them once to slag me off and they put two and two together and came up with him being a peadophile. They set fire to his legs in his own house and told him to leave or they’ll be calling the police.

He was homeless all the way through January. This is where I was just tired of him. He always laid his problems on me. Always took everything out on me. Those guys setting his legs alight was because of me, apparently. I had to do everything for him. Make phone calls, find him somewhere to stay. I was 15. I didn’t need this. Mid-January I told him I was leaving. It was night time so I said to him that we’d call in the morning when I was taking my sisters to school. 

I called him and he was just screaming and crying down the phone. I was strong. I just kept repeating “shut up” in the coldest manner. But he deserved it. I hung up on him, thinking “yes, that’s gonna teach him”. But now. He just came back stronger. Threatening to kill himself and call the police before he does, telling them it was all my fault and I pushed him to it. He said he’d ruin my family’s life. I was forced to get back with him. He said he was slitting his wrists and everything and I couldn’t deal with it. He called me the morning that we got back together, and I was crying because I didn’t want to be with him.  He said “if you do that to me again then I’ll have to go to the police on myself, because I’ve done something bad” so he knew what he’d done.

He offered to come see me outside of my sisters school when I was picking them up. In fact, he insisted and I knew that this is where it had to end. I couldn’t see him. I was terrified. Too much to see him. He disgusted me. I told him again that it was done. He kicked off again. He told me he had terminal cancer. He’d disappear for days and then come back with a new number. He said that he was going to end and ruin my life, etc. Started using my insecurities again me. Called me 32 times on an unknown number at 4am. I’d block him and he’d just get a new number.

This abuse went on for 4 months. Over my 16th birthday. My birthday was in May and by July I’d moved out. 170 miles away. I was safe. I finally got away from him. I haven’t heard from him in a while. He’s stopped posting about me on social media. I was glad. I was starting to think that the only way out is suicide but I was better when he’d gone.

Anyway, it’s October 2017 and I’m talking to a boy called Callum seeing as I started school again when I moved out. We’d known eachother since we were 14 but he’d built up a reputation. As I’d experienced before, when I was 14. He built a trust up in me but I’d always be so scared he was cheating. Of course, we were never official. We were supposed to meet on a Tuesday night but he’d “hurt his leg” and invited me to his house the next morning. I went and realised the cancelling was a ploy to get me to go to his house where we’d be alone. We had sex. He wasn’t my first since the older guy. I kind of started throwing myself in to uncommitted sex. It was a mess but I liked this guy. Anyway, after that he started arguing with me all the time. Disappearing all day. Turns out he was fucking my best friend and had been before we even started talking again. I was devastated but whatever. I was sick of his crap. I started talking to someone else in December and we became official in January.

It’s been almost 6 months and I can’t let any of this go. He’s fine. He’s a good boyfriend. He loves me and I love him so much. Breaking up isn’t an option so don’t even bother telling me to end it with this guy because I won’t. I want to better myself and move on. I’ve had a counsellor for 6 months but it doesn’t seem to be helping my emotional state at all. I’m so sad. I don’t know what’s wrong and I feel like it’s ruining my side of the relationship. I don’t know what to do with myself and I can’t tell my boyfriend any of this because I don’t want to seem crazy.

He took 6 months to add me on Facebook even though it’s something that bothered me. In my generation, it’s a must and if your boyfriend doesn’t have you on social media then what is he hiding? He added me last week and yesterday night it came up that he’d added his exes new account after a week of her having it. I’m so upset by this. I don’t even think he’s cheating but I’m just a mess and I don’t know how to feel about it. I don’t want to seem like a psychopath so I can’t tell him how I feel about it. Even though he’d be very happy to voice his opinion if it was the other way around. I guess we’re just different people. How can I better myself and stop getting upset over insignificant things caused by issues I’ve had in the past? How do I stop being so anxious and worrying about everything?

55,"Tl;dr: I \[M25\] woke up today and realized I have no goals in life and what goals I've had in the past have completely fallen through for one reason or another. I feel like my options are running out and that I don't know what to do next, but I just want to experience the drive to do something. Anyone else been here before? How did you carry on and find something that makes you feel motivated and not constantly borderline depressed?

And it's not that I don't want to have goals and be driven toward something. But at this point in my life, I just don't gravitate toward anything. And anything I did gravitate toward in the past just didn't pan out.

I've had goals in the past. For example:

* I wanted to go to med school, but I got burnt out trying to complete the prereqs + my major and two minors
* I subsequently wanted to become a nurse anesthetist and entered nursing school, but the cutthroatness pushed me over the edge and produced some pretty severe panic attacks
* I thought I wanted to get my PhD in political science (my undergrad major), but turns out I really suck at political science/theory and don't have any kind of passion for it at all; my PhD was also a toxic environment, which caused one student to commit suicide in our building at school and my abusive mentor caused my panic attacks to resurface, which I've been treated for for a few months now

So I've been out of my PhD since February (took a medical leave to get treated for the panic attacks), basically sitting around and doing nothing because I was still being paid by my PhD and couldn't have any outside employment as a condition of that, so I've basically just been sitting at home. I just don't know where to turn next. I just want to be something and feel driven to do something so bad, but nothing so far has worked out, and I don't know what options I have left or where I can turn next, or what to do.

Has anyone else ever experienced something like this? I'm just sick of feeling like I now have nothing in my life that's worth working toward. Like it's not at ""my life isn't worth living"" territory or anything, but my thoughts do venture sometimes in that general direction.",30Jun2018,1
56,"So this happened about 3 hours ago and the trauma is still very fresh, and I have no one else irl I would dare tell this to. But I have to tell someone, so this is a throwaway for very obvious reasons. I really need to get this off my chest. Here we go.

The morning started off not so great. I woke up earlier than I would like around 6am, (Im unemployed at the moment so I'm usually not up until noon) and I was having pretty bad cramps due to it being ""that time of the month"". So I accept that I'm not going to be able to get anymore sleep with this pain so I decide to get up and take some Midol and stay up and browse reddit till the pain subsidies. Well about an hour goes by, I'm still in pain and It's now time for my husband to get up and ready for work. His alarm goes off and he rolls over to ask me if I'm okay and I tell him ""Yeah, I have a bit of cramping is all. No big deal."" 
He carries on about his morning, and I'm still chilling in bed until it hits me. This isn't JUST my uterus torturing my body for not being pregnant, I also begin to feel my gut bubble up like I just chased 40 laxitives with some mentos and coke. I know this feeling all to well. It's period shits.
Now I'm not alone on this, a lot of you ladies know what I'm talking about. Aunt Flo and diarrhea go hand in hand. But I didnt have to go immediately, my stomach felt like it was brewing up something special. So. I'm laying in bed, just praying my husband will hurry up and leave for work cause I love this man to much for him to witness what my bowels are soon to unleash. He's taking his time, and I'm getting a bit squirmy, but overall I'm doing good masking that I'm planning to repaint the bathroom soon. And then FINALLY he kisses me goodbye and leaves for work. Now let me tell you the second that front door shut I jumped up and locked it, (assuring he doesnt return too soon and see something he'd regret) and headed for the toilet. 
So here's where things start getting interesting. I have a cat (bless his heart) who I stay home and hang out with most of the day. We do just about everything together, take naps, watch t.v, eat snacks, and yes he even watches me while I go to the bathroom. So I'm doin my thing and massacuring this poor toilet and as per usual my cat is chillin in the doorway watching me. I start to finish up and he moves his way onto the side of the tub right next to me (pretty small bathroom). As I get up to flush I take a minute to admire what I've just done to this bowl before flushing. It's pretty disgusting, cause its not just a shit, but a period shit. So theres a fair amount of blood in there as well. I start to reach for the handle to flush this monstrosity that once harbored my insides, when my cat (who's still on the ledge of the tub next to me) decides he wants a closer look at whats in the toilet before we say goodbye. He leans back and fucking jumps directly into the bowl as I'm flushing it. 

Yeah. I know.

What happens next i remeber vividly as it all seemed to happen in slow motion. I see him take the leap, I reach to slap him out of the way but it's far to late. I miss, Im helpless at this point and all I can do is let out a faint ""oh no.""
He lands in the bowl of spinning blood, loose stool, and toilet paper, and soon begins to realize his mistake. He is face in but quickly turns up and claws his way out. At this point the only thing I can get out of my mouth is ""ohfuckohfuckohfuckohfuck"". He flies out of the bowl, drenched in my secretions and pieces of toilet paper. He's mortified (as am I) so he sprints away into the living room, onto the couch and into the kitchen. I snap out of my ""oh fuck"" loop and run to the kitchen, leaping, to avoiding the blood and shit tracks in the carpet on the way. I see the trail ends at a cracked open cabinet, I, as calmly as I could, tried to call him out. No response. Im going to have to go in after him. I bend down to open the cabinet and he takes off and out back to the living room. I reached for him but it was very similar to catching a greased up pig. He slipped through my hands now leaving me also covered in bloody shit. I run back to the living room, no longer avoiding the carpet tracks, as im far to determined to notice at this point. I see he's gone to one of his favorite hiding spots, inside of our couch. I, fed up and ready to end this nightmare, decide I'm going to close all the doors leading to other rooms in the house (contaminating all the handles), flip the couch, and corner this bitch. I flip the couch, he runs, only to see he has no where to go. He looks me in the eyes, and accepts defeat. He lets me grab him and take him to the bathroom, back where this mess all begin, and I finally put an end to it by bathing him. I shut the bathroom door, put him in the tub and scrub him down. He of course being a cat in a bath, resists and begins clawing at me. At this point I dont even care. I just want to get this shit over with. (Literally) 

So the story ends with where I'm currently at now, trying to make sure I've cleaned every bit of blood, shit, toilet paper, sweat, and tears, that I can before my husband gets home from work in a few hours.

Welp, thats it. Thats how I fucked up, reddit. Hopefully this story brightens your day knowing it didnt happen to you.

TL;DR - My cat fell into the toilet after I used it and ran around the house, destroying everything in sight.

UPDATE: After this series of unfortunate events unfolded and I covered my tracks, my husband came home from work later that day. I must have gotten rid of the scent fairly well because he hadn't noticed anything out of the ordinary. I was in the clear...so I thought. Well he gets home, takes his shoes off after a hard days work, and sits back on the couch to relax. Everything is seemingly fine as we sit and watch television together. Until he gets up to go to the kitchen to grab a soda and I notice something on his arm. Then I suddenly realized what I was looking at. It's shit. My shit. My shit is on his arm. How? How could I let this happen? I was so careful, I made sure every inch of this apartment was spotless and just the way he had left it. I'm fucking mortified. Theres no way in hell I want to tell him what happened today, ESPECIALLY since I didnt tell him first thing when he got home. I've waited so long it would just be obvious that I was hiding it at this point. Maybe I just dont tell him? No, that'd be wrong. I cant let the dude walk around with my shit on him. What do I do? I come to the conclusion that it'd be best to tell him theres something on his arm, but play it off like I dont know what it is. Yeah, that'll work. Then everything will be fine and we'll live happily ever after. Ha. Fuck was I wrong. I follow him to the kitchen and play it off like I just happened to notice something on him. I say ""oh looks like you got somethin' on you, here I got it."" I reach for the paper towels, tear one off and wipe the shit off his arm. Smooth. All according to plan. Now I just gotta walk over to the garbage can and throw it away and it'll all be over. He stops me before I can turn away from him, ""Oh man what is that?"" He says to me. I look at it and play dumb, ""I couldnt tell you, maybe dirt from work?"" He says ""Nah that doesnt really look like dirt"" Then I honestly just couldnt take it anymore, I broke. ""Okay, okay. I know what it is. Its shit. My shit."" At first he laughs. I don't. He sees I'm being serious and begins to look at me with the most confused/concerned/ horrified look that I have ever seen. ""W...what do you mean?"" I start to tell him the story of my horribly fucked up day, and initially he was upset that I hadn't told him. But at the same time he kind of understood why I'd wanna keep it secret. He also said that having to deal with that situation alone was probably punishment enough. After we settled everything we had a pretty good laugh about it later on that night after he helped me make 110% sure I had gotten all the shit and blood cleaned up. I'm so glad he took it well and thought it was funny. I'm very lucky to have him.

58,"I can't post about it publicly, apart from my brothers, mother, and I and a few of my close friends nobody really knows. He was estranged from most of his family, including a half sister I've never met, but... yeah. 

It wasn't entirely unexpected, but still a surprise. He had just turned 92, and a month ago was driving 90 MPH through the Appalachia. He had a number of health issues though, and a couple of weeks ago he was admitted to the hospital because of issues with breathing and retaining fluid in his chest. He was at first optimistic, despite not feeling well. Part of what was wrong is he had a rare auto immune disorder that caused muscle weakness which there's no cure for. He was still getting around more or less ok without a walker, but at the hospital there was sudden progression, and he was mostly bedridden. One thing would get treated and we'd see improvement only to have something else get worse. 

The decline happened pretty quickly. He remained aware and pretty much himself, but started to become forgetful. He on oxygen but because he'd breathe mostly through his mouth he'd become confused as to what he needed to do, like get up and change into his pajamas or go to work. My family had several meetings, first we talked about rehab, and then the conversations turned into hospice. My dad was always extremely independent. He lived alone states away, preferring as he put it to live like a hermit. This always worried me. 

This brings me to a lot of mixed feelings I have yet to sort. We disagreed on many things, some extremely (mostly about politics and social issues), and because he cut out his brothers and his family from his life before I was born for what I personally think are minor issues (probably the tip on what his feelings were) and later when he cut out his first daughter when she sided with his ex wife who he left to marry my mom... I was always aware that if I told him the entirety of who I was, who my friends were, the things that interest me, that I would risk being cut out of his life too.  I'm the black sheep you see. Nothing I get on to I personally believe is shameful  but my conservative family, especially my dad would have issues about me leaving the church and hanging with gays and 'cultural degenerates'. Unlike the half sister who would fight with him regarding their disagreements, I lived by omission. To accomplish what I wanted and to live life the way I needed, I had to hold him at a bit of a distance. As his daughter I was held to certain old school beliefs about how ladies should behave, which I can't abide no matter how much I love the man.  So when college began so did the distance. 

The marriage between my parents failed for similar reasons (my mom needed friends and a life outside of their relationship and my dad saw love as 'us against the world'), and the head butting I experienced my brothers did too but in different ways. The long story short is for the last 14 years or so he's been living mostly alone. His only people in his life were people he hired to work for him. He never stoped working even after he retired. He ran his own business for over 50 years, later wrote a book, traveled the world from the Galapagos to Nigeria &amp; was always the oldest in any tour group he signed up for. His last trip was about a year and a half ago I think when he took a tour down the Danube and spent time in Budapest. But he never had anyone that was close to him. He grew up poor, had to work at a boarding house his mother owned after his father died when he was 11, and never really learned to make friends, real close friends. He graduated highschool when he was 16 and then lied about his age to enter the last six months of WWII as a merchant marine in the south pacific (he saw no action). Then off to college and off to work... which he loved. But still, he never got what I would call close to anyone. 

The last week I spent as much time with him that I could. I'm having major house issues that I'm trying to take care of (my water heater started leaking) as well as work. I spent the evenings with him watching him get weaker. He stopped eating more than a couple bites of soft food a day. Swallowing became difficult. Last night I spoon fed him some soup, just as he once fed me. He tried to drink water a little too fast and I reminded him something he says to me whenever I get frustrated over a big task, 'How do you eat an elephant?' (one bite at a time). He smiled weakly. 

I stayed around to make sure his breathing treatment was ok and he was settled in. I had to leave, to take care of my house, to get ready to call the repair man in the morning. He didn't want me to leave. He said in a small voice ""I'm lonely"". I told him he was going to be ok and that I loved him and my brother will be by early in the morning. 

A few hours in the middle of the night I got the call, and rushed back to find he had stopped breathing. I was there right when he passed with my younger brother and my mom (they had become amenable  later on, but he always regretted the relationship ending). 

There are many things I wish that were different, but I also feel like I have no control over how things went or could have been. I'm happy he had a life fuller than most, he has done things, created things, been places most couldn't dream of over decades, but also... I'm sad he was lonely. I'm sad that I may have contributed to that. I'm sad he pushed people away. 

What I can tell you that for me, the 6 yr old inside me, he was a titan. Someone who always saw the potential in things, who wanted to build, make the world better. Despite our disagreements he always believed in me, even when I faltered. Even when he faltered, a business went south or a deal didn't work, he would always try again. He never let failure or regret stop him. He knew, with tenacity, curiosity, a sense of adventure, and diligence that great things can be possible. If I could take that and bottle it I'd give it to everyone for free. 

I wouldn't be who I am without him.

59,"My best friend and I met last fall when high school started. Her parents own this huge summer home on the lake and that's where we're at now. Her parents invited me and my parents to spend the weekend here for an early 4th of July celebration.

We arrived yesterday afternoon. Me, my friend, and her little brother spent the first couple hours fishing on the pier that stretches out into the lake from their backyard. We went inside afterward and her brother then showed us a pair of handcuffs his uncle had given him as a birthday present. He'd left them behind the last time they were out here. My friend and I took them and decided to handcuff ourselves together as a joke. Only problem was her brother then realized he didn't remember where he'd put the keys last.

We searched the house but couldn't find them. Finally he remembered that they were in his room back home, four hours away. Her parents and my parents got a huge laugh out of this. They told us there's no locksmith nearby and since these aren't police cuffs, we can't call them for help. Our only real options, they said, were to either cut them off or leave us stuck together. They said since it was our own fault for putting them on without finding the key first, it wouldn't be right to destroy her brother's gift. So we've been stuck together since then.

We're all leaving Sunday, so we'll get uncuffed when we get back home tomorrow night. Till then, they're leaving us like this.

I know it wasn't smart to go putting them on without finding the key first, but isn't this over the top? I mean, we'd both be willing to chip in to buy him a new pair of handcuffs.",30Jun2018,1

As the title says, I’ve been struggling for a long time with my mental health but due to the stigma and how I’ve lived in an environment where it isn’t taken seriously, I’ve always been too scared to seek help. 
I’ve been in denial over even having issues due to the fact that I don’t want to be seen as lesser or have something wrong with me. I know this is just the stigma talking but it’s hard not to think like that after having grown up your whole life surrounded by those ideas.
I’m in college now and it’s been really taking a toll on me, the past few years of high school were the worst yet and on many occasions I’ve contemplated suicide but haven’t made any serious attempts. I visited my college counsellor last term about being stressed and the entire time felt uncomfortable with the whole ordeal. I’m not one to trust easily and I’ve never been good at communicating my feelings. I just don’t want to burden anyone with my problems or have anyone know and judge me for it.
Since the start of the summer I’ve been feeling even worse and the reason I’m posting this is that I had a fight with my younger sister earlier. I tried to offer her some help with her homework and she got angry and asked me why I was even bothering when the last time she asked me for help I blew her off. Hearing that made me feel awful especially considering that that time I was really not in the headspace to interact with anyone. I’m seeing that my mental health is beginning to affect not just me and it makes me feel even more useless I just don’t know what to do anymore. I want to ask for help but I’m so scared and I don’t want anything I say to a therapist to affect me further down the line in my career or anything else.",30Jun2018,2
63,"Hey. So I’m a 19 year old male just entering my second year of college. I’m really self-conscious about my appearance. I dated a few people briefly in high school and had a serious relationship before I left for college, but at college, I couldn’t get anyone interested in me. I got rejected a good bit as almost all my friends found steady girlfriends. It’s gotten me really down and worried there’s something wrong with me that I haven’t started a relationship at college. People say this is the easiest time of your life to date but I’m not seeing it. I fear this is because I’m unattractive. What do I do to alleviate this fear, and how do I know if it’s justified?",30Jun2018,3
64,"I can’t find a reason to leave my house if I don’t have an actual reason for stepping out (like work, school, or to see my bf)

Now you’re probably asking, “Don’t you have a hobby that you go out to do?” Yes, I take photos. This is probably going to sound like a terrible excuse but I can’t muster up the desire to take photos in my town? It’s not ugly or anything, I just have no interest in much around here. I live near Chicago so I can just hop on the train and shoot in and around the city. I’ve done it before, this winter/spring when I HAD to get photography assignments done for class. I wish it had someone to accompany me while I take photos. Today, I got stood up by someone I was supposed to take pictures of. We made the plans and everything and they just stopped replying. I was looking forward to it because I made the effort to reach out to them (something I had to push myself really hard to) and thought “woah, I finally went out of my comfort zone.”

I don’t have a car so I can’t drive to places like I want. Also, I don’t have any TRUE friends AT ALL  who are down to chill out with me. I’m currently sitting on my sofa with my camera wondering when I’ll finally step out lmao.

How do other photographers break that social anxiety and just do what they want? When will I stop caring and just FUFILL MY ARTISTIC DESIRES IN ME? ",30Jun2018,0
65,So I have really bad anxiety but music helps ground me and calm me back down. I normally hate even small crowds but I can’t help but to keep almost buying these concert tickets. I just can’t seem to hit the purchase button. Side note: it’s a five finger death punch/breaking Benjamin show. I abso-fucking-lutely love both of them. Their music just connects with me. So reddit should I buy the damn tickets? What if I can’t get the nerve to go. I can’t really afford to waste tickets. I’ve never been to a concert before and will be going with my boyfriend(who has been to countless concerts.),30Jun2018,2
