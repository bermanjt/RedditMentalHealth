I would like to believe in some sort of afterlife, (I have tried a religion once,) but it just makes me feel like i shouldn't neglect that i will die and there will be nothing afterwards. Pure emptiness. No feelings. No thoughts. Absolutely nothing. Not even knowing that there is nothing. And that makes me terrified. This feels stupid but still. help. plz.",28Jul2018,2

2,"I've always heard people say, anyone can be a father but it takes a real man to be a daddy. Same thing goes for women. Anyone can be a mother. I'm working on being ""mommy"" again.

I have been lurking this sub for a long time, trying to build up courage to post here. I need to get some things off my chest. 

I (31f) have three kids. My two youngest live with me. My oldest (10) lives with his dad.  I have been trying to change that for a long time. Sons father doesn't want me around until I can give him money and I can't. We have a custody aqw a person and an even worse mother. I was addicted to pain pills and I just didn't care about anything or anyone.

2012, I went away and got clean. Been opiate free since then. Sons father said he will decide when and if I can see my son. I didn't have resources or any way to argue so I conceded. Ever since then, he dictates everything. He doesn't like my husband so he makes seeing my son hell. He will tell me I can come only by myself, one hour at a time, son cant leave with me, and i cant take him anywhere. Let me just say, he is justified for not liking my husband. 

In 2014, sons father got into it with my husband. My husband said some horrible things about him and about my son, who is autistic. Husband was hammered, no excuse is good enough though. 

Sons father blocked me, moved, changed numbers, moved again. I finally got fed up (should have been long ago) and we have a court date in September. Hopefully things work out. 

i just wanted to vent. This stuff gets pretty overwhelming and I feel so alone.

3,"I'm in such a shit mood right now. Like fucking mad at the world but mostly mad at myswlf.



I'm mad at the world and how ugly and aloof people are/how hard it is to find like minded people in this world. I'm mad at the fact that it is so much more harder to find true friends after high school. 

I hate to say it but I really fucking wish I was back in high school again. It really did seem like these were the best times of my life, but god was I immature. I wish I was like the people that were surrounding me my 10th grade year. They were so fucking smart its unbelievable that I didn't grow new habits off them. I could have been in a more impressive state then I am right now. Instead I tried to emulate what I think this dumb dude would like and before I even began to realize the dude that was right in front of me was more of the person I should have taken ""inspiration"" from (of course this is all in the frame and thought process of teenagers mind who hasn't realized the true meaning of being you for you is) it was too late. I was in too deep of a depression and now unknowingly stuck in a 5 year rut of not learning anything at all. If I just listened more to the dude who was ambitious and talked about things that mattered and was less focus on the dude who all he wants to do is smoke and play mk, I would have at least been a cool depressed person that had existential crises instead of a cringey depressed person crying over a fucking boy. (Not glorifying depression but it was an inevitable outcome to other life events, maybe I could have been more stronger is what I'm saying.)



I wish I stayed smarter. No I wish I've always been obviously much more smarter then the average person. I wish when I was 17 I knew what emotional intelligence was or being aware enough and conscious enough to a point of pure maturity. I wish I fed my mind with books. I wish I could have taken school a little more seriously. Maybe I wouldn't have to go back to 5th grade math to start like I am right now. I wish I would have balanced myself more and maybe if that were to all happen, I would have been in an impressive state where I'm not living in my parents house, have a reliable car and a great career at the age of fucking 21. 




But no. Here the fuck I am sitting at home, dumb as a log, unemployed, have not had a stable friendship in 2 years plus no friends at all, no skills, no motivation to improve and I have to pick up my fucking sister from her band practice because shes a fucking dweeb and I just really hate that this task exists right now I really do not want to fucking do it. 



What do I want? To be fucking brilliant. I want to be smarter then the average person. I want an awesome job that pays well because I have the skill level to do so. I want to be out with my friends and SO, who all bring out the best in me and I bring out the best in them, laughing our asses off and having the best time of our lives together right now instead of getting ready to pick up my fucking sister from the school I use to attend 2 years ago. I want to feel loved and appreciated and adequate and respected. 



Td;dr plus disclaimer: the world owes me nothing and I am livid that this is the way it is. I'm mad that life is hard and every actions leads to the results of your future. I'm being a fucking brat about being my sisters taxi driver at 21, with no friends and no skills and I'm as dumb as a log. I'm filled with so much regret because I originally had great smart people in my life in high school and they had the  decency and self respect to not associate with a cringy person who is not smart like me. Yes I'm going to do something about it but it's just so fucking lonely. I want friends but I'm so insecure.",28Jul2018,14

I first joined Reddit during what I thought was the “worst” time of my life in April 2017 because I had basically no connection to the outside world besides my laptop. Things got better, I got out, and didn’t come back until everything blew up in my face again, in may 2018, into what is/was the actual worst time of my life, 10x worse than anything I could have imagined a year ago. Sounds like some cried wolf bullshit but every single second of every day was absolutely unbearable and agonizing to a level I can’t even begin to explain. I spend lots and lots of time on here every day and I feel like I would be very empty and probably more sad because it makes up about 60% of my “distract yourself from everything bad” free time of every day. It’s gotten better but things are still very bad but I’m more like myself, and just a little less consumed, for better or for worse. Love all yall. Thanks for being there.",28Jul2018,84

10,"Hi! I'm just normal student from Jeju island in South korea. (So my english is not that good, I hope you understand) 
And well, I never thought about deeply about refugees before Yemen refugees came to Jeju island. 

( If you don't know about this issue, this can help you:

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/12/refugees-from-yemen-divides-south-korean-resort-island-of-jeju   )

But I watched many time news and There were bad news about them(refugees who are muslim) like terror or rape or something like that. And I guess that many koreans have prejudge about them, because we are too far away, so Media is most popular way that we can know about them.  But I have known all Muslim or Refugee are violent, just a few like society. But yes... I know it's shame on me, but honestly sometime I'm scared about that. And if there are some terror cases in news, unconsciously I thought about Muslim..
Anyway when I heard they came here, I was surprised, because I never imagined that.

Well,,, and  Now many Koreans are confused. I mean they are really hate that and scared. And Jeju is very small and conservative. I saw sometime that Some People in here even hate people who come from other area in south korea. And when media in korea write about refugee, there are so many negative comment like ""They are always demanding""or "" why we have to care about them, we are also not stable. There are already so many people who need help in here, we can't afford to take care of them,""or ""they will rape korean women and will make korea to muslim country"" or something like that. Even most people around me hate them. they claimed that ""they are fake refugee. They are young and health, and they just come here to make money... "" I'm just ... it's really difficult. I mean I understand why they think like that, and it's kind of true that we are not ready to take them. but I feel something like Uncomfortable too.  Because we don't know about refugees life. And we also can be refugees.. frankly now I'm scared that talk about this issue with friends. Because their opinion are alike(negative). (But of course, there were person who think we have to take them, but only a few) So I just want to read others opinion about it to build my own view. I don't want to see this issue very emotional, but I also don't want to have extreme thought about it. I'm just want to see this issue as it is. And want to know others thought as many as possible.

sorry for long writing. And if there are some uncomfortable words to you, I'm so sorry. I don't have any intention to hurt someone's feeling.  Thank you for reading :)

My father fought for custody of me and won.  He is my savior.

Desipite living with my father, I still watched my mother get the shit beat out of her multiple times by her following two husband's.

I nearly died when I was 12 from a bicycle accident.  Brain surgery saved me.

My mother committed suicide when I was 17.

By the time I was 19, I had dropped out of high school, been married, had my first child, and divorced.  

At the age of 23 I fought for custody of my child and won.

My second beautiful child was born when I was 25.

My first born child developed a rare form of leukemia and passed away due to complications from treatment when I was 28.

I lost my shit and left my second born's mama.  Went on a tear for a year entrenched in alcohol.

Met the woman of my dreams.

Made three more beautiful babies with her

In the midst of all of this, continued to advance my career despite all obstacles (lack of education(GED))

Love spending time with all four of my living children and wife.

Until this day, live a happy and successful life with all of them.

I am so incredibly thankful for the life I still have with my loved ones.  The items on the list of things I could change, is short, but those few items are huge.

I don't even know why I am writing this.  I guess, hopefully someone who is in tough times right now, reads this and realizes there is hope.

17,"Hey guys. I’m not even sure where to start and I’m not looking for sympathy or anything really but just somewhere to vent, maybe a friend to talk to.

I’m a 22 yo female college student about to go into my last semester of school for studio art methods. I used to be so excited about the future and stoked to be an adult and start my life but a few really shitty situations are keeping me from feeling like I can do that. I have paid my way through school with no help from either of my parents (neither of which have gone to college or support my dream as a muralist) by constantly working multiple jobs dogsitting, serving, bar tending, etc. I’d love to find something in my field and I have even commissioned a couple murals for family friends but I can’t find anything permanent that will support me like serving or bartending. I have no friends as all my highschool friends moved away from the area and I work too much to develop new friendships, no significant other, and although I live with my family, I’m working so often and our relationship is so strained that we’re basically just roommates. 
 
Recently, things have just been really really hard. My tuition for my last semester completely wiped out my savings account a couple weeks ago because I have to take six classes to graduate and I can’t afford another semester. Just when I finally got my cushion saved up again, my car broke down, needing a new alternator which cost me 500$ and completely broke me a whole week before payday. My family doesn’t keep much food in the house besides condiments and usually go out while I’m gone at work. I have no money and I haven’t eaten since breakfast yesterday when my boss brought donuts to work for the vps birthday. I’m stranded until my family gets back from vacation (Sunday) and I’ve been eating peanut butter and plain noodles to try and fill my stomach until I get paid next week and can go grocery shopping again. 

I realize how fucking pathetic this all sounds but I just have nowhere to turn or anyone to talk to. I already struggle with depression and anxiety and this constant state of uncertainty and financial hardship is really starting to get to me. I know that so many people have so much less than me, don’t get me wrong. I’m absolutely grateful to have a roof over my head and a job and a car that (usually) works. But I feel like I’m running myself ragged with balancing 3 jobs and school and this fucking crushing loneliness. I’ve considered ending it a couple times recently, because I can’t see the point anymore of all this suffering and constant back breaking work with no rest. I’m always exhausted, always hungry and always completely busy and stressed. I’m not sure what to do anymore. I’d appreciate any advice. Thank you guys for reading/listening.

TL/DR: I’m broke and hungry and stressed and at the end of my rope. Friends?",28Jul2018,1

While today I have encountered many awful customers. I thought I would share some with you today. My first story of they day starts with a lady returning blinds she had ordered from us. Pretty easy deal she brought four but decided to only use two. I check her recipient and look up the order on the computer. Check the boxes for the correct numbers that match on the computer. I return them to her no issue at all. But she than gets upset saying I never returned her the full amount. I write down the math and show her that I am indeed returning her the correct amount. She then claims I’m trying to steal her money. She than creates a scene causing and line of unhappy people be hide her. I call my manger and he does the exact thing I do and it still comes up to the same total. She still claims that isn’t right and that I am trying to rip her off. My manger takes out his phone and calculates it out and it still comes up with the same amount. She still doesn’t believe it until she takes her own phone out and does the math. She gets the same total I was giving her. She takes her money with a sour face and finally leaves. Now this next lady it’s kinda sad. My retail store offers a credit card which you can make payments at the store. This lady comes to me trying to find her card or bill statement to make this payment that’s due today. She then breaks down in tears and tells me her past week someone has hacked her bank leaving her little to no money. Her sister has gone missing for 3 days and this morning she found her daughter dead in the river be hide her house. Her daughter has been missing for ten years. I held her hand as she cried and walked her to her car. Just when I think I have a bad day someone else may be having the worse day of their life’s.

So was doing the do today with boyfriend and I was on top because he’s been working out a lot recently to get in shape and is too sore to support himself. I’ve got like no arm strength so after a while I usually wind up flat on top of him, chest-to-chest and that’s fine.
This particular time, my hip decided to wait until I was orgasming to fuck up and I had a bad time of it halfway through. Poor boyfriend thought it was his fault til I told him what happened.
Needed somewhere to talk about this because I’m kinda salty about it.

Tldr; hip popped out of place during orgasm and boyfriend thought he broke me",28Jul2018,1

45,"So ive been struggling with depression for many years after a attempting suicide 3 years ago I've never felt the urge to try again but the depression has stuck. The crying, the numbness, feeling like no one loves you or cares about you. Last my grandmother passed away who i was very close with, that hurt my heart but my girlfriend was there at the time and she was constantly taking care of me. A week after that a girl i went to high school with had a brain aneurysm and became brain dead, this girl was terrible to me in high school, i hated her. Her parents are angels, nicest people i have ever met and they loved me. But once this girl graduated she fought with her parents and moved out, she then moved to my town and lived with the local meth and heroine dealer. I knew who and where she was. I knew what she was doing and I would just make jokes or fun of her with my buddies. She eventually got kicked out and was sleeping on benches at the library or in the slide at my local park when it snowed. I knew all this was happening and I just laughed about it. I apparently was the first one to show up to the hospital when I heard the news. Her parents asked that i came to see her. I stayed there for 19 hours and drove her father around to get things in order for their other children. All the while he just spoke about how thankful he was and she was to have a friend like me. I couldn't tell him all the terrible things i had done. Maybe i could have prevented this. Ever since then I just falling more and more in the depression I feel guilty for all the things I did and it just haunts me now and I can't get it out of my mind I could have stopped it I feel terrible for it and this past year I've been continuously dealing with it, it would get worse and better but my girlfriend was there for me, i would get upset with her and not feel like talking because of the way I felt. But i loved her, i truly loved her and everything about her. She was always making sure i was eating and getting sleep and taking care of myself. We we're together for two years but i thought we were doing great, to her we weren't i was listening to her enough and treating her right, I wasn't talking enough, i wanted to come see her all the time and she wanted me to work longer hours so we could support each soon. She wanted to go on a break for a week and see, she said we won't break up she just needs time. So we did, she said don't text me or call me okay. And I didn't. She called me a couple days in and said it seemed like i didnt care about us or her, but i did, I said i was doing What she asked. She called me later that day saying to come by to talk, she said don't worry I'm not breaking up with you or anything. But she was. When i get there she jumped in my car said we were breaking up and i lost it. I broke down I just started bawling and saying no ill fix things. We talked and so on, she seemed like she was calm about it but she still seemed like to she wanted to get back together. So we broke up, i kept messaging her that week after and she said maybe after a month or two we'll back together if you act right. So I did, I was working almost 70 hour weeks, I got a higher, better paying position at work. Id had been wanting to talk to her for months, my friends kept trying to set me up with people but it felt wrong, but I went to a concert with one and a date with another but that was it. July rolled around and a friend of mine passed away from a medical issue, and another friend was there at the time and he felt guilty and that he should have helped so he took his life this week. And this about the time when i first met my ex girlfriend so thanks to Facebook memories start popping up and i see shes also traveling with her family and she never liked vacations and i saw her smiling and having a great time, so I thought now or never. I'm doing great at work, about to get a new vehicle. She'll see I fixed everything. So i message this long message about how I truly feel, about how much i love her and her family and wishing i would have fixed things. She just messaged me back with a simple text but it hurt. To be with someone through thick and thing and love everything about them to just get a text like ""I'm talking to someone and I'm very happy. There will not be a future for us ever again"" I understand. I want her to be happy more than anything, but just to see that hurt. I said i was happy for her i wish her the best and thanking her for everything and all the good memories and to let her family know im thankful for everything they've done for me. And i get another message back saying ""don't message me ever again"" that killed me,  I had a mental break down and just cried after everything that happened this week I just thought even if she was with someone she'd still say something nice, I never knew her to be like that this was someone who played with my nieces and nephews with a smile and took pictures with me and of me all the time who wrote long letters and took care of me. It just broke me, i don't know what i expected to happen. I told i wanted that, I wanted to get back in a couple months. I told her i would do what she wanted and i did it. It seems like this was the breakup. I don't reddit, I just needed to vent that because i don't have anyone to talk to anymore.",28Jul2018,1

I'm scared of what people might think..it's very frustrating for me, I want to reach out.. I want to tell them How much I wanted to kill myself, every single day, but I can't. I'm scared that people will also just say it's all in my head, that I'm thinking too much..I can't reach out. I'm such a wuss. People from school and around my family, they know that I am a very enthusiastic person, and they don't know much about me, especially my family. I don't talk much to people, I can't express myself right, people are getting tired of me, I guess.

60,"So this girl I’ve been talking to for 3 months (she’s super cute and awesome to talk to) called me last night and said she was lonely and wanted to me see me really badly,(was not even thinking about her wanting to have sex) and I was super exited she wanted to come over because I had been 32 hours without sleep working almost the entire time on this project for my company, so I was happy she was coming over so I get just unwind for a bit and talk to her 

Anyways, when she got here we talked for about an hour while watching a movie, she started kissing me and we began to undress, unfortunately I was so sleep deprived and had so much adderall in me I could barely even get hard, so after 30 mins of struggling to stay hard even while I was inside her, she just started crying and saying how disgusting she was ):
 
I explained to her why I couldn’t get it up and she was like “you don’t need to make excuses for me, it’s my fault” 

So after laying down with her and calming her down, she fell asleep

So I went and was finishing up my project and when she woke up she came over to me and hugged me and said “I love you, you know that right? And I’m sorry for everything I’ve put you through” and she walked out before I could really say much, I’ve called her twice now and she said she doesn’t want to talk right now and just needs sometime 

Feel like I’ve ruined it with this girl ):

Easily the worst experience of my life ):

Bright side is, at least I finished my project

I feel the pointlessness of life all over again, probably because I dont do anything that is important to me and theres nothing to run from. What do I do? How do I get out of this?

62,"I don't know what to call this but this is just a self summery of my internet life so far. I joined reddit with the intention to talk about arrow, flash and batman with the fabs here. Made a server called Arrowverse on Discord, advertised on a 9000 member TV server and gained like 65 total members. 

Things were going well. I made friends here on Discord and on Reddit. I then ruined it all because of my anger issues. I haven't done much wrong except outburst so much that I don't have to do a lot of wrong to do more wrong than what I already do. I say things in anger I regret later on, I regret them now as well.

 The members of my server made their own server and I'm not allowed in it, my servers that I made later on..I deleted them all. I deleted my accounts (Discord) in anger and I have made 14 alts so far. I deleted them all and I don't make alts anymore or ever will. 

I went to London (where my Family is) because I was advised that it might be because I live alone, turns out I have ADHD and depression so yeah, that made me understand what's wrong with me. I seeked help, was better and got home this week and things are going back to the way they were. I'm angry again, depressed again, I keep thinking of self-harm again and I've started to take drugs now.

So, yeah..It's just fucked up how quickly things go wrong on the Internet.

I gotta change myself, I need to right my wrongs, do better.. become better than who I was, then who I am and hopefully the next 6 months are just full of positive shit, dudes.

63,"Seems like every website is trying to make their interface look  more and more modern, mainly this means hiding buttons until you move your mouse over them, but the scrollbars!

I remember back in the MS-DOS days, every program had a different notion of scrollbars.

Now, on this website, it means making the main scrollbar for the listed articles *SIX* pixels wide, in an off white on white (RGB colors are : 230,230,230 on 247,247,247) .  But that wasn't enough, it has to hide the scrollbars so that when you move your mouse off the list, it fades to white.

65,"We only talked once before she left. Before that I already knew she had a thing for me (her friend told me &amp; I noticed her staring at me on more than one occasion), but still I had to work up the nerve to talk to her. All I had to do was complement her boots for us to start talking. After that we spent a couple hours practically attached to the hip and learning how much we had in common. 

I was kinda taken aback by how alike we were. It wasn't just our interests, but even our life trajectories, out-look, goals, and values were parallel. I guess I spent my whole life feeling like the odd one out, so having this lovely girl to talk to who figuratively spoke the same language as me was nothing short of a breath of fresh air. I've heard a lot of talk about ""wave-lengths"", never totally understood that until now. 

Then she dropped a bomb on me. She'd was going abroad for a month, and she'd be leaving in a week. I responded with disappointment and she asked me why. Instead of being honest, I said something like ""Cause I just made a new friend."" 

I'm such a pussy...

Furthermore, I neglected to ask her for her contact information. I guess I was expecting to see her once more before she left (she's in my Tues/Thurs classes -- I thought she'd be there on Thursday.) She wasn't. 

I don't have social media since I deleted all of them for privacy reasons, otherwise I could have just added her on one of them. Although, that wouldn't even help much since she's vacationing in China which blocks pretty much everything I could have added her on in the first place. I found her email (wasn't that hard, just googled her first name, which is unique enough that I found it on the first page.) So I sent her an email, but she hasn't gotten back to me. Unless she has a decent VPN, chances are she wont check her gmail until she gets back. 

It's been a week and a half since then. So I suppose I just have to wait it out and hope she still feels something for me when she gets back. I've been talking to other girls, but none of them are anything compared to her. Like I've said, I've always feel out of step with people, like an alien, and it's rare for me to find someone who seems to belong to the same species as me. I always have to hold back a bit with people, fearing that they won't entirely get where I'm coming from. Difference is with her, I could just be myself.  

Maybe I'm idealizing her. Who knows? Either way, I felt a spark. I felt the potential for something great. Now all I have to go off is the memory of an all too short interaction. The feeling of my hand on her thigh. The smell of her hair when we hugged goodbye.

We remain in touch through, texts, FaceTime, Snapchat, and video games. Obviously u may think that’s not friend ship, but I beg to differ.
