0,"I’ve always had some issues with body image but my biggest worry is probably my breasts. My bra size is 32DDD, but they sag a bit. I’ve been reading a lot of articles about it, and they all say something along the lines of “it’s ok! Breasts sag as you age, have kids, and breastfeed!” which is nice but...I’m only 18 and have never been pregnant or breastfed. My boobs have looked like this for as long as I’ve had them. I know it’s natural and normal, but I still feel insecure.

They’re not “grandma” saggy or “flat and deflated”, and they don’t really have stretch marks, but I could fit maybe 2 fingers under them and the areolas are big. They look great in a bra, but I feel so deceptive because they aren’t so perky without it.

I’ve only had sex once before, and the guy really didn’t care, but he didn’t pay much attention to them either (it wasn’t entirely consensual so to be honest I don’t think he was worried about anything but himself). 

Right now I’m talking to a new guy though, and I’m worried what he’ll think of them when we eventually do reach that point. I feel like I’m not good enough for him. He’s 6’3”, really muscular, and good looking, so he could have almost any girl he wants. I feel like he deserves a girl with a perfect body, and I don’t have it.  He’s complimented my body before, but I don’t know if he’ll like it when I take my clothes off. What makes it worse is how in porn the women either have small, perky breasts or gigantic fake round ones, so a lot of guys my age probably think it’s normal for large breasts to be perfect circles. 

Also, I have stretch marks around my hips, thighs, and butt, and I’m worried what he’ll think of those too. 

I just want someone to actually find my body attractive, and not just tolerate it. I know there are guys who can “look past it” if they really like me or focus on other things they do like, but I actually want someone to like my whole body. I’m just scared that no one will.

1,"I’m married with three kids 7, 10, and 14. The only family we have within 1200 miles is mil who neither of us can stand and she usually flies to see her daughter for holidays anyway.

Most thanksgivings and Christmases are just us. It’s too expensive to fly five people anywhere for the holidays so we usually have to stay put. I long for the warm, big family holidays everyone else seems to have. Most people who live in my area grew up here and have lots of extended family close by. They have these huge family holidays and they just look so nice. 

I try to tell myself that pictures are deceiving and big family holidays can be stressful but I still want one. One of my closest friends is from a family of 7. She and all her siblings have children. Every thanksgiving they all gather in the family’s mountain home and have the most picture perfect holiday. My envy completely eats me up. And i honestly think her gatherings are as warm and nice as I imagine as her family is very close. She tells me about the gathering for weeks leading up and after. It secretly kills me.

I don’t know how to just accept that I have a sweet little family and that’s ok and we can still have a nice holiday. ",30Sep2018,5

Toffee


Dear toffee, 

Some things in life are inexpressible, not to yourself, your friends, your mum, dad, or siblings; a sparce, rarely sighted feeling and that cannot be explained or spoken. Many have not felt it or can understand, but the people in this house have all been touched by it. We did not choose to have it, we did not ask for it, look for it, or exepect it. It followed us all through the most important and difficult years of each of our lives, even if we couldnt see it at the time, in the end it was still there. 

You carried the weight of childhood, adolescence, adulthood on your back, but you had time for each of us however much we disagreed. You blessed us all with your curiosity, spontinuity, tranquility, and affection. You gave us the most wonderful and humbling gift we will come to cherish; the memories we shared with you. You will not be forgotten.

I was not there when it happened. I dont like how i said my goodbye, and i wont forget that. But we shared a bond that could not be broken, and it will not brake. You will always be my friend, and i will take you with me in my memory.

You aren't here anymore. But the inexpressible relationship we all have with you will remain with us as if you were still tugging on your lead next to us. The feeling stays here forever in your name. The feeling will be remembered as love.
  We love you.

3,"Earlier today my boyfriend was driving me to work and we were on a two lane road that allows passing. We were behind a semi truck that was going slow, so my boyfriend turned on his signal to pass and the truck saw him passing and purposely went over in my lane, luckily my boyfriend sped up but the way the truck was going it could’ve hit the passenger side where I was sitting, it could’ve killed or seriously injured me. We stopped at the gas station and the driver was stopped at a red light and started cussing us out and yelling at us. I screamed back, which surprised me because I felt this anger that I never felt before in my life because I almost died. Unfortunately we didn’t get the license plate or a number or we would’ve called the cops. ",30Sep2018,5

* they’re busy which works well because I’m always busy 
* they’re always around other guys so by the time they get to you they are ready to get down and dirty

6,"This post is kinda long but I gotta say something

Backstory: So I’m 23, living with my parents and my slightly  autistic little brother who’s 20. My mom has been kind, supportive, endearing and respectful and while she’s pushed her Jehovah’s Witness stuff a little strong on me, I love her. She’s been critical of me but loving and wanting me to do better. I get annoyed sometimes but I know she means well. 

Now for my dad. Buckle up. He’s late 50s and very, and I mean very, pessimistic. Over my teenage years, he really started to show his true colors. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve started to understand him more. In short, and I don’t want to make drama out of this, he loves Trump and everything he does. Anything republican is good, anything democratic or liberal is super bad. Thing is, he is volatile to anyone who disagrees with him, on like anything. He hates hearing people speak in Spanish on the bus to work, like he’s spent $100 total on headphones this month to “drown them out”. I’m the complete opposite of him, but I don’t let him know that for fear of what he will do to me. My biggest fear is that he’ll kick me out of the house and disown me from the family. He’s never hurt or abused any of us but honestly, that doesn’t seem so far out there any more. I like my dad, I don’t love him. Not anymore at least.

Text Wall Incoming

As for tonight, it was basically the straw the broke the camel’s back. Me and my mom were cooking dinner, her obviously trying to make sure I’m ready for solo life. And while the dish is in the oven, she spills her diabetes pills. Now, obviously you would think if food or pills hit the floor, you throw them out, because the floor is gross. So me, her and my little brother throw them out. Well here comes my dad home from work. My mom asks him, and I knew this was not gonna lead to something good, what she should do if she lost over half her pills and if she can get more so soon. Well, my dad basically stands there and calls her an idiot, a moron, stupid and careless. And this is one of the hundreds of times where he has belittled her for making a mistake. Mind you, me and my little brother are looking at each other with our facial expressions saying “you seeing this shit?”. We eat dinner as a family at the table and awkward is not even close to an accurate description. My dad finishes first and leaves, unaware of how terrible he’s made his own wife feel. My little brother loses it as he hears dad go upstairs and for good reason. He even goes so far as to threaten dad if he even so much as insults my mom again. My mom defuses him and tell him to take it easy. But then my mom starts crying. I know my mom and she only cries during sad parts in movies. I’m sitting here thinking about what the hell to do. I finish up and give her the tightest hug I’ve ever given her. 

God damn, I’ve never hated anyone, in my entire life, as much as I hated my dad right then and there. I could count on one hand in 23 years of living how many times I’ve had a “father,son” moment. Also he always, and I mean always, compares me to my “more successful” cousins who go to high end colleges, play golf and make good money at less than my age. Not knowing how toxic that is to your depressed son. Except he doesn’t know about the depressed part because he never fucking talks to me. 

So I finish the hug and my mom stops me. And these words I will cherish forever. She says, “James I want you to know that not all marriages are like this. Find someone who truly cares about you. I love you and I want you to find someone truly special.” I went back and hugged again and now I’m angry crying into my bed right now. My dad is about 15 feet away in the other room and I really wanna go off on him. I know it will just lead to more problems so I’ll just grit my teeth. Any support or kind words would appreciated. I just don’t know what to do guys :(

TL;DR: Dad has been a jerk to my mom for the last couple years now but it’s starting to really show now. Made my mom cry tonight because she made a simple mistake and he belittled her like hell for it. Mom gave me words of wisdom on marriage and I think my love for dad finally died tonight.

7," I had so much fun these past couple weeks I felt I had to share. So a little backstory I've been in the Army for about 2.5 years. I'm a barracks rat, never leave my room and play games/watch anime all day when not working. Overall I'm a pretty good soldier, so my leadership decided to send me to BLC (3-week NCO academy course). I was nervous at first but ended up having a great time.

I made a lot of friends and memories while I was there! I grew up pretty lonely (only child, parents busy working), never been to any parties, only had 2 good friends from HS. I didn't even celebrate my 21st birthday earlier this year. While at BLC that all changed, we went out eating a lot, drank for the first time, played golf, danced at the club, and one other place I won't mention haha. It was just a blast being surrounded by company and having fun.

I obviously won't being do that stuff all the time, but it's good to get out and enjoy yourself once in a while and not be a complete shut-in I learned.",30Sep2018,2
8,"Hi everyone, I've been out of college approaching 2 years now and I've had a hard time meeting new friends. I wanted to gauge the community on ways to reach to make better personal connections. I frequent bars because its an easy way to start conversations but most of the time the people i meet there are unreliable when it comes to maintaining a relationship. What specific ways have you all found to meet others in your community?

The situation looks dire, but my partner finally after a VERY long time of applying to jobs has had one respond and invite him in for an interview. He did well in the interview, they had him go for a drug test, and the next step is to start training! 

I wish I could express the feeling of relief we both feel... it’s been so long trying to live off of my disability money. I’m unable to work, but hoping to get back out there soon.

13,"This is for anyone who has the time for a short story about my battle with depression and the stress of not knowing what I want in life. I hope this can help others on a similar boat feel less alone, while also reaching those who can provide any advice.

I first experienced depression about 2-3 years ago, when I was in college. I also experienced social anxiety for the first time a few times during that time. Since then, I felt that I was beginning to feel better. I decided to move to a new city with my partner and I was so happy. I felt empowered, strong, and positive. I was getting back to my old ways - meeting new people and making friends, going out and having fun. But in the last 9 months I have gotten off track. The fact that  it's been 9 months is scary, considering I didn't accomplish anything during those times. Most days, I sat on the couch at home. In the last couple of few weeks it's gotten worse. I smoke daily now and for most of the day (I live in a legal state so it's casual and everywhere). I recognize that I want to smoke because it makes me happy for a few moments. But I know that by doing so it will prevent me from doing important things. I am currently unemployed and need to find a job. I use it as a form of escape and it's bad. 

I feel I lack self control and discipline that I am unable to execute what I KNOW is right in my head. Same with food. I used to have an eating disorder and I used to binge eat. Though I don't purge anymore, I am starting to binge eat again - The first time in a while. I lift weights now and stay active which has allowed me to binge eat some days without having any physical changes, but that is my way of justifying it. I know that it is unhealthy for me and I need to learn to cope through another outlet.

I went out with my friends the other night. It was what I would've called the perfect day - our musician friend was having a small gig and we all met up. We ended the night all dancing in the empty venue to my friend's music and it was fantastic. Yet, I didn't feel that way. It was as if I was seeing my life through the backseat. I can see how amazing these people are, how much fun they are, how great the weather is. Yet I didn't feel those emotions. I remember thinking, ""oh no, I'm depressed again."" I felt anxiety too, the first time in a year. I kept trying to come up with an excuse to go home early and needed to talk myself into chilling out. 

I think the biggest stress in my life currently is my not being able to find what I'm looking for. I didn't know what I wanted to study in college, I didn't know what I wanted to have as a career not ever, not today. I thought I found a career I would really enjoy. I went through an expensive bootcamp yet I have lost interest for it. At 23, with an expensive diploma, and an expensive bootcamp, I am wasting my parent's money with no sense of direction.

I keep searching for the goal in my life and I can't find it. My partner notices my lack of drive and tries to help me out, but it doesn't work. I was asked what my goal in 5 years is, and I couldn't answer it. I am still searching and I can't find it. Well, I do have one but I don't know how realistic it is. When I'm asked that question, the first thing I think is, I want to be an actor by then. It's a dream of mine that I've had for many years but I always felt embarrassed to say it. I took one acting class in college and I absolutely loved it. Every aspect - studying the character to understand its motive, desire, emotions, rehearsing the role, performing them, it was all just as enjoyable as I had imagined it. By that time however, I still felt too embarrassed to change my major for it. Why embarrassed? Let's say, if this had been Neuroscience that I had a new found passion in, I wouldn't even think twice about telling my parents. I feel like the town that I grew up in generally saw sciences and business as a real, formative career. I remember I told one of my best friends in high school that I may want to start acting and I remember she said, ""ew, what."" (we are no longer friends, though not due to this). It was odd, and I don't remember anything else but I remember how embarrassed I was. I also remember telling my other sister and dad that I may want a career in the arts and I remember them trying to hold their chuckles in and said, ""oh, really?"" I know without context they sound negative, but their characters can't be defined by this one example. It is also understandable that they may not take it seriously since I've never been formally trained. I grew up dancing and I absolutely think my love for performing stems there, but my only ""legitimate"" experience is that acting class in college. The regrettable thing is, the professor had a 1-on-1 with me and asked if I am interested in acting, and that if so I should pursue it. I went to UCLA, which means I could've gotten high level, proper theater education, and also in the acting hub of the states. I feel like I missed my chance when it was right there in front of me; Just because I was worried about other people's opinions. I mentioned this to my mother a year ago and she said that if I was truly passionate I wouldn't have any excuse and pursue it. I felt like that's true, and I decided I had to move on. I thought I found a new career path that I like, but I still go back to acting. Acting has always been the one thing that's been in the back of my mind, yet I tried to ignore it each time for silly reasons. Seeing it this way, it seems most reasonable to pursue it, but I don't know how I feel about asking for more financial support for such a risky career.

Now I'm unemployed, not wanting to even find a job in the new field I picked. Completely lost at what I should do. Thanks for reading, and please feel free to share any thoughts. Cheers.",30Sep2018,4
14,"Throwaway because not even reddit me can face the music.

Word vomit ahead. Need to dump this somewhere.

For the last few months I have just felt... off... Maybe it's the only when I have been drinking me, maybe it's me all the time, I guess I'm not sure entirely. I don't like my job, but it pays well and people like me. I want to take the next step but (literally) 30 rejection letters hurt. I can't find the motivation to do things I need to get where I want, and I can't find the motivation to do, well, anything else. Even things I like are just...... Not fun?

I've been down before.. I attempted suicide in high school... I'm well beyond past ""that point"" in my life, but I just can't seem to find enjoyment in anything anymore. I don't know where to start or how to even admit to myself that maybe now I should try to do something different since I keep expecting the same results. 

I can't stop thinking about my own mortality. It's just a weird feeling I can't describe other than ""my flame is about to burn out"". I'm not going to do it myself, but I can't help but feel like something is coming.

I have a house, a wife, a stable job, the bills get paid, I have a completely normal, stable, American middle-class life, but I feel like so much is still missing....

Anyway, I'm sure someone will read this and either relate or tell me I'm off my rocker. Either way, I at least feel a little bit better. I'll probably stay on this throwaway at least until I finish eating my overcooked rice and chicken (I like cooking and I'm almost even good at it yet here I am burning fucking rice) with this irish mule (which is actually pretty okay).

I'd consider myself as one who never grew up with strong family values. My parents were distant, through no intention or ill will of their own, but that's another topic. I have two brothers, one younger and one older. I have friends who I'd considered closer than them. I could go for months without speaking to my siblings and it affected none of us particular. And when we would eventually talk, it would be similar but a bit different from reconnecting to an old friend. I don't know quite how to describe it, but it's sort of an awkward halfway space. So I've always wondered what it really meant to always be there for someone. As I said earlier, I've had friends who I considered closer than family but when trauma struck us it tore us apart quicker than I would have imagined.",30Sep2018,2

Honestly I should’ve seen red flags because I know a girl who he hooked up with and when he was drunk he called her a slut and he kept hooking up with her even though she had a bf and he knew that (and messaged her bf to tell him one time). He was also a huge dick to some of my other friends. Still, we had a lot of mutual friends, so I assumed that meant he was ok deep down, and he has a therapist.

But then I received screenshots from his roommate of a conversation where this friend said I was “stupid for drinking with a 23 year old as a freshman” and “practically volunteered for it [to be assaulted]”. He also straight up admitted he only pretended to care when I talked about my trauma and my life in general.

And oh yeah, these messages were from six months ago.

I was honestly speechless when I read it. I immediately blocked him on all social media but it’s not like I can ever get back the year I spent being his friend while he didn’t give a shit about me. I wish I could take back all of the kindness and support and forgiveness I showed him.

26,"I have recently learned to appreciate those around me. I have been so selfish that I have been a jerk people who actually care about me. One of them being one of my best friends, a guy i met 4 years ago in physics. It still amazes me how we managed to stay friends, even though we no longer have the same classes together. What I still find surprising is that we are closer than ever, even after I messed things up 2 years ago by confessing my feelings for him. My friends thought he liked me, especially since he was trying to hold my hand one night at my friends party but I understand why he rejected me. I don't blame him. It probably would've ended bad since we were both younger and more immature. Overall, I didn't believe that things would go back to normal, and that we would remain just friends like he wanted. 

&amp;#x200B;

I rarely say this, but I love him. He's so driven, and passionate about his career and he has gotten so far. I'm so proud of him. I've always been very hard on myself but he always tries to push me in the right direction. I used to find it annoying, but recently, I have found that all his nagging has actually helped me. I've done so much, and i'm getting further into my career as well. I probably wouldn't have done this without his help. He's been such an amazing friend. I feel indebted to him but he just says it's ok and that I don't owe him anything. He just says to remember that he is one of my few real friends. (he thinks alot of my friends are fake. he's been right every single time.)

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel horrible because it took me a while to get over the rejection and I would put off doing things with him, and yet, he is still always there for me. He's so thoughtful. He would always buy me food, even when I said I wasn't hungry, when we'd meet up to ""study"" at school, when all we'd really do is mess around and laugh at memes like old times. He always listens to me and he always knows what to say. Just recently, we hung out and it seemed different than usual. Something about that night made us feel comfortable enough to share things we don't normally share, and have some pretty deep conversations. It really made me see him in a different light. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what it was about that night but I still feel strange about it. I get so happy when he texts me, or tags me in memes. Every time I see him now, I can feel my mood shift immediately. I can finally accept his compliments. Instead of fighting it like i tend to do when people compliment me, I just accept it. I actually feel really good when he does. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I finally learned to appreciate him and I am really happy he is still in my life. I am glad he chose to continue being friends with me, after all that has happened.

35,"I had an aunt that has no job even though she’s 23 years old... her siblings have always been problematic that she NEVER goes to school even though they pay for her college tuitions and exam, she’s fat(not kidding)  and always on her phone, my grandma, her mother have always been crying about it because even though her and her 4 other children (my mom and 4 uncles) that they’ve been supporting her college fees but she wouldn’t get a job and fix her attitude. Cussing at my grandma and her FOUR OLDER siblings and straight up disrespecting them. The reason why they cry because she’s the only adopted out of the 5 siblings. Everyone in the family knew except for her.

One day I was pissed off because I’m out here doing my fucking school work and trying to get the printer to work while studying for my exam. Then she comes lashing at the door saying that I didn’t do the dishes. WTF she’s been downstairs fucking playing with her 3 phones like a damn child, doing nothing but eating and laying in the couch, came to my room saying that I didn’t do the dishes? This is what she said “YOU’RE ALWAYS DOING NOTHING ON YOUR ROOM, YOU’RE ALWAYS ON YOUR PHONE, GO DOWN NOW AND DO THE DISHES!” Oh the irony, I’ve had enough of her crap she’s been shouting and throwing insults at me and hitting me for 3 years so I fucking lashed out. 

“WOW, You? Tell me that? Telling me me FOR NOT doing the dishes while you sit there doing nothing and playing your phone, not going to school, jobless?! IF ONLY YOU KNEW THE TRUTH” 

So that got out of my chest. Now she’s crying asking me what “truth” is it, so i just locked myself in my room alone. I shouldn’t have said that since my grandmother told me to never tell her that she was adopted. My aunt has been speculating that she was adopted but now that i told her that I’m scared to go out of my room. I’m only 13 and I didn’t know what to do, I was very furious so I lashed out at her.

36,"The last 3 - 4 years have been an immense struggle for me.

I was in a 7 year relationship from 17-24 and he broke it off with me because he didn't love me anymore. Our relationship was actually so great, we got along so well, but in retrospect we began to become best friends who shared a bed together and our romantic spark had worn down to a point beyond repair. This break up was very hard for me and it was very abrupt. However as hard as it was, at the time I had faith that the next few years would be transformational for me and I was adamant on growing an empire within myself, so that if someone I loved so much were to leave me like that again, I'd always have a strong foundation to fall back on. At this time, I also held a strong belief that in 3-4 years, everything would be so much better but I was so very wrong.

Nearly 3 years ago in January, I moved to a whole new city on my own because I was fed up of the small town I grew up in and I had to get out as there were no opportunities there for me anymore. My ex kind of followed me  because he wanted to be there for me and was relentlessly trying to get back together, as he had immense regrets for breaking up. It was hard for me to turn him down, but I felt so strongly in my gut that it wasn't best to go back and it didn't seem fair on him if my heart wasn't 100 percent in it. Because I had no one there and I was still very fond of my ex as he always was my best friend, we stayed friends and we were inseparable (and platonic) for a year until he had met a girl at the start of last year, which changed everything for him and I and we no longer know each other anymore.

Since then, I have been living the worst time of my life due to having absolutely no one here and feeling like I am wasting valuable years of my 20s with no social life. The loneliness and social isolation is so deafening that it has made me very depressed and at times a suicidal, requiring hospitalisation and much intensive therapy. Around a year ago I started a new full time job in a company that can get me very far and this year I started studying a new degree to enhance my career, so I do feel so positive about this aspect of my life, however the social aspect is not at all promising and it is hard to dismiss what is a very innate, human need. In particular, I find it very hard to face this problem being bombarded with social media accounts of people I know who have such enriching social lives and I feel like such a loser for missing out on this.

Sometimes I catch up with the mutual friends of my ex that I used to hang out with regularly when I moved over,  however it is always me who initiates it and I am beginning to feel I should put more energy into establishing relationships outside of my last relationship. I am very busy juggling full time work and study, but I still relentlessly put myself out there in every single way possible by joining clubs, night classes, volunteering, using bumble bff to meet likeminded people, the list goes on. I'm telling you, I am reallllly realllly trying and I'm getting no where establishing new, promising connections with people. I also want to meet a nice partner again and have been online dating actively for the last 3 years, but I find myself getting involved with guys who don't show me much respect at all, which then makes me feel like I didn't do the right thing by not getting back with my ex and regret ensues.

All and all I feel I am just banging my head against a wall trying to improve a situation that won't change no matter how much I put into it. Everyone else around me that I know has had their lives change in immeasurably positive ways in the last two years and I am stuck in the exact same spot and it terrifies me that this situation is permanent and that the stagnancy will remain no matter how much I work at changing it.

&amp;#x200B;

It is disheartening to look back on my 24 year old self when my ex had just left me and remembering how strong I was and hopeful I was that things would work out for the best, but I am 27 now and I am ashamed that I have totally failed these hopes and expectations. It almost feels as though that 24 year old was a worlds beyond me in strength and courage and I'm just running on empty trying not to get myself back into a place where I want to take my life again.",30Sep2018,3
37,"I got drunk and went back to an acquaintance's house with a group of people, some of whom are close friends others who aren't. I can't remember much of what I said, but I remember being incredibly arrogant and bragging, talking over people, and worst of all explaining that I thought my best friend's new boyfriend - who she'd introduced to everyone earlier in the evening - was really weird and rude and that I thought she could do better. I would never have said these things sober, and I feel completely terrified that she'll find out what I've said and hate me. I'm also mortified about how I came across to people, and keep being haunted by flashbacks of how cringey and intense I was. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also brought out a new friend from my masters course for the first bit of the evening and he saw how drunk I was, and I woke up to texts I sent saying ""me and my friends love you"" with a heart after it- I hope he doesn't see that as some kind of desperate romantic advance (I don't fancy him at all and he has a girlfriend who he went to meet afterwards, who probably saw that text and was like wtf lol).

I've never seen anything larger than a fruit fly in this apartment for the last 3 years. We keep the place clean (besides maybe a pile of dirty laundry) and it's a nice high-rise building. 

So, I'm trying to figure out why it was here and if there are more and I can relax.

Friday night I opened our bedroom window and it was rainy (it's been rainy all week). Saturday morning I didn't realize window washers would be removing the screen so all of Saturday the window was open without a screen. Is it possible it crawled up the building on a rainy day and got in? Did it travel on me or one of my bags and get into the apartment?

 I never made any friends after the first year, only some few acquaintances. All this time I am partially lying to my closed ones and it is tearing me apart. I have the constant fear that I will be recognized and judged from the professors and the other students.

And 6 months later I have lost 25 pounds and feel like I wasted so much time but also understand that the past is unchangeable but he future is pliable.

65,"Yes, as the title suggests, my brother is an alcoholic. He is 26 years old and have been drinking fairly heavy (at least three times a week) for the past 5-6 years. On top of that he is also not eating very healthy ( a lot of pizza and high fat foods) and very rarely exercises. He started drinking more often about three years ago and gained a lot of weight. Around the same time he started having heart palpitations which in  turn made him go to the doctor and do some tests. The tests was not that great and showed that he was beginning to develop a fatty liver. That really made him think and somewhat turned his life around. He started eating healthy, cut down significantly on his drinking and went to the gym. He lost like 50 kilos in six months, and things looked really good. 

&amp;#x200B;

He took up drinking pretty soon after that  unfortunately. I did not know the extent of his drinking back then (our relationship has been somewhat strained a few years for other reasons) but then we went on a family trip last summer. The first night he downed over 20 beers (!?) and he wasn't even drunk. The day after he didn't even have a hang over. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now fast forward a year and i suspect he has been drinking basically every day for at least 12 months. I suspect so since he posts it on social media/snapchat and message me every other day to go out for drinks. I have brought up this with him, but he either gets very defensive or straight out lies (he had a birthday party last week, and told me he was proud that he had cut down drinking to ""two days a month""). I know for a fact that that was i lie since he had been drinking every day for at least the last three weeks.  

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, everyone around him are his enablers.  Every single one of his friends (and hes got a lot of friends) are quite heavy drinkers, and our family allways serves free booze at every family gathering. I will admit that im a part of this as well, and is a bit scared to bring this up with him too hard since we have just begun to repair our relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, he is fully functional (he has a long term girlfriend, a nice apartment, makes a lot of money, a good job (manager) that he is really good at (but everyone at his job drinks a lot too, they have after works like three times a week). 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know hos too deal with this. Every time i see him he seems to be gaining weight and is now extremely overweight. We also have a history of heart problems in our family. Its just that he is so damn stubborn and insanely proud. He does not respond well to criticism at all. Help me, Reddit! Also apologizing in advance for grammar-errors, English is not my main language.

Sudden to me, but not to him I'm sure, my boyfriend of 8 years decided to call our relationships quit. We have been living together for 5 years now. We moved to a new city 4 years ago to attend university, he dropped out after 2 years because he got a professional job. I am about to finish my final semester with my undergrad degree.

He decided that he wanted space to grow independently, that he was tired of supporting me emotionally ( close death in my family a few years ago) and that he just wanted to be alone. 

I'm devastated. We have 2 pets together, a ton of material items, and share a small bedroom in an 'in-law' room situation. 

We decided to end our relationship as a couple, but he wants us to still be civil and ""friends"" since we have to share our living space. He sleeps upstairs on the couch now and I kept the bedroom, but all of our things are still together in the downstairs bedroom. So he will come in to get dressed, use the shower/bathroom, etc, while I am in there.

It is really hard to not want to be with him, especially since I see him so much. I still love him and would have liked to try and make our relationship work. He keeps saying ""We'll see what happens"" and ""lets not think that far ahead"" when I ask what our future looks like now and that really hurts me. I feel like he expects me to just deal with all of this and then get back with him when he decides he wants to.

What do I do? How do I deal with this situation of being broken up, but not?

Thank you for listening.

72,"creep or a liar?  I'm 36, but have been  told I look 27-32 and want to seek a date who's 25-33.   I made a trial  tinder profile with a nice landscape, chose an age 6 years younger and matched with 2 people so far.   It's not a serious profile because it's  not my real face photos but I would genuinely like to be given a chance  with younger people even though my ID shows I'm older.

Would  the potential dates understand that I lied about my age on the profile  or would it be a deal breaker if I said I was 30 and they find out  later, by checking my wallet or some other way, that I'm actually 36?

74,"I consider myself undateable and don't think I'll ever get a girlfriend, even if I recently moved to a big city that has many more opportunities than I ever could have imagined back home. Me thinking that I'm undateable and hopelessly single forever really bothers me and brings me down a lot, but I don't know why. It hurts to remember that pretty much every girl I've ever been interested in has turned me  down. I know that it isn't necessary to have a girlfriend in my life to be happy or to not feel alone, but I still crave it. I know that with a relationship, lots of problems and drama can arise. I don't understand why I want it.

There are times where I feel nice and think to myself that it's great that because I'm single and will likely stay that way for a long time (if not forever), that I'll never be cheated on, have to deal with drama, or deal with nasty breakups. Those moments are always really nice. The biggest problem and insecurity I have just doesn't bother me during these times. For a rare moment, there's positive thinking in my mind and I'm comfortable being single. The thought of never finding anyone doesn't bother me. How great it would be if that feeling would last forever, or at least come to me more often. 

I don't know what I want. Sometimes I wish that I could find someone, but other times I wish I would just get over it and no longer desire something like romance.

 I guess I just want someone, and know that I won't be alone forever, whether it's romantic or platonic. ",30Sep2018,0
75,"Many people have seen it, most have responded. I'm unsure how I feel. I've received a lot of support (more than I expected) but I don't want people to see me differently either. If I could turn back time I would undo what I did. I feel as though I worried a lot of people, which I shouldn't have done, and I've not really known how to respond to these messages of support.

I suppose I've come here looking for an impartial bit of advice, or for someone whose done or seen similar to offer their perspective. One thing that gets to me (and I wrote about this) is that I feel like I've been living a lie recently, coming across as one of the happiest people but in doing so becoming more dishonest and distancing myself from the real me.

It was also the worst possible timing because I'm supposed to be going on a first date with this girl soon and she also saw (this weighs heavily on me). While she was also supportive, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with everyone now being aware and I don't know how I'll face everyone once I'm back at school.

Maybe this will allow me to be more open with people, but on the other hand I think I may come to miss the straightforward dynamic I'm used to of coming across as a carefree to most I know.

76,Stuck in a horrible relationship for over 10 years. No friends or family. Just want to end it. It’s a for ever never ending cycle of us both being bad to each other and I just want to die. I always have since I’ve had our last child. Nothing brings me happiness. I’ve tried to overdose and didn’t succeed. My life is a mess I just want it to end. ,30Sep2018,2
77,"Neither of us could believe it, unfortunately my third shot missed, barely though.
I continued on hitting shots, sometimes one out of three, sometimes two, but way better than I did with my eyes open. I called my wife over to show her, and did it again on my second shot.
I'm wondering if anyone else has seen this happen or if there is anything that can explain it. It was far more than chance after like ten hits. Couldn't really find much online.
I'll add that we were playing around the world where you count back from 20 to 1, and then bullseye. So I wasn't hitting doubles or triples on purpose, just the number itself. ",30Sep2018,5
