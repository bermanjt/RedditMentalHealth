7,"For the sake of honesty and context I will say that I have my fair share of flaws (or at least things that some may find off-putting). I'm short. Real short. Less than five feet tall. I don't know if I'd say I'm outright unattractive, but I'm not noticeable that's for sure. I'm awkward, especially around girls when I meet them, more so in a ramble kind of way than a quiet staring kind of way, not sure which is better. I'm pretty nerdy. I can be a big smart aleck at times, and I can ramble on for quite a while, which you've probably figured out by now. On the other hand, I strive to be a kind person that can make people laugh, and I can talk about a lot of different subjects with some degree of familiarity. And I have nice blue eyes.

&lt;Random stuff that probably isn't important&gt; 

Around grade 9, I started noticing that people were starting to get into relationships, as much as you can get into a relationship at that age. I had various crushes but would, one way or another, have to move on. To cheer myself up, I would tell myself that sometime I'd meet a girl and things would be different. Tomorrow even. Or next week. Next month. Surely by next year.

Well I never met that elusive girl, and promising myself this vague future didn't make me feel any better. I had to stop setting myself up for disappointment. So I fought optimism with cynicism. Every voice telling me that this girl would be different was matched with a voice telling me that I shouldn't waste her time or my own.

The problem, of course, was that this didn't make me feel much better either. The more I told myself to not bother the more I wanted to prove myself wrong. So I'd grab onto anything I could. A smile. A laugh. Anything.

But now I was stuck in a cycle. Become interested in a girl. Force myself to move on. Chastise myself for trying, in the hopes that I won't hurt myself in that way again. Become more desperate to escape the cynicism. Repeat. 

&lt;Random stuff that probably isn't important/&gt;

For the past while I've been trying to just throw it all out, so to speak, and go back to basics. But it feels like whenever I try to just be confident with my feelings towards a girl, I get cosmically punched in the gut, sometimes in almost comedic timing. Meet a girl, get along really well, talk often for a couple weeks. Find out she's going on a date with another girl in a couple weeks. Think a girl in my friend group is cool, and when I warn myself to stop, I think that I should just have confidence in myself. A few hours later someone mentions the time last week she and another guy were making out. Match a girl on a dating app, and have one of the most engaging conversations I've had over the app, find out a couple hours later that I was unmatched.

I can't help but feel like girls just don't see me romantically, I might as well be invisible. Don't get me wrong, I have some great girl friends, and I'm so thankful to count them amongst my friends, but it feels like I'm never even considered as anything else.

I know that no one owes it to me to like me, but I just don't know what to do.

**tl;dr** I'm an awkward short dude who wants to be a kind dude who can make people laugh but girls never seem to see me in any sort of romantic way.

8,"On paper, things should be great. I'm 31, career is well on track, I'm in good health and 9 years in with the love of my life.

Over this past year I have been anxious to look after all the things that weigh on me daily. Things like back taxes, debt, vehicle maintenance, lack of retirement plan, and most of all -
 disorganization of any kind.

 I realize these are all simply what's called adult life, but I'm also certain there are people with much better workflow and execution than me when juggling it all. I also think my progress is being hindered by too many distractions in my life - social media, the internet, smart phone addiction, technology in general. I feel completely scatterbrained trying to look after everything at once. A deer in headlights.

I think reading a book might be a good way to center myself again. One that will be an escape, but will also help me conquer all the things I need to do with a more sound mind. 

What are some books that might help me out. Self help, philosophy, organization, good habits, motivation, positive thinking etc. I have no idea where to even start. Audio books are welcome too (I drive a lot for work).

PS, on a side note, I should mention I've felt obsessive about organization this past year, to the point where I'm unrealistic about how organized every task needs to be from the start, that I end up just not starting. I did manage a total purge of every material possession I don't need. Possibly mild ocd? Some related tics do run in the family.

11,"Not much as to the cause announced, other than that the car seemed to go left of center, over-correct, hit a pole, and flip... And that alcohol is not suspected.  We're in a rural school district, and everyone knows nearly everyone. This news, hitting so close to home, is difficult to take in. My kids seem OK (for now) but openly admit they don't feel like this news has fully 'sank in' yet.  As a parent, obviously getting such news is your worst nightmare. 

One of the deceased was the first crush a few years ago of one of my kids.  A passerby noticed the wreck and called 911 - that passerby is also a friend of ours. Being that person who calls 911 is something that person will never forget. Being first on the scene, and hearing silence rather than calls for help... 

There's so much here to process, quite honestly. 

I'd love to find some resources / reading that I might use in speaking with my children to answer questions they might have, words that I may be able to use when ""I'm so sorry for your loss"" doesn't even begin to cut it.

When I was 8, I was playing tag with a black girl, she put her hand on my crotch

At age 9, I put a bead down my urethra

Age 11 I put gum behind my foreskin and went to the emergency room

When I was 13 I tried to get a dog to lick my dick

At age 20 at my brothers wedding, I put my dick into the hot tub jet because it kind of sucked. 

I have been injecting lidocaine into my urethra for the last 6 months in an effort to numb the sensation and cravings, I have tried chemical castration at home, but luck hasn't been on my side. I have tried most things.

I will destroy my phallus, using fishing line and ice. I will inject heroin before I make the cut, to minimise pain and I will use lidocaine to numb my phallus.

18,"I wonder if my mental health led me to some of my life perceptions/thought processes or vice versa. I don't like my current life, but I also feel like my head is filled with concrete. For example: 

* Living in hiding/trying to be left alone from the rest of my family, just wanting to live independently or feeling like I have full control over the day-to-day stuff without being constantly asked questions...I only really want to talk to them if I *have* to. Sure, I want to move out &amp; won't freak out all the time. But yeah, money's an issue. 

* My lack of stable finances limiting social/relationship possibilities (as I'm fighting for each dollar I own at my 2 *casual* jobs). I wouldn't say I'm a reckless spender - I can afford most of the food I eat - but finding a more permanent job would at least be a relief for both my savings &amp; for my time.

* Social life is an issue but I'm wondering if the relationships I have with my parents have an impact on any other relationships I have - and I act noticeably different. Stuck in no man's land where I want to feel supported yet sometimes feels like my brain is working at a million miles an hour when I'm alone in a pub, or watching live sport, or any large gathering.

* And my patience is gone. I constantly feel like I'm racing the clock (I graduated 2016) &amp; not enjoying any free time I might have. And I don't have a fresh job strategy other than cross my fingers.

Just waiting for my psychologist to come back from holiday, but I'm considering a change of psychologists or at least a change of strategy. I do have a mental health plan but it's mostly been used for rants, and temporary relief..

Edit: The last point is somewhat tied with... 

* Upskilling, since Ive hated learning for a few years and I find it a chore pretty quicky. Probably because Im not seeing any immediate benefit, and would rather do something where I get paid.

23,"I feel like a fucking asshole right now man. I had a break during college, and had arranged with my friend to meet her to study or whatever which we do all the time. I have a massive thing for her, and she has a boyfriend, but that’s not really important here, it just kinda explains how I acted later. Anyway, she had to run a couple of errands, so she told me to save her a seat and that she’d get me later on, and that one of her friends from class was gonna join us cause she told her they’d grab lunch. A little later she messaged me saying that she’d forgot an important assignment she had to hand in. I replied telling her I’m sure it will be fine and that if she explains it will probably be okay. She messaged back a little later saying she was gonna be late cause she had a like a full on panic attack in the street.

I replied saying not to worry and just to take her time, and asked if she’s feeling okay yet. She replied a little later saying it really scared her and she’d never had anything like that happen to her. She’s a really anxious person and gets easily stressed, but I’ve never seen her get like that. She also said she was gonna grab lunch with her friend who was sitting like in a different bit of the library. I thought it was odd because she said we were all just gonna meet up together, and I was worried about her and wanted to see her to make sure she was okay, so I just told her that’s fine but that she should come see me for like 5 minutes or something. I didn’t tell her it was because I was worried though, and this is where I feel like I’ve been a complete asshole.

After I told her to come visit me I sat debating whether to say I’m worried about her. I didn’t want to sound like too comforting as bad as that sounds. Like I was a little worried in case it got taken the wrong way and it seemed like I was trying to comfort her too much where her boyfriend should be the one doing it. Sounds insanely dumb, but sometimes stupid thoughts go though my head. I also didn’t know if she wanted like space or whatever, cause it seemed she wanted to go sit with her other friend without me. I ended up just typing after it ‘I hope you’re okay now by the way’, but it was a few minutes later and it made it look like I was thinking her well-being was an after thought to the fact she chose not to sit with me.

Anyway, she replied saying ‘I’m fine now, thanks’, but completely ignored me telling her to come see me. I saw her walk in the library and go talk to her friend, but she didn’t even look my way even though she knew where I’d be sitting. She looked really pale and like she’d been crying, I felt like shit man. I just wanted to go up and give her a hug and tell her she’d be okay. Anyway, she stayed and had lunch with her friend and then left, never even acknowledging me. I feel like she’s annoyed at me, and I completely get that cause I really handled that so badly.

I just didn’t know what to say, I was too busy thinking about my feelings instead of just making sure she’s alright. I could have done so much more to help her. I want to apologise, but I don’t even know if she’s mad at me or she just needed a breather or whatever. I could be overthinking the whole thing and she just felt shitty, I honestly don’t know. Like she’s not that close with the girl she met, it could be she didn’t want to talk about it while she was there and decided she’d just talk with me about it later. Like she wanted to act normal and felt like she couldn’t if I was there and knew about it or whatever. Regardless; I just feel like I could have handled that so, so much better. She’s told me before that whenever she feels like shit or something she always feels like I’m the first person she can come to, and I feel like I just completely betrayed her trust by not helping her in the slightest. I feel like a fucking asshole. I’m too busy thinking about stepping on her boyfriend’s toes or making my feelings about her obvious to just be a good friend. I feel like a self-absorbed piece of shit man.

27,"I had a pretty good childhood, that is my parents aren't divorced and i wasn't beaten or abused or anything as a kid. But I was usually the kid who wasn't on the same page as my parents, there were a lot of times I didn't want to ask the about things or tell them about things because I knew they'd get embarrassed for me, and I've kept secrets from them sure, but I feel like its deeper than that. I've always had some sort of identity crisis due to being too afraid to ""be myself"" cause I honestly still don't get what I am, to this day (I am 21 yo) I'm still searching and I feel like I've wasted time and the family life that could've been great if I hadn't been such a needy kid in that way. Sorry if its very randomly explained here, I'm in the mood to rant a little.
So talking to my parents or grandparents has always been... stiff. Not that they haven't tried to get me to talk more it's just that I'm socially awkward and don't know what to say usually. I experienced dissociation at an early age, daydreaming and floating away because it helped with the weird feelings i now know were anxiety. Recently we've suffered through some tragic losses of family members, two of my grandparents and one aunt. It's put our family through some rough stuff and I kinda still feel it cause well if i say so myself I'm pretty bad at controlling and experiencing emotions in what one could call a ""normal"" way. I had to deal with all of my own insecurities at the same time, and didn't want to bother the rest of my family as they were grieving something far more significant than my 'rise' to adulthood.

And talking to them abou my depressive feelings and not helping me cope with the stress like living with my twin sister who literally doesn't listen to me and acts like the parents job is to make sure she gets everything she wants isn't helping. Noone in my family apparently understands me. (not to sound too emo)

... Been to a therapist, its kinda hard to do that too while pursuing univrsity studies cause i need time to rest after i feel emotions that are really strong about things i somehow cant shake the shame/sadness/anxiety of, and going to him doesnt help because its in itself making me feel like im overreacting.

Anyways last weekend an old friend of mine whom I've only seen maybe a few times at parties since highschool randomly DM'd me on twitter, asking how I've been, etc. 

I thought it was strange but of course I responded and this is what I was told. 

""I feel you on that bro.. yeah I am. Honestly bro I got connected with a group of entrepreneurs about a month ago to create some extra income. Would you be interested to get some details so you could too?""

Even though the offer sounded like the typical online scam, since it was a friend of mine who I did know irl I was interested. We set up a time to have a phone call the next day and he told me about who started the business and that it was about online marketing. He also slipped up and said that he gets more money for getting other people to join, which is understandable since we are all trying to make money but doesn't make the offer seem as genuine anymore. 

Anyways, I was told that him and some of his business partners were having a meeting Saturday that I could go to where a slide show would be presented with all the information I was curious about. I agree'd to go.

He said he has been a part of the business for a month, paid 183$ and has made that back within the month and some. He also said something about that money went towards him getting some sort of license for it?  

So pretty much what I'm wondering now is how legit does this sound to you guys? 

I'm still currently researching online marketing so I am familiarized before I go to the meeting, but I'm still suspicious on the legit-ness of this specific offer.

33,"What follows is a very long rant about an incident that I went through. And I mean very long. There is no tl;dr.

I figured that it's high time I let go of the pain that's built up over the last few years, collect my memories, and record what happened, whether or not anyone else gives a shit.

The MLP community was a place where I had hoped to find real friends, though sometimes I wonder if they aren't just ironically watching the show or sarcastically part of the fandom. But I should be more grateful because this is where I learned that nobody really cares about you more than how much they can get from you; that 'friendship' doesn't mean anything more than getting along with some people; that you can starve and people would rather not want to _hear_ about it; that you are effectively an asshole for being upset and venting on your friends by accident, even if they only finding out about it later because you told them what the deleted message was about, according to one u/SavvySillybug; that your cripplingly low self-esteem and situational depression is 'weirding them out', according to one u/SavvySillybug — I don’t know how to say this without risking a condescending appearance, but that's not something you tell someone in such a poor emotional state unless you are an asshole. I hope this was a mistake; but apparently, I'm a bad person for not wanting a profile picture on your site because it's 'unsettling' to other people, according to one u/SavvySillyBug. Who hurt me really badly. It's as if my sincerity meant nothing. Not to mention when I apologized, for not ever having been wrong in the first place. One cannot fake that without looking pretentious, like _certain_ people, and you know who I’m referring to. You're not pissed because I removed contacts from Skype. It seems like you desperately grab onto anything you can pin onto me, no matter how trivial it is. You clearly always were opposed to me after the incident, and for no reason other than your prejudice; this is something that makes you an asshole. You have no argument against me. You know our ‘friend’ was a douchebag. You know he hacked my account at your site because you're shitting nobody but yourself if you say you didn't check up on the second IP address after my account flooded _your_ chat room with spam and there was an unrecognized IP logged on my account; either this or you didn't want to check because you knew the truth, and that I would never do something like that; but apparently this makes me an asshole because I'm 'pitting' my friends against one-another, when in reality I couldn't care less about your shitty relationships, and when I couldn't care less for your 'grudges', because your moral judgement is perverse. You think I deserved all this bullshit when the truth couldn't be further from it. I can understand why your site gets no traffic.

Lose a house you’ve called home for most of your life? Meh. Enter catatonic shock from pain? Meh. Get hit by a bus? Meh. Get held at knifepoint? Meh. Get assaulted and beaten by your neighbor for something you never did? Meh. Get hungry? Eh. Get upset for a brief moment about all of this? YOU ASSHOLE. Let alone that I failed to commit suicide. Those in developed countries don’t know the fucking meaning of suffering.

I digress.

My best friend of five years betrayed me after shit-talking about me and lying to mutual friends of ours, blaming me for things I never did, using a pejorative of 'vegetable’ against my sister who suffers from down syndrome, and gaining illegal access to an online account of mine for malicious intent. I had to see this coming but I was naïve. During high school, I used to mix with the colored and black students because of mutual interests in arts and culture, though they weren't necessarily the best influence on me. Things started changing in 2009-ish (?) when a student transferred to my school and to my class. He claims that I just randomly followed him one day, and this was odd to him at first, but after that, things simply developed from there, and the next moment our relationship blossomed; we became good friends rather quickly. We had similar passions and interests, liked nature, older video games, exploring, fun science things, and had matching character traits, which explains why we got along. We were a real team, he and I.  We had a lot of plans for life. He was the big dreamer/entrepreneur/ambitionist, and I just tagged along with all his ideas. 

There was one idea, however, that I just didn't find that sound. He had planned to drag me and another mutual friend of ours along on a hike around the coast of South Africa, where I'm from, and camping at night and hiking during the day. Even if at first the idea did sound attractive since I wanted to see South Africa and learn more about it, I knew that this was just begging for us to get mugged, not only once but risking it many times over, especially considering my country’s staggering and infamous crime statistics. South Africa is considered the rape and murder 'capital' of the world, after all. I will not go into detail on that. When I kept insisting that I will not be coming along, he was upset and responded to my argument with rhetoric of how we are 'three grown men', and that he knew martial arts well, but his point did not resonate with either me or the other friend. I told him the idea was just too unrealistic, but focused on the fact that I wasn't fit enough to undergo such a journey in order to try to shift the blame, for lack of a better phrase, away from where it truly was. As a result of this conflict of interests, it never happened. 

I did tell him that I liked the idea, but that things were just a bit too bad at the moment. If it were in a developed nation that wasn't too cold or hot, I'd gladly jump aboard, leave everything and just go with him. He liked the music that I produced for fun, and we had planned to make a song ourselves as well, using funny and uncommon speech sounds in a rhythm manner; sadly, this never happened either. We had ideas for starting our own business and on this day, I'm very glad it didn't see the light of day. With my school’s entrepreneur’s day, we had our own temporary little venture in which we allowed the school pupils to vent out their frustrations on each other as participants to a fighting contest on a big, plastic-covered mattress, with the contestants obviously wearing protective gear. I was very surprised at the profits we turned that day, but more so found it hilarious. To recap, we were pretty good friends and would have tackled life head-on together, as soon as we left school. This never happened. 
Our relationship wasn't all moonlight and roses though. As mentioned earlier, I was mostly submissive to his ideas, and not just because of my introverted character. I never did like conflict and drama, but we had our fair share of this due to conflicts of interest and his persistent insistence that he was right about everything we argued about. I, on the other hand, was very pessimistic a lot of the time, but this was never mentioned to me. For the most part we did get along, but in retrospect, there was never any real growth in our relationship. It only dwindled from a while after it started. He had grown increasingly manipulative and megalomaniacal, started arguing with me often about the most trivial of matters, and there was never any love to go about. It was growing clearer to me by the day that this friendship thing wasn’t working out that well for both of us. I figured out that he didn’t properly learn how relationships worked, whether platonic or romantic, and his increasingly hostile attitude towards me most likely reflected the conditions in which he grew up, since his parents were divorced. I figured that there was much more to the parents (both of whom I met) than initially met the eye, and I'm assuming that it wasn’t a good relationship. This is purely speculative, however, but I deduced this much from how he started treating me after he started getting comfortable in our own friendship.

For this very reason I keep some things anonymous. I can be wrong but I don't know what else can explain his behavior. I'm very certain that it wasn't my fault. 

I cannot remember ever having encouraged any of this behavior, and I was also growing tired of the relationship feeling one-sided. In retrospect, I won't even call it friendship as much as it was an abusive relationship because there was a lot of emotional manipulation and control. He would come visit me just so that he could use my computer to play a game called World of Warcraft. I would visit him far less often than I used to because there was always conflict between his mother and him, and this was not her fault. He displayed an abhorrent attitude against her and I was caught in the middle whenever it happened. I mentioned earlier that I hate drama and conflict, so I visited him less, after which things just went south. It had turned ugly because of how hostile he was to me. But when I snapped at him once because I was angry about something, even if it happened long before this, I'm somehow the bad person. I didn’t even shout; I just got upset and said something I can’t remember but didn’t mean. There were no pejoratives, slurs or swear words, so it was trivial.
 
I started ignoring him because I had no breathing space in our relationship. I didn't want to be friends anymore and this angered him very badly. It never struck me as significant that he had suffered from bipolar, and this was at least half the reason he had anger issues, though I could be wrong about that. Ruminating for two years (during which I was more than willing to accept that I fucked up somewhere, and during which I felt as shit and guilty about it all as one could) about the whole incident, how and why things went south was what made me realize that it's a far more serious condition than I initially thought. His mom had made me aware of it, and at first, I shrugged it off because I didn’t realize how bad it was. Another friend, though this one I met over the internet, also suffered from this mental health condition and their characteristics weren’t awfully dissimilar, as far as I can remember. It’s a mixture of this, poor upbringing, and perhaps no small mix of jealousy because my family was always better off than his, or at least it appeared so from the outside. After my friend got the message (not a literal message) that I no longer wanted anything to do with him, he made it clear that he was very cross and furious about it. He ignored me at first in return, pretending that I don’t exist, but later he snapped. He was very pissed one evening and started lying about me, saying that he tried jumping in front of a car and I did nothing to stop him. This never happened. What happened was that, after going for a walk, which we did often because it was fun, a car did come along, and we were obviously on the opposite side of the road (there were no sidewalks). He did tell me that he was going to jump in front of the car. I just shook my head and said I was not going to allow it. He had been acting suicidal and depressed for a longer time back then and I did not know how to respond to it. I think he’s still mad at me to this day for not helping, when I didn’t know how. On one of his birthdays, I visited a little throw-together party that didn’t have much action. But it was a group of close friends so it didn’t matter. He had made no attempt in hiding his wrists that were full of cuts, and I could do nothing but frown and feel a little guilty. It was clear that he didn’t really attempt suicide because you can’t kill yourself by cutting your wrists. Still, I really didn’t know what to say about it so I just kept quiet.

To no longer digress, he started lying about me, strictly using capital letters to convey his anger by saying how pissed he was, how over a hundred people were mad at me because of ‘what I did’, but not even elaborating on that, how I made a girl cry (who never admitted to this despite my numerous probes), how he wanted to murder my family, as well as my ‘vegetable of a sister’, how he was going to get all his high school friends to come beat me up (even though they were my friends too), and how a friend of his told him to shoot me. Even though I was very surprised at his rage and outbursts, I don’t know why I didn’t take it personally. At least not up till a point where I had a dream of him lying to many people about me. Before this, I was mostly apathetic and unapologetic, ready to defend my case where I had to. But from thereon I wasn’t the same. Ever since the dream, it struck me just how bad things were, and after a while it started bothering me like nothing ever did before. I was starting to get very angry and wanted to hurt him really badly. I haven’t mourned and cried that hard ever before, and never realized up till then that emotional pain was a real form of pain. I did not deserve this. Before that, I just didn’t care. I was simultaneously happy and sad that we were no longer friends anymore. Not at least until he hacked into a chatroom account of mine, which had a password I shared with him for a World of Warcraft account, and promptly flooded the channel with spam. This is a trivial matter but it was then when I realized how much he hated me. But he knows exactly what he got for this.

I am not the first of his victims. Before all this shit went down, he used to have a girlfriend who lived not too far from him and she was the sweetest girl I’ve ever met. After a while they stopped dating and he told me that she got a restraining order against him. I didn’t know what to say so I did not say anything. After all this shit went down, he hurt two other female friends of mine from the internet too, if at least not one of them.

All this, in light of the fact that we were best friends; that I was there for you, while others judged you according a few unorthodox things you were accustomed to; in light of the fact that most of the friends you have today is thanks to me; in light of the fact that I’m the reason you got to go on that trip to the USA to attend Bronycon, because you wouldn’t have touched MLP otherwise; I opened you up to it. In light of how many times my dad helped your family out when they asked; in light of the fact that you got to use my computer to play some video games while I lied by saying I liked watching you play; and in light of the fact that my dad hosted you and your family at a holiday home once, free of charge.

I would gladly sacrifice all those things in order never to have met you, had I such a dashingly attractive option. As a side note, having told my dad this entire story, I’m the reason he didn’t help finance the car.

It makes sense to me why your friends from KZN started avoiding you. Savvy told me that ever since our incident, you’ve chosen your friends much more carefully, and that’s only a good thing because the less people you hurt, the better.

I hope you’re proud of yourself.

Bronies aren’t the better angels of our nature, and friendship is not magic. Thanks for reading.
