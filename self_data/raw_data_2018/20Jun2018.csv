2,"I'm 32, single and unattached I haven't been in a relationship in 7 years. My last serious relationship ended in late 2011. I didn't start college until later in life so I didn't finish until 2014. Now I'm trying to learn computer skills to get a better job. 

This is a good segue into my anger issues. I am taking some classes at a community college in my city over the summer, I got extremely frustrated at the lab today because it was a lot of work and I wasn't ready for it, it was impossible for me to understand. I tried to keep my composure but I'm pretty sure everyone knew I was pissed off. 

Some people can just figure this stuff out on the spot, it's difficult for me I've always suffered a disparity on highly technical precision skills like advanced mathematics or engineering skills. 

I don't want to do a trade because I don't really want to break my body like that. I don't think it's worth it.  It's just difficult, it's like I feel so much older and more mature but I still can't figure out what to do to give my life meaning and reach some kind of self actualization as Maslow put it in his theories. I wouldn't mind having just one child, but I haven't found a woman and it seems difficult and maybe not feasible without a higher income and the social status that goes with it.  I don't see myself as valuing what most Americans see as ascendant values.  I don't regard wealth and power with admiration, I save that for wisdom and virtue. Yet the only way to some kind of higher potential is through the structures and institutions which are in place in my epoch. It is not an easy dilemma, the burden wears heavy on me as I cast about with no meaning or direction.

3,"I work at a fast-food restaurant and have been at the place for almost two years. As a result, I’ve noticed the workplace change in terms of its employees and management. I can say I have a good work ethic (punctual, productive, and good customer service). I have learned almost all positions and know how to multi-task especially during rushes.   I began to notice a change in the work environment a few months after the store has gotten a new general manager.

I’m scrutinized for the smallest unintentional mistakes. I’m held to a higher standard meanwhile other “less productive” employees get second chances. Even some of those employees are getting promoted. I’m constantly reminded of what I’m suppose to do and by what time it should be done even though I already know what I’m doing. 

Surprisingly, favoritism was never an issue here until the store transitioned to new management. The store has suffered from this plague of a  selfish mentality “That’s not my job” or “I’m not responsible for that.” 

It is this favoritism that justifies management to pick and choose who gets promoted regardless of their merit. It’s this favoritism that allows them to target just who gets to be given some slack while others are examined to the smallest detail. It’s this favoritism that allows poor performing employees to continue working while others are held close to the possibility of termination for a mistake. 

In my case, I’m aware of how much reliance and criticism is put on me. I’m taken advantage of my work ethic. It seems that if I come for a shift it means that mostly everyone else can slack off just because I am there. Any mistake is subject to gossip. 

Sure, I cannot deny favoritism does not exist in the workplace but this environment has become a toxic workplace. There is no supportive team. No wonder most newly hired employees quit after a few days. Makes me wonder if it is best to resign. This is a decision I will make myself but don’t mind hearing anyone’s thoughts or suggestions. 

**TL;DR** My job has become a toxic work environment filled with favoritism and selfishness. I’m taken advantage of and held to a higher standard even though I have a good work ethic. ",20Jun2018,1
4,"Hello Reddit! I'm posting this from a throwaway because it contains a fair amount of info which could be tracked to real folk, but I really need to ask somebody who is not from my circle to give me advice on this. In any case, the information will be kept as vague as possible, so that you may form yourself an idea, but won't be able to get any precise data. This will also have NSFW parts. Also, english is not my main language, so forgive me if I make any mistakes!

**This is going to be long, don't say I haven't warned you!**

Ok, so first a bit of background: I'm a 19 y/o male. I've always been quite the special kid: I couldn't, apparently, speak at all until age 5 or 6, although I was pretty smart. When I was a kid, I read a lot and became, actually, pretty aware of my own situation as a living being, already as a kid, and could suddenly start talking and pronunciating stuff almost as well as an adult. I was quite the mood killer, and I've never understood exactly how do people exactly work (way better now). This has, however, compromised my whole life, as I've lived a pretty strange life. Don't get me wrong, I've had a pretty cool life, but there's always the bad parts. For one, I've been bullied, by girls (psychologically, at school (This is important)), and by boys in high school (pretty exhausting pranks, that whilst have affected me psychologically, I've never been physically harmed).

Not everything was bad, though: I've made quite some really good friends along the way, some of which are still with me, and I really appreciate it.

However, I've had a pretty hard time being friends with girls (until I was ending high school more or less). I had never understood them, and I kind of feared them, because if you dared to lay a finger on ANY girl (and with this I mean saying something which could be considered relatively nasty (with no sexual connotations)), suddenly EVERYONE seemed to turn against you, which kinda sucked. I knew there were nice girls around, but I was deadly scared of them, I feared that if I said anything to them which could be remotely out of tone, I would be instantly criticised, so I simply never speaked to them.

Don't get me wrong, I know, and knew, they were human beings just like me. However, to me it seemed as if they had a full network, where if you touched just one, the rest would fuck you up (and by touching I mean, as I said, saying something nasty to them, with no sexual connotations).

This had led me to become quite isolated in all the girly stuff that I just didn't get. For me, they were like magnets who pulled some of my friends away from me, which then (the girls) would look at me like a freak. As I said, I was quite the party-killer, whilst at the same time I had a slight superiority complex. I know, I cringe every time I think about it.

Alright, enough background. Let's get to the juicy story.

At high school, I met this girl, let's call her A. I had already known A all my life, but I had never spoken to her at all. I had a friend group of geeks and nerds (loved it, right where I belonged) and she suddenly sort of appeared there. She was just as a geek as all of our group, and there was more to it. A is, maybe, one of the most beautiful women I may have ever laid eyes on. I'm serious about it. I'm going to avoid descriptions just in case, but she was extremely nice and patient, really empathic, had similar interests, and physically a 10/10. She was also very shy, and had social anxiety.

I was just ""friends"" with her, in the sense that we didn't talk much, but we were cool with each other. I didn't actually speak much with her, until the last year of high school, when she had to drop out.

My memory is a bit foggy and I don't exactly remember how we started talking, but we started to get along really well. People from the group would start confessing their love to her (which was understandable, I'm not kidding when I say she was a 10/10), and only a few, including me, didn't. This set off a bit of group drama, but that's not the point.

With time, I started to actually get to know her. She had changed houses a few times, and had a really unstable family. Both her mother and father were alcoholics who couldn't keep a straight life, and would keep fucking up and making really stupid decisions. As I remember, although there was no physical abuse, there was plenty of verbal abuse. I vividly remember, for example, playing videogames, and stopping because she needed to vent, during which I would try to calm her down. By this point I considered her my best female friend, for she trusted me, and I trusted her. A really nice friendship had risen, where she would help me with a bit of my emotional mess, and I would help with a bit of her own mess, or we would talk about either philosophical stuff or the dumbest shit. She also commented that she hated having friends confess their love to her, for she didn't want to have anything with anybody in the group (both because she didn't want to spark any tension, and because she didn't like any of us, or so I think). I really understood her, it had to suck turning down a friend, knowing the feelings he would have. I emphatised with her, and I never thought it would happen to me, because I wasn't in love... ***right***?

You could have even said that we couldn't have been torn apart in any case, right?

Some time passed, and, suddenly, horrible news came to me: she had to move out of the country.

I discussed this with her, and while she didn't really like it at all, she was hopeful. She said that both her parents seemed to have controlled their own lives (not true, but we couldn't have known, especially with our age and inexperience), and she was really excited to see what would the other country be like.

She asked me to help her unpack some things, to which I agreed. I saw inside her house (she had never showed anyone her house), and helped her, whilst at the same time she gave me a small tour. At the time of leaving, we both looked at each other, we both knew that we wouldn't see each other for a very, very, very long time. I couldn't cry. We both hugged, wished her the best of luck, and went home.

Later, when she was already in the other country, the nasty stuff resurfaced: her parents had not changed a single bit. Abuse was still rampant, and they (A and her older sister) were stuck with them in a country from which they knew next to nothing.

I vividly remember A, being scared, texting to me about what should she do about her father, who would always reek of cheap alcohol, and who would always threaten to hurt them. In that aspect, I'll never forgive any of their parents.

Fortunately, A's older sister managed to contact their grandma, and they got out of the country, coming back to mine. 

I didn't know, but what had been friendship, was slowly turning into love. I didn't know shit about love, and I didn't realise that this sort of ""strong"" friendship, was actually love. I yearned to confess to her, hoping she would agree, and I yearned for any physical contact with her, be it a simple hug, a kiss, or sex. Not in any purely physical manner, but the opposite: making love with somebody you feel fully connected with. It took me a really long time to actually connect the dots, and realise what was going on.

""A"" managed to live with grandma, with a catch: she was in a town different than mine, and to get there you would require quite the travel, one you would only be able to make if you had the money and time (which neither of us had).

Once she was in the country, and we were able to, we hung out, and finally I confessed myself. I already knew the answer, she wasn't going to reciprocate, and obviously I was right.

Now, *this is where the fun begins*.

She was pretty much the source of 75&amp;#37; of positive emotions I had through the day. Any time a notification of a message from her appeared on my phone, my face would lit up. I discussed almost everything with her. Now, however, she had become a bit distant (we're talking about 2 years ago). We are still great friends, and we would do anything for the other, but, personally, there's not the same magic that there was before.

I confessed myself 2 more times, knowing that it was in vain, but I had to try and make myself really conscious of what was going on: that 10/10 girl wasn't going to choose me to be in a relationship. Consciously, I already knew, but I had to get that fact stuck in me somehow, as it seemed/seems like I can't grasp, unconsciously, the notion of her not wanting to be with me. She was really understanding of all of it, as I already had explained her that I would very likely confess to her again, out of pure stuborness. She has never held me any negative emotion for it, as she understands what I felt, and understood what was going on. She never left me alone, and she never ghosted me, something which I feared. For that, I'm extremely thankful, and no one ever will convince me that ""A"" has an ounce of evil in her body.

Now, this was the initial context. The problem is the following: I was in love with the *image* I had of her, not the real A. I had already built a lot of stuff around her personality, as if she was perfect and almost made for me, which she was obviously not. I loved her both mentally and physically, and the idealization made the rest. She's not perfect, of course, neither physically or mentally (that doesn't mean she stops being a 10/10 for me, tho).

And there's this issue: I don't seem to accept the fact that this 10/10 girl, ""A"", has escaped me (romantically), precisely when it's tremendously hard for me to bond **so much** with somebody. 2 years later, I've tried to not let my mind dwell too much on it, but that idealization still lingers on my mind:

Whenever I open porn, whilst I obviously like what I see, no girl gets any close as her. Doesn't matter how many internet points that porn star is rated, or how many people seem to adore it: it still isn't, for me, as beautiful as her. When it's time to masturbate, although I can still masturbate thinking about beautiful girls, I get the strongest feeling thinking about ""A"". For real. I might not be going well at all when masturbating, but at the instant she pops in my mind, my heart begins to race and I finish in an instant. I don't do it anymore because I know it's a mistake to recreate myself in an idealitzation, something that doesn't really exist, and will only cause more harm, reminding me of the romantical failure.

And here comes another part. I'ts been a really, really long time since I haven't felt the same for anybody, as I've felt for ""A"". I've met really nice people, and aroused by some girls (though I haven't even kissed any), but none compares to A. I fucking hate having to depend on that false construct to be happy, I don't want to live a lie. I know it's a lie, I've seen A a couple of times when I have been able to. She has a boyfriend now, who seems pretty cool, and who I actually want to know.

I think I may have depression, or a mild form of it, or something similar. I can quite relate the people that have it, but at the same time I'm not like them. I have a bit of ambition, and I refuse to fucking sink in misery, but at the same time it seems as if my mind was being slowly grated, milimiter to milimiter, although never ending it.

**So, you might be asking... what is my point,** ***exactly*****?**

My point is, that I want to learn how to feel again. I've hardly felt anything positive for a long time. You know that feeling when your heart is all warm and fuzzy, where it seems that nothing wrong can happen? When you *know* things will work out on the end?

I'm scared of falling in love. I feel it on me everyday. I know I want to love, and I want to trust, and yet my mind seems to be telling me the exact opposite: ""remember how it went with A? Yeah, let's not do that again."" At the same time, when I try to hook up with a girl, they don't usually show interest (not that it's unacceptable, of course, just discouraging). 

What I fear, though, is that what I feel for ""A"" isn't really love at all anymore. It might have been love before, but at times, I get this weirdly possessive vibe, and it can be called, really easily, an unhealthy obsession. I know it's an obsession, and I want to keep control of it, I want to supress it, to remove it. It's not healthy, and it doesn't allow me to think clearly. And this doesn't only happen with A, it happens also, at times, with girls I may fancy for a bit.

With all this, what I mean is that *I need to learn to love again*. I've learnt to hate, to defend myself, to keep friendships, to keep limits with certain people, but I can't, for the life of me, fall in love with anybody. I really miss that warm, fuzzy feeling. My mind cannot simply hold forever a life where I dwell on negative thoughts, where I only dwell on the dirt. I know that love exists somewhere in me.

I've lost, to a great extent, my motivation to do stuff, and this can't go forever. I need to set my wings open again, even if that means to get hurt. Because, ironically, preventing me from hurting myself will only hurt me way more in the long run.

**To sum up: I turn to you all, Reddit, because I need to know what must I do to go on. I feel as if I was stuck until this never-ending question is answered. I need to learn to love again, so I will get to be a decent person again, and not feel fucking miserable. I need to learn to shun away unhealthy obsessions, and to identify them away from positive emotions. I need to learn to cry, and to appreciate the small things, I need to learn to loosen up, to see all the colors on the palette.**

At this point, I'm currently writing stories, playing both guitar and cello, composing music, and also writing lyrics for said music. I really try to express myself the best I can, to unravel, at least, a part of the enigma I consider myself. I don't consider myself to have low self-esteem, but rather I don't see the chances/possibilities I can offer to this world, and to myself.

**Thank you for reading, really.** I do not expect for anybody to answer with something that will ease/solve all the problems, of course. However, I really need the input of somebody who doesn't know me personally, to infer in this issue, for it grows bigger day by day, relentlessly.

With all this said, have a nice day/night! Life's business never seems to rest, not even when we do.",20Jun2018,2

6,"I’ve had an issue with best friend, who is my crush. For the past two weeks, we haven’t been as close. And I think that it is safe to say that, “we are a thing.” My parents do not know about us. He was my first kiss, and he really makes me feel happy when I’m with him. We’ve been best friends since kindergarten. And one we both told each other that we liked one another about three months ago, I thought that it would be hard to transition from being best friends to partners. However, that was not the case. We really do like each other and we’re not shy about it.
However, our relationship is kinda a secret to the public. Yes, my school grade does know about it, but no parents know that we are a thing. 
My Crush has always been kind. And in this case....too kind. I feel like he’s always flirting with other girls. For the past two weeks, we haven’t been close at all. Before, we always would say I love you blah blah all that cheesy stuff. But now, whenever I say it, he never returns it. And when we meet in person, he isn’t as enthusiastic. It’s as if he’s tired of me. And in this case, I’m scared he is. He always talks to this one girl way more than me when we’re hanging out with the rest of our grade. I’ve tried to talk with him, but whenever I try and turn the subject into something serious, he quickly gives me a short answer and then changes the subject again. 
All my friend say to try and talk to him, but it just never works. I really want to tell my parents and the public that we are “dating” but now I just feel like he doesn’t want to at all.

13,"I felt like sharing a light hearted story about my first vehicle. TL;DR at end. 

My first vehicle was a 1990 Jeep Wrangler YJ. The thing was horribly loud, couldn't make it on most highways, was terrible on gas milage and broke down all the time; but man could it off road. 

I am from the city and never encountered many dirt roads, however I wasn't the worst rider (but certainly not the best). Almost all my friends were from rural areas and all knew or had an idea of how to off road. I got into their group and joined the ranks of some of friends who owned 4wd 8 cylinder trucks and one who even had a lifted FJ. We tried our best to go every couple months and spend all day in the mountains taking the craziest trails. 

Now let me preface this, I am a rule follower; to my demise. I follow speed limits follow every little rule and law set out. So much so it makes my friends angry at times. However, when I got off road, and I knew I couldn't get in any trouble out there and I let the pedal hit the floor and went crazy. I eventually got known for that. Being an absolute maniac when I hit dirt was my thing. From drifting a dirt field to slamming into mud bogs, nothing was off the table, until that day.

I was bored on my day off and my friend had just called me to ask if I wanted to go off roading. It was perfect conditions. It had just snowed, but enough had melted to create mud and it was cool enough not to overheat in my Jeep, which was like a freaking greenhouse. Of course I say yes and I get in my Jeep and storm off to my doom. We meet up and things are going well, I'm having fun, the Jeep is running great and there's not a problem in sight. 

Here's where things get messy. We finish the ride and have to head back on some back country dirt roads before hitting a highway to get home. I am leading at this point with my friend trailing me. I see that the dirt road is kind of muddy too, drop a gear, and I have some fun on my way back. I come over a hill too fast, open the throttle going down hill and hit the brakes to turn the corner. My brakes lock up. My steering wheel has no affect. I'm stuck in icy mud going downhill at around 35mph and gaining. I slam into a roadside ditch, hit a tree, flip the Jeep on the passenger side and side a few more feet. 

All this happened so fast and I have come to my senses before I realize I'm sideways in my Jeep, still buckled in. My engine is dead now and my phone is somehow still plugged into the car charger, just dangling on the cord. My soft top is shredded somehow and I'm suddenly very cold. My friend comes running up and screams in to make sure I'm okay. I kinda look myself over and give him an affirmative ""yes"" as I stare at him through what was my roof. I lean myself over and stand on the passenger door before unbuckleing and getting out. Not a scratch on me.

After calling some people and coming to my senses we flip the Jeep right side up and tow it home. The engine still ran, the frame was still straight. Besides some dings and scratches, only one of the leaf springs got damaged. In the end, I traded it in (plus some money) for a Civic. As much as I love the reliability and mpg, a stupid part of myself still misses that stupid little trooper of a Jeep. 

TL;DR I was stupid and drove my Jeep into the side of the road, flipped it, and bought a new car because of it. ",20Jun2018,2

20,"In high school at your generic drinking party with some friends, we drunkenly confessed our feelings for each other. So I kissed her, we started making out and if I remember correctly (or as correctly as I can, we were drunk after all), I started to put my hand in her pants. I remember hearing her moaning and that got a few guys attention. So I figured I should talk with her alone, really confess. So I grabbed her hand and started to head away from everyone to the park by our friends house. But we were too drunk hahah and my buddy had to help us get back to his house.
 The next day, I was confused, nervous and a little excited to explore this. I talked, or rather I believe it was through text. I asked her if we could talk about what happened the night before. She said she wanted to pretend like it never happened and to not speak of it again. That hurt. But I listened. I never spoke of it, and she distanced herself and we began to just argue all the time and resent each other. We became toxic for each other but some how, we always ended up running in to each other. I mean we ended up having THREE jobs together in succession after high school. I don’t  know if it was the gods trying to have us run into each other but it’s weird, right? 
Later, a friend of mine found her tumblr. 2 or 3 years later, I read that she believes I sexually assaulted her. I was horrified. I’ve been sexually assaulted a few times, from friends and family. I would never wish that on anyone. I was in love with her. I didn’t know then.. I know that it’s not what your Intentions were but how you made the other person feel. I get that and I feel so terrible that I made her feel that way at all. Reading her tumblr, she remembered what happened completely different. She had the notion that I was rough with her or something and she made me seem like such a predator. I’m not ever sure if she remembers we confessed our feelings. I wondered if she wanted to remember. Maybe she wasn’t ready to accept her attraction for females? Im honestly not sure what happened. I think over the years she twisted the drunken memory. I’m sure I have too. I thought she had consented, she said she wanted to try again with  me and that she’s liked girls before and had a girlfriend in catholic school.

P.s. she now uses this incident as a defining factor for her life, her transition into her sexuality. She’s gay now or bi now I believe. So I know her feelings were real too.. I mean she invited me to family vacations... hah I want closure. I know I cannot fix what has happened,  but I wish we could mend this conflict. Understand both sides. Hopefully we could be friends or at least civil so we don’t have to split our friend group. Did I really assault her? I’m confused sexually, emotionally and all around guilty for hurting someone I was so close to. Help",20Jun2018,4

26,"Idk what to do anymore. Some of my friends are all happy with their lives and some friends are having absolutely everything wrong happen to them. Here I am. Just in the middle. I’m having nothing exciting and nothing to worry about. It’s a state of confusion almost. It’s like torture. This is all so confusing. I dont know what to do here and now, and in the time ahead. Everything is an uncertainty, uncertainties with larger probabilities of something going wrong. I don’t want to go to college, but that’s the only way to do what I must do... I want to make my parents proud, but I don’t want to grow up. If I grow up, years go by faster... and when that happens, family disappears quicker... soon I’ll be the parent... watching my children leave.... It will all happen so fast and I know it will.

I want to see everything, capture every damn moment and store it, somehow, somewhere. Share it with others. See it all again for myself. Live the highs, observe the lows. Do everything in between. It won’t happen though. This life, possibly the only life, will flow through time like a river through a valley, seen but not observed. I can’t let that happen, but I dont know how to ensure it won’t. but life goes on and so will I. maybe I fret over nothing. maybe some day I’ll look back and think that I lived my life in the best way I could, and I wouldn’t have done it any differently. maybe... just maybe.

We keep in touch through texts and stuff, although we don't talk on the phone much. he had been sick for the past few days and he told me he had bad diarrhea and just felt awful. I talked to him about 12 hours ago and I told him to go to the doctor, but he said he was feeling better since yesterday. About 7 hours after that my mom got a call from the family he is staying with. Long story short, he vomited and then went unconscious and has been unresponsive since, so they called an ambulance. They came and did a CAT scan at the hospital. he has a fucking brain aneurysm. He's 21 and has always been in decent shape and has worked hard. Hes the smartest guy I know too. They won't know anything for another few hours or so they said. I don't know what to do. My brother is one of my best friends and he's older than me so he's always been there to give me advice and make fun of me. Now he's not there and he might never be again. I am terrified that I'll never get to talk to him again and that he will be just a stupid fucking memory and it's just not fair. i know rationally that there's no order to the universe or whatever, but he is a great person and he deserves to live more than anybody. If he dies, my parents will be devastated and so will my sister and so will I and it will be fucking bullshit. I remember reading on reddit a few days ago and brain aneurysms came up. I had read about them before, and this time I did what I always do when I hear about something like that ""Wow thats so awful and it would be terrible if it happened to me or someone I loved."" Such fucking bullshit that this had to happen to my brother. I don't know what to do and I just really really want more than anything for him to live and be okay.

32,"Not really looking for responses, just yelling into the void after my ex of almost 3 and half years already began dating someone else 2 months after breaking up. I'm happy that she found someone else, I'm just frustrated because she told me while we broke up was because she said that relationships weren't for her. Like, I shouldn't be upset, yet I am for some reason? Maybe because I still love her? Mostly I feel like it's because she said that she didn't want to be in a relationship and she does this?  


I shouldn't be upset, I've casually been meeting people, nothing serious because of a distraction? But yet this bothers me so much. Just need to keep my cool and work on myself. I wish I could still talk to her, it's been two months and she said we could still be friends because it was mutual. Towards the end, we both wanted out so we can work on ourselves. But I miss her even if she was the complete opposite of me and her life choices and friends went against my personal philosophies. Fuck. Why am I like this? How did she move on so fast?

36,"So I've been on antidepressants since about last September or October, and so far they've actually been pretty good. I was on another prescription before and those hardly helped, but the newer prescription has been way better. However, I also feel like I still feel depression kind of creeping in lately because I'm stressed out about my life circumstances. 

I'm really trying to move abroad next summer and I know I need to start saving money... yesterday, but I haven't gotten any of the jobs I've been applying to over the last few months. This has made me start resenting my current job even more, because I just have a retail job and it's very difficult to save money since I'm only just getting by. It's also frustrating because it feels like an extreme waste of time. I'm about to enter my last year of college and I know I'll have a much better chance of getting a job afterwards if I've already started getting experience in my desired field. Now I get really sad and anxious when I go to work because I feel like I should have a better job, and I also feel like going to work just completely drains my energy and I feel unable to get things done outside of work because I'm either spending the time getting ready for work or trying to unwind after work. 

Then a lot of times I end up feeling anxious on my days off too because it feels like I have so many things to get done all within that one day off and I get scared that I'm not going to use my time effectively. Today when I woke up and after I walked my dog, I ended up spending about 3 hours fading in and out of sleep because I just felt exhausted and unable to get out of bed. I know this is an issue I had before I was on my current meds, too. 

I feel like there's so much stuff I should be getting done, and I can't tell if they're not getting done because I'm not trying hard enough or if I really do have a finite amount of energy. I feel so stuck, and at the beginning of the summer I was feeling positive about getting to work more and make more money and I felt positive about my chance to get a new job. Nothing panned out, and now I feel like I'm back to being as depressed as I was before. Plus, I didn't realize what an emotional toll working more was going to take on me. I'm just constantly swinging between feeling anxious and shitty because I feel like it's my fault my life isn't changing, but also recognizing that some things are out my control and I need to listen to my body when I feel physically unable to get things done. 

I'm wondering if I need to up my medication, but my psychiatrist moved and I don't have another one. And getting an appointment with a new psychiatrist usually takes a few weeks at least. I feel like I'll be fine if I up them myself as long as I add the increased dose in to my routine in phases. I also googled the standard doses and made sure I wouldn't be exceeding that. My friend isn't keen on the idea of me changing my meds without supervision, which I get. But can slightly increasing my meds really be that big of a deal if I stay within the healthy dose limits?

38,"I've been at the same job almost 10 years now, I'm 28. It pays well (especially considering my education level and skill set) and has great benefits, but the list of cons grows every year. The work is mind numbingly boring, which was ok for a while but is getting to the point where it's not worth it. Since I've started there's been horrendous management bloat, and they get more unreasonable and demanding day by day, and seemingly they get stupider too. It's just bad decisions all the way down and the guys at the bottom - like me - have to deal with it. On top of that, they've been aggressively pursuing punishments for increasingly minor infractions, to the point I would consider it harassment. Personally they've literally made up stuff to try and punish me for, and when presented with contrary evidence, try to pretend it never happened, without removing the incidences from my record.

So after 10 years I think I'm done here. I never wanted to retire from here anyway. I'm extremely lucky to have parents willing to foot the bill for my education, and even allow me to stay at their place rent free. That's what really put it into perspective. Guys I work with would tell me if they had the same opportunity they would've quit years ago, really made me realize I was throwing away a golden ticket.

It's still scary though, because once I leave here, there's no going back. I can't return to my old job if I quit, and nowhere is gonna pay me as much for my limited skill set. I'm looking at a more than 50% income reduction while also trying to go to school, but I think it's worth it. I can't take it here anymore, and for that reason the thought of walking out and never coming back is incredibly liberating. The day I made the decision it was honestly like my whole outlook changed, there was a light at the end of the tunnel now.

44,"I have been trying to avoid political topics on social media lately. And this isn’t because  I am scared to talk about politics. In fact, I believe that having a healthy discussion is vital to how we develop educated beliefs and convictions. And I don’t mean “healthy discussion” in the form of a so called “echo chamber” that we see happen so often; I don’t mean we tell ourselves that the discussion is healthy because it supports a comfortable  viewpoint, and doesn’t make us angry. I mean “healthy discussion” as in, actually listening to and attempting to understand another view point, no matter what your first reaction may be.

So this is what I tell myself before I attempt to write this post.  I am sitting here writing this because I genuinely believe that this topic is important to our society’s well being and the legacy that we are creating for ourselves. I ask you, if you are reading this, please read what is being said. If this topic is one that you are passionate about, one way or the other, I ask you to please bring an open mind. If you find yourself skeptical about any claims that are made, I ask you to continue reading, and think to yourself “why am I skeptical to this”. To those of you that begin to read, and find yourself upset, uncomfortable, angry or in disagreement with what is said, I BEG of you to read what is being said, and ask yourself WHY this brings out the reaction that it does in you.

The topic I am talking about is the news on the “Tender age shelters” that has just been released. If you have a strong opinion about this already, I again ask you to continue reading, and really think about your opinion as you read. I don’t mean to say this in a condescending manner, I truly believe that confronting these uncomfortable opinions are extremely important to forming your best possible idea, belief or value on a topic. 

If you have not heard anything about this topic, this is a brief summary on what I have found in the news: 

Recently the Associated Press published an article, with the headline “APNewsBreak: Youngest migrants held in ‘tender age’ shelters”. The article goes on the explain that in early May of 2018, the president’s administration has enacted a zero tolerance policy in regards to immigration at the border. As a direct result of this policy, children considered to be a “tender age” of thirteen or less to be separated from their parents and housed in what the article calls “”tender age’ shelters“. I believe there have been three shelters built so far, with plans of a fourth shelter being opened soon, along the southern border. Officials have explained that they must be protective of the locations of the children being housed. The article states: “ ‘In general we do not identify the locations of permanent unaccompanied alien children program facilities,’ said agency spokesman Kenneth Wolfe.”

The number that has been released in regards to the amount of children that have been separated from their families is 2,342.

This influx of children in this short amount of time has caused a significant drain on government resources.

Several important details released regarding these shelters have been confusing. Some of the details discussed in the article are: the logistics of housing so many small children institutionally; any policy with regards to an actual age that a small child, baby or infant is separated from their family; the standards applied to those taking care of the children; the amount of children that are in certain demographics (for example, whether the child is verbal or nonverbal).

Recently, a mother named Beata Mariana de Jesus Mejia-Mejia was released from custody while her case for asylum in the United States was pending. She has sued the president’s administration, as she has not seen her seven year old child since they were separated. She believes that her son may be housed in a shelter in Arizona. 

I would like to go back and explain why I think this is important. This is one area where I hope to find a lot of similarities with others, regardless of the polarity of the issue. I have been taught my whole like to be proud to be an American. To me, this means that being American should invoke certain ideals and principles within me. I am well aware that our history is flawed, and depended upon the work, enslavement, segregation and all around degradation of others. I believe this to be irrefutable fact. There seems to be a battle in my own mind between  two justifications that make it acceptable to be “proud to be an American”. One option is to willfully choose ignorance, in response to the sense of shame that this information brings about. This may happen in ways that I do not even consider, as pride can be underestimated as an  emotional force within. The other option is to use this information to \*\*learn\*\* from the mistakes of our history, and empower the idea that being “American” means that one is a defender of certain ideals, among them being equality, and righteousness for \*every single\* human being in existence. Our sense of equality is \*\*not\*\* defined by the government. Our human rights are \*\*not\*\* defined by the government. The people being governed have come together and certain people have come to the agreement that certain principles are righteous to all. While they may have taken the time to define \*some\* of these principles, no individual or collection of individuals is the origin of these rights. Continuing this logic, the rights we abide by are not applicable only to us as Americans, but to all as human beings.

I desperately want to be able to claim pride in being American. There may be flaws with this desire, but I do not believe in blind pride. When I want to be proud to be American, I want to \*\*deserve\*\* to be proud. I can relate to those who want to claim a powerful sense of pride in their homeland. However, historically, blind pride and nationalism has been an extremely slippery slope. It is easy for us to sit here in hindsight and claim that we would never find ourselves in the positions that so many found themselves in during the greatest atrocities in history. However, if we truly want to be able to say that we would be better than those that may have come before us, we must first approach things with an open mind, so that we may recognize when the very things we claim to stand against come to reality. An extremely common, and extremely controversial comparison that I have seen. has been to that of Nazi Germany. This makes me uncomfortable -- and it \*\*should\*\* be uncomfortable. I do not want to make an assertive viewpoint that we are or are not following in the same footsteps as the people of this period have. I do not believe that I have \*enough\* information, historically and contextually, to make that call. However, I do have what I hope to be a basic understanding of the history of this period. I do think that I can place myself in the shoes of others that may have fallen into a particular trap, and hope that I can look enough inside myself to find the character to recognize and stand up for what I truly believe in.

There have been two other pieces of media regarding these shelters that have had an impact on me regarding the news of these shelters. The first was a recording of some of the children  in a shelter. They were in hysteria, screaming and crying. I do not speak Spanish, but the video I saw had bold subtitles that translated what the children were saying. Having it translated seemed to make the video more morbid, as I was able to relate what these kids were saying into something that I can understand -- into something that I could picture a child in my life saying. The second video that I saw was a recording of an MSNBC reporter initially receiving the breaking report from the AP. The reporter was unable to compose herself, holding back tears and looks of genuine shock as she read the report. The reporter seemed to beg her team to take her away from the center of attention as the news continued to roll.

Now, I recognize the importance of skepticism in today’s media cycle. I worried, and hoped, that the information being presented may have been somehow a misrepresentation. I saw my friends gut reactions of anger and disgust, and hoped that they were misguided, and the result of manipulative media. In a sense, I can see how others may make these claims. I can see how this hope and want may cause one to seek out media that truly \*\***is**\*\* exaggerated or illegitimate. It is truly heartbreaking that this type media is so prevalent. There will inevitably be false stories pushed as fact, on either side of any issue. Scholastically, we call this “propaganda”. Casually, we call this “fake news”. The problem is, that once you find one example on either spectrum of any issue, it erodes at the trust in any trust you may have in this viewpoint. So when you seek this news out, and find a sense of comfort or validation in the fact that you may have been able to find these instances of propaganda, you begin to feed into a confirmation bias. You may actively or subconsciously begin to follow this bias to force yourself into a conclusion that is simply a comforting lie. It is important to try to find as much differing discussion on an issue, and learn to find ways to critically analyze the discussion's legitimacy.

With this in mind, I wanted to understand more behind the sense of outrage that so many seemed to feel. I knew that both of these videos I had seen where in reference to some new information regarding children and our immigration policies. I started here to research the issue. I found a few different headlines that all mentioned the “tender age shelters”. I found the AP article that I summarized above. This was a more “primary” source than simply a video of someone reacting to the article (although, the article still references other sources, so there is room for bias here. I believe this article to come from a more reputable source, but there is room to dig closer to the source). I attempted to find commentary on both sides of the issue.

For me, I try to put myself in the place of those that are being affected. I have met and befriended people in my life who have immigrated to the country, some seeking asylum, some seeking better opportunity, and some who I truly do not know enough about their motives to speak on. It is unfortunate, but I can definitely see how there may be a significant portion of the population who may struggle to relate to these people. It is hard to relate to someone if have literally never had any interaction with them. There seems to be a knee jerk reaction that goes something similar to “if you didn’t want to be separated from your family, you shouldn’t have illegally crossed the border”. 

I may be misrepresenting this viewpoint in my discussion here, but I have genuinely seen this sentiment shared by several people in various forms of social media. However, for every time I see this sentiment, I see others responding with very confrontational, very personal retaliations. While I may agree with the \**sentiment\** of these responses myself, I find myself frustrated with the way that it is handled. We find ourselves butting heads with others, and eventually it becomes a game of simply arguing for the sake of arguing. There is no productive discussion to be had here, and there is no progress to be found in this kind of conflict. I have gotten quite a bit off topic here, but I do so hoping to help send my point across some aisle. 

I understand that there may be some cases where an individual issue may not be representative of the entire problem. However, consider the figures. Mentioned above, the number that has been released in regards to the amount of children that have been separated from their families, since this policy went into effect early last month, is 2,342. That is **\*\*two thousand, three hundred and forty two\*\*** families with an extremely controversial action being taken upon them in roughly six weeks. That averages out to about 390 families being affected a week, 56 families being impacted a day, or 2 families being impacted in an hour. In just six week, immeasurable damage has been done to a significant amount of people. 

I want you to try to imagine. Imagine any time that you may have done something illegal. This might be smoking weed, or simply driving too fast down a road. Historically, this may have been having a different opinion those that are ruling you. Historically, this may have been believing in a particular set of beliefs. Historically, this may have even been having grandparents, or family that you have never met, that were on the “wrong” side of things. Now you are discovered by some intimidating group of people. And your family is rounded up. You are just 5 years old, not even old enough to have begun learning about basic addition, or how to form friendships, or what love is, and you are separated from your family. Imagine that your cousin, that \*\***your\*\*** friend, tha**t \*\*your**\*\* younger brother, tha**t \*\*your**\*\* younger sister tha**t \*\***your\*\* daughter, t**hat **\*\*your\*\* son was taken. Imagine that they were taken and murdered out of fear that they may inspire rebellion. Imagine that they were taken to be sold off to others in the name of slavery. Imagine that they were taken into camps described by Anne Frank and Ellie Wiesel, and tortured or killed, because your mother and father had been identified by a yellow star and particular ideology. 

**\*\*Now imagine that this same young child was brought across several countries to a land that promised hope, and protection from a violence that has plagued your community for many years. Imagine that this young child was forcibly separated from their family. Imagine that you had no way of knowing where this young child was being kept, and the details of their conditions were vague at best, and that their cries were recorded to be used as a deterrent to prevent others’ from attempting anything similar.\*\*** And imagine another person refusing to listen to your story. Imagine this person stereotyping you with others from a similar nation, and blaming you for problems that are out of your control. Imagine the feeling of despair, when your very real concerns are sidelined with claims that you  somehow deserve this.

45,"Hey everyone,

Ever since I hit puberty I had a tendency to isolate myself and just play videogames or spend my time on 9gag and later reddit. I'm 20 now and after school I did one year of volunteering in the Netherlands (I'm german) and had a lot of time to think about me and life in general.

I always thought during school that something about me is not quite right, I didn't really think of it as a depression, but something wasn't right. When that dissappeared at the beginning of the year I was glad and happily went along with it, but it had come back just as suddenly as it had left.

Now I was more sure it was a depression, but since I lived in a small village I didn't even bother searching professional help, I would only have a few months until my year was over. I read an article on psilocybin used in therapeutic settings to combat depression and since psychedelic truffles are legal there we experimented a little.

It helped massively, I realised I had nothing to fear in the people around me and after some thinking about my experiences I somewhat shifted my view of the world in general. The bottom line is while it did help, it seems I still had (and have) things to figure out.

When I moved to a new city to study at first all was well, but especially when the second semester started, it all quickly went back to before the voluntary year. I got into my old thinking habits, started to isolate myself more and finally gave in to the old videogame habits. I played for hours every day for several weeks. I started smoking weed more than in the Netherlands and had had some problematic weeks with smoking as well. However weed also got back into a psychedelic mindset and made me realise how nonsensical my videogame habit was. I told my parents about this and visited family members who live closer.

I'm not free of my problems but I am right now on a path to betterment.

I started a habit of going to local swimming pools and I enjoy it.

Yesterday I had a difficult day and smoked a joint I really didn't need. Well, maybe it sort of helped, but I couldn't sleep until so late at night and it was some sort of escapism and I know that's not good for me now.

I am better again today and I hope this will continue, I'm fucking ready to work for it.

Thanks for reading (if you have any questions, feel free to ask)",20Jun2018,36
46,"I’m convinced it’s mostly for men who haven’t been able to please a suitable woman for whatever reason, and problematic because it messes with your sexuality and sexual function.

When I was in my late teens / early 20’s I watched a lot of mainstream porn because it was the thing that was right there. I went down various rabbit holes with niches and categories seeking novelty and hyper exaggerated aspects of benign things, ultimately ending up at much more hardcore high production value porn.

It took me a long time to get away from that, and the thing that did it wasn’t my will power, it was being lucky enough to be with the right women and figuring out how to genuinely give them what I wanted, not what I thought I wanted.

But before this it really messed with my desires and warped my expectations in totally unrealistic ways. These days I can’t stand anything mainstream, it just seems so absurd. Especially the actors faking it. Once you’ve been with numerous women who enjoyed the experience and you see what that looks and feels like, the “performance” given in mainstream porn just feels icky.

If I do watch porn now, only amateur porn does anything for me, it has to be real.

I suffered from some erectile dysfunction during my mainstream porn phase when with real women, and it’s so clear now it was due to this fake porn rewiring my sexual circuits during this time. I’ve also a couple of friends who tell the same story, and they’re just the ones who’re willing to be honest about it. My guess would be these problems are widespread. I can’t even imagine what must be happening to the minds of children who have grown up with access to this stuff, I feel like because my exposure happened in my late teens I just managed to escape any lasting psychological damage.

Anyway I just wanted to share that and see if anyone else could relate or had opinions on the subject matter.

49,"[Picture of rosaries being confiscated](https://i.imgur.com/74UhCID.jpg)

It's really upsetting to see shocking examples of humans stripping their fellow kin of their last shred of hope and belief to carry on in what must be a living hell for them.

What is also sad is when you realise that the picture being circulated is over a year old and wasn't taken at the detention centre recently featured in the news. It's sad because you know that the anger and desire to take action friends momentarily had is about to dissolve into nothingness, because their outrage is so fragile and sensitive to inauthenticity.

Fact checking sites like Snopes will tell you that the exact same practice of removing rosary beads from migrants is happening in the detention centre we hear about this time round, but for many people that is beside the point. Anything less than 100% fact is not good enough. They've feel they've been duped.

It's like there is a collective depression weighing down upon us all and the shocking memes we consume daily are drugs fed into the system that hopefully can give us the jolt of will power we need to move, even if those drugs are out of date. They worked before so hopefully they'll work again. Hopefully they'll give us the ability to actually feel the reality of what's happening right now because we can sense we're in a critical moment, we just can't feel it enough.",20Jun2018,2

52,"So this is a new development...

I’ve been alive for 40 years. Dating for 25 of those years. Aware of my feelings for men for 30+ of those years. And never once have I felt anything more than friendship for women. And then the other night I met a beautiful woman who I just immediately wanted to kiss. We hung out as friends at first because I had no idea if she was interested in anything more than that. And I was 200% fine with just friendship if that’s what she wanted...and then she held my hand. Literal sparks may have actually flown. And then I kissed her. And it was like nothing else existed but the two of us. This woman who has never been interested in anything other than big strong men just wants to touch her and kiss her and bury my face in her.

Have you guys ever been surprised by your feelings like this? My dream of being polyamorous was always about men. I wanted relationships with women but it was always as friends.

59,"Hi r/self

I have a feeling which I have been stuck for awhile now. First of all I'm gonna introduce myself, I'm a 16 year old male in high school that is happy with his life(most of the times). School is done in about a week and I have this thought in my head constantly that I'm missing a lot for someone my age. Let me explain why I have this feeling, I know a lot of people(around my age) that have a lot of plans this vacation like going to festivals, parties, beautiful places in different countries, etc and I have this feeling that my life is passing me by, people my age have so much planned and here am I planned nothing except for probably staying home and doing nothing fun the next 2 months.

I have been stuck with this feeling for months now but it never had such a big influence on me and I don't know what to do with it, and I wanted to ask if these feelings that I have right now are normal and if they are warranted or if I'm just exaggerating and should calm down.

60,"I'm currently on my way to going to a zoo opening with my closest female friend ... And her brother (who is also my friend). I know I shouldn't be upset that it's this way but it does. We were getting so close that I honestly thought that she would like the idea of hnaging out with me, _just_ me. She already rejected me during the earlier stages of our ""rekindlement"" but honestly, I thought our friendship grew to the point of spending one-on-one time together, especially since she treats me so well when we're out with friends. She treats like her best friend when people are around. Even when just us (driving to and from friends' houses), we laugh and chat and even have serious conversations. I've asked her if she wanted to hang out with me at my house but she's never home and out of town most of the time. When she is home, she's helping her family.

It seems to me that America isn't getting any less racist. We're just carefully creating acceptable parameters for it. Racism is ~~a natural but outdated survival tool for presociety humans~~ a tool of oppression that can only be wielded by one race in particular.

Of course that's not true. Anyone can be racist, all they have to do is make distinctions based on race. If six Mexican students band together to violently beat the only black student in school attempting to drive them out, that's racism, it doesn't depend on the ethnicity of the aggressor and it never did. Racism is defined by motive.

I've encountered racism in a couple of parts of the world. Japanese racism is incredibly polite. I could live under Japanese oppression (bad joke / mostly true). Kuwait was uncomfortable, but almost entirely for my uniform: it only seemed like a hard place to live for women and the poor (most people are foreign nationals anyway). America has been the most hostile place to me, by a wide margin. That includes my time spent in active warzones that I didn't include above.

The non-twist is that I'm white.

See, in all honesty I don't care about myself in this scenario. I don't particularly feel like I'm in any danger. What I'm really interested in is seeing an end to stupid, senseless conflict. Or at *least* a shift to the hyperpolite racism of Japan (yeah, I set the bar of humanity real low). And to do that you've basically got to foster a sense of compassion and understanding. You know, that thing MLK talked about. And end to divisive rhetoric.

Nobody is going to read this and feel a a net positive in race relations.

65,"I don't want to bore people to tears with paragraph after paragraph of my concerns so I'll try to keep things short and sweet, but there is a lot to get through as I have a number of issues which are really impacting me living a healthy, happier life. I also don't have a huge support network, so I'm hoping (praying?) people here can fill in that gap. I do see a counselor.

I appear to have a very difficult time establishing good relationships with people, and whilst I understand people tend to come and go in life...I seem to have experienced this more-so than others. I show genuine interest in other people and sure enough I can make some pretty good friends, but more often than not these new-found connections are short-lived and I find myself very much alone with very few people to talk to or spend time with. What few, genuine friends I do have seem to think the world of me, but they don't really make much of an effort to keep in contact or plan anything. Unfortunately, I find myself getting upset and a little jealous when I see more outgoing people thriving off their social success, and feeling I can never achieve such.

By extension to the above, I've also made a number of toxic ""friendships"" over the years which have hurt my self-esteem / confidence. I've cut all of these people out of my life, but I'm left feeling empty or second-guessing myself as to whether or not I'm a good person, because they make me feel this way. A couple of examples would be a female friend who turned an entire social group against me (no idea how, either) and another friend who completely fell out with me for, erm...leaving a night club early.

My first love, who I had a relationship for four years, falsely accused me of emotional and implied sexual abuse. I was devastated when this happened and spent the few years since then seeking therapy / counselling. There have never been repercussions from this accusation other than my own internal bullying / fear, and everyone who knew me at the time were by my side. My second love, who I dated for six months, was a much better partner in general but whom I ended things with when it was clear she was not over an ex. She was with someone else soon after. Despite both of these relationships occurring years ago, I find myself depressed over what I've lost and upset that I may have been forgotten or the good parts of our relationship / me ignored.

My current dating life is, well, non-existent. I've tried dating online and off, ranging from attempting to establish a serious relationship to simply a casual hookup, and I've had no success in any of these areas. I've had my profiles reviewed, spoken to friends and family, spoken to people online, hired a dating coach...and all of them have told me I'm a great guy, very attractive, have a lot going for him...all of which I always thought would have given me some advantage. It's knocked my confidence certainly, which in itself is an issue, but it's very disheartening to read stories or even witness myself how easily people seem to find casual sex or a date. I do go out clubbing / to bar regularly but have never made contact with a woman in these settings (and am seemingly invisible to women in general), and online although I do get a fair number of matches they never translate into anything.

My family is dysfunctional and has been for years. A conflict between my mother and father has been ongoing since I was around twelve years of age, and they are ignorant to any effect it may have had on my upbringing. It often feels that I am trying to keep the family together by listening to their rants, but on the flip-side they also don't appear to take me seriously or treat me like an adult. A lot of what I have achieved has been done off my own back, as my parents were never truly supportive (and would often try to put me off things, for example going to university).

I was bullied as a child in high school. Enough said about that, really.

Despite all of this, I seem to do very well in life. I used to have severe social anxiety which, over the last few years, I've managed to overcome and put myself into situations I never thought possible. I have achieved very highly in my academic endeavors and the organisations I have worked for (I have done a TON of volunteer work) have praised my efforts, resulting in me being mentioned in articles, invited to interviews or to give talks etc. People have expressed how proud of me they are and have told me how much of an amazing person I am. I've been told many times, specifically and without prompting, that I come across as a confident, kind, intelligent and interesting person, and have also heard it mentioned that I'm ""very popular"". Throughout counselling / therapy it has never been alluded to or even outright said that I have something fundamentally wrong with me, in fact I've often been told I'm an emotionally mature, sensible, kind-hearted, intelligent guy who ""will go far in life"" and whom ""will be fine"". In life I don't really aspire to much; I simply want to live a happy, comfortable life and have a decent amount of social / dating success as well as begin a career in teaching, but it forever seems to be out of reach.

Thoughts? Advice? If anyone knows of any other sub-reddits to post this in, that would be great too.

TL;DR

I have a lot of issues in life which I am unable to address because I don't truly know what, if anything, I am doing wrong. A lot of negative things have effected my self-esteem / confidence, but I have also come leaps and bounds from who I once was. I've struggling to make friends, get dates, and the few experiences I do have more often than not end up failing. I'm at a loss, and feel depressed.",20Jun2018,7

during that period in which we sort of friend broke up, our entire friend group had dismantled, and i moved to one group while he isolated himself. i decided to move on, it was a lost cause trying to get him back, no matter how much i had cried and how mad i got at myself. i became best friends with the person who he liked, purely out of convenience. we did everything together and i let him vent to me, like i would vent to my old friend. i didnt realize how toxic it was though, as i idolized him for being remotely similar to the one i had before, blinding me from his obvious preference for our other friends. i realized this on our graduation day, around when me and my old friend started talking again. why we started talking? i had gotten over the belief he hated me with every fiber of his being, and decided it wasnt worth it. i had cried for hours to him about how broken i felt with him, and i realized how stressful it was to be friends with the new one. everything we did would make me feel worse about myself, a stark contrast from the easy friendship i had with the old one. the old one made me feel special. safe, loved. he was my equal, not my superior.

i remember at our post graduation party, i asked him to tell me something i didnt know about him. in our one year of friendship, we'd learned virtually everything there was to know about each other. i knew him better than his best friend of a decade did. he said he liked a girl. and i constantly asked him who. i wanted some excuse to talk to him on an intimate level once more. i had no, *no* fucking clue it was me, and holy fuck when he did tell me i felt like i was *flying*. i didnt even think i had a crush on him, but the thought of him liking *me*?? i didnt sleep because i was so hyper and my face hurt from smiling for hours. the next day we talked about everything, then the next we got pizza and i asked him out.

dating him is so easy. i dated one person before, and she liked me, i didnt necessarily reciprocate. she was gorgeous and funny and everything i wanted to be, but she wasnt for me. it was stressful, she was the better one in the couple. but him? i feel grounded, equal, loved. everything about him makes me so fucking happy. we talk like we used to, we talk about everything. we're open about every damn thing. it feels so right. even though we're only on day five, and this will only last until the end of summer break and we go our seperate ways, i feel like we've been this forever, and will be forever. ive never been so happy in my goddamn life.

76,"It is June 20th, and my life has changed significantly from a month ago. One month ago, I was finishing up my track season. I had some tremendously bad races and an injury I ran through at the end, but the 20th was my last race and I still had the chance, and the hope, to make it a great one, because running has become something that means so much to me. It has become this not because I want to keep it, but rather everything else around it has fallen with the depths of time. I had entrusted my coach as all the wiser around me suggested, and though I had faith, it utterly went by the wayside as my training proved useless without essentials my coach had forgotten and forbidden. And, that final race went to hell, as did my junior year of sports. I had also just finished up my second semester at a local college, as I take part in the college credit program in my high school, where I can go to a local college campus and take classes in lieu of strictly high school courses. I finished this semester up with a lower GPA than my perfect first, through no fault but my own. At the time, it was near the end of an on and off “relationship” I had with a girl, which had been coming together and falling apart for months prior, with her coming back and going away, and leaving me in a world of hurt, surrounded by my own unconquered demons with no weapons to fret them. If only I would have known this when we began dating almost a year ago, and had I known I would come back around after a breakup due to my own unrelated emotional distress and grievances. 

Now I am, and have been, stuck on her as she has not a care in the world about me, except occasionally when she acts like she does. It is now summertime, and my life is completely dull. I see friends rarely, assuming I still have any, and the ones I think are friends really could care less if I was part of their life. The problem is, these people are all around me and in order to get rid of them I would have to throw away the remaining things I love, including running, and things I need, such as higher education. My best friend, who I became very close to over the period of the last year, has graduated, and drifted away as his focus shifts to his summer job and ailing relationship, constantly full of insecurities, fights and lack of communications. Him and I no longer share the common bond of being in the same sports or going to the same school, and with that comes a loss. I no longer have the person to talk to about problems, or have fun with or go on adventures with. I lost that with losing both my best friend and girlfriend. I feel as if my life has stagnated at best, though I have definitely fallen from what I view as my previous peak, as I am friendless, clueless and completely out of shape. I am mentally weak, unmotivated and really have no one else in my life who cares that could help me. 

My desires do not align with the common resolutions to problems in the areas of things such as relationships, as exercise has not driven me away and I find that I crave social interaction, because without it I become lonely, depressed, sad and overthink about things that matter most to me. I feel as if my body is failing me, my mind is failing me, and whatever else is left besides the previous two are failing me. I have lost all hope, much motivation and any drive to get out of this constant rut, this hole that keeps digging deeper, this life where I put meaning, hope and love into something and it falls apart and leaves me with a piece missing. I am not suicidal, though I do get depressed when I see that all others in my life have great fun with their friends every night, or are always busy, when I am completely alone, with no one to talk to, or anyone caring enough to talk to me, and having to figure out life completely by myself. I just felt I needed to write this to get it off my chest, off my mind, so I might as well post it too.

77,"Hello, I'm PhendranaDrifter. 

There are lots of reasons why I want to keep my actual name anonymous (which I'm sure you can understand), but I'm here today because I've had enough of the way things have been run in the United States. I'm announcing now because I won't be 35 (the legal age to run) until 2025, so I'm going to seize the first opportunity. In my life so far, I've been an actor--I was struck by the urge to empathize with other people and understand what conditions make a human life different from my own. Then, (now) I'm a teacher, because I want to use my experience, along with my empathetic skills, to improve my life as well as the lives of young people. I've visited 44 out of the 50 states, spoken with students and parents in those states, and am hoping to visit the next six (and Puerto Rico, of course!) by the time I'm thirty! 

This administration and this president are using a platform of ""America First!"" and perhaps they are marginally right. But the only iota of this tagline that I remotely agree with is that we need to focus on the issues at home *first*. We are not in a position to be world leaders, and we are proving that now. We need to address our domestic spending and allocate much more funding toward education. We need to turn schools and social institutions into places where young people can go for social, intellectual, and cultural enrichment. We need to mobilize the working-qualified of this country to work on infrastructure projects that can bring the standard of our public utilities and water systems (Hello, Flint, Michigan!!!!) and bridge and roadways up to the level that we have been boasting! 

We are a dangerously divided country! We cannot pretend otherwise. I've had enough of the lies of politicians! We have the ability to achieve the success that we have been pushing on the world. Now is the time to commit to it. ",20Jun2018,3
78,"Just left the school on the bus to NYC for our senior prom. I never had a date and I was okay with it at first but now being here all by myself away from my friends in the back and seeing everyone sitting next to their dates just makes me feel truly alone. Even in spite of the fact that I’m surrounded by 30+ kids in my grade. 

I can’t believe how I’ve let social anxiety destroy my life. I’m so awkward that not even my decent looks could barely save me from failing everyday. I try and I try but I just *can’t*. I know I shouldn’t just sit here and feel sorry for myself but I feel there’s no point anymore.

I hope I can muster the motivation to have fun when I get there, because I feel pretty unstable right now.",20Jun2018,1
79,"Made a post in /r/depression that didn't get any responses. Called two suicide hotlines that weren't really helpful. My parents are aware that I'm depressed/suicidal but don't care.

Sorry to make another one of these posts but I'm at my wit's end.",20Jun2018,4
80,"Throwaway.

Recent college grad here. About 5'7. Not fat, but a bit of a belly from always hitting books and never the gym. I came home from the first day at my new job in SWELTERING heat. 102 degrees today. 

Nobody is home, so I walk in the door, and right then and there, in my living room, I need to get OUT of these clothes.

Shoes and socks OFF.

Suit jacket off and thrown across the room. Belt. Suit pants down and off, thrown over the couch. Tie, thankfully, OFF. Thrown across the room. Same with the dress shirt.

Oh what the heck, nobody is home. Undershirt off. And I'm going all the way, boxers down, swung around in a circle over my head and thrown across the room. AHHHHHH freedom.

All I have on is my glasses.

My lily-white body from the neck-down is finally free and basking in the glorious air conditioning.

Turn to the right. My curtains are WIDE FUCKING OPEN and there is my 44 year old hot female neighbor laughing her ass off and giving me a playful wave. Instead of playing it cool, I covered my penis and balls with both hands like they were precious jewels, and ran my jiggling, plump, bare white ass down the hall for cover.

I now have to sneak out of my house and away from my neighbor the rest of my life.",20Jun2018,13
81,"I am 19 years old, and have gone through puberty but it’s still ridiculously small and weird looking. One morning I went to take a whiz and it was horribly discoloured all purple and sticking up. I poked it to see if it would hurt and it fell off. Then I realized that was a raisin and my actual dick was underneath. They looked roughly the same size/texture. The colour is normally a dark grey and I am pretty pale so is that weird too? Every time I search up a google there’s just a bunch of memes and average dick size articles. ",20Jun2018,0
82,"I work overnight security at a waterpark and I am the only person there at night. I have worked here for 2 years and have never once caught anybody in the park or have found anything that would give me a hint anybody else has been in the park. If I was a kid that lived near a waterpark I would for sure sneak into it, especially if it is such low security. I was wondering if anybody has ever done something like sneak into a waterpark and how your experience was. ",20Jun2018,1
