0,"I have seen friends of mine be hateful and mean to people for no reason.  It seems that more and more people are divided and instead of engaging in positive discourse they lash out and try to make someone else's life worse.  I have done this too.  

This makes no sense.  Selfishness i understand.  Ruthless self interest makes sense.  It makes you an asshole but hey who isn't sometimes.  

But why, for God, the universe, or nothing's sake would you hurt yourself to try to hurt someone else.  

So don't even be nice to someone...  I mean please be nice but at least think ""what is the upside?  How do this help me?"" before you speak or act.  I believe this will make your life better.  Please argue that point.

1,"I see it as the end of my childhood, the end of the days my consciousness was allowed to roam freely, and not be handed over to be raped and utilized by the capitalist system.  I’m terrified of giving up my freedom. It’s a year and a half since I’ve graduated high school and I’m really struggling with what I’m supposed to do. I have always questioned things since I was 12 and have always hated school and it’s conforming brainwashing employee-factory nature. 

I never asked to swallow this societal pill and I feel like I just want to run away because everyone’s telling me that I should just submit to the social order when in reality that is the most terrifying nightmare I could imagine. Spending my entire life working...always bowing down to a higher authority and following orders to make ends meet like most Americans. UH NO THANKS. 

Are there any options for someone like me? Routine, boxes and conformity are things I cannot stand. I thrive in chaos, creativity and the edge of practicality. I’m pretty lost and don’t know what to do....",01Apr2018,0

4,"On and off for about three hours, as I’ve been trying to relax by myself and watch the final four basketball games, someone in my neighborhood has been just sitting in their car, honking the horn in a very consistently annoying manner. The more I heard it, the more irritated I became, until I snapped and left my house to go search for this person that needed to be dealt with. Maybe it was a little kid who has snuck into the family car in the driveway and just discovered the horn? But, no, more likely it was some jerk-off who just needed some attention, and I am going to find him and give him some. I walk and walk and walk some more, but it is now strangely silent. Okay, so now it’s gotta be some conspiracy designed specifically to annoy ME. What the hell? Who would waste so much time and energy only to annoy ME in this fashion? I walk back home, collapse back into the couch in a confused disappointment.
My roommate, who is now sitting on the other couch, watching the game randomly asks: “...why is the 24 second shot clock a loud car horn sound? That’s pretty annoying...”

Is it normal? I tried to delete the app and re-download it, but it’s still happening. ",01Apr2018,0
6,"This just hit me before sleeping. My full life I’ve been aimless. I’ve never had anything I want to do. Like no passions, no real interests. I just sit and watch TV all day most days. Recently though I’ve been approaching a crossroads. I basically felt pressured a couple of years ago into going to college, even though I had no idea what I wanted to do. So I just picked a degree and ran with it.

Two years down the line now and I’m deeply unhappy, with my grades nowhere near good enough to stay on my course. I know I’m gonna be kicked out after summer. I’ve been trying to avoid thinking about where my life should be going, but now I really have to decide. I’ve thought a lot about what brings me happiness in life. The only thing that has brought me consistent happiness the last couple of years is a friend I made in my first part time job. I crushed hard on her, and now we don’t talk since I let her know how I feel (she has a boyfriend, it was best for both of us to have space), but it meant everything to me to just have someone there who gets me. 

The other night I got insanely drunk, partly to take my mind off not talking with this girl anymore, and have spent the last couple of days feeling like utter shit from a hangover. 2 day hangovers are killer. But over and over in my head I keep replaying something one of my friends said to me while we were out and completely wasted. I’ve known this guy since we were tiny, he’s probably been my best friend all my life. We never admit how much we mean to each other, but he’s been a constant in my life. And in a rare moment of us being genuinely nice to each other and cutting the bullshit, he told me I’m probably the most selfless person he knows. Like I’m always trying to just do the best for other people. 

And it’s kinda clicked. I thought about the way that girl made me feel, the happiness, feeling like I have someone in my life who values and understands me. I thought about what my friend told me, about how he values how much I’ve been there for him. And I thought to myself, that I can be that person for other people.

And I’ve realised in the haze of probably my worst hangover of all time that THAT is my passion in life. It always has been, i just didn’t see it. I just have this need to help others. It fuels everything I do. I’ve always tried to make people laugh constantly in my life, and it’s because I love the thought of having brightened someone’s day a little. There is no better feeling for me than knowing I’ve helped somebody through some shit. I just want to help everyone I can. It sounds stupid, but it’s true. I don’t know how to make that into a concrete life for myself or whatever, but now I know that I want to. I want to live a life where I have an impact on others, where people’s lives are genuinely bettered by having me around. That’s what’s always mattered to me man. The world’s a shitty place sometimes, and everyone struggles. I want to try lessen it, even if it’s a little. I think I’m gonna try volunteer with some charities or something and really try make some kind of difference. Beyond that though I know now I want to have a career, and a life where I’m helping people. It took me so long to realise it, but there it is. Now, even if I do end up kicked out of college, I have a guiding principle in my life.",01Apr2018,33

9,"Last month, I opened up to my boyfriend about something that upsets me very much. Condoms. 

We're in a serious relationship and have a lot of sex. When we first started out, we had some condom breakage and I ended up having to take Plan B on 3 separate occasions. This was traumatizing as my body reacts HORRIBLY to Plan B, for 2 weeks after I take it. During this time, I was the one going to the store to buy plan b, and I was the one buying condoms, with an exception of like twice, because I knew he didn't have much money as he was off work due to an injury.

This was a horrific time for me so I decided to go on the pill to avoid plan b ever again. I have been on the pill for five months. In these five months, I have become terrifyingly emotional, crying at least once a day, I've gained 20 pounds and am constantly sad as this is the fattest I have ever been, have mood swings, and I have two periods a month. Because it was my first pill, I was told to wait this all out until my body adjusted.

For reference, we use condoms and the pill together because pregnancy is a serious fear of mine. During this time, I was the one mainly buying condoms. I figured if I stopped, he would eventually just do it. This isn't the case, he just wouldn't buy them, and would tease me without ever fully having sex or we'd just do oral on each other. I tried to keep reminding him so he'd feel like it's his responsibility, and he kept forgetting and it would go on for days and days or a week until I would cave and just buy them myself. It's not about the money to me, it's about the principle.

I told him last month that I want to make condoms his responsibility because I want him to have a part in preventing pregnancy and being safe in our sex life. I told him that it makes me feel really upset that I am the sole one responsible for responsibility in our sex life, I'm taking the torture of birth control, I'm the one remembering the condoms/buying them 80% of the time, I am the one who has to haul my ass to the drugstore and buy myself plan B should anything happen, and I am the one to deal with the trauma of getting pregnant because it is my body. I told him that it makes me feel like shit and I would like him to take up that responsibility to be a part of it and he apologized a lot and told me that he cares about me and that he'll do that. He bought two boxes of condoms the next time we were at the store. We didn't go through them very fast because I had two periods shortly after he bought them. 
 

Fast forward to now. We ran out of condoms 5 days ago and I didn't say anything for three days. Then I asked him to buy them for two days. Tonight, I asked if he bought them after work (his job is down the street from a Walmart,) he said no and that he keeps forgetting. He then sat next to me silently for about 40 minutes because ""he had nothing to say to me,"" because he already told me he forgot them today.
 
I basically broke down and cried really hard. This really made me feel like he doesn't care. I have been having the worst time in my life on birth control, and I remember to take that every day of my life, and I remember to get it from the pharmacy every month. How is it that he cannot do the bare minimum of buying a box of condoms twice a month? He goes to the store about once a week, but just doesn't buy them. It just further made me feel like it's only my responsibility because he doesn't care, because he can't get pregnant. I cried so much, and when he hugged me and told me that he cares, I just argued back that he doesn't because his actions prove otherwise.
 

It sounds so dramatic, but I have been enduring a lot for us to have pregnancy free sex. 50% of my life is bleeding out of my fucking vagina and I really have no sympathy for his lack of effort towards us having safe sex. Especially after carefully explaining to him how I felt last time and talking out everything together, he promised me that he would do what it takes for me to feel like he is also contributing to our safe sex. This really made me feel like shit. ",01Apr2018,247
10,"I've been in this odd stance with those around me for a good while, but it is growing more and is definitely part of the cause of my current passive-aggressiveness.


Ideally, I would want to navigate my social relations in which I do not require any form of support nor strong attachment from others and yet provide support for others. I was raised with and firmly believe in the point of never needing to rely on others for your well-being, especially given just how unpredictable other people are. Best to just make yourself content and stable. But I still have a genuine desire to try to support others, so I try to do so.


Here is where I screw myself over; I am neurotic and have a lot of the related staples (e.g. low self-esteem, tendency towards negative affect, inconsistency, etc.). Likely related, I find myself getting in a tizzy when it comes to my inability to handle myself emotionally. I don't want to bring others down with my nonsense and further rationally justify not relying on others for emotional support. However, I find myself getting angry when the few people I talk to do not make an effort to ask how I am or understand me. I will grow resentful when they go on about their problems without considering how I am. I will do my best not to show, but boy does it eat me up inside. And I can't manage the feeling; no matter how much I tell myself that my emotional response is unjustified and unfair, I keep getting more spiteful. It feeds into my pre-existing paranoia I have about relationships in general, and I get sad/angry.


But when they do actually ask, I don't often go into detail and quickly put the spotlight back on them. When this happens, I notice that a few different rationales will pop up in my head, including ""they really only want to talk about themselves, they don't care how I actually am"", ""they won't really listen anyway or they will talk over me"", ""I can't bring them down"", ""talking about what is wrong is not going to change anything"", and so on. Combine that with the fact that I often feel guilty or worse when I do actually tell about myself, and it is kind of a mess.


So how does this end? A continuously conflicting stance I hold with those around me in which I am never happy with myself or with them. I have reasons to not look to others about my problems, and yet have this dysfunctional response cycle of getting resentful when people don't ask how I am and getting closed off/short when they do. I both do and do not want support, and it is screwing me up and likely my relationships, too.


How/Why? Do you have/know of something similar? Any advice for trying to control this problem? (As a note, while there are definitely characteristics of those I interact with that do not positively help this situation, I view the problem more with me than with them. So what can I do to change me?)


TL;DR Do you have/know of something similar? Of where, for one reason or another, you don't want the emotional support of others and yet you get spiteful/angry when you don't get it? Even worse, if people actually do offer it, you don't take it? How/Why? How to fix? What do?",01Apr2018,1

15,"It was such a stupid fight, too. I feel like a dipshit. 
I (22F) have a really high sex drive and he (23M) doesn't. It makes me feel unattractive and unwanted sometimes because I get turned down often when I'm trying to be sexy. I know he doesn't mean it like that, he really just doesn't feel like having sex as much as me. I brought this up tonight and afterwards he just shut down. I can tell he feels like such shit about bringing my self esteem down but it's really not his fault. He kept saying how he felt inadequate and like he should want to have sex more often, he just doesn't. I just feel like I guilt tripped him or something. It's a petty thing for me to even bring up, especially since we do have sex a fairly decent amount anyways. But I was frustrated because he said two nights ago, ""babe, I'm just so tired. We'll do it in the morning."" We didnt. Night rolls around, same response. I didn't say anything and I honestly just stopped trying to initiate. Today, we didn't do it in the morning...again. We had a really busy day, so no opportunity during the day. Finally, I was sure it was going to happen tonight. He seemed more in the mood than he had been. But no, I got turned down once again, for like the 4th time in a row and I just felt like such shit about myself. My appearance, my weight, and the fact that I even have a high sex drive. I feel like I'm causing this problem, even if it's not because of lack of attraction. We talked about it for a bit but then he got so quiet and we just went to bed without saying anything else. I tried to talk a little and he just did not want to engage. He wasn't mean to me or anything, but definitely not warm. We've never gone to bed angry before and I'm freaking out. He didn't even say goodnight, just flopped onto the bed and turned away from me. I'm so upset about how upset I've made him. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend (23M) has a significantly lower sex drive than I (22F) do and it's causing some tension. Tonight we went to bed without clearing things up and I'm upset.",01Apr2018,6

If I do find somebody and it looks up. It always seems to crash and burn for the usual excuses (not ready, they cant “lose” me, friendzone).

17,"

Climbing out of the pit that a lost friendship and relationship left me in. A long difficult haul with no one to pick me up. Learning what it feels like to be alone. 

Confidence growing slow and steady like a goat up a mountainside. Smiles emerging from a once dark place. A new period begins making me eager. The fragile nature hidden from others in the shadows.

3 months and I meet the eyes that are my new world to get lost into. Butterflies that have been absent for years. Tingling sensations that are revitalising. A soft touch and close embrace leave my mind fixed on you. 

Lighting myself on fire to keep you warm when I learn you’ve been through the same. Wanting to comfort you and help you through what I battled with. The distance you need to learn yourself again hurts me but I smile to see your growing confidence. 

I’m 2 steps ahead. Not wanting to be a burden. Moods determined by your replies. A bad day turned good by something you say. A good day turned bad when it feels like you’ve thrown your phone away. I want to get to know you, I hope it’s not to soon. 

Wanting to be understanding to your situation but wanting you to know mine. I want to tell you how I feel and the things you do to me. The power in your eyes. But it’d be the end of me if I was my own demise. 

The smiles are coming out of the shadows after all. I’m not ready to be hurt again. I’m interested in you that’s all. I want to know where we stand, and if you can take me places. I hope you’re ok. I don’t want to be a bother, but not knowing is bothering me.

The love cycle continues. Time passes on. Another one my heart is fixated on. Another one who I hope shows me mercy. Just reply to me god dammit I need to smile. The pit is cold and dark but you can save me in an instant. Save me Lizzy and I’ll let you stand on my shoulders and I’ll fight for you. I’m sick and tired of being in a dark place.

Does it matter at all though, after all everything is just time and space.

19,"I think it started happening maybe 6 years ago. I was 14, nearing the end of my last year of middle school. I was walking around the mall, trying to find the food court. Finally I spotted a rectangular shape up ahead. I walked to the mall map, trying to find the star that showed me where I was right now, when I felt something flickering in my peripheral vision. It was an almost indescribable feeling, a sense of calm mixed with the most intense desire to walk away immediately, leave this place and never come back again. And I obliged. There was no reason to ignore my instincts after all, I was a product of many years of evolution, and if my body felt strongly about something there was a pretty decent chance it was right. Yet my intense curiosity made me want to look back, just for a moment. As I rounded the corner to turn away my eyes darted back to the mall map display. A glimpse of dark shine. It was right next to where I was just moments before. And then nothing, as I walked past the corner and took out my phone to call my mom to pick me up.

""Whoa looks like someone's in love"" my friends would always say with that stupid grin on their face. The first time it happened I didn't even hear them. I don't think I heard anything except for my heart beating, on that first day in freshman year of high school. Silver moonlight on a summer pond. Slick black, polished to precision, like a glass sculpture. Black glass. How was it moving? At the same table were some other high school girls, eating cafeteria lunch and laughing. Did they not notice? I snapped back as one of my friends poked me, recalled what they had been teasing me about, laughed, and pretended to be embarrassed. 

I learned later, it was a girl, a normal high school girl. Everyone else saw her fine. So why couldn't I? Sometimes I would just sit and stare at it, almost mesmerized. I think my friends thought I liked her. 

~

Second semester of freshman year. There were others now. And they weren't new either. The guy on the wrestling team, who would always spend the last 5 minutes of lunch scribbling his math homework, I never saw again. But now there was another one of them, moving exactly human-like but wrong, talking to other people. I passed by him once, straining to get a closer look out of the corner of my eye. I could still hear his voice, the same dry tone he always had. 

~ 

As the days, weeks passed, I grew accustomed to them. One in my chemistry class. When I saw it pick up a glass vial I was almost surprised to not hear the distinct clink of glass on glass. In my free period, in the computer lab, chatting away with a friend in the back. I think there was one on the student council too. And I only noticed the ones in my grade. When the bell rang for lunch I would step out of the classroom and see they scattered among the students, like smooth dark beads among sand. They all looked the same, like humanoid art pieces of dark metal, moving smoothly through the crowds. I was the only one who ever saw them. I learned not to stare.

~ 

I saw one in a movie for the first time during a summer. The Bourne Legacy. It was in the background, driving a car. For only a couple seconds, but I saw it, the all too familiar silhouette. Long and lanky, slightly hunched over reflecting sunlight white also absorbing it.

~

""Umm, did you finish the homework by any chance?"" Black coffee under a flickering bulb. Almost no one did any homework near the end of senior year, as college acceptance season had come and gone. I looked up. It was like it was liquid, moving with the viscosity of molasses, over and over. It didn't seem to go down with gravity, just moving in any direction. If you didn't look closely it just looked solid. He look at me weirdly, and I quickly answered back. 

At this point everyone looked like it. Months before I would've spotted a few normal people in public areas, but now I was certain there were no normal people left. My friends started to ignore me when I had trouble recognizing them. My school days were a haze. I came home to them in my own house. I learned to act normal, but I was never sure if it worked. I couldn't tell if they were happy, sad, upset, or even neutral.

When I looked in the mirror every morning I would wonder moments before if I had become one too. And every time I would still be me. Was I disappointed? I don't know what I felt.

~

I moved out soon after I graduated high school. I'd applied to a few colleges, but I didn't want to go back to being the odd one out in a sea of glistening shapes. With my own apartment I didn't have to see them as often. People paid decent money for remote IT work, so I think it worked out. 


I'm walking to the grocery store. I need to buy some more eggs, I'm running out. 

I see her, walking down the street towards me. She's wearing a baseball cap, on tight over fluttering red hair. I stare, I don't know what to do, say or feel. We lock eyes, hers brown, and I feel a shiver; I haven't seen another pair of human eyes in forever. My body is moving on its own, walking straight towards her. As we near, I blurt out ""Can you, can you see them too?""

She seems to stare down at me. Creases form on her face, corners of her mouth turn down. I have trouble recognizing what it means. Disgust?

""Truly putrid. Passive observer. I wonder, what would happen if I saw you from a thousand miles."" She continues walking past. Hints of reflection. Dark blood running under an eclipse.",01Apr2018,1

23,"A little background on me: 
Before this relationship I was very depressed and didn't have any motivation in life. I wasn't confident in myself and had nothing to look forward to in the future. I was thinking of ways to end my life. Never attempted to because I didn't want to leave my family with that pain especially since one of my brothers had already passed away from cancer when I was only 9 months old. I'm the youngest of 2 brothers and 1 sister. I was always really quiet and didn't go out much. I sat at home and played games while my grades dropped. I would get games taken away and then my grades would go back up and then it would repeat until the end of the school year where I would get them up so I could pass. Repeat for 7th-10th grade. I was never really happy in life. I was ready to end it. And then in the middle of 11th grade I met a girl who changed my mind. 

During relationship: 
Met this wonderful girl who gave me confidence in myself and changed me a lot. She really made me who I am today. I'm now able to go out and socialize with my friends. I can talk to my family and siblings a little bit better as well. Still can't go out and conversate with random people near by but it's better than nothing. I had motivation to graduate and to get a job and a license. I felt I had purpose finally. I was happy with her. Sadly it was a rough relationship until the last 2 or 3 months. We both had a great time together during that time. Throughout the whole relationship we did but there was a lot of arguing and trust issues from me that caused a lot of problems. But these last 2-3 months was just love... Or so I thought. Idk when she began to feel this way but she wasn't feeling the ""spark"" in the relationship anymore. She began talking to her coworkers and I got jealous about one of them. He passed and she talked to another one. They were both just friends but my trust issues came into play and made me think things that would eat me away unless I approached her about them and then when I did she would get upset that I still don't trust her after a year. She never did give me a reason not to trust her. Idk why I couldn't trust her but I just couldn't. She has never cheated on anyone she's been with but she's been cheated on. Idk. This last coworker I ended up getting really jealous about because he was her type and they became really good friends. But in my head it was more than that and I couldn't stop thinking these thoughts. Finally when we were talking tonight about how I was feeling she tells me that she doesn't feel that spark anymore and she says she hates seeing me hurting like I am and she decides to call it off so we don't hurt each other anymore than we already have. I don't want to let go but I know its probably best for both of us so I let her go. 

Me now: 
Just broke up about an hour ago now and I'm back to feeling lost with no motivation in life and idk if I'll be motivated enough to get my grades up to graduate. I know it's just the super depressed feelings that everyone gets after a break up of a long relationship that they thought had meaning but I don't feel like it's just that. I feel like I'm back to my old self where I'm depressed and I don't have motivation anymore. My whole future is now connected to this girl and everything I do is connected to her in a deep way. I had planned to do a lot with this girl and we had both planned a lot together but now it's all gone. I'm feeling like shit and thinking of ways to end it again. Idk how to motivate myself to continue in life. I feel like I'll never find a girl like her. Even though we had a rough relationship she was still a great person that I wish I was able to trust at the time. But it's too late now and I feel like I'll never find something similar. She was one of a kind. I don't find any girls in my school attractive and don't know how I'll meet someone outside of school. I feel like I need someone soon or I'm going to end it. I can't wait too long or else I'm just going to sink deeper and deeper into my depressed mind. 

Someone please help me get out of this 

Tl;dr : just got broken up with after a year and back to feeling depressed and suicidal just like I was before the relationship. Lost all confidence and motivation in life. I want help please. ",01Apr2018,4
26,"I am a young film director, I go by the name Esma Saric. You can find some of my student works on a vimeo page.

So, the story goes like this. I received a notebook from a woman who survived 4 years of concentration camp, during the war in Bosnia. I was born during the war, and she was my age when she got in the camp.

I have the notebook, doctors papers that claim she has ptsd, and real info about the case. I was thinking to make a film, Woody Allen style, sort of like an essay, about the parallel life we are having. Something like me, trying to make a movie about her.

She gave all the right to me, and only me. She wants the film to be made in this form. She is the only person that survived this during the war, in one camp. She leads a good life now, but wants her story to be heard.

33,"Hi, 4 months ago my boyfriend broke up with me. Our relationship was far from perfect and his explanation for breaking up with me was that 'he didn't love me, hadn't for the last 3 months and didn't want a future with me in it and there was nothing I could say to change his mind'. He couldn't look me in the eye and kicked me out of the house after that. We haven't seen each other since.

This was a man I thought I was going to marry. When he left it felt like the closest person to me died. It was worse though, because it was his choice. I cried the entire night before the breakup because I knew it was coming, and he just rolled over and said nothing. He left me feeling worthless, especially since he was telling me he still loved me up until the week before. Looking back there were a lot of signs and mental abuse in the relationship. I always managed to make excuses for him though because I loved him and being with him, whether we were fighting or not, was better than being without him. He often made plans unrelating me and would choose his friends over me, even when they called me crazy and that was what ultimately hurt the most. He would hang out with other girls without telling me and every time I told him it hurt my feelings he would say sorry but then do it again the next week. I remember one night waiting until 2am for him to get back from being somewhere with a bunch of girls without a word to me and he couldn't understand how that upset me. When he introduced me to his family he didn't tell them who I was or that I was coming and made me sit at a table in a restaurant with them while he sat at a different table with his friend. He wouldn't introduce me to his female friends and then got angry when I got upset when he hugged some random female in front of me. He was narcissistic and detached, and I think that was part of the reason we fell apart.

There are a lot of things I just don't understand. I loved his soul and who he was when it was just us, but he was a completely changed person around other people. I know looking back on everything that it was not a good relationship but at the time I would have married him, even though I was so miserable and probably would have killed myself before I was 30.

I know all of this but yet I became so immersed in the relationship that even now he is the soul of every thought I have in a day. I replay every conversation we had or everything I wish I could say to him if I talked to him again. Every decision I make, he is the backbone of the outcome. I could never get back with him again, yet every day all I want is him there, to talk to him or just see him.

To be honest, I don't think I know how I will recover from this. Part of me I think is still struggling because I didn't get any closure. He said he loved me once but if he had he would have known that the way he treated me was the worst way to treat anyone. It's still in the back of my mind like it was yesterday. It has hit me that this is forever and moving on means letting go of him for good. I will never be with the person I thought was my soulmate for the rest of my life. I feel worthless and incomplete. I know that is sad to say but the love I had for him was so pure and innocent that I felt completely destroyed when he ripped my heart out. I know it isn't, but he is still making me feel like it is my fault. 

I want to move on and continue with my life but the thought of him stops me. Please, does anyone have any advice on how I can move on? I want to respect his decision that he wants more and maybe I could start beleiveing that I deserve more too but it is so much easier said than done.

40,"When I was a kid I was pretty fat and bullied. Not that often but occasionally. I was kinda ostracized because of this so I turned to video games. They were always there, never judged me, and I had tons of fun. I eventually stopped caring about my social life altogether and rushed home after school each day just to play.


Around senior year, I felt I missed out on the high school experience. Never played an instrument, a sport, had a girlfriend, did an extracurricular activity. My grades also suffered and iirc I graduated with a 2.XX GPA. My friends got into Stanford, Ucla, Usc and were doing something meaningful with their lives. I got very depressed and kept playing games even more because they were the only thing that made me happy. I told myself that I would change when I went to community college.


When I started attending community college I got depressed again realizing I wouldn't be able to transfer to a university until I do 3 years worth of classes (Comp Sci major). I was going to miss out on the college experience. Living in a dorm and a new city, making new friends, and growing as a person. The depression and anxiety came back twice as hard and I failed all my classes because I stopped attending. This went on for two semesters. I also gained about 100lb during this time. 


However the one thing that was and still is always there for me was gaming. I made tons of friends on it and it helps me escape from my shitty situation. It's as if I have a better life online. I have friends that care about me, games that I can play for 12 hours straight and never be bored. I know how fucked I am wasting my life on games but I honestly don't care anymore. It's the only thing that makes me feel happy and useful, not like a failure and useless piece of shit. ",01Apr2018,2
42,"I am definitely not refuting the statement. I definitely would say I do not love myself, but I want to change that but I don't know how to, nor do I think it's possible.

I am generally in a not happy mood every day, and it is pretty tiring, and I'm pretty sure it has contributed to why I am a 30 year old virgin. I am a disabled vet who doesn't work so I have probably way too much free time.

I'm the result of a 20yr affair (father was married) mother was significantly younger but stuck with him for 20yrs until she realised that the guy was an asshole and would never leave his wife. As a kid, I saw my father infrequently. His wife found out about the affair when my mother got pregnant but for reasons of her own, she stuck by him and has always been wonderful to me throughout my life. She considers me one of her own. 
Whenever my father visited as a kid, I always felt like a hindrance and as though I was in the way. I never felt as though he was there to see me, only ever my mom and that caused huge amounts of anxiety growing up. It's worth noting that my father had a habit of having affairs.

Usually it's with people who are either not interested at all or who just like the attention but it's a pattern I've had since my late teens and it really impacts on my mental health. I end up fixating on other people to the point I end up stressed to the max, depressed and hurting the people who love me.

59,"hey guys! Alright, so this is a bit of a personal problem. Honestly, I feel bad for even posting in this thread considering how minor it is compared to some of the stuff other people are going through, but this is something I think about non-stop and would love to hear what anyone else has to say, or if they've ever gone through something similar. 
(I just want to apologize in advance for how scattered this may turn out to be, I'm a horrible story teller and even worse at knowing where to begin)
Here's the deal, I (20/F) recently moved towns for university. It's a really good school and not too far away from where I'm originally from. HOWEVER, HERE'S THE PROBLEM (if you could call it that)
I just feel so uninspired.
The town is infinitely smaller than where I would be living if i had not decided to leave the province for school, and I fear I've made a huge mistake. 
Like I said, the school has a great reputation and my family are all quite proud of me for getting in, but I just dont feel like it's the right scene for me.
Im originally from a big city about 3 hours away, and I just cant stop thinking about what life would be like if I had never come out here and just stuck to my original plan of getting an apartment and going to school downtown. 
The city is gorgeous and hoppin' with action at all hours of the day year round. It sets my heart on fire, to be dramatic. I've always saw myself in an urban setting, and was pretty sad to leave the place that I had taken for granted for so many years when i had received my letter of acceptance to this university that I had kinda applied to on a whim.
The way the school even came up on my radar was through my ex boyfriend, who was from the town where it's located. I was dating him at the time that I had applied, but I still wouldnt go so far as saying that I had applied just to be CLOSER to him, but I fear that could have played a little bit of a role in my decision to apply. We had broken up by the time I was accepted, which was fine, as it had been my decision, and I was still intrigued by the idea of picking up and moving to a new town for school where I knew basically no one.

So I accepted the offer and made the move, and having just completed my first year here, I still feel so out of place and like this isn't for me. I've met some really great people and could definitely make it work so to speak, but I just dont and haven't felt 'present' in a long time. I just can't shake this feeling of wanting to live and go to school in the city where I can be surrounded by things that interest me and where I can have more opportunities to grow OUTSIDE of the classroom. BUT, I also fear that I may just be resisting change and am being overdramatic/too emotional and irrational. Like I said, the school is a good school, and Im proud to be going here and I've always thought that making yourself uncomfortable in life as a means of trying new things and widening your perspective, but I just feel like I'm withering away when I'm not in class, and the thought of spending another 3 years here kills me a little bit. 
This brings me to the crux of my dilemma, I'm at a loss for what to do for the upcoming year. I could either a) commit to staying here and just stick it out, if not for my whole degree than just for another year, or b) listen to my heart thats telling me to go where I feel most alive. 

(I just want to make sure that if i choose the latter, im not cutting myself off from a potentially great thing that's hard at first but will ultimately serve as a great investment in my academic future) 

ALRIGHT, I'LL STOP THE RAMBLINGS HERE, thanks for listening, and please feel free to ask me any more questions if things need clarifying.

It was pretty late at night at this point so I just put down my phone and went to sleep to see if anything happened. The next day she messaged me and we chatted for a while and we both gave each other our Snapchats. A week after that she asked if I wanted to go to the movies with her, I agreed. Then a couple days later we exchanged phone numbers and we have another “date” setup for this coming Friday. 

We have pretty much been texting the majority of everyday for the past 2 weeks. 

The problem is I don’t know if I’m really that attracted to her. Like I always thought she was kinda cute and she’s kinda cool to text with but I dunno if I really feel that way about her. My main concern is that I want to go to prom, that’s all I really wanna do and I think it would be cool to go with her. In school we have one class together and I can’t really bring myself to talk to her then. I always feel like I am grasping for things to say and trying to fill empty space in conversation so I basically just avoid her. 

I just don’t wanna lead her on cuz I don’t know if I want this to really become anything, but I think she has feelings for me that I’m not so sure I feel in return. Any advice would be much appreciated. 

tl;dr Accidentally matched with girl from school on tinder, want to go to prom with her, but not really sure I have any romantic feelings for her ",01Apr2018,1
