0,"I mean, hands down terrified. This is my greatest fear. [Look at this shit.](https://i.imgur.com/H6SLNd1.gifv) What if that was dropped somewhere near me? What if everything I knew and loved was vaporized? Every person I loved? And I feel at the mercy of these world leaders, some of which seem unhinged enough to fire a nuke - without naming names. 

I had a nightmare the other day. I was skying with a friend on my laptop. I got a text from my mother - it said ""it's all over. Nothing is left."" I checked the news. The headline read ""NUCLEAR MISSILE DETECTED HEADING TOWARDS US"" or something like that. I heard sirens and the ""fwoooooooooo"" sound of a missile dropping. The end of the dream was me burning alive in nuclear fire. I woke up horrified. ",10Feb2018,4
1,"I can’t stop thinking about someone I like! Not even romantically, I mean, I just get so excited when I become friends with people. I was super shy for a really long time and now I’m starting to come out of my shell and there is this boy. We’re in class and extracurriculars together, and I speak to him sometimes and he’s SO NICE. I never really even talked to boys ever before this year, which I think is strange, and I’m learning not to get a crush on every boy I talk to lololol. But like, I like him so much as a person and he is super attractive and funny and talented. I am trying to think of things to say before I see him because to be honest, I struggle with conversations sometimes. Starting them is really the tough part though. Anyway yeah I’m happy and excited and I can’t wait to see him againnnnnnnn but yes I know he is not the only important thing in life lol. Gotta keep my priorities straight. Whoo!!!!! ",10Feb2018,0
3,"On January 1st I gave up drinking alcohol when I'm by myself. Only if I'm around friends and family, I'll indulge myself. Truth is, I didn't have any issues with it prior. I got to a point where going through a six pack a week by myself was making me feel not good about myself. Tonight I really want a beer because it's so friggin' cold outside. A nice thick stout.

fellings and all

~~i think~~ i love pr*** but can`tell her because don't wanna spoil our friendship, i have indirectly expressed my feeling but she have taken it as drunk text msg or humour, i am really confused and all of my heart wanna express my feeling on valentine day,

but my brain says no because if she rejected{which have 90% chance, as far as i know} it will have major negative impact on our friendship and will affect my college life drastically.

So, the best solution is to let it be friendship only 
But the ranveer singh inside of me is shouting like **Go for It** what could go wrong?
but like she have not shown major signs of interest, so her answer would probably be no 

my major fear is she would block me everywhere and will stop talking and other people will make fun of me...

so i am confused whether to ask her out or not?

lol what the fuck, this is  my major concern right now

-__-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-
my major concern is to appear happy in front of other peoples ;) haha lol

_-_---_-_-_-
my other concern is like i look so fucking ugly because of my teeths, naybe everyone hates me i should follow how to stop wrrying ans start living with how to win friends and influence people 
yup i am gonna create a subreddit for all of my ideas

8,I just poured my heart out to my boyfriend of 4+ years about how I want us to be passionate and feel like we are in love every once in a while. I just sent what seems like a god damn book to him at 1 in the fucking morning so the first thing he is going to read is this sob story and I regret sending the text at all. ,10Feb2018,2
9,"I just recently learned this. I knew that the stock crew at my store occasionally stole a meal from the frozen department every once in a while, but I was informed earlier today by a friend that the dude recently told him that he stole over $100 of merchandise that night.

After questioning a mutual friend later, I learned that the guy usually makes out with over $50 worth of merch a night minimum. It also turned out that a few other coworkers of mine knew about this happening and were at least okay with it.

I think this is super fucked up. I want to let someone know that this is happening, however:

This will likely ruin my friendship with at least two people, who are not only fairly close friends that I'd rather not lose, but important connections that I use outside of work for a variety of things. 

This will also jeopardize my reputation at work. As much as I hate to say it, and I know how flawed and shitty this sounds, but I do not want to be seen as the snitch that got a guy fired.

Talking to the guy is pointless. I also dont want any dramatics.

There is a confidential associate hotline I could call, but I think that if he gets fired/investigated anytime soon I am quite certain people will know it was me that started the whole process. Most likely I will wait a bit and either call it in or have a talk with one of the managers that I trust.",10Feb2018,188
11,"Ironic because I’m posting this at 2:19 am. I have a terrible habit of staying up late. I think it started initially because of staying up with homework last year. This year isn’t so bad on the homework front, but I still stay up doing something, 99% of the time surfing the web. I want to get sleep, and I’m frustrated at the fact that it’s completely my fault for not having it. 
I really boils down to a time management problem. I’m terrible at following a set plan; again, web surfing distracts me so easily, that I accidentally spend far too long going down a rabbit hole. 
I’ve heard that little changes at a time result in long term changes. Any advice on how to fix this web addiction and end this sleep deprivation?",10Feb2018,2
12,"Hey i'm new to this sub (and to reddit! :) ) and I recently moved to the Boston area from Springfield MA. Last night after an all night taco bell binge and a few too many tequilas with some casual PCP, I was walking back to my inner city flat and I saw what I can only describe as a ""pinhead"" alien like figure crossing the street in front of me. The strange thing is no one around me seemed to react or notice and they just went on like nothing happened.

I took a double take and just went on with my walk. But it started following me. I took a turn down an alley and it kept following me. I ended up climbing into a dumpster and hiding out there for a while, but then the taco bell kicked in and I started shitting explosive diarrhoea everywhere uncontrollably. So here I am absolutely destroyed on pcp and drunk off my face wallowing around in my own shit and I can still here the alien buzzing out the dumpster so I had to just keep my head down and pray.

eventually I was able to get out the next morning, and feeling terrible I went to go grab a coffee at Starbucks but they soon noticed my smell and a small 5'' Russian man asked me to leave. I told him that I wouldn't leave without my coffee that I payed for. He grabbed my arm and I instinctively reached for my glock and pressed it against his shiny bald head. I was about to pull the trigger when I saw a grey alien emerge from the bathroom and walk towards me. He handed me a grateful dead CD and faded away. I freaked the fuck out and got out of there ASAP.

Long story short I might be leaving Boston now because I don't want to deal will greys or pins.

Thanks guys.",10Feb2018,0

17,"Hi
I'm curious about something.
I always have something to eat in my backpack (chocolate, candies etc.).
And I have this friend, who's often hungry and didn't bring any food with her. I have offered my chocolate to her may times . What I can't understand is, that she always takes soooo much. She sometimes even eats all of my chocolate or snacks. It's not that I have problems with it. For me, such a behavior is a lil bit impolite. I'm asking myself, if is it normal to eat all of your friends snack or take so much of it without asking if you can do it?
Ah and sometimes when she is thirsty and doesn't have something to drink, I would offer my Water. But then she will drink all of it, without asking first
I'm not being racist here. But does it have something to do with her culture? She is an African. And her African cousin did the same thing too (and that annoyed me because I'm not friends with him, but he took 1/4 of my chocolate bar). I'm just curious. Can someone tell me please?",10Feb2018,7
19,"I'm a young adult and I'm already so jaded of just going to work to go home to go to sleep to go to work. I feel like I have no time to live, no time to enjoy myseld, no time to get to other priorities like cleaning the house even.

1. When are you going to take responsibility for the fact that [the #2 subreddit](https://i.imgur.com/FTJREni.png) is a hate group that spreads Russian propaganda freely?

2. When are you going to take responsibility for helping hostile powers both foreign and domestic attack our democracy?

Russia is already attacking our 2018 elections and not only does the president have no intention of stopping them, **he is refusing to enforce their punishment for what they did in 2016**. Our country is falling to fascism in slow motion and Reddit is _helping it along_ and _profiting from it_.",10Feb2018,0

I have been training to be more gentle with myself by congratulating the person I am comparing to, as well as me, for being able to exist in the first place. It has been helping a bunch.

25,"I've dealt with serious depression for over a decade. 2016/early 2017 it came to a head and I became insanely depressed and climaxed with me drunk, puking my guts out, holding a knife thinking about ending it there. It took a lot of work, but I'm pretty happy now. I have ups and downs but I know how to deal with it and it's mostly ups now tbh. I genuinely believe I'll never get depressed again or at least not for a long time. If that does happen, it won't be nearly as bad.

However, some of the experiences were traumatic. Just knowing how bad things can get is scary. Whenever something bad happens it reminds me of how bad things got before and even if I know they won't get that bad again, being reminded of that can be unpleasant.

29,"25 year old math geek here.

A few weeks prior, I embarrassed two of my friends who were hitting on a few cute girls. I couldn't help myself, and I made a know-it-all comment on how wrong they were on a certain topic of science, and the girls laughed. Little did I know, I was going to pay for it.

I mentioned to my friend's that my very attractive, married, 42 year old female English professor from my first semester of college moved in next door to me. I said ""Oh, there she is pulling up now.""

They looked at each other, smirked, and then pounced on me.

As my former, attractive professor walked up the walk way in her pantsuit, the door was opened and I was tossed outside by my friends to greet her.

Buck naked.

She looked over and said ""Oh shit!"" out loud.

There I was, standing there, eyes wide, mouth open. My 5'7 bare body right in front of my 5'10, well-dressed professor. 

Lily-white from the neckdown. 

Clothed only by my glasses, a pink blush on my face, and the smattering of hair on my chest, stomach, legs and arms (not to mention pubic hair).

Reduced to having only my body hair to protect me, like an animal.

Hands at my sides as I stood there in total shock. My ""studies while eating Doritos"" chubby belly exposed and my small package just flapping in the brisk early March breeze.

My friends yelled ""Enjoy the fresh air, virgin boy!"" as the professor had a smirk on her face.

Oh great, all my secrets revealed today!

I turned and started furiously banging on the door. I could feel my big, bare white butt jiggling like crazy behind me. ""Guys, let me in NOW!""

Hard to sound authoritative when you're as naked as the day you were born, thrown out of your own apartment and blushing up a storm.

Not to mention the indignity of the cold, stiff breeze attacking my bald, hairless, defenseless butt-cheeks.

""GUYS! Please? PLEASE?""

They laugh harder.

The professor laughed herself now.

She said ""Wow Martin, you're STILL a virgin? Aren't you like 25 or 26? That's adorable hahaha. I know I'm not teaching you anymore, but your homework is to hit up a tanning salon."" and she laughed out loud as she walked inside.

""Get that cute round bubble butt indoors, virgin boy!""

I was finally let indoors a bit after she went inside and sat there fuming after I got dressed, thinking of my cold, embarrassing 15 minute ordeal outside and how I could ever face her again.

I was terrified the whole time, but I understand I wasn't like...in mortal danger or anything. Nothing hurt but my dignity.

But now I toss and turn at night when the memory pops in my head right before I try to fall asleep!",10Feb2018,0
30,"I’m currently overseas and I get a call from my sister telling me that our family dog who’s been with us for 7-8 years has cancer. He has two lumps, one on the neck and one on his leg. The doctor said that due to his age, treating him would just cause him more pain. I know he’s old and that he would eventually leave us, but the thought of him going sooner than I expected is tearing me up. He is also my first pet and the fact that I’m overseas and can’t return until the end of this month also isn’t helping because I just want to see him.
