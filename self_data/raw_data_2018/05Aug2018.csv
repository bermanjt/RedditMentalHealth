0,"I’ve been working in retail for almost 8 years and I hate every second of it. I spent the last 2 years studying film and tv and also playing in a band that is slowly starting to do well. I have been looking at going freelance for a while now but I’m honestly terrified of what will happen. 

The retail job I work in is terrible, I’m part time and spread my shifts throughout the week and I’m unable to really do anything else. On top of that when I’m looking at holidays or even asking for a specific day off for a gig it’s impossible. The earliest holiday that I can take off isn’t until October! 

I have no desire to move up as it involves so much ass kissing that I refuse to do it. I even took off 3 months stress to try and clear my head from it all. I know that I should leave but the fear is stopping me and I’m terrified of what will happen.

Any people been in this kind of situation, your advice would be greatly appreciated!",05Aug2018,3

4,"I don’t really know where to begin, but basically I “asked” out this girl and she said yes. The catch is we’ve literally never talked before or anything, which is why i’m proud. 

So the girl that I asked out will be called W for the sake of privacy. 

Quick background info: I’ve only had 1 class with W and that was junior year (i’m going to college in a month). We never talked to each other, no small talk or anything.  even though i did catch her eyeing me a few times in that class. 

Story: So i’m on snapchat viewing my stories and W is on her best friend’s snapchat looking cute. So I replied to her best friends story “bruh lemme smash”.  By the way, i was exhausted and just got back from a concert so i wasn’t in my “normal” state of mind, i was in a “i’m-so-tired-idgaf-what-happens” state of mind. 

so her friend replies with her W’s snapchat the next morning.  I added her and snapped her, “you wanna get high together? when do you leave for college?” she replied within minutes saying that she was really down. i was legitimately shocked that she was down bc we never talked or anything and i just shot my shot.  

this is meaningless to basically everyone here but the fact that i’m gonna hang out w a really cute girl is a victory for me.

I graduated with a mechanical engineering degree which literally gives me all different routes to take in regards to my career which is awesome but stressful and confusing.

My sister started working there because she wanted to be involved but for me, I’m torn. My dad used to always say I could do whatever I wanted to do but now I kind of feel pressured to work there. Id like to be apart of t but at the same time I just don’t know if I’ll enjoy the work, especially compared to what I could be doing with my degree.

9,"I'm working my first post-college job in a new city 700 miles from my hometown.

I've been here since May and the things I've tried like Meetup, church small groups and barhopping have all been duds so far.

I know it takes time to meet people and I'm not too discouraged I'm just getting tired of constantly doing things alone. Weekends are especially lonely because I just miss my family and friends that I left for this job. I'm an outgoing guy but as an introvert, putting myself out there requires a lot of effort and especially draining since it hasn't led to anything yet.

I think it’s the idea that he cared enough to know that he would hurt me with his lack of ability to be affectionate that is killing me. 
So another person who I work with who also recently when thru a break up just confessed his crush on me. I’ll admit I’ve thought about it, but I’m generally not physically attracted to him. I mean it isn’t that he’s bad looking, it’s more that I haven’t been attracted to anyone since the last guy. 
So now I feel like a dick, lost, angry upset depressed and generally like I just want to go away. I’m sick of this. I’m tired of finding a best friend in a guy only to have this happen, and ultimately losing someone. I really wish that I could go back to that moment, and talk instead of letting that molten lead feeling fill me up and running away. I wish I hadn’t let someone else self-sabotage and kamikaze me into this oblivion. 
Why. Why is the one person I want unavailable. 
Why is my new best friend... I mean, I guess I can’t blame him. He’s great. I just wish.. I don’t know. That’s the thing. I can’t pinpoint an issue. It’s just, well. He isn’t the other guy.

12,"I spent my high school playing video games - had a 0.08 GPA when I dropped out on my 17th birthday. 4 years ago this August marks the first day I started undergrad - about 180 credits in I have a 2.75 GPA. It's starting to crystalize - I am about to get a D in my physics class. If I want to go to medical school I have to spend 2 years bringing it up to 3.2 and still I will be extremely uncompetitive. I will be a doctor no matter what but I sure as hell am making it difficult for myself.

I keep getting Ds. There is something about me - I am not a good human being. I promise you that. I cheated on my girlfriend by kissing the girl next to me on the airplane. Literally a stranger in the beginning of the flight, kissing her by the end. This will haunt me for the rest of my life - my girlfriend did not deserve that. I never told her and I do not plan to, but the guilt has had a grip on me. Still, another part of me still flirts with every good looking girl I see. I know it's wrong but I still do it. I know I will get a bad grade for the class I am paying $3000 for, but I still don't study. I still don't go to class. I still don't do my homework. I know I will regret it for the rest of my life, but I still want to cheat on my girlfriend.

Fuck, I even scold my cat if she doesn't listen to me like a dog. Why the hell do I expect a cat to listen to me? Why am I so fucking mean? Why? Why am I like this? I thought humans are supposed to be inherently good - there is nothing about my upbringing that could have caused this. I had such a warm and happy childhood.

I am a terrible person when I am sober. The moment I am intoxicated, when I allow myself to become aware of my own thoughts, I suddenly realize I have been behaving animalistically rather than rationally. Oh, did I mention, I have been smoking weed almost everyday for 5 years? 

I owe my family, friends, professors, and cat an apology. There is nothing about me that is deserving. I want to go deep inside and destroy that which makes me ""I"". I have no other desire. Om.",05Aug2018,1
14,"TLDR: relationship ended; having a hard time letting go of a lame woman because she overlooked my disability

&amp;nbsp;


I dated a really good woman for about two years - she has a child (tween) and some baggage at 43, but at 50, I have my share of baggage as well as a disability - paraplegia.

&amp;nbsp;

I pursued her a little her through the end of her last marriage, and we ended up hanging out a few months after she was divorced - with her hitting on me (kissing my head in public, wrapping her arms around me, flirting). So we started hanging out, became sexually intimate, and started being involved in a romantic relationship. 

&amp;nbsp;

After a good trip out of town around the 6/7th month, we exchanged “love” as a mutual affection, and things were going great - occasionally she would vacillate between distancing and closeness, but she was always a bit wishy washy and has a hard time making up her mind. I just took it as her being guarded and let it go.

 &amp;nbsp;

About a year in, she got very distant, and I almost dipped, but then she was super attentive and started talking about me moving in and is getting a house together. Sounded good to me - I loved her and her child; no big deal. Then a set-back on my end monetarily caused me to put the house hunting on hold - oh boy. All of a sudden, me, just like all men, can’t be trusted. She started distancing and said how she never got to be single after her last marriage, and after the house thing she decided she needed to focus on her and her child, but she was still wanting to date. To which I called bullshit - you said you love me, now you want to date? Good luck.

&amp;nbsp;

Ok - that was a few months ago, and I am still a bit raw and kind of broken up about the whole thing. BUT, the reason I am hurting isn’t necessarily because of her, because while I thought she was great, she was also flighty, wishy washy, know it all, and has some ideas that are not congruent with mine in some areas. As a disabled man, it is do hard to not feel stigmatized and shunned for no other reason but my lack of ability to walk.  So, I miss a romantic relationship, and who knows if she is the last person that will be willing to see me as a man and not a social problem or a disability? I miss her, because she didn’t let my physical status dictate her relationship with me - that is what I miss. I need to be more confident in myself and truly put that pony out to pasture, but it is hard.

28,"I have a story that i will never forget and it has taught me a very valuable lesson. (got removed from r/confession) I havnt told alot of people this story just because of it being embarrassing, though its quite funny so i thought id post it here:

When i was 12-14, i was able to control what i was eating more. so what that meant to me was no vegetables and just junk food. my parents are very ignorant to what me and my brothers ate so we cooked for ourselves alot and they ate what they wanted, so eating what i wanted wasnt really that hard since my brothers didnt care either. it was quite insane that i didnt die in those 2 years because i ate so little vegetables. its insane. i got anemia and high cholesterol from this issue, but in my case, it wasnt that bad. i just had to take some meds and the doctor told me to start eating vegetables more. but little ol’ me would listen. i kept deepthroating all that junk food to my teenage hearts desire. all the junk food and unhealthy food i wanted. i was particularly a fan of carbs so i ate that the most. little did i know, that my actions would have terrible consequences. 

When i was 14, i hadnt shit for 5 days. Ive had constipation issues my whole life cause of my diet so it felt normal at the time. my normal shitting cycle was one big shit then it would build up for 3 days then i would shit again. i was thinking to myself that this could just be a rough week and that it would be over soon. it did not. day 6 is when the pain started to kick in. my stomach would start squeezing and cramping in mild but bad pain. i would start lying down and wincing very hard. i knew it was the shit. day 7, the pain had gotten so much worse. i would lie down on my bed, crying, thinking about how i could overcome this issue. i thought to myself, “its been too long. it WILL come tomorrow” well, i was wrong. the next day went by and i have had enough at that point. i went into the medicine cabinet, grabbed the laxatives, took like 4 or 5 fucking pills and fucking downed that shit. it still didnt come at that point so i just went down to sleep. but little did i know, that was foreshadowing a horrible disaster.

i woke up at about 3 am, and i knew in my gut that a storm was coming. my stomach grumbles with a deep roar and i feel my intestines squeeze in pain, so i run to the bathroom while enduring this horrible pain. i started taking off my pants before getting into the bathroom. i opened and closed the door faster than anyone couldve ever have. i sat on the toilet, put my arms on my thighs and i tried to push; but no shit even peeked outside my body. i thought to myself, “how?!? i can feel this monster inside of me, but he wont come out?!” i kept pushing and squeezing as hard as i could while fighting off the worst pain ive ever felt in my whole life, yet to no avail. no matter how much i tried, no matter how much sweat, pain, or tears i put into the effort of pushing, no shit would even kiss the inside of my sphincter. at this point, i was hugging my knees while trying not to cry or make noise, otherwise id wake my parents.  i was massaging my stomach to hopefully persuade my intestines to let out the shit that was ruining my night. but it didnt. it only hinted at the chaos that was yet to come. it was coming. disaster. i massaged my stomach some more while my face is wrecked with wrinkles. my intestines sounded as if there was a ship in a storm sloshing around in my stomach cavity. the storm. i knew it was coming. i felt as if i lost. i felt as if i couldnt win because of the torment my body was in. at that point, i thought i was at a dead end. i thought i would lose this battle. i thought the shit storm wouldve overtaken me. my pride was defeated by this...by this atrocious behemoth inside. “when will he be released? when will he spare me? when will this torment end?” i thought to myself. tears were rolling down my face while my body was shaking. it felt like the end. i couldnt endure it any longer. it hurt. it hurt me and my soul. i felt hopeless. but i saw a light at the end of the tunnel.

my asshole started widening and widening and i felt some dripping rolling down my cheeks. i looked up with hope and started to push. my asshole suddenly blinked open like a crack in the earth, and shit started to plummet down my cheeks down to the toilet water. it didnt stop. it kept sloshing down. i didnt know what my emotion was, but it was definitely positive. the shit was nothing but liquid with some soft solids. it definitely hurt. after i finished fighting the chaos, i felt Poseidon kiss my ass, as if to say thank you for releasing him from my stomach prison. i looked up, and felt euphoria coarse through my veins. i was so relieved. i looked down at the toilet and i could not believe what i saw. it looked like shrek just ate me out. its impossible to describe. there was blood and everything. it was so unbelievably disgusting. i tried wiping the aftermath on my ass, but it burned like hell. i took some water in a glass and poured it down my ass. i wiped, and put the toilet paper in the toilet. i flushed with pride. i walked out the bathroom knowing that ive won a hard battle. i still have mental scars from the war, but it was ok. i was ok knowing i have fought the struggle that was that shit. i was ok knowing i would be sleeping with no pain. i was ok knowing i won. i have defeated the beast- no, i let him free. i cried. i fought. i won.

Just to form an understanding of the level I am at with this kind of stuff, I'll tell you this: When I go on my unhealthy watching sprees for youtube, I occasionally get an ad for a horror movie. During these ads I do 1 of 2 things: immediately switch off the volume and hide under my covers while I wait for the skip ad button to appear, or I just close out of the youtube video right away... Often after an undesirable ad shows up I get anxious and feel like something bad is gonna happen that is related to whatever spooked me. 

\*Currently, I'm writing this post at 3 A.M., and I decided to write this because of a very abrupt dream I had a couple minutes ago. 

\*Before I fell asleep, I was thinking to my self I was sleep deprived and also dehydrated so if I saw something weird, I hallucinated. 

In my dream I was unaware that I was actually dreaming and not experiencing this in real life (and I'm glad I was dreaming). I was dehydrated in this dream and I told my self that if I start hallucinating crazy stuff, it's not real. Immediately, I am paralyzed, I feel SUPER disorientated (even though I am lying down in my bed), my heart starts beating passed 200 BPM and TERRIBLE amounts of anxiety and anxiousness fills me and I think that A: I'm having a heart attack due to my dehydration B: A monster from my hallucinations will come to kill me...

I woke up and was confused, disoriented and still very terrified. I called my mom a few times to tell her that I might need to be hospitalized but she was sleeping and fortunately couldn't hear me because I was gonna tell her some stuff that was only a nightmare.

\*This has been a new experience for me because I had never actually experienced what I had anxiety about. Having a nightmare that connected so well with what I was worrying about really frightens me. I have MUCH worse thoughts than what that nightmare demonstrated and I REALLY don't want a dream to draw the thoughts into my reality...

I have a feeling this dream/nightmare came from the anxiety that is controlling me during the night.

My account age doesn't show it, but my poor sleep patterns and lack of productivity are evidence that I have been reading your comments and watching your videos for years.

33,"hey r/self friends,

whenever I read the news (which is daily) and I hear of things happening in this world, an odd thought crosses my mind:

'life is unpredictable ... tragedy and misfortune can strike anyone, at anytime' my next thought is always 'make yourself self-reliant and capable, not only for yourself but for others'. meaning that ideally, you should be in a position where if something does go wrong, you dont have to ask for help. YOU are the one who should be in a position to help others...

then i realize I'm at a place in life where I have the potential to do so much and achieve so much but have actually done so little...

anyone else get like this ? 

literally one day, you're healthy, and the next you could be diagnosed with cancer. there's no discrimination when it comes to death, disease and suffering. 

what I'm trying to articulate is that - life is unpredictable, how do you 'future-proof' yourself ? do you get similar, if somewhat morbid thoughts ? does this motivate you to be better or does it just make you indifferent ?

goodnight",05Aug2018,2

39,"So about 3 weeks ago, I saw my father leave our house with another woman. I just came back from university and it was about 1 week earlier than I said I'd come, so I obvioulsy wasn't expected. I didn't really try to confont him and I really wanted to hope it was just his friend, but in the end, I just really needed to know the truth. 

So I kinda 'abused' the fact that my father never logs out from his facebook account on his notebook (not that I didn't know his password anyway.) and decided to go through his messages. 

Yes, it is definitely wrong for me to do that, I know.

I ended up finding a chat with another woman, they were agreeing on meetups (at OUR family house) when nobody's home, it was also full of sexting and other things I'd rather not talk about, but turns out they were 'chatting' for 4 years already. Which means this affair might me going on for a looong while.

Look, I'm an adult, I am not really a part of this household anymore and I should probably let it go, since my little brother might be the one that'll be affected it this family 'drama' came out... but I don't think my mother should be treated like this.

When I read this messages I had an instant flashback on a question I asked my mom when I was 12.... ""What would you do if dad cheated on you?""

It was nothing but a mere curiosity from my side.

""I'd take you and your brother and move away."" was her answer, she laughed, probably meaning it as a joke, but I'm not sure if I can just leave it at that. Keep my father's secrect and hope he'll stop meeting her...? That doesn't feel right at all.",05Aug2018,334

44,"I'm a sprinter, and I listen to music when training.  When I'm exercising in the park, I only sprint when the paths are totally clear I have outrun people on their bikes before.  When my endorphins start kicking, I air drum along with whatever I'm listening to (I am a drummer and this response can't be helped).  Anyway while I was doing my sprints, an older couple (50s I'd say) parked and sat down at a nearby table.  I eventually noticed the woman smiling at me but figured it was just amusement from the air drumming - I've received comments before so it just made sense.  Can't help it.  The guy got on his phone but of course I didn't think anything of it right then.  When he hangs up he starts smiling at me.  While I'm mid-sprint I see park rangers enter the parking lot, which I don't think anything of besides routine patrols.  The couple gets up from their table, they both give me big smirks, get in their vehicle and leave.  I just keep training and air drumming.

After about 10 minutes of this both park rangers get out and start walking to me.  I stop and take my earbuds out, I figure they're going to ask me if I've seen anything (assuming wildlife related).  The guy ends up giving me a hard time for the air drumming which I take as jokes, but then his partner goes ""Do you know why we're here?""  And I just go ""What?""  ""Somebody called in a running guy who looked like he was on drugs.""  I laugh because I think he's joking, then I remember the couple and I'm like really?  Like the smirks were those kind of smirks then?  So they ask me about any recent alcohol or drug use, do I have any of either on my person or in the vicinity.  They didn't pat me down, but they held me up about it for ~10 minutes which honestly ended up feeling super awkward really quick.

I've been going for years and never had anything like this happen, yeah some joke remarks and the odd pointless jerk about it, but this blew my mind.",05Aug2018,1
45,"Long story short. In high school I had this “best friend” he was the opposite of me but we got along. I had straight As and did my work, payed attention etc. he regularly got Ds never did his work goofed off in class always got in trouble etc. 

The dude wouldn’t have had passed high school it it weren’t for me. I’m not exaggerating. I got him to get his shit together, tutored him, etc. and he barely made it through.

Over the summer we kinda stopped talking he went to get a job and dropped out while I went to college. When classes started I tried to initiate contact with him. It was all going well and “by the way, I’m bisexual” which lead to a whole new conversation. 

After that ended he stopped talking to me. I was like “oh well” and never texted him again. About 3/4th of a year after (today) he knows someone I need to get in contact with. He’s the only person who I know could get in contact with the person I’m trying to talk to. It’s REALLY important for me to get in contact with this person so, I sent the guy a message “hey, get back to me, it’s important” no response. I send another the next day “okay you’re working, get back to me ASAP, again, it’s time sensitive and important” 

So today, the next day after the second message (third day from the first time I contacted him) I try to call him and I found out he blocked me -.- bruh fuck off. 

He is the only link I know of that knows this guy that can get in contact with him. Without him, well, I can’t talk to his person and as I mentioned, it’s VERY important. Any suggestions on what to do? How to contact this other person? ",05Aug2018,0

Then what ends up happening is that I spend all this time burning myself out trying to improve with no payoff. On top of that, I'm a college student with no job. I apply to places, but never get hired. I already take your advice about enjoying myself in order to stop from going insane, but that only makes things worse. It makes me feel incredibly lazy.

51,"Ugh. I watched Nightcrawler with my bf and he found the character to be revolting. At least tumblr agrees with me he's hot. I even made one just to stare at clips of his character in the film haaah... ^^;


I never got the whole ""jake gyllenhall is hot"" thing. But he was 30 pounds underweight in this movie and his face looks SO much better. He has kind of a bloated face normally. His chiseled jaw and cheekbones. I LOVE that he's just a ruthless(not violent) but logical guy. Not a serial killer trope. I hate overly angry dudes that try to be intimidating. Like screaming and punching a wall. Like woah buddy? where's your tard handler at?


Lou was fascinating. He was very clear. He was coercive, but did not really seem abusive. I guess his willingness to cut people out immediately instead of ""stalking"" or hurting or obsessing about them makes a huge difference. Breath of fresh air


He was straight up. Not really a lying weasel or angry low IQ physical brute. I would admire and respect a real life lou. While also prolly being on edge and watching what I say or do, because it might be misconstrued against me. I hated rick. Im so happy he died. No reedeming qualities about a homeless methhead that wanted to film a rape in a park. Even lou was like..... ""eww..""


I'm not gonna lie....that scene near the end where he's like....you want this tape? hmm?... How bad do you want it? ;)

He would be the best dom. Ugh. I need to stop lmao.

53,"The last  fair period of time has been really traumatic for my wife and myself.  To just summarize this part of it, we've been through a lot of bad luck outside of our control.  It had gotten to be a bit too much for her as of late and she kind of cracked and had to be placed on suicide watch.  Thankfully I think this was actually positive in a way in that it allowed her to put herself back on a good track now that she has support, a psychiatrist on her side, and medication that is propping her back up.

In the past week or two now that she's gotten on a good track and things have returned to normal, I've reassessed how I am doing and it's not good.  I'm really confused about a lot of things.  I'm anxious about how things will unfold in the future, what degree of responsibility I may have in how my wife got to this condition, to what extent I should be her caretaker, and many other things.

It also doesn't help that I also have my own mental health tie-ups.  I understand enough to know that I have a horrible assessment of myself, feel very little self worth, have very little confidence, or any of that.  With so much going on and so much that I need to be there for, I don't really have the time to really take care of myself or the luxury of really mattering that much anyways.

I do have a good small circle of friends that have supported both my wife and myself to the extent that they're able, which has been a great help.  I really hate to burden them more than they've already been.  I feel embarrassed to let them know that I'm also having issues, when I should be the one that's a rock for my wife right now.  My friends also have a number of their own problems, and I've always seemed to be seen as the oldest or more responsible one.  I know they understand that my main priority is my wife right now, but I still feel responsible to continue my support of them as well with their problems and needs.

I'm also feeling so emotionally exhausted lately. I'm continually trying to be of support mainly to my wife and also to my friends.  I don't mind giving as much as I can, and I find at least a little shred of meaning and otherwise rare self-confidence in being able to be of support to others and to be able to take care of others.  But giving and giving and being such a center of support has kind of finally drained me dry.  I'm all the time asking others how they're doing and asking how I can help, but no one ever seems to check in on me or anything.  I'm so exhausted being that support and not having anyone support me.  I realistically know I shouldn't expect that from anyone, but I still feel like I'm being pulled underwater and don't have anyone to pull me up.

Another problem is that I feel now that I'm feeling like a lot of life is passing me by and my own needs are not being met. Apart from needing someone to be there for me for a change, I'm just not feeling like my emotional or physical needs are being met lately.  My wife realistically can't really provide that in her position right now so I'm understanding of that, but I am just dying for some kind of affection.  Physical too.  I can't even imagine when my wife would be ready for action again, but I am absolutely dying for it.  I have to admit that I am extremely jealous and bitter when I hear of the adventures of my friends who meet partners for fun.  I hate having to sit on the sidelines for that kind of thing, especially since it's probably going to be that way for me for the forseeable future.

I know the classic well-meaning internet stranger advice is going to be to go to therapy.  I've got an appointment scheduled this Thursday, but I am also realistic in understanding that understanding how to process all of my confusion and problems aren't actually going to solve them.  Problems like not having anyone there for me or not having the physical affection I need aren't going away anytime soon.  

What can I do about all of this?  I feel so tied in knots and underwater and I am just kind of at my last rope. ",05Aug2018,2
54,"You know how it is. You set things up with people and they say “yeah I’ll be ready in 1 hour dude” or “yeah! 5pm sounds great. I’ll be there a few minutes early”. But no. 

They’re always late. A L W A Y S. How?! It’s the time YOU set; not me. Now, I’m ready by that time and moved my ENTIRE day back or forward just so I can be punctual for YOUR time that not even YOU met. It just baffles me how people are so used to this. To being late. To thinking everyone’s time is flexible and disposable. 

Now I’m sitting in a parking lot with an extra 2 hours. Not enough time to do what I needed to do for the day. But definitely enough time to sit around and wait and do nothing. 

Even if they originally set the time 2 hours later, that would be fine. That would allow me to keep the schedule I had in mind and have me do the things I needed to do.
