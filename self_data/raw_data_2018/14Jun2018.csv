5,"I need your advice

I’ve realized more and more that I’m not growing. I’m in my twenties and have had to overcome significant  challenges from a young age. After college and getting my dream job, I felt like I could finally breathe. My basic needs are taken care of. I don’t need to worry about money. So I have spent the past four years enjoying what that feels like: paying off loans, spending time with family, helping out my parents. But I am worried that I am wasting my life away in a eat, work, sleep routine, while not really doing anything that is fun for me. I am acutely aware that having a good job and not worrying about money is a privilege and it would be a shame to waste it by living on autopilot. Going to college and getting a good job were my dreams. But I haven’t had any other than that. 

I want advice on how to find new dreams, new passions, new journeys to embark on. I’m not really sure how to go about it. I would really appreciate your advice.",14Jun2018,1
6,"When something good happens or is about to happen, I feel miserable. I think about all the possible downsides and hope something goes wrong. If something bad happens, I feel absolutely ecstatic. I feel kinda relieved too. I don't know why. Yet at the same time I complain about all the ways my life sucks. I hate the misery but I also love it.",14Jun2018,2

8,"Have recently made a conscious effort to be positive online and refrain from posting negative thimgs and it feels great. It isn't difficult either, and there's a sense of inner peace that I get from needing to understand others' point of view so that I can maintain the positivity.

In person, it's easy to fly off the handle and let emotions control what comes out of your mouth. Something that I often experience at work and other places - something I'm also working on. But online, there's time to really think about how you're going to approach whatever you're talking about. A simple ""I understand how you would feel that way, but I disagree"" is so much better than ""you're full of shit.""

And with so many people wanting to bait you into getting worked up, it certainly does nothing but good for your stance on any topic. I'm not perfect, but I feel like I'm doing a good job. So much of our communication is done online nowadays, even with our closest friends and family. It should be easier than ever for us all to take a few seconds before we type and just be nice to each other.",14Jun2018,13
9,"I see someone I like, I get to know them, I’m head over heels in love, we flirt forever, I finally ask them out, they say yes. Everything goes fine at first but it all goes slowly down hill for me as they fall more and more in love with me. This is how it always goes. After I break up with them, I promise that I will never date again. But I do. Every time I find someone new, I convince my self that “This is the one!!” But no. It it never the one.

10,"I have $\-200 in my bank account. Between bills, an absurdly large overdraft fee, etc\- my account is deep in the negative. I've never been so broke. I didn't even have any groceries. Being this broke is my own fault \- poor money management. But hopefully soon I'll have a second job and get out of this situation. 

In the meantime, I was cleaning my apartment, trying not to sink into despair and full on freak\-out mode. I was planning on going to a local food shelf for students. Then I got a knock on my door.

My boyfriend was standing outside my door with three bags of groceries.

He hardly has any more money than I do. Often, he doesn't have groceries in his apartment either (we're both college students). Yet there he was, holding everything I could need to tide me over till next Friday. 

He even went out of his way to get me the brands I like. He wouldn't give me the receipt or tell me how much it was, just that it was less than $50.

Earlier today, I wanted to cry from stress. Now I want to cry because I feel so loved. 

My boyfriend has always looked out for me when I  was in despair. It just feels so good to have him do something like this, with no judgement and nothing but love. He's my hero today.",14Jun2018,1615

I just want sing my own song. I've been trying to use LMMS (a music making program) and I even bought a microphone and an audio box.

13,"Hi. I’m going to tell you guys a bit about me. Here’s the short version. 
My parents pimped me out to older guys from ages 11-15, and my father sexually abused me too. 16 &amp; 17 I started getting help, and my parents didn’t like that. They hired investigators and paid other shady people to follow me and keep track of where I went. They put mechanical tracking on my car, and had people tail me. 

After I turned 18, I wrote a letter to them through mail that I also sent to the police department explaining that I was leaving, in my right mind, and I had the right too, and if they called me in as a missing person it’d be a waste of their time, and to not expect any further contact. 2 times during that year, their posse caught up to me and kidnapped me. 

I started moving distances frequently, in and out of big cities, and making myself minimally traceable. I’ve had encounters since then (I’m 28 now) multiple times. My last one was 3 years ago, which is short enough ago to make me believe their still pursuing.  

This is my first social media account. I’ve always practiced extremely tight electronic security, I’m using Tor and Tails currently and I’ve mechanically disabled my mic and webcam. 

I’m ready for them to find me any-day, I sleep with weapons, and if I happen to be caught by them, I will go down with dignity. 

",14Jun2018,4
14,"And how I come off is as a relatively serious, boring person. Not that I don’t think anybody could ever enjoy being around me, but when I look at the sum of my interactions with other people, and how I envision myself acting even in the most confident circumstances, it’s clear that I will never be the life of the party, and that is ok. I’m the kind of person that you hang around if you want help getting things done, and you need a sense of direction. I’m sure there are plenty of people who need somebody like that in their lives.

Now it’s just a mater of finding those people, and living out my personality in the real world. ",14Jun2018,2
15,"I'm (24f) a WOC in an interracial relationship with a black man. He is not the cause of my insecurity, I just can't see how he is with me when black women are so beautiful??? We've been together for over a year now and I still struggle with feeling like he will leave me because I'm not black. Whenever I see an attractive, intelligent, strong black woman whether IRL or OL, I feel like I can't compare and feel like my bf is wishing I was her or regrets being with me. Again, he has never made me feel this way but the thought has corrupted by head. I feel like I can't fully be happy in this relationship with constantly feeling like I'm not enough. I've talked with him about it and always reassures me but my comfort only lasts for so long before I feel insecure again. I just don't know how to work through this, especially because outside validation doesn't really help. I'm trying to love myself for who I am but when it comes to this... my mind simply cannot accept the fact that he loves me for me? 

TL;DR I cannot control my insecurity towards black women in my interracial relationship.",14Jun2018,2
16,"i pissed off a friend the other night... i didn't mean to, just told an inoffensive joke which i guess she'd heard from me one too many times. i've been getting this feeling for a while now that she doesn't really like me as much as she used to, so i think this was just the straw that broke the camel's back. i've tried to apologize but she won't even talk to me hah

part of me thinks she's being irrational but i'm more inclined to believe that this is my fault and i'm just a less likable person than i was in the past

i've been feeling more distant from a lot of my friends recently, actually. part of me thinks i'm being paranoid but it's just little things that i pick up on; inside jokes between them that i don't get, them tending to face each other rather than me when we talk in groups, not saying much to me unless i speak to them first, things like that.

i'm in an area with a pretty sizable population of people from a certain other part of the world, so my friends all speak a second language which i don't. they've always told little jokes and stuff to each other in their language occasionally but other than that they all primarily speak english. the other night when i was talking with two friends they spoke in that language for about 10 minutes without cluing me in on what they were talking about... it's okay to keep secrets i guess but it just hurt me so bad that they would exclude me like that when i'm right there, you know? 

idk. they're good people generally, so i don't think they'd try and make me feel like this intentionally. i've really just been less of an interesting person lately, so i think i'm really at blame for causing this rift if there is one and i'm not crazy. on top of that, when i talk to them these days i'm constantly thinking about what i can do to fix my relationships with them and it makes me freeze up and talk even less, compounding the problem.

this whole situation has me feeling really anxious. i've kind of been a loner for a while, and that never bothered me but i'd been feeling like i fit in with these people for the past few years and i'm worried about losing that. tonight i've actually been so anxious i almost threw up haha. pathetic getting so worked up over something like this, i know.

sorry about the ranting, and for the wall of text. i wasn't going to write so much but i ended up venting. thank you for listening to me if you bothered to.

17,"The first time in my life I am hearing about gender pronouns and gender being separated by sex is when I came here to Canada. It makes no sense. As an outsider it’s very hard to wrap my head around. I always understood vagina = female and penis = male.

What does all this jargon about nonbinary and gender binary and heteronormativity and gender nonconformity and all this words mean?it’s just so needlessly confusing. I was at dinner with a couple of other friends who were immigrants, and we were talking about these aspects of Social justice regarding race and gender and a friend mentioned something interesting by saying “this is the kind of stuff people argue about in countries where there are too much food and water” 

Maybe I’m being insensitive but I feel like people in Canada and America have a bit of victim issues and easily get offended and feelings hurt ",14Jun2018,1
18,"I feel stuck. Maybe because of the fact I just graduated high school and I’m not doing the typical “teen” things I want to do during the summer or whatever else it would be

I haven’t improved as a person, my friends haven’t improved, I haven’t found friends that don’t suck. Just constantly being at home not being able to do stuff.

This is more or so just a rant to myself. I’ve been feeling in a slumber about it recently, like my life is going forward but I as a person am not going forward with it.

However my goal is to buy a car by next year. Since I want to move far away from my folks, I am in need for a new car. At least a 2016 ish car. This could have been all handled when I was 16 and working and stuff but damn, now? I could have been fixing to move out sooner. 


Yeah 2018, finish college and grow portfolio. 2019 get a job within my career choice (computer science related) and get a car. 2020 Land a goood ass job within career choice and move out in another city.

The job will be working at parks around my city, maintaining and fixing various things.

I have a few questions about this kind of stuff-

I have dress pants and a button-down i plan on wearing, is it ok for me to wear doc martens for shoes?

The interview is going to be very close to my house, would it be frowned upon to bike there? Walk maybe?

I’ve heard that a common interview question is about what you think your biggest weakness is. Would being too stubborn to give up be a good answer?

Another one I’ve heard about is what you will do with the money. If I’m honest, I want to buy video games, but I’m also interested in a gym memberships. Should I say the gym or something else entirely? Maybe saving up for something big?

What even happens during an interview? I am going to bring my resume and some lined paper to write stuff down on. Am I supposed to ask questions too? 

What should I expect and be prepared for?

What attitude/mannerisms should I display during the interview?

I got my tongue pierced a month or so, I assume taking it out for the interview would be the best idea. The issue is, I don’t want it to close up and I’ve never taken it out on my own before. Even if I managed to take it out, I don’t know if I could replace it. Any ideas?

How should I cope with the possible depressive episode that may follow if I don’t get the job? 

Any tips regarding this stuff would be incredibly helpful, I am going to go to sleep to prepare for school tomorrow and the interview the day after that! 

Thanks in advance to any answers :-)

27,"I've been struggling so hard to word this. I've written this out 5 times and I still wasn't happy.

~~I'm going to spit everything out in a small paragraph and we'll see what happens.~~ woops.

I'm a 24yo Male, so part of this question is "" Is this just a stage we go through""

Are humans generally stupid, or am I just cynical / arrogant. I genuinely feel like I'm above the average population but I would never act it. Why do people bother reading / watching  ""the news"" when it just becomes a game about who comes up with the best pun for a title, and when every journalist spins each story to produce the biggest reaction? Why do people think it's hard to not cheat on their partners? Why do people think driving isn't such a big deal when people die everyday due to carelessness? Why do people break the road rules when they are clearly the reason for the traffic jam? I'm not claiming that I know everything, and I realise that I'm only presenting a small handful of problems that could be completely local to my area... but I don't think they are. 

Why doesn't anyone care? Why do people continue to make the same mistakes?

I feel kind of suffocated with this. Is society stupid, or am I the fool? Are there any like\-minded individuals like me? What do I do? I want to move to an island and keep away from it all, but I know it would only follow me eventually.

38,"As parents, we want the **best** for our kids. We want them to grow up (be **prepared** for the future) and be emotionally **healthy**. There is a big decision that parents have to take regarding their kid continuing school or homeschooling them. (if you are one of those parents making the decision right now, i advise viewing this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGu2U3X9\-sk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGu2U3X9-sk&amp;index=9&amp;list=LLV3Lch-CvSwbZIZipG87K0Q&amp;t=0s) )

I am going to talk about my **experience** as a student starting from primary school until 1st year of college.

# Primary School

I remember we did writing and artwork, and i pushed for my **creativeness**. Also i met an English teacher and he **inspired** me for many things mainly origami and programming games.

Despite of that, my main teacher used to talk a lot about **her life**, and other's people having diseases and dieing (i was tormented). She was a zombie teacher... We spent a lot of time making **useless** and **boring** work (like those stupid multiplication calculations that everyone forgets, and festivals preparations... etc)

Also i was **bullied** a lot in school and **nobody could solve** the problem. Teachers would even **alienate** me and **encourage** other students to do it.

# High-School - 5th and 6th

My math and science professor was mediocre in teaching, although the classes were **too easy** for me, and he would **punch** students on head once in a while if they behave like the professor don't want them to. My art teacher was crazy, she was always **yelling** at us many times. Our history professor was so **serious and boring**, he was so **poor on teenager interaction**. The Portuguese/English professor used to talk a lot about other random and **unrelated** shit and his teaching abilities were really bad.

The only good professor was the gym professor, he was **creative** and **passionate** about it (i earned speed running and jumping championship because of him, he is one of the reasons i still run everyday). Also he used to play ping\-pong on the school club and **inspire** students, which was a lot of fun!

I didn't learn any useful school content in this period other than a bit of math, drawing (i am still terrible) and programming (which i did on my own). It was forced to us to **memorize** useless history and science facts which i forgot, and music discipline was a **waste** of time, since we had to listen to teacher horrible taste of music.

# High-School - 7th, 8th and 9th

Here we change to a new school, near the previous one, which is bigger but also less secure.

I was the magnet of bullying, even people from higher age which **reproved** **3 or more** times used to bully me. (maybe because i could't shut up and accept their illusory reality, i always replied them). Once again, teachers would **fuel** the bullying further and not help at all.

The majority of teachers were terrible, despite two biology teachers i had which were really **passionate** about teaching. Despite of that, we still had to **memorize** many facts about rocks and plants which is totally pointless for me and i automatically forgot. Also we spent our **energy** making those power\-point presentations, which in theory is supposed to promote team work, but it just disgusted me and made me **hate** team work, because most of the times i had to do it alone, or i had to swallow the boredom ambient among the group.

# High-School - 10th, 11th and 12th

For us in Portugal, 10th year is when marks start counting for university. They **convinced** us that marks were everything, and the **only** thing important for our future. So i was pretty pumped about it, i was preparing my mindset that i **must get A\+s** on all the disciplines. I wanted to be a doctor since that was the only profession that was talked about and **praised**. i needed to get every multiple choice right, every point of the argument that teacher wanted to hear should be **registered** on my brain database and **printed** in the test. I wanted to be praised for my materialistic capabilities of raw memorization (now looking back, it seems so stupid). Life for me was the **marks** and only the marks.

After some months of school, it didn't seem right to me, it was so boring and i felt i wasting my time on school. Here was when i started **struggling** a lot to **memorize** the content. I was always wondering the **why** of the facts, but teachers would constantly **criticize me for wasting time** *“wondering on the moon”*, as they used to say (among others ones).

I had high hopes for my career (i was **dreamy** and **hard worker**) and often showed teachers what **i wanted to do**, although no one could give me **orientations**. I was **confused** on where to go and later **frustrated**, what took me to **destructive behavior** (i was addicted at playing games).

Each summer holiday i would **rest** and do **what i love** and the magic would momentary appear again, i was feeling **curious** and **happy** overall. Although it would once again **disappoint** and **bore** me and the magic would die after a month or two.

# College - 1st year

One of the happiest year, although students seemed to not like me much. Students cared about the **diploma** and parents's **expectations** and not really for the school content. The college was private and expensive, professors were decent. Although there was a lot of **cheating** and raw **memorization**.

I had high marks, although i was behaving a bit l like a **zombie**, i made group work alone (group of 5), i was giving classmates **explanations** for free, wasting my time doing team representative **work** (it sucks...).

It was the happiest year of school not because of the high marks, but because i met my girlfriend, an she made me realize how much school was **destroying** me. She helped clean all the garbage school put on my back, school made me obsessed with perfection: ""if nothing went perfect, nothing was **worth** it"". I thought that i would have a chance to follow my project if i was really good, but that was an **illusion** and lie told by teachers and family. I was being seen as just a **material/machine** which is loved by being great, or hated by failing, and i didn't realize it. I was slowly **accepting** that i was the machine and just the machine.

That's why i quit here, and started developing a platform for helping teenagers overcome what i did.

I want to help people (mainly teenagers) improve their **perspective of themselves and the universe,** setting them more **free and powerful** than ever.

For the first half of my college life Reddit didn't even exist yet, so it isn't like I can blame it for the procrastination and general lack of motivation and drive. But I wanted to share with the community where I now spend the preponderance of my time. 

If you too are in your thirties and don't feel like you are getting much meaning out of you life and job, I am proof that you can quit it and go back to school. This last year was hard but I am definitely happy that I decided to go back and finish. I walk this weekend and start my internship next week hopefully, still waiting on the call back after the interview. ",14Jun2018,5

45,"I climbed into that huge, old van that brought these lovely ladies into my life.  It was so hot outside.  And humid.  My clothes and my hair was sticking to my body.  I just prayed that this antique of a van had air conditioning.  I climbed in and crawled all the way to the back to the last bench.  I needed my space.  ""Please initiate territorial bubble Captain Sulu.""  

Amy sat on the bench in front of me while Kim was up front in the passenger seat.  Stacey climbed into the driver's seat and started the engine.
Worship music filled the cabin of the van.  No air though....Crap!!! It wasn't long, though, and we were moving.  With all the windows down and the breeze blowing, the temperature wasn't that bad.  Stacey turned the music down.  That's when it happened.  A barrage of questions were thrown in my direction.  One after another. I had just barely enough time to get one answer out of my mouth when another question was thrown my way.  ""Where are you from?"" ""Do you have kids?"" ""Are you married?"" ""What is your drug of choice?"" This went on for about 10-15 minutes.  I could tell they were excited about meeting their new sister from another mister.  I answered everything the best I could without giving them too much information.  There were some things I wasn't comfortable telling complete strangers.
After about 20 minutes my head was starting to hurt.  Because of the heat, my nausea was coming back in full force.  I caught Stacey  watching me in the rear view mirror.  She must have noticed that I was starting to feel bad because she turned the volume back up on the radio.  That was the girls cue to cease and desist all questions.  I closed my eyes and listened to the music.  I tried to clear my head.  I listened as the girls started singing along with the music on the radio.  It was a very lovely sound.  I had never listened to worship music before.  I was surprised at the calming effect it had on me.
Once again the radio was turned off.  Great!! More questions.   I really didn't feel like answering any more questions.  Maybe if I sit here with my eyes closed they will leave me alone.  But instead of more questions, I heard Stacey start to speak.  I listened for a couple of seconds and realized....she was praying.  She was praying for me. I don't remember exactly all that she said...but I was able to notice that it was a prayer.  A prayer asking God to ease my discomfort...my fear and my anxiety.  She asked for protection over her new sister.  She commanded that Satan and all his works be gone from me, for he had no business with me anymore.  I kept my eyes closed.  I tried to hide the tears that were starting to fall.  I took a deep breath and just tried to relax my body the best I could.  

Again, that tiny little annoying voice entered my head.  ""This is gonna suck!! I still can't believe that you are gonna do this.  You can still leave ya know?!  It's not too late.  All you gotta do is wait till the van comes to a stop and jump out and start running.  We can give your guy a call and have something in your system in 20 minutes.  Then all this pain and anxiety will go away.""""But I have no money."" I said to him in my head. 

""How on earth can I buy drugs with no money?""  

He had an answer.  

“Well...you know James has always wanted you.  He's always offered to give you what you want if you give him what he wants.""  

I could not believe this conniving little shit!!
""Shut up!! I'm not listening to you!  I'm staying.  Theres nothing you can say that's gonna make me leave.  So fuck off!!!""  

Jeez....I'm really loosing it. All these years of drug abuse has done some damage on my melon.
I turned my attention back to the van.  The other girls were all singing along with the radio again.  We were now on the interstate.  The windows were down and the music was blaring.  These beautiful women were singing and laughing.  The van was alive!!  If you were a vehicle lucky enough  to be next to us at a red light, you could roll down your window and actually  hear the sweet, pleasant sounds of a gaggle of giggling girls.   I didn't join in.  I just sat and watched and listened to these three beautiful ladies.  I wondered if I will ever be like that again.  Happy... Will I ever laugh again?  Will I ever LIVE again?
We got off the interstate and was now cutting through town.  The music was cut off one more time.  Stacey turned to us and asked if we wanted a snow cone.    Amy turned to me ...waiting on my answer.  

“I can't,""  I told her, ""I don't have any money.""  

I was so embarrassed.  How pathetic was I?  Couldn't even afford a snow cone.  

Amy gave me this little frown with a tilt of her head and said, ""You don't worry about that.  Stacey is gonna get all of us one.""  

Well in that case...Hell Yea!!! It had been ages since I had a snow cone.We all got out of the van and walked up to the little shack with the massive menu.  Stacey turned to me and, with those big brown eyes looking up at me,  asked me what I wanted.  

Now...if you know me...you know that I joke. A lot. It's my meager attempt to deflect and distract from whats really going on with me.  I'm usually really funny.  But sometimes I can be inappropriate.   I was feeling like crap, I was weak, I was tired and I was annoyed.  The constant battle between the devil on one shoulder and the angel on the other was really starting to wear me down.  It's moments like this that I have diarrhea of the mouth. 

 ""Yea I'll have a large Strawberry Cheesecake. But instead of Strawberry, I'll have Morphine.  And instead of Cheesecake, I'll have Amphetamines.""  

I stood there looking at Stacey’s frown.  I could tell she didn't think it was funny.  I lowered my eyes in shame.  Looking at my feet, like a little kid, I apologized.  She reached over and grabbed my hand.  

“It's ok.  I know your not feeling well.""  I looked back up at her, and with tears in my eyes, I gave her my real order. 

“Small Strawberry Cheesecake...extra cream. Hold the Morphine and Amphetamines.""
Once we all had our snow cone, we went and found a place to sit.  Us four gaggle of girls, sat there with the wind in our hair and the sun on our faces.  Eating our snow cones.  Talking, laughing and living.  For 20 minutes I forgot about my nausea.  The creepy crawly feeling went away.  My muscles stopped hurting and the fear and anxiety went away.  For 20 minutes I was a girl again.  Enjoying my snow cone with my friends.  For 20 minutes I wasn't a drug addict  fiending for my next fix.  For 20 minutes I was alive again.  I was a girl again...And for the first time in a very long time......I GIGGLED!!!",14Jun2018,1
46,"This is for those of you out there who are struggling, whether it be financially with a mortgage, being bullied at school, feeling the pressure to achieve high results, going through breakups depressions you name it. I feel compelled to share this as I wish there was someone telling me this when I was 13.

Whilst this is a “self” post this post is about you.

ITS GOING TO BE OK... seriously it will be, you just don’t see it yet. What do I mean by that? I was bullied for seven years by this one guy only to find out after school each day the bully would go home to a drunk father who beat him. I went home to a warm cooked dinner and ate with my family. I didn’t see the pain that bully received when he went home. I was miserable for those 7 years at school but that was nothing compared to his childhood of being beaten. 

You failed that test? It’s not the end of the world they’re not called death tests. And they only test you for that time allocation not what you do daily so relax 


And if you’re depressed! What works for one does not work for all. You could have 1000 people give you the same advice and you won’t take it until one day you wake up and realise what you need to do, by all means there is support available to get you to that day I promise.

And if you’re suffering right now be depression or anything comment below, chances are there is someone else going through the same thing 


ITS OK TO FAIL. This took me 2 decades to understand completely and sometimes I still don’t like when it happens. You see these failures form part of the journey and it’s the journey you look back and remember, appreciating and learning from FAILURE IS IMPORTANT. Why? Because it tells you two things, you put in 100% energy in the wrong place or didn’t put 100% in... it’s that simple. 

ITS OK TO HELP OTHERS.  Have you ever helped someone? How good did it feel? Why did it feel good? We were originally very social creatures who remained in tight knit communities in order to survive and grow, technology is tearing this apart and the exposure sensitive content online is desensitising us.

MONEY IS NOT EVERYTHING I promise you, it’s not. It’s wonderful to have surplus money but it is not the holy grail, connections and experiences are. Connections with people and experiences with people and places. Do you still cherish your first pocket money from you parents? NO but do you cherish those childhood memories when something amazing happened like a Christmas or a family
Holiday? Don’t lose site of the value of memories over money 

STANDARDS IS EVERYTHING this is powerful, I mean this if implemented could change the world. Raise your standards in everything you do, I don’t mean be perfect. Just do what most people don’t. Put your trolley away after the groceries, organise the weights at the gym, these little disciplines create character and people will notice the effort you go to, it’s all about leaving something better then you found it, and you don’t do it for other people you do it for YOU cos you’re a bad ass mf. It sets a great example doe others! 

If this post helps just one person out there I would be more then happy. 

Look out for each other guys, peace. ",14Jun2018,10
48,"I had to just sit down and get this off my chest because I feel like I have almost no outlet right now to unload and get my thoughts out.  I have been married to my wife for 4 years and we have been together for a decade.  She's the best.  She and I work well together and have always been a great team.  Only, recently she and her sister have been hanging out a lot more than usual.  Her sisters (2) suffer from major substance abuse problems, as does her mom.  Her mother is addicted to opioids and her sisters are alcoholics and ex\-heavy drug users.  

Without getting into too many useless details, I have often come home from work and had a conversation with her and she is totally fine and sober then BOOM like 10 minutes later, she can barely keep her yes open, she's slurring her words and she has no ability to focus on what I am saying.  I can look her in the eyes/face and ask her a question and just get this lost 10,000 mile stare back at me.  

I asked her in the moment what she was on, what she had taken, why she was so messed up and incoherent.  It was scary.   I couldn't get an answer out of her.  She immediately took to lying directly to my face.  She said at first she had one drink after she got home, then a few minutes later she said she only had 3 total drinks all day.  Before we could finish the conversation, she literally laid down and passed out so hard, i couldn't wake her by shaking her.  I had to keep checking on her throughout the night to make sure she was breathing.  I had no idea if she had taken pills and mixed that with alcohol, but that's kind of how she is acting based on the symptoms and what I have put together by Googling.  I suspect Xanax abuse or potentially some anti\-anxiety medicine or anti\-depressants.  These would be fine for her to take if she actually went to a doctor to get them prescribed so she knows what's best for her body chemistry with regards to narcotics.  

  
I'm rambling now, but my biggest fear is that I am starting to lose my wife, my soulmate, to the same things I've seen addiction do to her mom and 2 sisters.   When I approach her about it when she is sober, she gets defensive and sometimes downright mean... accusing me of trying to paint her as the ""bad guy""  Then she will storm off and nothing ever gets resolved.  I am afraid and powerless and don't know how to fix this situation.  Thanks for listening.  It was hard to type, especially seeing it all laid out in black and white in all of its ugliness.  I think I am going to make an appointment with a counselor to have someone to talk to.  I have great insurance so may as well make use of it I suppose.    ",14Jun2018,4
49," You had him, and I had her. I had no business feeling any kind of way to you. I’m a rational man, in control of my life, in control of my emotions. And then your long hair seemed to fall over my eyes and blind me from the rest of the world. Your honesty started to cut through my reason, your smile crushed my perceptions of what I wanted. But you had him, and I had her. Nothing to be done. Then you had problems, and I had problems. Suddenly the unthinkable was thinkable for a few moments in time. But then, once again, you had him, and I had her. Try as I may, I can’t shake you. Every moment I’m allowed to spend in your presence makes me understand the silly love songs. But I’m a rational man, they’re just emotions and I don’t idolise anyone. Everyone has flaws and nobody is perfect, I know this. I refuse to put you on a pedestal.

51,"From my earliest memories, no older than 7, before I even knew what being turned on was, I was getting aroused by the idea of lung damage and the act of inhaling smoke.

It has always been my number one turn on.  Never been  sexually fulfilled without at least thinking of it. I’ve smoked plenty of cigarettes and even inhaled things like wood smoke, car exhaust and silica dust.  These days it’s tobacco smoke and clay and rock dust.

Having had this for so long I have a hard time believing I can change it now.  I have largely accepted it.

I am looking for someone to talk to about it but in the mean time I thought I’d post it here.

It’s easy to say “that’s so bad, your so stupid, you deserve to die but what if you were faced with the challenge of giving up entirely the thing that turns you on the most?

I didn’t choose to be turned on by lung damage but I have been from some of my very earliest childhood memories.

Realistically I think I have to accept that it’s always going to be a part of me.

The question is really whether I can moderate it to a level where I’m ok with it or whether it’s worth trying to entirely ignore it somehow and the repression that is likely to involve.",14Jun2018,1
52,"I rarely write shit like this, and definitely never online. Not using a throwaway, fuck it.

&amp;nbsp;

It started before I was even born. My granddad  from my mum's side was incredibly successful \- he ran a copper mine. My family had land, and even a coat of arms. He was also an alcoholic with an expensive taste. He pissed all our money away. One night he came home and raped his wife... 9 months later my mother was born.

It's not so good on the other side of the family either. My other granddad was also an alcoholic. He used to come home and kick the fuck out of his wife and kid.

I've got a sister. Her dad killed himself before I was born.

&amp;nbsp;

I was born in a poor country to a poor family. The first decade of my life was spent watching him kick the fuck out of my mother and my sister. He never hit me, maybe because I was his and my sister wasn't. Here's some highlights from that time:

* When I was 4, my mother and I came home; when she unlocked the door, I saw blood all along the wall because my dad hammered nails into our dog's head. She died slowly. The blood was roughly at the eye level of a four\-year old...

* When I was 5/6, I heard screaming from a different room. Nothing unusual \- I just turned the volume of my TV up like I always did in those situations. The screaming got louder. I eventually went to see what's happening. My mum was on the floor, my dad leaning over her, strangling her. I realised I'm too small to drag him off, so I jumped onto his back with my entire body and started punching him in the back of the head. He stopped.

I got more...

&amp;nbsp;

They started to divorce. We moved cities with no warning. My mum met my stepdad, and he entered my life before my dad left it for good.

&amp;nbsp;

She's been through a lot, but she's no saint. She tried to kick me out since I was 9; telling me how much I remind her of my dad. It was always said out of anger, but you can't just un\-hear that. She succeeded when I was 18. That's when I was at my best \- I beat depression for a few years. I was working and going to college; 18 hour days were the norm. I wasn't partying or having fun. I spent my 18th by myself. I was trying to get a normal life. Then she kicked me out. I became homeless. I wasn't homeless for long, but something changed me then. All the motivation I had, went. Like a piece of my soul died..

&amp;nbsp;

When I was 10, my mum told me that we're moving countries in 3 days, and that I can't tell anyone. For the next few years, I got so busy with learning English and trying to not fall behind in school that I didn't notice the perpetual depression that made a home in my brain as soon as I could comprehend what feelings are. It never really left.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, I'm doing ok. I never went to uni, but I'm working alongside native people my age with degrees. People that know me (but not well) think that I'm always cheerful; I'm always cracking jokes and smiling at everyone I pass by.

My close friends know the reality. I just want to fucking die. Constantly. I attempted suicide 3 times. I didn't fail because I subconciously wanted to prevail. I failed because my survival instinct is too strong. I didn't ""feel better"" when I failed to jump. 

I understand that this isn't the worst thing that could have happened to someone. I'm perfectly aware of people far less fortunate than I am... people that work in trash cities in India, people that dismantle ships for mere pennies a day, people that are used as slaves and cannon fodder. It just makes me feel even more guilty for not being able to be happy with the things I do have.

When good things happen, I have to force myself to be happy (or at least pretend to be) about them. When bad things happen, it hits me like a fucking steam train. It takes me forever to get over anything. I'm constantly beefing and wishing for something big and heavy to fall on me when I'm at my worst... and catatonic at best. It's like being in love, except the lenses are grey.

I've been taking it ""a day at a time"" for too long. I'm tired of pretending. I'm tired of this hanging onto this superficial dream that if I do ""X"", I'll change and learn to be happy. I don't even know who I am anymore. A part of me is in my home country, a part here. I don't belong anywhere. I don't own much. I'm in debt. I have countless unhealthy coping mechanisms. I have a counsellor, but I don't think it's helping.

I live with my best friend at the moment. As soon as I move, I'm going to end it, so he doesn't think it was his fault. He kept me alive longer than I should have lived anyway.

If you made it this far... thanks for reading. I hope you find the joy in life that I was unable to find.",14Jun2018,7
54," August 27, 2017, Hurricane Harvey, the strongest Hurricane to hit the United States in more than a decade, rammed into Texas.  He left nothing but disaster, death and broken lives in His wake.  My sons Grandmother approached me, just yesterday, wondering if I might be interested in going with a group of volunteers to Houston, Texas to volunteer with clean up.

I immediately said, ""yes.""  

8 Days of Hope is a christian, non-profit organization that is both evangelical and non denominational.  Their purpose is to demonstrate the love and hope of Jesus Christ by serving those in need.


Later that night, I started watching some of the footage coming out of Texas.  These images are  identical to images from 12 years ago.  These images are seared into my brain.  Images from 12 years ago, almost to the day, that I was part of the Rescue Operations  in New Orleans, Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina.
Hurricane Katrina
12 years ago, Hurricane Katrina set her ugly little eye on my home state of Louisiana, and her neighbors, Mississippi and Alabama. Katrina knew what she was doing.  And she knew the damage, death and destruction that she was gonna cause when she made landfall on August 29, 2005. She knew she was going to completely annihilate these three unsuspecting states.
I had been out of the Academy less than a year and had only been working the ambulance since April.  To say that I was Green and a Rookie was being kind.  I was still learning the ropes, adjusting to the stress and strain of working in Emergency Medicine.  I hadn't even seen my first dead body yet.
When I got the call from my Paramedic Supervisor for, ""All hands on deck,"" I didn't see what the fuss was all about.  I lived in South Louisiana my entire life.  I have lived through countless Hurricanes.   If Hurricane Andrew was a piece of cake all those years ago, Hurricane Katrina wasn't going to be much different.  We were gonna get there and have to pick up a few limbs and put bandages on a couple of scratches and that was it.  I was wrong....I was so very wrong.  We all were.  There was no way any of us could have been prepared for this.  No one was prepared for this.
I was  excited to be getting out of the boring, hot, humid and non-electric house.  In the last couple of hours  a noticeable smell of funk began to spread in the house.  First, I checked to make sure it wasn't me.  Upon a little more investigating, I found out that it was, in fact, my husband and his brother.  Both true river rats.  

Tell a southerner that a Hurricane is coming...well...you just gave him an excuse to spend the entire time drinking, playing quarters and trying to get the dog drunk.
My Supervisor told me to pack whatever I may need for the next couple of days.  They had no idea when I would be coming home.  I grabbed my backpack, through a couple of pair of underwear in.....and froze.  

“What was I gonna be doing?'  ""What do I bring?""  

I had never been in a situation like this before.  I had always been on the civilian side of the storm.  Never on the Rescue Operations side of it .  I stood there thinking for another couple of minutes.  The only thing I could think of to bring was socks. Yes...socks.  I grabbed about 10 pairs of socks, my stethoscope,  a clean uniform, and some wet wipes.  

I called my parents and told them that I was called in to go to New Orleans and help with the rescue efforts.  My mom started freaking out.  It was then that she told me that civilians were rioting .  They were also taking shots at the rescue teams in boats as well as in the helicopters flying overhead.  There were also rapes and beatings at the Super Dome.  I could hear the panic and fear in her voice.  I assured her that I was going to be with a very large group of people.  We were going nowhere near the Super Dome or into the residential areas.  This information calmed her down a little.  Her final request was that I call her every hour on the hour.  I laughed at her when she said that.  I told her that because of Cellular Company overload and the destruction of a number of cell towers, getting a cell phone call out was almost impossible.  However, I told her that I would  try to get a call out when I got the chance. But also told her not to freak out if she didn't hear from me for long periods of time.  She tried asking me another question but she was unable to keep from crying.  

I heard her pass the phone to my Dad. It was now my turn to cry.  Dad listened quietly as I told him the exact same thing I told mom.  When he could tell that I was done talking, he steadied his voice and assured me that I was going to be fine.  

He continued his encouraging words by telling me how proud he was of me and told me how proud I should be of myself.  

“Not many people on this earth can do what you do. God gave you the strength and the courage to do this job. Your mother and I are so very proud of you. God called you to do this job and he needs you down there to help save people. There is no need to be afraid.  No harm will come to you as long as you have God in your corner. So you remember that when Satan tries to scare you. You see Satan doesn't want you down there. He doesn't want you down there helping people.  He's going to put as much fear into you so that you will be too scared to go. So you tell that devil to leave you alone and tell him to go straight to hell, because your going to New Orleans to save people's lives.""  

The phone went silent as my dad stopped talking. Dang he was good! Dad knew exactly what to say to give his little girls courage a little boost.  We talked for a couple more minutes and I told him I had to go.
""You go get 'em my love. I'm in Love with you."" My dad said.
""I love you too daddy."" I told him. 

I also asked him to keep an eye on mom and to reassure her that everything is going to be ok. He said, ""OK."" 

And hung up.I went to my sleeping, stinking husband in the living room and tried to wake him up to tell him ""bye.""  
I gently tried to shake him but he was deep deep in that drunken sleep.  I took the almost empty water bottle that I had been carrying around and poured what was left right on his face.  He came to with the most girlish scream I had ever heard come from a man before.  He was angry and I was laughing.""I didn't want to leave without telling you goodbye,""  I told him as I handed him a rag from the kitchen.
""OK sweetheart.  Please be careful, don't go anywhere alone and try to call when you get a chance.""
""I will.  I promise.""  I assured him. 

He grabbed my bag and walked me outside to my car.
""How long will you be gone do you think?"" He asked.
""I really have no idea.  I'm pretty sure they don't want us missing any of our regular shifts so, more than likely, I will be home the day after tomorrow.” I guessed.

We gave each other a hug and a kiss. ""WOW! How can this man NOT smell himself?"" I thought to myself. 

Before driving off though, I rolled my window down and said, ""Hey! Before I get home, you need to get a bar of soap and a rag and, please for the love of God, take a shower.  I don't care if you gotta get outside in the rain and do it.”

He laughed and promised that he would.  We both waved one last goodbye. My next stop was the station in Baton Rouge.  The gathering spot for all of those taking the rescue trip south. ",14Jun2018,1

56,"I moved up to Michigan from Georgia with my boyfriend of one year out of college. He was offered a job as an engineer with a good company and although I was hesitant at first, I chose to go with him when he asked me. I didn't have a job I enjoyed, it wasn't even in my field. So we move in together in Michigan and lived here for two more years. 

It was like a dream. We'd each never lived with significant others before and had never really fallen in love in that way with someone else before. It was so new and we were such a good team--I had my whole life planned it seemed like. And he and I were helping eachother achieve our goals and get our lives together. 

Towards the end of our relationship a year ago, he stopped wanting to have sex with me. I could tell he was shutting me out emotionally. He is not a good communicator when he has a problem. I probably am not either, but I do like to talk things out. We never really fought. I know people say that says there were problems. But it was almost like we were the same person. I don't know. So he breaks up with me telling me he's not in love with me anymore.

He doesn't get with anyone new. I could tell it wasn't anything like that. But I never got closure. 

He has continued to try to be my friend. After all, we both moved here together, we made the same friends, all of our memories in Michigan were made with eachother. Althought it's been a year, I can't not feel this attachment to him--a connection I don't have with anyone here, anyone anywhere. I think he feels it too. But I don't know what to do about it. I feel so safe around him but I'm almost certain he feels guilty still maybe for everything he's put me through--is that why he's trying to still be my friend? What in the world does he want from me? I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm staying in Michigan because deep down I know it's closer to him. I'm a mess. My whole world was turned upside down. It's been a year but it feels like it just happened yesterday. 

I have scheduled a therapy appointment for a few weeks from now. I guess I'm just looking for other advice. I can't remove him from my world completely--it would be too hard.

TLDR; Boyfriend of three years who I moved from Georgia to Michigan with broke up with me a year ago and I can't cut him out of my life. We are friends but it still hurts me after I see him.",14Jun2018,2

When I was younger I was hit a lot because I questioned the religion or refused to practice Islam. I was hit with belts, kicked or slapped or locked in rooms without food. Sometimes he’d hit me in public or begin shouting on the bus about me not fasting or something. I’ve been hit for wearing shorts, simply walking home with boys or having wash-off tattoos. I’ve never been a religious person and it’s not something I’ve wanted to be involved in.

My dad has been known to have outbursts. When I’ve been to restaurants with him, he’s shouted at waiters for no reason. He’s been in shops and shouted at people for no reason. There was a time where he hit a cyclist in the street for no reason. In all of the jobs he’s had, he’s screamed at bosses and he took the time to send abusive emails to every one of his co-workers.

He’s also got depression, but hides it. 

There are times where I can do something small and he won’t talk to me for months. One time I didn’t carry his suitcase for him so he started screaming at me and didn’t talk to me for 6 months. When he eventually came back, he guilt tripped me, saying that I was growing up bad and that I’m not what he wants me to be. He’s done this many times.

Sometimes it’s not always bad. He can attack me, ignore me and shout at me then take me for a shopping spree.

My dad lived with me and my mother for a year. It was hell. There was a time where said he went to the gym and then hid in a small wardrobe to listen to my mother and I’s conversation. I was stressed about all the abuse and I ended up saying pretty bad things about him. He came out from where he was hiding and began screaming, telling us we were disgusting people.

My dad has mentioned that he practically has no respect for me and my mother since we’re women. I’ve noticed that he respects males a lot more than women.

I’m still in school and I don’t know what to do. I feel horrible saying that I don’t love him. I don’t know how to approach this situation. I know it’s only going to get worse as I get older.

Sorry for the really bad structure.",14Jun2018,1
58,"He’s a drunkard and a user. Typical Loud mouthed New York douchbage. He’s so self absorbed. He’s an ex con and lives with his parents. He initially was cool when we were kids. 

But then he started living a hustlers lifestyle and fucked it all up. Hence why he lives with mommy and daddy. 

He tried to reconnect with me a few years ago hen I was in college out of state. I thought he was like a big brother to me. He said he would show me the ropes of college life. 

But it turned out he just wanted to fuck me. He would only call me at night when he was drunk. I’d be pulling all noghters at the library and he would call me at 1am. I thought it was an emergency as I have had sudden deaths in my family and he lives close to my mom. But he would always be drunk and I eventually stopped answering his calls. As with many men in my family he doesn’t seem think there’s a problem with fucking your younger female cousin. 

He’s also an unapologetic peadophile. We went on vacation a few years ago to a third world country. He wouldn’t shut up about how many 12 year olds he was going to fuck and already fucked. He had a step daughter around that age and I’m certain he molested her. I pointed out that it’s statutory rape and he said “Not out here it isn’t and high fives my other cousins.” I asked him why he didn’t just have sex with an adult. He said he wanted to fuck s virgin and all 18 year olds aren’t virgins in NY. He said NY girls are all thots so and he needed to get them while they were young. 

He has 3 children of his own, they live 700 miles away and he never visits them. His ex wife filed a restraining order against him. He doesn’t work, to avoid paying child support. He said he doesn’t want to support his kids calling a faggot Daddy. He is a violent and angry drunk. He is also not afraid to hit women. His ex wife is now a lesbian. He tried to fight her new wife. He said he hates all gays ESPECIALLY lesbians. 

I can’t stand this douchebag. He’s talking so fucking loud trying to bag this cardi b sounding bird.  He’s tried to fuck me multiple times. Late night phone calls saying he wants to be close to me. I remember telling we are close we’re cousins. He said “I want to be closer than cousins, close enough to make you uncomfortable.”

I told him nothing he could do could make me uncomfortable. Then I stopped answering his phone calls. He was clearly just calling me when he would get drunk and horny. 

One day 2 years ago my other cousin died. This asshole showed up at my moms house drunk with a 17 year old. He asked if he could fuck her since my mom wasn’t home. He was feeding her popsicles from my freezer that I have for my nieces and nephews. I told him he needed to leave. He said he was too drunk to leave. I kept telling him to leave. He spread his legs out on the couch and thrust his hips in the air in a highly sexual fashion. I put bass in my voice and told him to go. 

He’s a really big dude. And I’m 5 foot 4 and weigh 105. I was scared, but all my siblings and his “girlfriend” left bc he was being wired as hell and it was just me and him and I wasn’t going to sleep with his degenerate ass at my moms house. 

I avoid family functions if there’s a chance he might be there. We live 30 minutes away from each other and would frequently ask me to give him rides to and from his community college. I stopped all contact with him. 

Then my grandma died, I went to her funeral and afterward me and my regular cousins were hanging out in the basement smoking just laughing. He is 10 years older than us and never wanted to hang out with us when he was a drug KingPin. He was also 40 miles away from his kids at this point but didn’t visit them. Instead he hung out in the basement being a buzzkill. We were laughing and joking because we were stoned and he got angry and violent. He thought we were laughing at him. He started bullying my younger cousins. I told him to chill out and smoke a bowl. He called me out and said I was a stripper whore and a loser and that my teeth were fucked up. He specially said I was a “Dirty dusty Bitch”. I had had enough. He put my dirty laundry out. I supported myself through school. But I didn’t hurt anyone and I definitely held my own.

So I told everyone in the room about how he was a user and despite his apparent disgust with my appearance, he would still try to fuck me at least every other week. My other female cousins started laughing when I imitated how he behaved when he tried to fuck me. I was seated on the couch and he towered over me and raised his fist. 

My little brother was in the military at the time and heard him yelling at me. He ran to the basement and saved me by tackling him to the ground. My brother is smaller than him but this asshole gets so shitfaced that he can’t hold his balance. My other cousins escorted him out of the house. He was yelling and raging in the street. Foaming at the mouth to now fight me AND my brother. He makes me so fucking sick. 

So yeah I’m heading for any other funeral at the same house all this went down in. I hope this bitch nigga gets sorosis of the liver and dies slow. He is a waste of life and a virus to human existence. 

And now I’m on a 16 hour long bus trip listening to him behind me sharing his glamour is life with this bird he’s trying to bag. He so fucking creepy. 

Of all the buses headed to NY why did I get stuck on this one with him. Is it fate? ",14Jun2018,240
59,"For years I’ve been trying to figure out what I want to do. I once wanted to be a chef, then a truck driver, then do marketing, then be teacher, then work my way up at the company I work at currently, then nothing.

It always circles back around to nothing. I’m 21 and it’s time to get this shit in check but I cannot feel comfortable settling on anything. This sucks. ",14Jun2018,1
60,"Last January, I was in a car accident. Legally it was 100% the other driver's fault Small, but I got a concussion. 

Every time I drive down that road (it's only a 25mph road) my hands turn white, clenching the steering wheels. I zoom past a car when I think I'm in their blind spot. I am hyper-vigilante, I can't talk to the passengers in my car because I have to focus on avoiding reckless drivers. 


So much stress. From over a year later. And I have to use that street almost every day. ",14Jun2018,9
61,"i lived an okay life. i had a nice house with a good cat and a brother and sister that made me smile, even though sometimes they pissed me off. i can say that i had friends.  i can say that some people cared. i know at least one of you did. i never did too well in school but i can only hope that my friends and my siblings do better than i did. i hope everyone else does better than i did.

i wish i made music. i wish you could listen to my songs and try to remember the person you thought i was. i wish you could listen to my music and read between the lines of my lyrics and my notes to realize my own feelings and experience the exact emotions. 

i wish i wrote more poetry. i stopped writing in the 5th grade and i never went back. it all sounded so corny and i thought nobody would like it if i didn't like it. i didn't want to write anything soulless and fake. 

i wish i saw the world. the last time i went out of the country was 15 years ago on my 4th birthday to see my family in the phillipines. i never went back there either. i always had plans to see the world, but they never panned out. i will always know what the world saw through the paintings in all the museums that i missed so much. i wish i could have seen the getty one last time. maybe even the louvre.

i wish someone loved me the way that i should have been loved. all my life and all of my love was so wasted on people that didn't care and were too selfish to give me anything back. wasted on people that forgot as soon as i brushed them off. the facts about who i knew cared and loved me deeply die with me and those that share the same heart and soul. i knew who cared and who loved yet i still had to question so much. that says enough. 

in the life that i lived, i'd encountered so many people. in passing, in anger, in joy, in togetherness. i can't say i knew them *all* well enough, but i hope that i touched someone, even in a minor way. 

i hope you can all forgive me for doing this. especially those that i really loved. i hope that my cat can forgive me and i hope that even after thirteen years of friendship with three of you, one and a half being my best friend, and one year of enjoying your sweetness. i hope that after nineteen years of being your child that i was able to make you at least a little bit proud. i hope you can heal properly and happily. that is the only wish i have for *you.*

do not follow me yet, as it is not your time. you can say that it isn't mine either, but that's not your choice.  i know myself and i will always be here for you, even when i am not. ",14Jun2018,3
62,"I was on Anti Depressants as a teenage, but as I got into my 20's I weened off them, thinking I could do it on my own. I'm 30 now and I've been in denial about how serious it had gotten for years. I couldn't, I've been in a bad place for years now. Today I decided enough was enough and booked and appointment to see a mental health professional. I'm nervous, but excited to get this fucking dark cloud out from over me. I know, because I've been there, that there is no magic bullet to cure depression, but I'm ready to give it the old college try. My first visit is August 2nd, and I just have to figure out how to cope until then, but at least there's a light at the end of the tunnel. ",14Jun2018,64
63,"I've been going through a spell of depression for a while now as well as some pretty bad insomnia and I was just told my school doesn't want me back next year due to grades. I know its my fault but I can't stand seeing my parents so upset, they think everything was fine with me but really it's not I've been struggling for so long now staying up all night thinking of ways that life will get better but now it's nothing but an illusion to me. I wish I could've been a better son for my parents sake. How can I overcome this? I desperately want to be happy. ",14Jun2018,2

65,"I feel like I'm going insane when I read about ""gender identity"". How is gender even a real thing?

There can't be such a thing as feeling like a man or feeling like a woman because everyone has a unique brain and body.

So what is up with this whole 21st century thing about gender identity, now people are saying they're masculine, feminine, agender, etc. If every man and every woman were clones, sure you could say you are a feminine or masculine, but we're not.",14Jun2018,1
66,"I always come too fast, even though i can last up to 13 mins if i vary my speed (is that much? I don’t even know). Some days i even struggle to get the little guy up. Speaking of little guy, i also feel like my penis is too small. She has even said it herself, even though i think it slipped out of her. Not sure if that makes it better or worse. Guess the next step is for me to become a cunnilingus god. Rant over.",14Jun2018,0
