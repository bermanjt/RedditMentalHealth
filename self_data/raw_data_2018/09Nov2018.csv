0,"My friend is the worse at meeting up, I can't count the number of times he's blown me off when we arranged days and even weeks in advance to meet and at the last minute he blows me off. It's really annoyed me and today it just topped it all off. A few weeks ago we arranged to go on a trip to Spain for a weekend, we arranged for him to come round mine and then book it together. Well on the day he was meant to come round, he apparently was ""ill"" and couldn't come. I'm not saying he lied here but with his track record, I wouldn't be surprised. Anyway, we arranged for him to come to my house this week instead and kept talking about it on Snapchat a few days prior. The day comes that we arranged to sort the trip out, and we message back and forward. Thirty minutes before the arranged time he is still messaging me confirming a time. The time comes but he doesn't show. I'm waiting all night long but he never turns up. I sent him a text message and everything asking where he was but nothing. I check his social media activity status's but it's all quiet until four hours after the arranged time where I saw him on Snapchat maps at his home. He was on his phone but chose to ignore my messages. He does this all the time and I'm just thinking, how can he be a friend? I've told him how I feel before but he's just ignored me. I'm going to university next year where I'll hopefully meet new people, but in the meantime what am I going to do. He's literally my only friend and he does shit like this. What do I do do, should I just end it with him, or say how I feel and give him one more chance? I really need some advice here",09Nov2018,1

4,"In the past year, the management of my apartment complex has entered my apartment 4 times. This is separate from the actual maintenance requests I've submitted, which resulted in them entering an additional 4 times (total of 8).

The instances I didn't request involved fire alarm inspection, general apartment inspection (paint/floors), chimney cleaning and changing outdoor balcony lights. They've always provided sufficient notice as required by law, but it seems to me like these kinds of tasks are usually done between tenants/leases. I've lived in apartments most of my life and haven't had management enter my apartment for these kinds of things. Is it me or is it weird that they do this while I live here?",09Nov2018,1
5,"For the longest time now I have been trying to force myself into an academic frame. I am pretty intelligent, at least above average, and so I could get into university and cope getting through the first and second year without doing much work or studying. But now I'm in my third year and the work I'm doing requires effort and work in order for me to pass. Long story short, I fucked the second semester up and failed all of my subjects.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a block with academics basically my whole life, never been able to study, and now I've realized this and I kind of feel relieved. It's as simple as this: deciding to not pursue academics anymore has me literally singing and dancing around my house because I feel so free; while deciding to push myself to complete what I've started instantly puts me into a state of depression. And it's not that I'm lazy, because I have no problem working hard and have been described as a hard worker before. I just can't study, my brain won't have it.

&amp;#x200B;

I love psychology and I can see what I do in the future being within the realm of psychology, but I just won't have a degree and I'm okay with that. It's a fuck up no doubt, but it's done now, and honestly I feel free and happy which is good. I want to write and dance and sing and get a job! I have ideas which I wish to share, and for some reason had always hoped of doing that within the realm of science and psychology, but now I see that I would have been way too restricted within those perimeters.

12,"Back when we were friends, I’ve seen her radically change her personality in the years I’ve known her. From coming out as gay, to radically changing her looks, to becoming a full fledged tomboy. I’ve always accepted who she wanted to be and what she liked without question. She kept on reminding me regularly that she’s thankful that I accept her and that she would accept me no matter what. Well, one day I told her that I love all things Disney, and she outright told me that Walt Disney was a child molesting neo nazi piece of shit, and that Disney stuff is creepy. I mean, Fuck you! I don’t care if you hate or love Disney, it’s that you’ve made your friend feel like a pedophile endorser for liking the things they like, after telling them over and over again that you’ll accept them no matter what! And also, I’ve checked her Instagram recently, and she’s now a total Disney buff. From posting Disney art to following Disney fan accounts. Enjoy the things you like bitch!

13,I recently moved away for college and I haven't seen my family since the semester began. They didn't want me to move so far away so them visiting is not an option. As school began I kinda kept to myself because I felt home sick. Now I totally regret that decision I didn't make friends when I first got here and now making friends is very difficult. I have acquaintance from my classes but not someone to hang out with or just talk to. My roommate is from the area and is constantly leaving home. Most of the time I'm alone in my dorm room.

14,"Desclaimer: Long story, no question at the end. I just want to share and finally get it out.

Today, in my own personal history will go down as a turning point in my life. Let me give a bit of backstory of who I am;

My parents were never the best people, but who is? Before I was born, they had one other child and my mother had one more from a different man after my birth. My father stayed with my mother, for what reason I do not know. My father was 30, my mother was 29 their names are Shelly and Todd.

The beginning of their relationship went off great as most do; the ""honeymoon"" stage. My father worked as a driver delivering mail and my mother.. Well, she dropped out at 14 and stayed at home being a house wife. This went on for a few very short years until she got pregnant with her oldest from my father, Ashley. 

Being a stay at home mother really made her show her true colors to the world, and shows how frustrating it can be to raise children. While there was fighting at home, most things were quiet as much as they can be in such a situation. My parents both were stressed out with separate personal nightmares; my father would work 13 or more hours a night and my mother likewise would deal with the baby all the time and clean the home.

After a few years something else happened.. I was born. It was April 4th, 1997 in the town of Des Moines, Iowa at 11:38 PM in Mercy Hospital. My mother was with my father, my sister by their side looking at me like a new toy. My mothers thoughts would jump between if she should keep me, or run to escape her boring home life. Luckily, she chose to stay and to this day is still in my life.

The birth went well, I was a healthy baby at 9 pounds, and fairly tall. My mother healed rather quickly and started taking care of us right after leaving the hospital. The next few years were slow and pretty much the same. After I was old enough to start making noises and hold myself up, things really started to go down hill in my life.

To say my mother was a drunk in this scenario would be an understatement. She would drink with us around, and when we weren't around. It did not matter when or where it was, she would have a drink. Due to this, my sister often had to take care of me by herself while my mother was drunk or out of the house. Saying this is a big task for such a small child is not even beginning to scratch the surface, she had no control over herself yet and would try to hurt me due to the crying. I would have laser pointers shined into my eyes, flashlights shined into my eyes, choked so I couldn't breathe enough to cry, put into rooms by myself in the dark so they can't hear me.

Through all of this my father stayed with my mother not knowing what she was like at home and what happened behind closed doors. Nobody found out about what happened to me and nobody would have cared even if they had. We had no idea all the things that was happening when my mother left, we just knew she smelled horrible when she came home stumbling thorough the door smelling of day old puke and booze. 

Fast forward ahead a few months and it's the end of the year. There is snow so dense you would not be able to see even if you had a hawks vision, it was 10 below freezing and my fathers delivery truck would not run. This one day would be the turning point in all of our lives. Being unable to work that day, he walked home in the storm. Upon coming to the house, he noticed there was no car in the driveway even with my mother home. He was perplexed because he thought she was usually home during the days for the kids, so he tried the door and it was locked. After unlocking it and going inside he found us home alone, my sister letting me scream in the bedroom with the lights off with no clothes on, and my mother nowhere to be found.

Our neighbor soon showed up, he called her to watch us. In the storm he went to look for her, knowing how she was before they got together he looked at the bars nearby. Once the sun started going down and it started to get dark he finally found her car. It was at a place called the ""Brew Haus"", my uncle ran the place but it is a bit out of the way to be going to especially in a storm like this. 

He went inside and there she was. My mother was sitting next to another man, drinking and eating nuts. When they laughed and kissed, his heart sank and he walked out without making a fuss. Finally knowing what kind of person she was and what was going on behind the scenes while he worked, he went home as fast as he could. He found all three of us next to the television, my sister drinking milk and the neighbor drinking soda.

With no explanation he grabbed us and put us in his car and drove off, without saying anything to my mother. We drove to Ankeny, Iowa and stayed in a hotel for a few weeks until an arrangement was made on an apartment. We were not let in on what was happening with my mother at this point so I am unable to give any insight into that scene. 

A few years pass, my mother moved in with the man she was with and his name was Paul. He was an ex police officer who works for a drywall company. I don't know his age, but he was older than my mother, by quite a few years. After a lengthy legal battle she won custody of us and we moved in with her, this is when we found out she was pregnant with her third child. During her pregnancy we only saw my father every other weekend and the rest of the time we stayed with my mother and her boyfriend.

Skipping ahead to the end of the pregnancy, she gave birth to my brother, Cole. He was her baby, spoiled rotten. I hated him for everything they gave him and didn't give me. Love, toys, candy when he was older. He got it all, and we got put on babysitting duty. To speed this post up, the next 5-10 years followed suit exactly the same. We always had to give him what he wanted no matter what.

When I was 16 I started acting out for attention. I grew my hair out to shoulder length, dyed it black and got snake bite piercings. I liked that everyone stared, what they thought did not matter at all. I was at least getting attention for once. My first girlfriend came around this time, her name was Maddie. Now Maddie had a reputation that I had not known about until after we got together, she was known for sleeping around with random guys all the time. So no big surprise, I lost my virginity to her soon after and I won't go into the details but it was not pretty.

We were together for a year until I caught her cheating on me. She proudly announced that she was cheating on me since we first got together because of my bad sex performances. This crushed me completely, I lost all confidence in myself and put on an excess 100 pounds over the next year. 

I had a hard time dealing with what happened, thinking everything was real and I was in love to sudden disappointment and disaster from someone you cared for. It effected my view of women, (a recent realization) I have trouble seeing women for anything except sex. All my partners for the next two years ended the same way; either we had sex and I did not get involved at all or care about them or I left because they would not put out. I'm not proud to admit but I would cheat and lie to them all the time. 

I was in a deep depression and could not find my way out of it, I masturbated multiple times a day until little J was completely raw. It was the only time I felt anything at all, I would cut myself multiple times throughout the day because the pain made me realize I was alive (so cool, I know).

My father sent me to a doctor and got filled with pills, I was taking 4x Bupropion and 2x Fluoxetine once a day. These pills made me feel even more hollow, I did not have thoughts or urges to hurt myself anymore but what kind of life can you lead not having anything inside? I was on these for years to come.

After graduating high school, I went from job to job trying to find somewhere I fit in and was unable to. I worked in a warehouse, a restaurant, a grocery store, online, mowed lawns, anything I could think of. My humor was so warped nobody wanted to be around me, my social anxiety and not being around people in my life as a kid left me with no skills at all in social situations. I'm unable to keep friends longer than a few months because of my issues.

I got sick of running around doing everything so I decided to go to college for computer science and graduated with an associates after 2 years. My entire family came for my graduation and for one day I felt loved for once. As short lived as it was, it was what I wanted my entire life. I eventually found a decent job at a gas station with good people and am currently working there, I live with my father and he helps me with living expenses and food.

Now that you're all caught up, let me introduce myself: I'm Josh, I'm 21 years old and I like video games and television. I currently masturbate 8 or more times a day, I've even done it at work. I have trouble keeping friendships and relationships. I can't see a girl and not think of sex. I want to change and I'm finally tired of playing the victim so here I go, forcing myself to change.

Today I am a new man and will not let sex and masturbation take over my life.

Today is the first second of my new life.",09Nov2018,1

I’m going to talk to her tomorrow about it and if she is being unfaithful or gives a crappy excuse, I’m going straight to that guy and letting him know that he’s wasting his time. But is that wrong?

21,"I live in LA, so the Thousand Oaks shooting hit really close to home. Thankfully, nobody I knew was hurt. But that is a *safe* neighborhood, the last place once would expect an attack like this to occur. But it did.

The best thing we got out of our President is ""thoughts and prayers"", but nothing else. No proposed policies. No paths forward. Same thing he does with every other damn mass shooting.

Why? Because he doesn't want to piss off his awful base.

And now there's this garbage about his Press Secretary sharing doctored video to trick the country into thinking that Acosta assaulted an intern. She even had the nerve to be all ""#MeToo"" about it, even though she's shown time and time again that she doesn't give a damn about what's best for women. The White House is *deliberately* spreading ""Fake News"" to push their agenda: suppressing those who disagree with them.

People keep voting for this guy and his party, though. My parents did. My parents-in-law did. They're terrified of the caravan, because that's all that they see on their TV channels. They think all forms of abortion is murder, and so they won't vote for anyone who's even a little bit pro-choice. They don't realize that climate change is a threat, and think that the universe was created in 7 days.

Any time I question them (or anyone on Reddit, specifically /r/AskTrumpSupporters) about how they can continue to support this administration when it's done so many horrible things (and more), all I get is ""yeah, but... the tax cut gave my business a huge boon! I was able to buy more stocks!""

How many times can you use ""yeah, but..."" to avoid these horrible things that this administration is doing? Two years into this administration, and they have nothing to show for it. All they've done is hurt the country.

23,"I am subscribed to a surplus of commentary channels. The type of commentary channels that basically react and talk about weird/bad/scummy/insufferable videos that they happen to find on the internet. And I used to love watching that shit. For the past 3-4 years, it's what I've mostly watched on YouTube. 

However, now I'm finding that I don't like it anymore. It's the same fucking format each time.

1: YouTuber opens video by saying they have discovered a cringy video

2: They often give backstory to the clip, to explain why it is hard to watch

3: Clips of the cringy video are shown, and YouTuber gives predictable reaction

4: They then take it upon themselves to explain obvious parts of the videos that are cringy, as if the viewers can't see

It's gotten to the point that it seems like the reactions to the videos are so typical and low effort, that it just adds to the cringe, and I have to leave the video. And these kinds of videos are huge within the community of YouTubers I watch. 

There are YouTubers I watch that do it well, it's just that the others (the majority) all have repetitive reactions to every cringy video they watch.",09Nov2018,1
24,"As the title suggests, I’ve had a trying few weeks and the next few days are really gonna test my convictions. I’ve had to deal with family, school, law enforcement, as well as my personal philosophies being questioned as of late and I feel like I’m barely managing.

I’m not sure this is the best place to go into detail about my personal tribulations but figured it might be ok to post about about the scrutiny I’ll be enduring. I’m not sure how I’m gonna handle the pressure of the next few days considering I’ll be facing the realization of coming to terms with and be experiencing the reality of the lack of meaningful relationships in my familial, social, and ethnic communities. Without the “moral capacity “ (being the best way to put it) to completely avoid the situation at hand, I cant help but feel, I’m going to be ostracized, demonized, and probably shamed in the ensuing circumstances.

I’ve always held on to the notion of religion and morality in terms of my philosohy in how live my life but I’ve come to terms with the realization that in the midst of things, neither my faith nor my beliefs may not really help me through this.

Today I realized my familial ties are a farce and I may not have any real meaningful ties to this realm.

I’ve dealt with this notion for some time but wrestled with the idea that its not what I need to be happy, but amidst the circumstances I’m faced with, I can’t bare to feel I’m any more alone on this planet than I already feel like I am.

25,"I also know it's okay for me to feel bad, but that almost makes it worse since the extra knowledge then makes me think top much about what level of sad, or why not just fix everything, and then I feel like that just delays the question for another day/week/month.

26,"I know I’m young, I’m 20 years old but I’ve been struggling for a long time and when things were looking up for me it only took a week before things really went down for me. In the last two years I’ve lost my dog, my grandfather, torn an acl forcing me out of sports which made up my identity.

The resulting depression from that and family issues caused me to drop out of college, and my girlfriend of 4 years to leave me. In the time since then I’ve worked hard to get to a better place. I’ve found a great job and will be going away to Ireland (I’m from NA) for school next September. 

I recently started seeing my ex girlfriend again, and things were great for a bit but things flipped quick and she said that she felt guilty to be with me because she couldn’t be a good girlfriend to me and that it was too much energy for me to be with her. 

Driving home from picking up things from her house and I wasn’t focusing on the road. Long story short I caused an accident totalling my car, no one was hurt but I’m worried I’m going to fall back into a depression. I felt so lonely when I was single and I don’t know how to fix it.

28,"But there are people in my town who are thirsty for gossip and drama and *will* read this. Not like they have the imagination to do anything else!          

So I made a post giving my real thoughts on how I was treated at my last job. Apparently, my word means so much to them, they're retaliating. Had someone buzz my apartment in the middle of the day while I sleep (I work nights). Bothering me at work, continue to say sneaky dumb shit under their breath.        

I am so glad I listened to my gut instinct and avoided these people. Imagine being friends with someone who has such a frail ego that something someone said on the Internet about not them in particular, but the things people you have done, and being upset about it, while pretending to be super confident and a know-it-all. Meanwhile, they actually don't understand how things work and are consistently wrong about things.      

The way they act is like little children. They only know this one way of living and think people who act differently are ""bad"" and ""deserve"" to be treated badly. Or something, IDK and don't care.    

They think that just because they are friendly that they deserve friendliness back, and they deserve friendship; or else!      

Intent gets you zero points, as I saw here on reddit. Yeah, I intended to do 1000 sit ups a day but it doesn't mean I deserve six pack abs. Just because you're friendly doesn't mean you deserve friendship. Their morals are skewed, and their way of thinking is dumb. I remember calling them dumb once, so they went out of their way to put an engineers calling card in front of me as though to say ""see? We are smart!"" Reminded me of when little kids try to prove someone wrong.      

I guess what I think and say is very important to these babies and I am glad to not be their friends. They're stupid, childish and needy to prove others wrong. Their ego is so frail that me just saying this will annoy them lmao. Once this town grows bigger, they're going to be in for a rude awakening: you can't control everyone, especially with intimidation, and not everyone likes you just because you act nice.      

Just because a person went to engineering school doesn't mean they're smart or a great thinker or have an objective grasp on reality. It means they worked hard in school and followed the predetermined path set by millions of others. Just because you know a lot about one subject, doesn't mean you're a smart person. It means your smart in that subject. And to know a lot of subjects does not make you a great thinker or that you understand how things are. It means you're good at remembering what others has said/written. And who knows if those are right? Remember, they used to burn women in a fire pit because they thought they were witches? Obviously wrong but they thought they were right! What if, we were wrong about things going on today? Crazy, right? Maybe the way you think is wrong, or at least, not helpful! But no. Your ego is too wrapped up in your beliefs you tool. Uh-oh! He said a bad word about us! He should pay! Because what he says about me is very important to me and hurts my feewings; even though I pretend to be super cool, and confident! Words mean everything to me!!       

They think I'm dumb because I ignore their stupid attempts at being my friend. They've never gave me anything I couldn't get in my own, and I've gotten everything I have by myself. My own dad kicked me to the street to teach me a lesson. Probably guided by his wife who I do not like too much. But still, a dumb decision. I would never do that to my kid when he needed help and was on the cusp of doing better for himself. I was at the tail end of finishing my courses, but being a poor student, I couldn't make rent, because I had to choose between food or rent and chose food because I had chosen rent more often than not and was sick of eating so little all the time.
     

Anyways, off topic.       

Fact is, school was so damn easy for me, I grasped concepts faster than most. 8th grade, I decided ""it's the last year of elementary, I'm going to really try and get good grades"" and you know what? I got straight A's for every subject. We were to read like 10 books and write 10 essays for them in one year. I read like 30 books and wrote 30 essays just because I enjoyed reading and writing that year. It was easy. At some points, I would just blab on my school work because I had already made the point, but there was a minimum word limit that I had to reach. So I'd just creatively say the same things in different ways, or explore smaller points in greater detail just to reach that limit. I'd get the essay back with an A and be surprised, like ""wait, that actually worked?"". It was so easy for me. 1st grade I was in the 1/2 grade. I figured out it was because the smart kids in kindergarten were put with the dumb kids from grade 1. And then I was in the 3/4 class. Most of the older kids weren't dumb really, they were mostly just misbehaved for one reason or another and didn't like school or whatever it was. Idk, I didn't know, didn't pretend to know, and didn't put much thought into it.            

One year, we had this class called ""Explorations"" or something. We were allowed to create a class to encourage us to learn on our own. I convinced a bunch of kids to create a Pokémon class, where we ended up just playing video games for 2 hours out of the day! Some of my favourite times as a kid. Although, there were a few fights over Goldeneye 64, which ended up brining an end to Pokémon class. We had to join others classes after that. So I joined a reading class, and read and doodled and talked to my friends about video games. Fun fact, I traded Cool Boarders 3 for Megaman Legenda (or was the other way around?) to a friend and MML is still one of my favorite games ever!

Anyways, I don't have anything to prove to these people, they don't deserve shit, and if you think you deserve a gold star for trying, then think again because you don't deserve more than you worked for.       

Go learn about self-development instead of listening to gossip or talking about people you vapid cunts. Grow thicker skin, and if you don't like what I say, then why are you reading this? Are you retarded? Nothing that I say or do has any impact on your life more than what you make it. How is that something that needs to be said? That's such a simple concept but you never learned it? Too busy talking about Joe and Sally down the road, I bet. Go poop on your head and fart in your food you droopy stoop butthole nerd, fuck face, ass boob, gorp lord why are you still reading greedy needy beady feedy heart narf barf are you a glutton for punishment hent rent ton boat float how do you know to fear the way that it is to look more like? Have you ever been so far to look more like? You got no one to blame but yourself wealth is right around the corner down your spine out your boner.        

Great. Now that I am, and have been to my way of life, to do more is like to have it when you know it be they way that it do. Nerd. Eat my potatoes shoed foot fetish is weird way to die a thousand way to fart my ass is bled red dead redeadead.        

You just read will that you moron. L. M. A.  O. literally. My ass fell off because I was laughing so hard at your face and the dumb expression on it. As Abraham Licoln once said ""don't believe everything you read on the internet"" get it? Because the Internet didn't exist back then so the statement is redundant and sarcastic for humour's sake. But you probably think that everything you hear and read is 100% true because thinking is hard. Or maybe you're just too lazy to think. It's easier to just let John tell you what to think about someone. There's no way that his way of thinking is not exactly right because you chose him as a friend! There's no way the way you think is wrong, so by extension, John is not wrong.        

This is what I think of you: you're a reacting biological machine, unthinking about the way you think and act and un-self-aware about how your mode of thinking could be wrong or why you even think the way you do. Your mom was mean to you when you were growing up? Probably why you dislike women. Dad made fun of you when you were a kid? Probably why you are aggressive towards men and people of authority. Did your mom get mad at you and only calmed down when you were nice and submissive to her? Probably why you think being nice and submissive is the way to go about to ""making"" someone like you. Maybe that's why that chicken acts out, because her dad didn't hug her enough or that boy is a troublemaker because he had no dad to teach him right from wrong or how to act in the face of adversity.        

I'll be friendly and nice but you don't get  gold star based on intent. Leave the group chat, and listen to an audio book, read a blog post, go learn about something. Don't just yap about someone who in actuality, objectively, does not matter. We're all going to die one day, why waste it gossiping of all things. That seems insane to me. Remember what Jessica did 5 years ago? No. Because time flew right past you in the blink of an eye. Remember being a kid? How fast did the time go by since then? It might as well have been yesterday. But here you are reading this as if your social life depended on it because it does! I am very important and the things I say have weight because I said them. I am smarter and better than you and could do what you do way better, more efficiently, and more effectively. I am god and you are but a bug on the asshole of life.        

Did that last part piss you off? That's because you're an idiot who missed the whole point. But your friend is a mechanical engineer, so you're smart and you're all smart right? Because he's been told how an engine works, and memorized passages in a text book. That's what smart is. Duh!         

Anyways, eat my ass, fuck my food and swallow my spit up your dick and go on a diet because eggs and ham don't mean a thing when you think you're a shill to the corporate greed of mass society easily offends my ass.         

I am the all seeing all being eye of the universe. And you are but a pawn in my grans scheme. I am literally writing nonsense and can't stop because it's kinda fun. Half-remembered quotes from TV or movies or video games. Anyways.

I was going to make 2017 my bitch, but it took a little longer than that. 

However I am the happiest I've ever been in my life. 

First half of 2017 wasn't that great, I couldn't find a job for a long time. However in June I found a decent job and started climbing out from the hole I'd been in for years. 

In the past 1.5 years I have:

Got a job

Got promoted 4 times, salary is now almost tripled compared to my starting amount. 

Went to a few concerts/sport games I wouldn't have been able to afford before.

Got my driver's license.

Been on about 5 first dates after 10 years of not talking to girls.

Dated 2 girls for 3 months each.

Currently dating the girl of my dreams. First time ever in love. We've been together for 4 months but yesterday I told her that I would have proposed already if I had money for the ring right now. And she said ""I would have said yes"".

Got my own place.

Visited another country for the first time.

Done some therapy and dealt with my anxiety and insecurities (not finished yet but I'm much better now).

Found a couple of new hobbies.

Lost 15 kg and started doing some physical exercises.



My life is so different now. I'm actually happy nowadays, I thought these days would never return.

So just wanted to share and tell everyone that things so get better. Yes when I read these words before I thought it was bullshit. But it actually happened to me and so it can happen to you. 

Also thanks to /u/nicd , /u/superwindex , /u/huffmonster , /u/takuya-san for their encouraging comments on my original post.

Take care 💙

I didn't have ""that one"" friend you can always turn and talk to until 3 years later and I decided not to worry my family because of my problems as everyone had their plate full with their problems and it didn't seem fit to burden them with my misery. 

Fast-forward to current events.

School's just as it was back then, but home is even worse now because there is this unexplained aura of tension in the air. I don't why is it that way but it's terrible, I'd much prefer to spend all my days at school... alone than staying home but I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place

37,"Apologies for my bad writing.  I have no idea where else to post this where people can see it but I wanted to write this while it's still fresh in my brain because this was definitely not a normal dream.  It felt so very vivid and real so I wanted to jot this down while it's still fresh in my brain.

So basically it went like this...  I was visiting home where I grew up.  It's about a 12 hour drive from where I live now.  Some of my friends from work and some from my childhood were with m  We decided to go see a movie.  We started off to the movie theater on bikes and after a while decided it was going to be too far so we stopped at my father's house to borrow one of his cars.  It was a mid-sized SUV and I remember it being a little bit older piece of junk.  My car wasn't available for some reason.  I must have flown in. We borrowed the car and started on our way to the next town.

On the way there, we stopped off on a side route  to look at some scenery.  There was a waterfall or a river that looked particularly beautiful so we got out and took a few pictures.   Anyhow, this place seemed particularly intriguing to me for some reason because in was close to where I grew up but I had never seen or heard about it before so I decided we as a group would wander in deeper.  We followed a trail to more some water and came across a group of large sea turtles.  They were in and out of the water and hanging out in this small cave  They looked more like tortoises but they could swim.  The cave wasn't big enough for us to walk in but we could crouch down to look inside and take pictures. It was kind of like an exhibit you would see at a zoo or an aquarium. There were many large fish in there as well and some had large mouths with sharp looking teeth.

I remember whipping out my phone for a sweet instagram story and started taking video.  Once we started on our way back we noticed a 2nd opening to the cave.  We peered in and saw that there were also penguins hanging out in the cave.   This doesn't make any sense at all because of the climate but it's a dream so I'll move past it.  One of the penguins appeared to be dead and I think the turtles were eating it.  I took out my phone again and started taking videos with my friends and suddenly one of the penguins started kind of mimicking words like a parrot would do. I remember hearing him say that he was Muslim.  It was wild.  After my friends and I took a few pictures everyone was ready to walk back to the car and head to the movie theater.  We started walking back I remember thinking that this was just too crazy so we couldn't just leave yet.  

I went back to the cave thing and began speaking to the penguin more.  His words were more coherent now and he had a male voice just like a regular dude. I had my phone out and was was taking video the whole time because I didn't think people would believe this and I wanted proof of a talking penguin. He seemed a little turned by the fact that I was filming but not mad so he went along with it.  I started asking him about his life and what he was doing there.   I wanted to ask how a penguin became Muslim but thought it would be rude.  I asked if the other penguins were nice to him and he said that they all were but some of the fish were not and wold steal his food.  I'm guessing his food was smaller fish.  He got out of the water and walked out a little bit.  He told me his name was DBS or DSB (something like that).  I remember asking him his name a couple of times so I wouldn't forget but I'm still not sure which it was. While talking I started to notice that he wasn't all penguin.  He was sort of a penguin-human hybrid.  I saw the back of his his neck and it was kind of like that creature from the shape of water but the rest of him was basically penguin.

None of my friends were as interested as I was in what we were seeing and they wanted to get to the movie so we had to leave.  I told DSB that I would show the world what I had seen.  I asked if anyone had ever asked to take him out of his penguin life show him the rest of the world.  He said that one person told him they would come back and take him to hang out but they never returned.

Anyways, It's the middle of the night so I'm going to to back to sleep but  I made a promise to DB that I would let the world know about him so there you go. world.  I hope he makes it out of that cave one day.  Now that I've written this down I realize how stupid it is.  Sorry.  Goodnight.",09Nov2018,1

40,"Ever since I was a little kid, I've struggled with the ability to really care about other people's situations instead of my own. I've always been reay self centered and focused on my own life that it's hard for me to actually care about anything that has nothing to do with me.

I'm not sure if it's genetic, because my dad was the same way, but I have a bad habit of only caring about things that benefited me, and instead of feeling happy for others people's achievements, I get irritated that it's not happening to me.

For example: my ex and his best friend were thinking about going to Disneyland for his birthday. I then proceed to get angry because I had never been and I wanted to go, so not only did I make the assumption that I wasn't invited, but I made the situation about me, which I never really realize until later on.

I've tried to catch myself lately, and I've learned not to make situations about myself, but I still struggle to feel other people's emotions. In fact, when I am emotionally distraught, I watch videos about national tragedies and terrorist attacks to make me feel better because it's not happening to me. I'm not asking for help, but I've always wondered why I just have no compassion for other people. I just..dont care.",09Nov2018,1
41,"I am a mid 20's male and have been married to an absolute angel of a person whom I love and cherish for over two years now. But, I can't stop thinking about an Ex. Normally, I would think that it just takes time to move on, but we haven't seen each other for over six years. I normally have a stray thought every few months and think about her, but it has been much more so lately. I have had two separate dreams about her over the last two weeks and could not shake thinking about her the entire day after. She was my first true love, but we were just in different places of our lives when we split up, nothing bad happened, but I went off to college, and she didn't communicate very well through phone, so we ended things. Through the next two years we would meet up, re-connect, catch up, but one of us was always in a relationship, so the timing was never there. But now, I can't stop wanting to be with her. Its tearing me up inside because I love my wife and she loves me, there is nothing wrong in our marriage, I'm close with her family, and we have a great time together, but I cannot stop thinking about Ex. Ex was the second person I was ever ""with"" and she was there for me during the toughest point of my childhood and was one of the only reasons I was happy during that timeframe. Could these thoughts be because of that connection and help? Does anyone have any advice for how to stop these constant thought? We live in the same city now, and thought about trying to get coffee, to show myself that we are not the same people that we used to be, and that seeing that might change my thinking back into memories, but I could see this back firing like crazy.

Looking back at it now, even I would have told myself that I should be production crew. But now, I have my fire and I’m planning on blazing a path to my success! 

I know I need more training. I want to go to school in Canada for acting. I hope to go to the Toronto Academy of Acting. 

I want to get started in Canada and move my way to LA eventually. Especially since SYFY shoots A LOT of their stuff in Canada.

I chewed only around a gram or so of dried leaf which is barely anything to really get hallucinations. Usually, I connect very deeply with the ""voice inside of my head"" &amp; this time it wasn't like that. 

 This time, I had almost no thoughts. I was aware that I wasn't thinking. Now maybe that was me thinking that I wasn't thinking, but still, there were no thoughts. I know because during meditation I struggle with this a bit. Clinging to the thought &amp; then coming back to the breath. This matters because I feel like our whole entire species is on a race. A race against time. We are trying to speed things up in every direction. Even speed ourselves up in order to ""get things done"" I'm starting to feel like maybe we need to slow down a little bit. Not slow down our individual potential.. but slow down our need. Not concentrate on the inventions, not the innovation, not the technology.. But ourselves. That is the final step. 

 There is a world of potential with these things &amp; I hope you all take another look into it. I documented my whole Salvia trip before &amp; after on video if you guys are interested. Link below. Anyways, much love and hope to hear some comments!

54,"I think it's different for each individual. There can't be some ""ultimate"" meaning that's the same for everyone, can there? Some people find it in their work or through religion. Some find it through family—a child or spouse. But what I want to know is, ""How?""

The answer to that question is probably as unique as all the different types of meaning one can find. But surely there are some patterns. I would imagine that, for example, the meaning won't come looking for you; rather, you have to put in some effort yourself. I've heard a lot of people talk about happiness, which you could say is the same thing, and how you can't search *too* hard for it. So, maybe it boils down to: You should go wherever meaning is most likely to hang out, and with time comes familiarity, and familiarity acquaintanceship.

As for me, I'm not quite sure *what I'm* doing. I don't feel like I'm searching for anything, but merely glancing around the same ol' room to see if some meaning has nestled in a corner. It's something like checking the refrigerator for food again after just having checked it, hoping something new has magically appeared.

They still don't see a dog. I bark a third time, and now the dog is very confused. ""Is ... is that a human barking at me?""

It gives a curious bark, as if it doesn't believe a human is barking, but it has to know. That bark came from somewhere. I bark again, and now, wow, now it is barking. That WAS a human! Ok, I'm going to tell him what I think! I might bark another couple times. They get all riled up, and love every moment of it. It's friendly barking!

At this point, the human is usually trying to drag the dog down the street, and the dog looks at the human and barks at them, as if to say, ""dude, don't blame me for barking - HE started it! The OTHER HUMAN STARTED IT! Blame him!""

It cracks me up every single time, and dogs always have fun getting a good bark in on a walk. It's a win win, and the world is better when weirdness is added to it. When I go on walks, I will bark back at dogs who bark at me. Always hilarious to see the startled expression on their faces. They did not expect that.

So anyway, one of my neighbors asked me if I have a dog, and I truthfully told her ""nope!"". I'm not sure that I was believed.",09Nov2018,1
68," I snap my fingers by putting my ring finger on top of my little finger, then snapping the two fingers against my thumb. Everyone that sees me do it says I must be the only person on earth that does it this way, but it’s the only way I’ve ever done it as long as I can remember, and up until college, I thought this was the proper way.

69,"For some random reason, on the last few days, I've been taking the bus to the subway station at always \~ 9h AM. 

&amp;#x200B;

On Tuesday, at the bus, I spotted a girl starring at me. I usually get very uncomfortable when people stare at me, but she looks friendly, and I wanted to make eye contact back, but it feels hard to me (I have a lack of social skills).

On Wednesday, got the bus at the same hour, and there's the same girl. I got to get by her side at the bus, and realised she kept staring at me all the travel to the subway. Sometimes I would look at my side, pretending to look at nothing, and she kept staring. It still makes me uncomfortable, but I also realised that her eyes are very beautiful. 

On Thursday, I also got the bus at the exact same hour, and she was there too. She kept staring at me, and I kind of glanced a smile at her. I started to realise I have a crush on this random girl. 

Today, I took the bus 10 minutes earlier, and I didn't see her. I got kind of disappointed. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's funny that I didn't know I was taking the bus at almost exactly 9AM, I found that out when I checked my timeline on Google Maps later. It's very interesting how these coincidences happen.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR there's a random girl staring at me on the bus every day and she looks friendly, how can I tell if she's interested in me? How can I talk to her? ",09Nov2018,1
70,"I was the happiest when I was 19. Working, hanging out with my friends, socializing m, going out. Just a general not giving a fuck about anything and living life day to day. Now that I'm 25, I'm miserable. Always depressed, don't know what I'm doing with my life, can't seem to find a passion.

I have an alright job that pays 45k a year but I cant help but feel like crap. I have mo real direct skills that relate to my job and cant help but feel like I'm going to be fired.

How do I regain the happiness I once had when I was 19?",09Nov2018,1
71,"Weird title but pretty much says it all. 

So like a year ago there was this girl from my uni, we were in the same classroom, I started noticing her with time and I really liked her for some reason without even talking to her, she was cute and very introverted, I have no idea what but there was something about her... Anyways being the shy introverted guy that I was I couldn't initiate by talking to her directly IRL so I added her on FB and we texted a lot, we talked after that IRL because we kinda knew each other but she seemed that she doesn't care when I look back at it, but that time I was in love and irrational, she was making my heart race and I kept overthinking every ""sign she sends"" through literally everything she does, either text or IRL, then I come to the conclusion most of the time that she likes me and thinks about me too, while she probably didn't give a single shit. Anyways we kept texting a lot, we would text at night and wish each other a goodnight sleep. I became more in love with her with time until I couldn't hold and decided to confess, I said I liked her (being the coward that I am of course by text) she said ""thanks"", that was a sign I should've seen clearly that she isn't interested as I am, but I didn't. I kept going and few days later she sent me "" do you love me?!"", my heart started racing, I felt happy and thought she finally loves me back. I said ""why are you asking this?"", she insisted, I said yes I do. Then she said ""What?! You like me just as a friend right?"". I said ""yeah, just as a friend"". I felt embarrassed, she said it was just a dare a friend of her told her to do, that friend that knew that I loved her because I told her one day to ask her if she's single. Then everything went downhill from there, she confirmed she only likes me as a friend, I knew it was over and it was so embarrassing we pretty much never talked ever again. 

That destroyed me, I really loved her, I kept thinking about her and being depressed about it for months after that, a year has passed now, I don't have the same feelings for her anymore and I sometimes ask myself why I liked her that much to begin with. I also handled it very poorly, my self esteem was way lower and we talked mostly by text. I still think about her a bit to be honest but rarely.

Since then I grew way more as a person, I started going to the gym and my self esteem improved, still not the best but better for sure. I still am very introverted but it's in my nature and it's something I like about me. A bit social awkward still but better. Thing is as much as that experience made me grow in some ways,  excluding the depression it gave me for months and self hatred, it also made me not want to initiate anything of that kind ever again afraid of it repeating. 

Now, a year after, I have a crush on someone in my classroom in the uni. I really hate to say this and I tried my best to refrain from seeking a relationship with someone anymore. But this one seems like she cares, I wouldn't have noticed her if not once, in the classroom, she turned around looked at me and smiled, I was like fuck, please don't fall in love again. That look kept me thinking about her for some time. It happens again, she stares at me, and I overthink it again. I don't want to initiate anything with this girl not only because of my past experience but also because she looks way out of my league. She's really fucking beautiful and probably the most beautiful girl I ever saw but yet so introverted. So yeah, I decided I have a crush on her and I don't want to do anything about it. I might be overthinking it when she looks at me, maybe she does it to everyone. Who knows. As much as I want her I won't repeat the same mistake. And I don't know how long my refrain from relationships will last now only because of that experience, but it was so bad and I don't want it to happen again. 

So yeah that's all, sorry for my bad English. And by the way the first girl also uses reddit so she might read what I said, I don't really care though. 

TLDR: I got rejected once and it was bad so that it  made me afraid of initiating anything of the kind with any girl anymore, including this girl I had a crush on recently.

72,"I got in some good barking this morning. I spotted a tiny bulldog across the street and barked at it. The bulldog stoped, looked around, and barked back to try and find the other dog. High alert!

I bark again.

The bulldog looked up in my direction - there IS a dog!!! - but still didn't see a dog. Where is it!?

I bark a third time. The bulldog cocks its head, I could read the expression on its face: ""... did human really just bark at me?""

The bulldog gives a curious bark back. The barking is coming from somewhere, and no way was it that human, but it has to know.

I respond with a good bark in turn.

Now it REALLY starts barking. That WAS a human! I bark another couple times during this. The bulldog gets all riled up, and loves every moment of it. It's friendly neighborhood barking!

At this point, the human tried to drag the dog down the street, and the dog looks at the human and barks at them, as if to say, ""dude, don't blame me for barking - HE started it! The OTHER HUMAN STARTED IT! Blame him!""

It cracks me up every single time, and dogs always have fun getting a good bark in on a walk, so it's a win win. The world is always better when weirdness is added to it. When I go on walks, I will bark back at dogs who bark at me - they make the most hilarious faces - they do not expect that!

Anyway, today one of my neighbors asked me if I have a dog, and I truthfully told her ""nope!"" I'm not sure that I was believed.",09Nov2018,1
