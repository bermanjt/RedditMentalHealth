0,"Apparently I'm intimidating. 

I never really realize how I come off to others (nor do I really think about it), but occasionally I'll be hit with a glimpse of it, either in the odd reactions of some people or in people straight-up telling me. I've heard it my entire life. When it's said, it's never really in a malicious way--a nonchalant mention in conversation by a friend, or someone being overly apologetic and weirdly subservient about something, or a blushing confession by a girl--but the non-direct reactions of some people are most definitely malicious and that's the part of it that I'm having a difficult time dealing with. 

I run into this with middle-aged men a lot. I'm 30. I'd say that in about half of my dealings with middle-aged guys, they start acting oddly competitive and condescending almost immediately. I promise I'm cordial, considerate, and I'll even be a little self-deprecating if I start to get the sense that I need to be, and even so, it can get overwhelmingly evident that their ego is fighting some battle that I have no interest in being part of. 

My new boss is a gigantic narcissist who took on a *major* argumentative, competitive dynamic with me immediately, but only in front of our coworkers. Unfortunately, that's 80% of the time. We've gone out for lunch and spent time together one-on-one before, and we've gotten along well. However, in front of a coworker, he will argue *everything and anything* that I say, completely making up facts in the process just to win a completely invented argument. I could say ""water is wet"" and he would respond with, ""Well that's just wrong. What you call 'wetness' doesn't actually exist. You clearly should've paid more attention in chemistry. What state did you go to school in?"" Even beyond arguing, he'll be blatantly rude to me--but only to me, and only in front of other people. I've disengaged from him as much as possible, but I still have to interact with him everyday. 

I recently looked up ""Argumentative Personalities"" and read that it's a ploy for control. Shit, he's my boss--I voluntarily surrendered control to him when I took this position. I'm not argumentative or unwieldy and he has no reason to need to try to prove (to himself or to others) that he can ""best"" me. 

I'm no stranger to this game, either. It's been happening my entire life with a very specific type of person. I had a roommate in college that used to do the same thing--constantly trying to put me down, especially in front of girls--but then one day, very earnestly called me his best friend. My old boss began filing false complaints against me when I started being considered for a promotion that would've put me on his level. I had an old coworker who had the same attitude toward me and out of nowhere accused me of sleeping with his wife. That may have been one of the most absurd instances.

I'm not trying to compete with anyone or to ""show up"" anyone, and this is getting really annoying. I just want to go about peacefully but I think that I'm setting off these frail egos into ""fight"" mode and it's just making my life that much harder. Is there any way to remedy this or to make people feel more comfortable around me? It's not that these people *dislike* me, it's that they assume some sort of competition with me when I really am not trying to engage in one. 

Sorry, I guess this halfway into a rant. It's been a tough for months in particular and I guess I just needed to get some stuff off my chest. Any advice is so very welcomed.

2,"Advice welcome but honestly I just want to vent. For the purpose of this story I'll call the coworker ""Kate"". Also for context, I have a pretty professional office job, but we hire a lot of people right out of college so most of my coworkers are under 30. I'm 24, Kate's 28.

It started a few months ago. She was a new hire training here, she actually lives roughly 3-4 hour drive away. We kind of connected really fast and became friends fast. One day I invited a few coworkers to hang out after work, she and two others came, and I got her number from that. That night she texted me, and we talked for a while. I reread that conversation the nexte day and it really felt like the get to know each other type of conversations I've had with girls I'm interested in. A few weeks later we hung out 1 on 1, it wasn't intended to be, she invited a bunch of people, but I was the only one who could make it. Watched a football game together, had a great time, I don't think either of us were bored with the conversation for the entire like 3-4 hours we were hanging.

Anyways, at this point I didn't think much of it. I was kind of interested but it wasn't something I wanted to pursue really. Due to random circumstances I didn't see her again for like a month and we didn't talk much over that time, and I started to see another girl too. Well that thing with the other girl ended, and about a month later I'm in office and talking to her. And I don't know what happened but something clicked and I realized I have a thing for Kate. I end up hanging out with a lot, in groups, over the next couple weeks and it intensifies.

So after this, I go out one night with her, another female coworker, and a friend of mine. We proceed to get a little too drunk. Kate admits to me she has a thing for another coworker, and they have kind of been talking in that way. That hurt a bit, but whatever. But then that night we end up pretty close. There was some like, not platonic touching going on with both sides. My friend departed at some point and me and the two coworkers go back to my place, we had all met there and ubered from there. Kate ends up passing out on my couch, and my other coworker goes ahead and gets an uber back. After she leaves I check on Kate, who wakes up and we talk for a little while and I drunkenly admit I have a thing for her. I honestly don't really remember her response, but she asks to sleep in my bed with me. That night we just cuddled, but then when the morning came and we were sober we stayed in the bed together for like three hours talking and cuddling. At some point it started to escalate but she stopped it before it became sex. I could tell she didn't want to stop, she seemed very very conflicted about it, but she told me she doesn't want to lead me on. 

That week we talked a lot. I helped with a work thing, which led to a phone conversation that lasted about 3 hours. Then we did it again the next day. We ended up talking a lot. I've only seen her in person once since because she's been out of town for work (we travel a lot with this job) and it was in a very large group so nothing really happened. Beginning of last week we talked for a minute and she said she realized the thing with the guy she had a crush on isn't going to happen. We ended up talking on the phone again, and we talked for like an hour and a half. That was about a week ago, we've been snapchatting each other but haven't had a long conversation since then, she's been on a work trip. 

So that's where I'm at. I've kind of realized I straight up for sure have a thing for her. Talking to her on the phone is always so nice, and she makes me feel really comfortable somehow. She's given me just enough signals that I think she's thinking about it too. 

But there's lots of complications. Dating a coworker can be tricky in a professional job, when I took this job I told myself that I wouldn't let myself ever hit on another coworker or try to date another coworker (whoops). She lives three hours away. I don't want to feel like I'm just the consolation prize because the other guy didn't like her that way. And I also enjoy the friendship a lot, not only is she great to talk to but we help each other out a lot with work stuff, and I don't want to mess with that. And so it's hard to see myself actually making a move or escalating this further unless she just makes it clear that she wants me to. 

Fun stuff. 

tl;dr- I have a thing for a coworker, we slept together but she told me she doesn't necessarily like me in that way. But she's starting to give more and more signs that she either actually does or changed her mind. I'm conflicted on whether its even worth it. ",09Apr2018,2
3,"i spent all weekend looking for chocolate pudding. not just any chocolate pudding **Kosto Chocolate Pudding** I went to a dozen stores and couldnt find that creamy chocolaty bounty.

Finally! Finally today I located the elusive hoard.

No! no I most certainly could not have. all Chocolate Puddings are inferior Usurpers to the title of King of Chocolate Puddings that Kosto currently holds in my heart.

6,"Recently, I've been in this unshakable mood where I'm convinced I'm unlovable and going to be alone. I know that people love me -mostly my parents - but I'm afraid that my lack of dating experience and social skills, along with my serious self-image issues, are going to lead down that path. I'm afraid that nobody is going to want to date me because I'm just a tad overweight (190 lbs) and because I can never start a conversation. I don't hate myself either, I think I'm really pretty despite being chubby. 

Is this a reasonable fear? ",09Apr2018,2
7,"Today I'm struggling. I don't even know if I can say more than usual. I stopped meditating, eating healthy or exercising. Maybe it's depression hitting back after I've been doing so well. Maybe it's because my birthday is coming up and I always have a bad time around my birthday. Or maybe I'm just trying to sabotage myself again. I didn't have enough to feel bad about lately to justify constantly feeling like shit, so I'm fucking everything up instead. Can't self loathe effectively when you're feeling healthy and have an actual support network. 

So here I am, knowing exactly what I should do to improve my life and stop feeling like shit all the time, and instead I'm wasting time away. I'm scared of change. I know how to deal with depression, abuse and loneliness. I'm scared of anything different. I kind of enjoy my unhealthy coping mechanisms; the crutches of alcohol, self-harm and insane amounts of Netflix. 

There's people out there that actually enjoy my company. I have friends. I'm doing well financially, and I haven't yet crippled myself. I know I'm capable of being by myself, but I'm too scared to break up. Scared of being alone, even though I'm already always alone. Scared of change, of doing something irreversible, when maybe things between us could get better. I keep thinking, hoping, that maybe if I just do more for him, he'll begin to treat me with basic human respect. He will put my well being over his pleasure. But I'm starting to really doubt it and I feel like I've already wasted too much time hoping he'll change. 

Maybe it's about winning approval. Hoping that his approval would give me some instristic worth because conditional love is the only love I believe I can deserve. I know I'm capable of doing better, yet why is it so hard to actually do better? Stop eating cheeseburgers and spend 20 mins exercising in the morning. Break up with the most toxic person in my life and move on. Meditate instead of drinking till I pass out. Clean up after myself once a week. Spend time with friends instead of rewarching Bojack and think of all the ways I could kill myself if I wasn't too scared of permanence of death. Why can't I just get my shit together? ",09Apr2018,5

10,"So yesterday my fiancé was over my house and we were cooling. Just chilling watching Netflix everything was perfect. She decided to go on about her ex’s like how they all treated her like shit and kicked her to the curb. She also said that meeting me was a blessing, I’m nothing like her ex’s because I actually care and treat her perfectly. No physical or verbal abuse, we probably argue over little petty stuff more than most couples do but who doesn’t I’d call them more like disagreements rather than arguing i mean cuz I’m not yelling at her I’m talking very calm about things as always and try to work through them. So Today she’s balling her eyes out crying after she gets out of church; she’s telling me she wants to break up, we can’t be together anymore, stuff like that. I’m like what wait why what did I do what’s wrong? I’m trying to figure out why she’s crying so hard and why she’s saying this. She goes “because you don’t praise god, you don’t go to church every Sunday like I do and if you don’t do that then you don’t love me at all”. I’m like “woah wait who told you that?” Apparently her family, friends and her pastor told her that I’m not good for her she should break up with me because i don’t seek god. Now I believe in god/Jesus I never told her I didn’t love him or i never said he doesn’t exist I know he does. Now my family is already Christian like she is. I used to go to church every Friday, Saturday and Sunday with my grandparents, pray to the lord everyday before I went to bed when I was very young. Sunday school and stuff. I’ve told her this yet that’s not enough. She wants me to “change” I don’t think this really falls under forcing her religion on me because I’m already Christian I just don’t do it anymore because i know he exists, I know there’s a god. The very fact that I know that he exists should still mean I love him and should be enough. I’d just rather not go to church every weekend and pray before I sleep like I used to. My life isn’t horrible, I have a clean police record 0 convictions, I don’t do any drugs, I was never gang affiliated. I work normal warehouse jobs making 13-14$/hr for 8-12hrs a day paying rent to my parents trying to move out someday and be on my own I’m 24 she’s 28. What’s so wrong with my life that I should go back to seeking God’s help or praising him everyday or going to church every weekend? Whether or not I still do that or not shouldn’t mean I don’t love her anymore. I KNOW SHE DOESN’T WANT THIS BECAUSE SHE TOLD ME SHE LOVES ME SO MUCH AND SHES CRYING THE WHOLE TIME TALKING TO ME. But yet why would she be ok to have her family, friends and pastor get between us and what we have. Everything was perfect we were engaged and thought we loved each other so much nothing could break us up if we worked everything out, but I don’t think she’s budging unless I praise god and go to church. Am I wrong for telling her that I don’t wanna do what she’s asking me because I lover her I really do but I really feel like she’s wrong for trying to do this to me when we’ve been so good since we’ve met/dated.",09Apr2018,4

15,"Hi everyone, I am not sure if this is the right place to post this subreddit but I have to get my thoughts out. 
I am a 25 years old male who's planning on attending medical school. I finished my bachelors with honors two years ago even though I was supposed to finish three years ago.

 Ever since, I have been trying to study my MCAT and get into medical school, yet I played around, traveled, got in a relationship, lived abroad, instead of focusing on medical school. My friends advised me to get into their Phd program and pursue a Phd instead of medicine so I can make my life easier because I have passed through a lot of stress, depression, breakup in the past two years. 
They are already in their 3rd year of Phd, they are in great relationships , they are financially stable even though they are still students and have a their future planned and figured out. Unlike myself who's 25, lost, I'm still trying to take my Medical admission test, single, in debt and I have gained lots of weight since 2015 where I had a six pack and felt that everything was working great. 
I keep getting the thoughts that if I get into medical school this cycle, I will start when I'm 26 by the time most medical students start 22-24, i'll be done by 30, then I'll have 3-4 years of residency. By that time everyone else will have their life going, they have kids and if I keep this mindset I will end even more depressed. I keep looking at what everyone has (not with an envy) but it makes me feel like crap. I feel bad about myself because I had a great life up until 2014 and ever since I have been declining because of this mindset, laziness, procrastination (even though I still managed to do 1000+ hours of volunteer work, graduate with honors, travel and experience life), yet none of this matter now as everyone one is ahead of me. My college friends are almost doctors, have their life going and I'm still alone in the library thinking of what everyone has. 

I know that this is toxic thinking and that's why I hope I could get some advice from someone that might help me. I just feel old af, out of place and that everyone is ahead. I am even ashamed to talk to my friends, parents and cousins because I haven't been doing much for so long and I feel that I have let everyone down.

The street lights were all illuminated which meant it was past my curfew.

I’m (16, F) and my boyfriend is (17, M). We’re in a long distance relationship and recently the idea of going to prom came up and I decided to surprise him by asking my parents if I could go. They said yes. I told him and he was somewhat pessimistic about it saying “maybe it’s too late, we’ll wait and see” since prom is on the 14th.

I’m somewhat sensitive so I thought maybe he wasn’t excited to go with me. I told him how it made me sad and a lot of other things and we got passed that. We talked about what we do while I’m there and stuff and sort of planned things without certain times. 

Then we find out he’s working on Saturday from 5-9. He already made the mistake of not requesting days off the week before for college orientation and the manager said not to make the mistake again.. and so he can’t ask for Saturday off. He didn’t know when prom was until today and the schedule was posted today. He might get fired. It was really difficult for him to get a job after awhile of searching and so I don’t want that to happen.

My parents probably won’t let me go see him if I can’t go to prom because the reason why they let me go was for prom. If it’s not a special occasion then there’s no reason to go.. is what they think. Even if I could go with my parents permission, he’d be really sad about the 4 hours we don’t have to spend together. 

I’m really sad and he feels bad for “letting me down.” I feel bad for brining it up in the first place. I don’t know what I want to do. Maybe I just want someone to cheer me up or suggest ways for him to not lose his job but go too.. 

Tl;dr: Wanted to go to prom with my LDR boyfriend but he can’t go due to work. 

Edit: Some more clarification. It’s a 7 hour drive here to there so that’s why my parents don’t usually let me see him. He’s currently a senior and I’m a sophomore. He might not be able to go to my prom because he’ll be a college student next year and my school might not allow college students to come to prom.. ",09Apr2018,2
21,"I live in Mexico, one very conservative country on this matters, so there is not much conflict about it here because there's basically no discussion at all, the things that are heard of mostly are from the news in the form of hate crimes and murders towards transgender people on the tabloids showing the mutilated bodies, or an sporadic conflict at a restaurant or workplace. People normally won't tell you anything but you are not sure you will make it to the store and back home if you happen to be unfortunate. Things are slowly getting better but only under the curtain.

I see that in the US is very different, at least in the last years, and there's a lot of information and there's even program implemented on schools, there's always the theme of the LGBT+ community and is something that has transformed almost into a fad for how much attention the subject is getting. Along with it how much hate is sprouting from the discussion. Where does this hate come exactly? I thought that having more information and less censor would led to better understanding, or at least better debating between arguments but I think the hate is probably not even towards transgender people but towards how fast things are changing. Maybe I'm wrong and is actually towards us, idk. 

Is it really that bad? For someone to ""be"" I mean. I don't understand it. Does someone really deserves to die and suffer because of it? I don't understand the hate, even when there suppose to be more knowledge on the matter? Is it maybe just a battle of power of who will win the discussion, are they only joking around and offending people out of pure boredom or teenage level of entertainment? Is it just overexposure?

I felt like I got bullied to leave the only place that felt safe, and there I am at the fucking bar, forehead on the table, too angry to look at this man, tears streaming down my face and this asshole is just...letting it happen. For almost an hour before he was like, I fucked up; let's go home.

He has since apologized for thinking that I was just wallowing in self-pity and that if I got out of the house, I'd get out of my head. I had to explain that sometimes I can in fact be trusted to understand what I need and don't, and when I'm lying in ed crying my eyes out and I tell you to leave me alone, maybe it's best to take that advice. I'm angry and I'm hurt and that's besides the original issue. People are fucking stupid sometimes.

38,"Quick note: I’ve posted this question on /r/CasualConversation and it got a fair amount of attention for the half hour it was up (until a mod removed the post for hosting a banned topic). So I decided to move it here since there doesn’t seem to be any rules against discussing personal issues or sexual orientation. 

**TL;DR:** I'm not really attracted to any of my male friends, but I frequently think about what it's like to *be* them and to be in a relationship with them. Is this still considered bi? 
_____________

I kind of feel like a disgrace for even *thinking* I could possibly be bisexual. Hopefully others can relate to this, but especially to those who are actually bi, have you ever felt like you wanted to physically *be* an acquaintance/friend of the same gender, but you're not necessarily attracted to them? 

I've noticed that ever since I started college as a freshman (Fall 2017), almost all of my guy friends are physically attractive. I've never looked at a single of them and thought ""If he was gay, I'd definitely ask him out."" However, I frequently think to myself ""Man, I wish I was just like him. I wish I'd know what it's like to be in a relationship with him."" Maybe the second sentence doesn't make much sense, but that's how it is registered in my brain. 

Now let me get one thing out of the way: I'm absolutely sure that if I were to come out, most of my friends would be supportive or at the very least, think ""Oh, cool"" and move on. My parents are not religious, but since they're, you know, my parents, I'm only mildly certain that they'd be okay with having raised a bisexual son.

So ultimately, the leading question is: am I *really* a bi? If yes, what would be the best way to come out? How do I come out without looking like I just want attention? If not, what exactly am I? Or are these just simply recurring thoughts that happen on a regular basis for more men than I realize? 

And of course, saving the grossest part for last, I *have* wondered what it feels like to be the one going down on a dude. I've heard of this as ""bicurious"" but I'm almost certain being bicurious has no bearing on sexual orientation.",09Apr2018,1

A little background - I'm 27 years old and got out of a very toxic relationship a couple months back. I've history with mild drug abuse but have been clean for 3 months now. I quit my career in IT just a few weeks ago because I'm tired of sitting in front of a screen answering phone calls with no fulfillment. I have a fairly healthy physical lifestyle. I run, yoga, climb and have a healthy diet. 

I literally have no idea what to do. I'm emotional wreck from my breakup and the loneliness is unbearable. My past relationship isolated me from majority of my friends and support network. I have have a couple of months to find income again or I'll be basically homeless. 

This is some serious pain and I've set myself up for a way where I can no longer escape from it. I'm trying to not go the self destructive ways with drugs or shit relationships but I feel backed into a corner and it's crippling.

I should probably see a therapist but honestly don't have insurance and can't afford one.

42,"Sorry I just need to vent.

Me, my parents and younger brother and sister went and visited my aunt since we were out of school came home last night and find the front door unlocked and drawers open in the living room just stuff missing.

The strange thing is about this whole thing is they had taken a PS4 and Wii from our living room and took all the PS4 games but the ones we were currently playing were placed back on the shelf they also took the controllers but not the broken one

They took a fair bit of alcohol from the kitchen and once we went upstairs everything in my room was pulled apart and every single game I owned was gone along with a Wii U they also took a number of jewelry from my Mom as well.

The other thing that seems out of place to me is right when you walk in the front door there were two laptops and a printer that we had gotten from the local soccer league that my Dad is the treasurer of they are still here my custom PC here my monitor here we have this sound bar they took the cables and moved the bar next to the front door but left it in my room they also took all the Wii games but left all the ones downstairs.

They also didn't break anything other than a small window 20 inches wide to get in.

All this stuff makes me think it's my other sister's boyfriend and maybe even her too, which makes me sick to think about. Her boyfriend had lived with us for 4 months 3 weeks in realized he is an asshole very aggressive, never wrong, very jock like but I never did anything to but generally just kept a away from him. But tension came to a bowling point and he and my sister moved out they are 19.

They came over for Easter at our place they knew when we would be gone and when we would be back. The boyfriend hates me and just so happens my room everything is gone from. They knew what to take and where it was and tried not break stuff they only way it adds up I'd was them to me.

47,"Posted this already somewhere else but I’m desperate for help 

When I first got my cat Ari he was as normal and cute as could be. A couple months later his eye began to swell. We rushed him to the vet where he was diagnosed with AIDS. (He was born with it, and had caught it from his mother while in the womb). 

He was treated and became as happy as could be. One day his breath began to smell bad. He then began drooling, choking on food, and sleeping a lot more than usual. 

We took him to the vet where he was diagnosed with Stomatitis. From my understanding this is when a cat is allergic to plaque, making them basically allergic to their own teeth.

 It’s an extremely painful condition for the poor babies. 
She gave him steroid shots for several months. When he had the shot he was the happiest cat on earth. Didn’t sleep all day, could eat like normal, and no drooling. One time we came back for another shot and the vet cut him off. She explained that if he received another shot he’d be at a high risk for diabetes. 

We asked what the next step was, where she explained offhandedly that he should be put to sleep. That the only other option was to take his teeth out, but she said it wouldn’t be very effective. 

I looked online where there’s hundreds of success stories for cats with their teeth removed with this condition. I began to get excited, thinking my Ari could go back to feeling good. But I realized I could never get the couple thousand dollars needed for the operation, and that was most likely the reason the vet advised against the surgery. 

I don’t know what to do. He’s only around 4 years old, and he must be in so much pain everyday. I can’t bring myself to get him euthanized because it’s MY FAULT that I don’t have the money for him to get the surgery. It’s not fair he has to die early because of me. I don’t know what to do. I need advice, badly. Is there any place I can take him where they’d get him the surgery for a discount? I feel so terrible for being unable to help him",09Apr2018,4
48,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for 1.5 years. We have a great relationship and are in a particularly happy place right now. One of our friends has recently gotten into a new relationship and she is having some anxiety about her new man's ex. She decided to talk to me about it because she knew I dealt with the same intense anxiety about my bf's now ex when we first began dating.

 I haven't been obsessively anxious about this girl for about 6 months now, but the recent reminder from my friend's similar situation has brought up some feelings. Not necessarily insecurity, but I'm realizing that the way the ex and I interact is unique and actually pretty strange. I think it might make my boyfriend a bit uncomfortable so I have stopped talking about her very often, but here's some back story:  

My boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) got together in November of 2016. He was in a relationship with his ex (23F, whom I have never met but have mutual friends with) for 4 years. They were high school sweethearts and he broke up with her only 3 months before our relationship began. The main cause of my anxieties about the ex was the short span of time between our relationships. 4 years is a long relationship for your early twenties, and I was concerned that the ex would try and get him back. No matter how much he reassured me that he broke things off, he did not want to see her again or get back with her, (any contact she attempted he ignored) I just could not face down my insecurities. 

I began obsessively checking her social media accounts to the point where I was only hurting myself and making my anxiety worse. I would scroll through the deepest, darkest depths of this girl's Facebook and instagram, listening to voices in my head tell me that she was better than me in every way. ""She's 5'2"", so skinny. She probably weighs about 110 pounds. You're 5'10 and 190. Fat. Ugly. Fat. Ugly."" ""Look how petite and sweet she looks."" ""She graduated summa cum laude."" ""She is probably so much better than you at everything."" These are the kinds of things I would think, regardless of how my boyfriend tried to reverse these hurtful ways I was seeing myself. 

After we had been dating for about 4 months, they had been broken up for 7. She got a boyfriend. This guy, I kid you not, is almost a carbon copy of my boyfriend. They're still together. It still weirds me out when i see a photo of them. Maybe she just has a type or something, but I thought it was weird. Also, she rarely posts photos of her new boyfriend. She didn't even acknowledge their anniversary on social media in February of this year, which I thought was kind of strange considering she posted photos of her and my boyfriend often when they were together. 

So anyway, after 6 months of dating my boyfriend I'm still weirdly obsessed with his ex and I don't talk about it anymore because I know it's weird. But one night I got pretty drunk and accidentally added her as a friend on Facebook. I think my drunk logic was that she had some of her profile private, so I wanted to see what she shared with friends, and ding! Just like that I sent it and it was too late to take it back. The last thing i was expecting in the morning when I woke up was to see that she had actually accepted the friend request. I freaked out and had to explain to my boyfriend that I had drunkenly added his irrelevant ex girlfriend on Facebook, but no, I didn't want to delete her. I was so embarrassed but my anxiety did not want to unfriend this girl. I wanted to see her every move because I thought it would make me feel better. 

That was almost a year ago - since then, she has followed me on Instagram and she likes a decent amount of my posts on both Facebook and insta, especially ones with my boyfriend in them. I thought at first she was just being petty  but now I really don't know if she's just being friendly. She probably thinks I'm a bitch but idk from what my bf has said, apparently she's a pretty nice girl and not the type to start drama. We've never contacted each other directly, but I just don't know what kind of weird game we're playing here. 

I know the solution is quick and simple: delete her, idiot!! But i just can't bring myself to. I don't think she's trying to steal my man, or even that she could if she wanted to, but at this point, it's almost routine to check up on what she's doing. I'm genuinely just curious about her at this point. Is this as weird as I think it is? Or has anyone else done something like this? 

TL;DR: At the beginning of my relationship, I drunkenly added my (22F) SO's (23M) ex (23F) on social media. I never deleted her and we like each other's posts and I'm wondering how weird that is. ",09Apr2018,5

52,"I guess I just feel like talking to someone. I'm lonely. 

I shouldn't be sad: my life is going okay. I'm reasonably independent, have a decent job. I don't have any significant interests, I struggle to focus on anything, so I turn inward and obsessively self analyze, or I get obsessed over some abstraction that usually plunges me into a deeper depression. I'm at the point now where I can't handle anything too dark or sad without feeling helpless and afraid. Thinking too hard about certain topics just leave me a sobbing mess where they never did before. More and more my default is empty. About the only thing that keeps me going right now is, of all things, fantasy. I always have some little fantasy world in my head and I just retreat there when I'm done with the world for a while. I've considered writing, or learning to draw, but I'm too lazy for that and I doubt what I produce would be good anyway, so I can settle with entertaining myself. I guess I'm too attached to this mode to seriously consider any other kind of escape; it's certainly kept me sane, though I fear losing it.

Then my mind goes to all the claims that I'm just a pussified special snowflake who can't handle life, another whiny millennial loser who thinks they're the center of the universe. I fit the bill: I didn't become independent until my 20s (following on the heels of a period of horrifically entitled behavior), I have zero ""mental strength"", I claim to be depressed, I'm questioning my goddamn sexuality for chrissakes. It's pathetic. I have no right to any of that, but trying to just not think about any of it because I'm too spoiled, weak, and privileged for it to be legitimate doesn't work. I know I've never had any hardship in life and that it would break me if I did. I can't help being self-focused regardless. I mean, if it doesn't hurt anyone, surely there's nothing wrong with it? If it doesn't interfere with my ability to care about others or the world at large? Especially being depressed. I have nothing to be depressed about, and I finally learned to shut up about my own self hatred when it crops up because that constitutes ""self pity"". Besides, venting that bile on the internet never helped, it just left me feeling overexposed and helpless. 

What can I say. I like to be ""special"", whatever that means. It's not often that it happens but I like it regardless. Every now and then I have these moments of profound individuality, this existential feeling that hits me like ""Wow, I'm a person. All these traits and tendencies and worldviews are a part of me. There actually is a me, and some of those traits are kind of weird, that's cool!"" And then remember everything I've read on Reddit espousing nothing but disgust for such attitudes - you're not special, you're not unique, everyone's the same so how dare you think you're different, etc. It's wrong to think of oneself that way, to try to have an identity. Though I've always wanted one, and I think part of all the obsessive self-analysis that never goes anywhere is this feeling that once I've completely labeled and categorized every aspect of myself, once I've cultivated an ideal personality that fulfills every personal ego ideal, then I can go out in to the world and do stuff. However, that will never happen, so I end up spending the day with Youtube and audiobooks and games when I'm not working.

Idk what to do with myself. I get ideas, but never act on them. I'm lonely, but have no idea how to make or keep friends (people like me though. They like me without knowing me. I get that that sounds edgy but it's the truth: I say nothing of consequence, people know next to nothing about my life or my personality outside of work, yet think I'm great. Why?). I'm so used to being alone I don't know what I would even do with friends. But I know I'm lonely: I feel like I just want someone to care a little, to feel close to someone, though that might be more of a me problem.

58,"So I was introduced to God during a mushroom trip. That was cool. I then gradually started to communicate with him more and more and things were awesome over December. When the new year hit though, something went screwy and I started to fuck up my communication with him. 

I had previously invited him into my life permanently, and I think from then on everytime I spoke in my head, I was speaking to God, but I didn't know I was. So in the next year, I tried to talk to God as separate from myself but because I allready was talking to God, I was basically just being delusional. I then go in and out of this delusion for about 4 months until I realise that any time I'm tallking in my head, it's to God, and any reply I get is from God. That realization ended the delusion.

Anyway, even though going through that bullshit sucked major dick, it's over now and almost certainly won't happen again, so awe fam. I've now been learning and progressing in the same way I was at smoking dragon over December, which is way less painful than being stuck in delusion/ignorance. 

God and I are super chill. He can only speak to me through body language (as in he makes facial expressions or hand gestures using my body), so I can't just ask him for answers. I have to present answers I've thought up myself and he gives me a yes/maybe/no/idontknow etc. Through asking him various questions I've come to discover that the reason he doesn't speak to me in words is because he literally can't. Weird. 

Our relationship is really nice and easy going, not like anything normal religious people would expect. Like sometimes I say things like ""fuck you God"" and he just smiles. The image I have of him is obviously also very different to the one depicted in most religions. He's basically just like us, trying to figure this shit out, just a little smarter, a lot wiser and pure good. His presence feels very ""big"".

Because I've given him permission to use my body he'll sometimes do something or look at something to see what it's like, like driving or looking at paintings. Socially we work as a team, me going out into social settings and him coming out through my body to display certain body language when appropriate.  Basically to get the scene lit. Lead and teach the people. 

Only people in my personal life I've told about this are my mom and psychologist. My mom thinks I'm straight up delusional. I think I've done a pretty decent job to convince my psychologist that I'm sane, but she obviously still doesn't believe that I literally communicate with God. To other people this will probably sounds like split personality disorder and that's why for now I'm keeping it on the downlow. The only way too convince people is with time, with experience, by making their lives better. 

The plan is to have many humans communicating with God one day, but certain things have to happen before that can take place and that's a whole nother story that I don't want to get into now. I haven't gone into too much detail because this is my first post and it's late af right now. As a nice little ending I asked God if he liked what I just wrote and he gave a nod and a big smile! :) ",09Apr2018,2
