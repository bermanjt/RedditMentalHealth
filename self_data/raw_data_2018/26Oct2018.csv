As to the lunch balance, we just found out that we are just above the reduced lunch $$$ limit and it's between paydays; oh the joys of getting off welfare after spending your whole childhood and some adulthood on it",26Oct2018,1
3,"Howdy people!
I'm a junior in high school and I've noticed a growing dread of loneliness. Every time I go to do homework I can't stand listening to music anymore because I feel alone... I always have to have discord pulled up or something. I have also noticed myself growing a closer attachment to the senior class (even got a hug from one of the senior girls today, which was nice), and not hanging out with my ""immature"" friends. Next week the seniors go out on my school's senior trip and I have no idea how I'll be able to bear it. I'm going to take the time to ask my crush to my school's version of prom (which will be my first date ever, never had a girlfriend), but aside from that I feel stuck with my ""immature"" friends that I can't stand. And even though this is just for a week, I seeing feel like I fit in with my grade anymore. I've gotten to know these seniors well through my AP classes, and they have been my escape this school year. I don't want to associate with my ""immature""friends, but I'm afraid it's only going to lead me down a lonely parth. I don't know what to do but I'm at such a disconnect.

I always have to have nice clothes, nice shoes, perfect hair, etc. I got insecure about my teeth, so I got braces.

And I have trouble dating, because whenever I meet a girl, I think “I’m not good enough for her”. But I refuse to act like I’m not confident in public.

11,"I don’t know if this is the place to put this, but I figured here was better than not doing it at all.

I have some major social problems. I don’t know how to talk to people, I don’t know how to be funny or come up with a topic to talk about, or keep a conversation going. I love it when people talk to me, but no one ever does because I don’t know what to say ever. Normally, when I see their expression where they look like they don’t know what to do I apologize for being so awkward, and they normally say “oh it’s fine.” But it’s not, because then they only talk to me when it’s absolutely necessary (which is almost pretty much never). 

I remember I use to be able to at least keep a conversation going and act like I “owned the world” or some shit, but I have no idea how I even managed to talk to people before. And, i know this sounds like such a minor problem and that I should just “talk to people” but I never know what to say. It’s literally impossible for me to make new friends and I’m in a dire need of some new ones, because all my friends now are leaving me.

I swear I’m not even shy or anything. If someone asks me something I have no problem answering(I think this is because I know what I need to say? If that makes sense), and I don’t really stutter anymore. I use to be very shy but I could at least talk to people. Now it seems like I’m shy but I’m not, i know just clueless aha.. 

Lately it’s been really hitting me hard how I need some new friends because I really dislike the thought of having no friends, and all my current friends are leaving because I’m not “evolving” or whatever. I understand because I also wouldn’t want to hang out with someone who never has anything interesting or new to say. It sucks.

I don’t know whether I’m just majorly introverted or... i don’t even know. This might be just a me problem (obviously) but I’d just like some advice that isn’t “just talk to people! It’s not like it’s hard. Grow some balls.” 

Yeah, well. That’s it for this little whiny, desperate for advice rant.  If you choose to actually answer this, thanks aha. ",26Oct2018,1

16,"Last week, my team at work went to six flags. We rented a party bus, had some drinks, and a lot of fun. We all got dropped off at the office afterwards so we could gather our things and head home. 

I ended up staying at work with a few others. I had some late night cereal while others continued to drink. 

Someone had opened a window, we are on the fourth floor, so I went and sat on the window ledge and I was bouncing a tennis ball. I dropped the tennis ball, it hit the fire escape and then went shooting down to the street and then hit a moving car. 

Obviously I wasn’t aiming to hit a car or even to drop the ball. Clearly, I shouldn’t have been sitting on the window ledge bouncing a tennis ball. 

A few days later, my director group messages a few of us about this incident. Asking that whoever threw the ball out the window to step forward. He mentioned that he wasn’t judging and that things happen etc etc. he mentioned that it hit a coworkers car. A person who I personally worked with, on the same team, for almost a year. 

I took responsibility and sad I would apologize to them. I messaged them through a couple different tools. No response. I checked their work calendar and it appeared that they were in a meeting until the end of the day. So I waited outside that meeting room for 20-30 minutes so I could take responsibility for my actions and apologize face to face. 

The door opens, I see them interacting with others, smiling, laughing. Then they see me and immediately look disgusted. I think to myself, this is going to go great (sarcasm). They walk out of the room, I go “hey! Can we...” “No” they interrupt me and shakes their head and walks away. I don’t chase after them because I figure they still need space. 

I inform my director of what just happened. He tells me that I did the best I could and that maybe I should write a note. But I go home. To think about it and what I should write. The more I think, I decide to hold off on the letter for a day or two to give them space. 

A day after this incident, I get a message from a person in HR. Immediately had a feeling it was about this and I was right. 

They reported me to HR. Saying that I threw the tennis ball at their car. So now I have to deal with an investigation about this when I thought we could be adults. I wanted to apologize, offer to pay for any damage, but I got stuck with an investigation with HR. 

No word on the investigation, it’s only been a day, but I needed to vent. 

TL;DR

I dropped a tennis ball out of the fourth story window and hit a car. At the time, I didn’t know it was a coworkers car. I tried to apologize, but they didn’t let me. They reported me to HR. ",26Oct2018,1
18,"I’m a lone parent to an incredible little boy. I’m late thirties and have recently graduated from a degree that I did to try and give my son and I a better, more secure life.

I have a full time job I love and that is related to my degree but I just can’t keep my head above water financially, and emotionally at the moment.

I was a victim of child sexual exploitation and in my twenties I was also raped. I am broken.

I’ve been in therapy for 3 years which has been helping me mentally, but recently my brother was arrested for rape. My family, who are awful and don’t support in any way are saying such awful things about his accuser and although I rarely have contact with them I am triggered and overwhelmed and scared and lost and I feel even more of a broken woman. They make me feel like the whole world hates victims of sexual violence. 

No one apart from my therapist knows my past and I feel so isolated and alone.

I have had to live off credit cards to pay bills, food and overdrafts to pay rent. Now I’m working my cc payments are so high that they take my salary, so with that and my rent and food (for my son at a minimum, I’d starve than have him hungry). We have no heating as I can’t afford to pay for it so we’re really cold and home feels damp and unwelcoming.

My house is in an awful neighbourhood and I have drug addicts regularly collapsing in my door way. A few weeks ago a woman was raped opposite my house and the police also discovered a child sex trafficking ring 1 min walk from my house.

I have no friends and no partner, low self esteem, anxiety attacks regularly and yesterday I received a court summons because I couldn’t pay my council tax. I ended up putting it on credit card but I did it too late.

I am drowning financially
I am drowning emotionally

I am broken and I don’t know where to turn for help. 

I wish I hadn’t put so much on my credit cards. Without those bills each month I’d be able to provide a better life for my child and I.

I’m trying so hard to build us something strong and stable but I’ve failed and now I feel like I’ve ruined it all.

I feel like I'm just living on autopilot... like I don't really see a point in it all. I'm not suicidal but I feel like my life is just droning on... even now writing this I'm not really enjoying it even though I came here voluntarily. Like I just don't see a point to it all. I'm in college rn which I'm thankful for and all but it's just so much work. I'm always behind in at least one class; and if I try to catch up, I just get behind in another class. I have literally been behind ALL YEAR and I feel like there is no way to catch up. It's just a never ending pile of work ... and I even like my classes most of the time but lately it all just feels like a gray blur. Literally all I do is go to class and do homework... maybe I go party on the weekends but that's just a distraction. I don't even know why I go. What am I looking for? Some girl to make out with? I don't even want that. I want a relationship. I miss my ex but honestly more than anything I just miss being in a relationship. And she broke up with me too is the fun shit. I remember just leaving her house for the last time, getting into my car, crying, and driving out of her life forever. Now I can't even text her. I mean wtf happened there... I can recount the events but I can't make sense of it all. First kiss, first girlfriend, just gone, vanished the fuck out of my life. just wtf    
  
And now to top it all off, the Hackathon I was gonna do this weekend (ill advised I'm sure because I really should be studying for my two midterms next week); now I can't even do that shit. Was like one of the only things I was excited for but my teammate had to bail. So I just feel like I don't really have anything to look forward to... like my life's just school now. At least before it had some intimacy and I could do nice things for someone and just fucking get a hug if I wanted one. but now it's just work and nothing else. and I don't see the point of it all really.

30,"This is gonna be a bit messy, read if you like but if the thoughts are too all over the place it's okay.

I mean, 

I know why this is, due to my childhood and adolescent years being a bit fucked and weird to say the least, but it just annoys the fuck out of me. 
I can be very sexually attracted to a person, but I hardly ever experience actual lust. It's like I'm one step behind and I can only ever be aroused by the thought of lustful experiences happening to me. Once I'm finally having sex with someone, it all goes away. 

I am grossly turned on by intense sexual tension and know that it would really do it for me, but I've barely ever actually experienced it outside of my mind. It just doesn't end up happening. know people might say I just haven't met the right person and that I'll find myself and work through my trauma etc etc and while I appreciate that and find that it is true, I just really want to rant about it and explain cause it's been on my mind for years. 

I know that I dissociate from actual sex automatically. It really bothers me. I've just gotten off of my birth control and my hormones are coming back full force and it's like my libido thay never existed is coming back guns blazing and I don't know what to do. I'm immensely aroused thinking about doing things with someone I'm attracted to, but if it happens that I get to the sex act I just feel nothing!!!! I know I said that before but I'm just so all over the place about it and this is the first time I've tried to get it down. 

I just really want to actually feel lustful and properly aroused rather than this weird out of body experience. Even when I am aroused I'm still thinking about when I won't be. It's like I'm addicted to thinking ahout sexual tension etc because I already know it won't happen in real life.

32,"Rambling post. TL;DR at the end

I have a family member (sister in law) who is obsessed with the workout class called pound... Maybe you've seen classes offered at your local gym or taught out of a studio. They call it a ""rockout workout"" because most of the music Is some popular rock or pop and you use two drumsticks (rip sticks) to pound on the ground when you do squats or other movements to sync with the music. Anyway it's been about 4-5 years since she started getting involved with the class. Around that time we used to hang out and I would go to pound with her but we would also do other things. Eventually the class got old for me and it wasn't my cup of tea so I stopped going but we would still do stuff together once in a while... Pound has a certification that people can get called becoming a ""pound pro"" you basically pay for a day class that teaches the principles and then you get a certification to teach the class so she got it because she liked the class and wanted to teach. Pound also has a group of people called ""icons"" which are basically their top trainers and have to be selected. We happen to know a person who is an icon so of course sister in law and the icon girl hang out more.... Fast forward to present day and she has completely stopped hanging out with me no explanation. Her and my bro seem very self centered and ignore the rest of the family. she only wants to hang out with other people who love pound or teach pound. The only time she even spoke to me recently was one time to tell me I should come to pound. Of course she's allowed to have her hobbies but it's really changed her as a person. 
EVERYTHING she posts is pound related mostly just pictures of her and whatever girl she is teaching a class with, or a clip of the class, or a picture of her posing with the sticks. She even had someone draw the green sticks into her bitmoji character so she could use it to post... Someone even had a baby shower and all the girls in attendance posed with the pound sticks (???? This has nothing to do with a baby shower????) 
Also I feel almost bad saying this but she only teaches one class at a studio per week and attendence is really poor so I have a hard time believing that this is lucrative. Yet she flys to events for pound and she has pictures taken and gets merch to wear for classes. And when she goes to her regular gym she gets to go up on stage and lead a few songs (so do the other pound pros) so I'm sure it makes her feel really special.
Of course I have no idea what she actually pays or earns from any of this but I do know she also holds a full time demanding job and in the past she's told me she had anxiety. I feel a mixture of dislike for how she had treat me and my family over the past few years and concern for if she can't keep up this lifestyle she's created.
I feel like pound is just a fad and the people who I know who have gotten into this fad seem to approach it with almost a cult-like personality. I guess it's just too bad that I lost a friend to it.

So I lived in house with a roommate and my dog. It had nice big yard for her(my dog) to run around in, and we were getting by, just making ends meet. But 5 years ago, my landlord sold the house and we had a month to move. My roommate moved in with his gf. So I had to find a place that I could afford that also allowed dogs. Unfortunately, I had been going through so financial problems and couldn't find an affordable place that allowed pets. 

So I made the hardest decision of my life and decided to give her up. I managed to find a nice, well off, middle aged couple who would take her(they even had a boat, she loves boats). Needless to say, drop off day hurt like hell.

About half of my friends don't have one either. Learning to drive wasn't a very good experience for me; I had some very weird driving instructors but I got through it. Driving with my father was always stressful because he'd just sit in the passenger seat and freak out and chain smoke cigarettes because he has always been the driver in our family. I got through driving school but I had a lot of trouble with parallel and reverse parking (I recently tried to learn this with my father, it was the same thing as when I was in high school). I failed the test twice in high school and just gave up. I had such bad test anxiety, it was awful both times. The pass rate in my city is only 50%, and that doesn't even get you a full licence, you have to do another highway test after that. I had another test scheduled a couple years ago, where I drove to the testing centre but my anxiety was so bad because of my inability to park that I just bailed on the test 10 minutes before it started. I have anxiety about driving as well because I was in a bad accident as a kid and also got hit by a car once as a pedestrian, my city is pretty well known for awful drivers. 

I just had a phone interview for a job that I felt like I was pretty qualified for. It went well but at the end she asked me if I had a driver's licence because there is a small amount of travel and site visits involved. When I said no I didn't but I'd be willing to get it, she basically ended the interview and hung up on me. 

I feel worthless. ",26Oct2018,1
45,"Sounds pretty normal huh? Not for me, for the past almost 3 years I was unable to eat anything without getting intense stomach pains and nausea, only eating bananas and dry toast in that time, slowly starving from being unable to eat enough.

It finally turned out to be a rare condition, dunbar syndrome (MALS) along with 3 other compression syndromes, 6 weeks ago I had a big 8 hour open abdomen surgery for it.

Recovery is rough, after all it was a big procedure and my Gi tract is not used to normal food, let alone larger amounts of food anymore.

In the past I always had to plan when I eat, even a bite because it would make my stomach feel like it would blow up and moving during that time would make me incredibly sick, so I stopped eating at least 2 hours before going anywhere, even if it is just moving in the house.

But now, I can just snatch something and eat it while walking no problem, I can eat more than 2 bites without taking several hours, I can eat two bread rolls with jam or cottage cheese in the morning and am still hungry! And today, I ate a filet of trout, not a big one and I do feel my stomach being queasy, but even one or two bites would have been unthinkable before surgery, it is amazing, just.... so great. I had to share this with someone and I don't know who, so thank you for reading.",26Oct2018,1
46,"I grew up in an American upper-middle class household.

All I really did is play video games, soccer, and Boxing growing up. I never experimented with anything else. Now that I [25,M] have grown up, I’m confused on what I really want out of life. I’m still unsure what career I want to chase after, and I feel like I’m lacking certain traits that most normal people already have. 

I’ve been asking myself lately questions along lines of, “Who am I?”, “What do I want?”, and “What do I stand for?”. No matter how much I’ve looked in the mirror, I’m still left without answers and I feel empty inside. 

I feel like a man without purpose is like a ship sailing with no destination. ",26Oct2018,1
47,I hate being in college without a plan. I hate being surrounded by people yet being so totally alone. I hate myself for being too scared to talk to anyone. I hate them for not talking to me.

51,"I will say that up until all the rules were changed at the end of last year, I've had UHC and Molina and at reasonable rates and was able to go see a number of doctors, so I know the system *can* work.

But this year, I had to pick a more expensive option with less coverage. I went with something that was closest to what I had last year, and thought I was all well and good.

Turns out, only 1 OB/GYN accepts this insurance **in the whole state**. So for my annual exam, I had to pay out of pocket. Women typically get fucked over when it comes to this kind of stuff anyway, so I just figured it would be ok if I got something that affected my entire health system, not just my reproductive organs.

Well, now I have a pretty severe cold or something (I don't even really know what it is, because I can't go see a fucking doctor), and there's only 1 practitioner in my area that accepts my insurance. And they're probably not really accepting it or have shut down (which has been the case with every other practitioner I've tried so far).

So now I'm paying over $330 a month for something that I literally can't even use. I'm going to have to go to one of those pharmacy clinics and pay out of pocket yet again so I can finally feel better.

We need some universal healthcare. I'm just tired of feeling feverish and sick and just want to feel better, and to know that I'm not wasting a lot of money every month for literally nothing.

Thanks for reading my rant, and whatever you do, **DO NOT GET AMBETTER FOR YOUR INSURANCE! YOU WILL GET FUCKED OVER!**",26Oct2018,1
52,"Oh hello there. I see you're a person of means and taste, much like myself, so I know you'll appreciate this yarn. Just 20 minutes ago I strolled boldly into my early voting location. There was a blessed lack of other people, no stinking throngs of *last minute* voting day voters, so I collected my ballot, voted, and walked out, all in 5 minutes. The polling location volunteers all gave me smirks and knowing glances as I handsomely strode out. They saw in me what I see in you: a person with refined sensibilities, who votes early.

53,"I’m in the best relationship of my life. Since September we’ve been together. Her original appointment was Oct 8 I think or somewhere around that. But her mom planned something on top of that and wouldn’t let her go so she booked another appointment for yesterday, Oct 25. Her mom drives without a license or registration and somehow gets away with that so she depends on her aunt but she got stuck at work. Come Oct 25 she couldn’t take the test so now her appointment is on Dec 3.

On top of that she tells me her parents scream at her for not going more than 10-15 or more above the speed limit (???). Apparently her parents drive like maniacs and want her to drive like them for some reason. She never goes below the limit. Both her parents are very angry people.

I don’t drive because I’m a terrible driver and I crashed my car when I was 17 (i’m 19, she’s 18) so I still have my license but no car and no means to take her on dates.

It’s just really frustrating not ever being able to see her except for when we’re at school. I get an hour and a half in between classes and that’s when we see each other on Monday. On Tuesday we have barely a half hour gap. We want to go on dates. We want to go to the beach, to live shows, or at least to her house but her mom forbids her to date and she can’t do anything about it except not tell her because she’s controlling as hell. So they can’t know about me. It doesn’t matter that she’s 18.

This is such a good relationship, and we’re planning to move in together next summer when she has the funds to do so.

I just needed to vent, and I need to find patience.

Honestly the patience comes on it’s own because there’s absolutely nothing I can do about this. I force myself to accept it and think of the time as none at all in the grand scheme of things.

But this is getting ridiculous and I hate it. Her family is really limiting what we can do.

So I guess we have to live with excessive PDA in whatever secluded area we can find (there’s not many in Fullerton) because we can’t be intimate in private.",26Oct2018,1
55,"Okay so here’s a quick “in a nutshell” paragraph of my life story. It’s relevant. 

We were a happy family, something happened, mother chose brother over me without even listening, I became the outcast, developed severe social anxiety and selective mutism, I’ve had a life full of suffering and zero happiness. 

Okay here’s the thing.. throughout my life I have always been told I wouldn’t be shit in life, I’d always be useless and weak. All of my life I’ve been told “you wouldn’t be able to do that” 

I have proven wrong every single one of those people. 

I’m trying to ship out as soon as possible and I opened myself up to ANY MOS field. Today I was texting my recruiter and some how this came up”I won’t send you to recon “ and I was like “didn’t I open myself up to  any mos field as long as the spot came up?” And he was like “yes but recon is setting yourself up for failure” 

So.. no disrespect BUT. Think I can’t do recon? Watch me. 

I’m switching to recon. ",26Oct2018,1

57,"My language teacher is not really respected in class, we are around 35 students and the subject he teaches is not particulary interesting, he is quite innocent and not rude and tries his best to teach and help us, but there are days where he cant do anything, everyone talks and screams disrespecting him and interrupting his classes, sometimes he has enough and just looking at his eyes you can see his sadness, he really cant take it.

Today, bored i searched his name and surnames in google, and surprisingly found his facebook and LinkedIn  pages, which are public, it really broke my heart and made me tear, especially a video he had on facebook with his less than 1 year old son, he was looking at him with the eyes of a hard working father. A man who goes to a school 1 hour away from his home working more than 8 hours a day on a job which in my country is not really well paid regarding the amount of effort it really requires.

On his most recent post he has drawings of his family made by him which are really pretty he appears with his daughter, son and fiance. He responds to the comments on the posts and is extremely happy with his family, talking about how many toys they have and how joyful he is with them. This man who is probably a really great father and loved by his family, is disrespected at school, people moking him because of his baldness and interrupting his classes. He is genuine about teaching but is not treated like a normal person it really breaks my heart to look at him everyday while he teaches with an unhappy expression that i cant get out of my head. 

On his linkedIn page i found he had really good studies and knew a lot of languages but had been working on harsh jobs like a cashier and telemarketer  before becoming a teacher. Also found out he likes a music band i listen to and has written in various famous opinion newspapers

He deserves more, I just wish to be able to gift him a lot of money for him to take care of his family or maybe go on vacation.

She was emotionally,physically, and sexually abusive, I’ve never talked about the sexual stuff before. This realization that finally need to start talking about this to move forward and my bipolar disorder deciding out of nowhere to fuck with me caused me to crater into depression and yo-yo up and down.

61,"Not really sure what the point of this post is. I just wanted to share this weird thing that happened last night. 

My fiancé C (24M) and I (24F) were watching netflix last night when C got message on facebook. C showed me the message - it was from his ex M (23F). M wrote in her message, that she had gotten a phone call earlier that day. When she answered the phone, a woman's voice told her that she should watch out and that something bad was going to happen to her and her ex-boyfriend. M wanted to know if my fiancé knew anything about the phone call, which he obviously didn't. M said she had no idea who had called her or why anyone would be threatening her and my fiancé. She also said that the ex-boyfriend reffered to must have been C, since she has no other ex-boyfriends.

So that is just weird. For several reasons. C and M dated in high school and broke up (on good terms) more than 4 years ago and haven't been in contact since. It doesn't make sense that anyone would be upset about them. C and I have been together for 3 years and M has also been in a relationship for about 3 years. C and I have no beef with anyone. We don't know what is going on with M since C and M haven't had contact for years, but C says that M did hang out with a somewhat bad crowd back in the day. 

C and I told M to contact the police about the phone call, but it doesn't seem like she will. 

C and I don't think it's anything to take seriously. We just think it's either a prank call from someone who knows M, or someone just wanted scare M for whatever reason. 

It's just strange... and a bit creepy.  ",26Oct2018,1
62,"God, I feel like I was just punched in the stomach.

In my post history you'll see my cat has been in a lot of pain for the past week, and I suffer from chronic pain, too. Their daughter's birthday party is tomorrow, and I had to RSVP maybe. I said that my health has been variable, and Ellie has suddenly gotten really sick and I don't know how she'll be.

My friend replied, ""I'm sorry. Who's Ellie?""

It's not just this moment. It has been a series of events that have occured over the past 4 years. I guess since I got Ellie right after the first gut punch about our friendship, I shouldn't be surprised at all that that they have no idea we have a pet at all. 

As someone with rejection issues, keeping around this friendship just to see if maybe it will heal again once they get past early parenthood is incredibly trying. I'm writing this and feeling dizzy and nauseated from this guy punch.

It hurts so much because I trusted them above anyone else. Maybe even my husband. And for someone with borderline-type rejection issues... having your trust broken, or declined is incredibly painful to the soul.

So many times they were there for me and I cherished their friendship. Most importantly, was when I was the closest to suicide. They have no idea any of this happened. It was there mere existence that they cared so much for me that helped to alleviate my pain. I remember sobbing on the floor of the shower and suddenly realizing that if I could not bare one more ounce of this pain I could call them and they would be there in an instant. I didn't need to call. Just knowing they cared was all I needed to find the strength to dig myself out.

I don't feel any care from them any longer.

It started the summer of the death of my dog and an intolerable spike of the symptoms of my mystery illness. I was in so much pain, I could barely move. They asked to see us, and we'd tell them I can't leave the house, but they would never visit. They used to have no problems visiting us. They love my husband's cooking. But they never visited us since that summer.

Then, one day, a baby shower evite appears. They're having a baby. They never told me. This is how I find out my good friends are having a baby. An *evite* from a stranger.

I was crushed. 

I tried to grit my teeth and bear the pain to my heart. They ask us over for dinner shortly after, and I'm well enough to go. She dances her belly to announce her pregnancy. I am shocked and surprised at this display. I found out over an impersonal email from a stranger, why are you dancing your belly? I try to feign excitement and joy, but it is so difficult.

During dinner we discuss my illness. I go over lots of theories. One theory is a reoccurrence of mono (BTW, it turned out to be just nerve pain. Nothing contagious, just my nervous system is fucked up). 

Because I cannot rule out mono, they want me to stay far away from her. This is painful. She is a huge hugger, and makes a big deal about it every time she greets and parts from a person. So now, every time I see her and part from her she loudly announces she cannot come near me for a hug.

I get a kitten after this dinner, and they meet her several times. They just met her again last Thanksgiving. Of course, I haven't seen them since last Thanksgiving.

The baby comes and I'm thrilled. I am out of work due to my illness, so I can be there for them to help! I can go grocery shopping! Clean! Do dishes! Whatever they want.

They announce the birth with a ""food train"" registry for people to sign up for specific days to give them food. Ok. Weird. My husband LOVES to cook, he LOVES to shower people with food. We eagerly sign up.

Then he messages me: my husband can come over, but I can't because I can't prove I don't have mono.

I'm crushed. My husband made them one meal and dropped it off. Without me.

It snowballs from there. We finally can see each other again once their baby is over 1 year... but they're pregnant again. And again, she goes through the loud exclamations about how she can't hug me. This time when the baby is born, we don't bother to feed them. 

I had wanted to sit down and talk to them about hurt I was before the second baby was born, but my husband told me I was over reacting and being unreasonable. I so regret that he talked me out of talking to them. Given the type of people they are they probably would have totally understood how their actions hurt, and try to salvage our friendship. 

It's been over 4 years since they first broke my heart. I have tried to be sympathetic of their germaphobia, and super anxiety about parenting. I have tried so hard to just stick this out until we can finally be friends again.

But it's so hard. Apparently 50 people are coming to this party. Where did these people come from? Who are they? Why have they had so much time to make these friends, but no time to maintain a friendship with me?

And now, the name of my cat wasn't worthy enough to stay in their memory. 

I'm not worthy enough to be remembered to be invited to socialize, except for their annual invite-everyone-they-know party.

For someone with borderline personality disorder level of issues surrounding rejection, this is _**hard**_ to cope with.

I want to disappear, and stop this pain from occurring every time I interact with them. But I remember how incredibly valuable their friendship was to me, so I try to stick it out. Try to withstand. Try to ride out this storm with the hope I can be their friend again.

But it may be over. I may be staying in this storm of pain for no benefit.

And now I've cried. And crying causes a migraine. And tomorrow I have to be outside in the wind and cold, which triggers my trigeminal neuralgia. And watch them too busy fussing over everything and dividing their attention between 50 guests. Is the physical and emotional pain worth it? I question if I should endure.

I more and more believe it is not worth this pain because the likelihood of regaining their friendship is dwindling by the day.

But then I remember, sobbing on the floor of the shower, and the knowledge of their friendship giving me such great comfort.",26Oct2018,1
