4,"I've always kind of been by myself. I had friends in high school but no one too close to me. I moved into my college dorm with my best friend of 5 years in 2016 and we fell out in a messy way after she became codependent, no longer on speaking terms. Months later, my boyfriend broke up with me due to him moving away. Another close friendship I have has become unhealthy and we are growing distant. I don't have friends I can call up to talk to, or banter with and text on my free time anymore. I feel like I haven't been able to form close relationships with anyone in a long time. I feel scared to connect with anyone, just as friends. I feel like I don't know how to. But I know I do, I've just forgotten right now. My current boyfriend doesn't seem to like texting and it makes me feel like we're not close. I don't feel close to anyone at all. He at times criticises me and it's never in a way that is supposed to belittle me but every small blow hits me hard. Confuses me. I feel isolated and apart from the constantly interactive lives that some people live. All of my thoughts are so focused on what I feel and it aggravates me, I wish I was writing about anything else right now.",26Jun2018,5
5,"I come from a family where being ‚Äúchubby‚Äù is encouraged and being anything other than that is a no no. I never agreed with it but I‚Äôd go along because when you‚Äôre 10 years old and you‚Äôre taken to McDonald‚Äôs every weekend you just shut up and eat the food :) 

So by 7th grade I started saying no to food (junk food) but once in a while or pretty much all the time I‚Äôd cave and eat it since my family literally shoved it in my mouth. By high school I learned to ‚Äúlike‚Äù food a little less but I‚Äôd still cave once In a while. 

A few months ago I started weightlifting with the ultimate goal to join the military so I started weightlifting &amp; I completely disassociated food with ‚Äúfeeling happy‚Äù.

Instead of using food to feel good I use food only as a source of energy ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è whenever my parents bring hamburgers or just fast food in general it‚Äôs so easy to say no and not think about it then when I get thinking about how I used to love that stuff it‚Äôs kinda sad that now I don‚Äôt even want it lmao",26Jun2018,3

11,"Long-ish post ahead. 

So, I honestly don‚Äôt care about most of my family. If my entire family disappeared overnight, excluding my mom, dad, and brother, I probably wouldn‚Äôt be too upset by it. 

Some background info: 

My mom‚Äôs side of the family is from a Latin country. All of them speak Spanish. I understand every word of Spanish when it is being spoken, but my mom never taught me Spanish, so when it comes to being included in conversations, I‚Äôve never really felt like I‚Äôve been an integral part of the family. Also, my mom‚Äôs side of the family is HUGE. I have over a hundred cousins and counting. Lots of people, for my family, equals lots of gossip. This side of the family does nothing but gossip about each other. It‚Äôs such a negative energy because everyone knows everyone‚Äôs business but acts like they don‚Äôt know anything to their face. I learned quickly that I should never tell anyone what was going on in my life unless I wanted the entire family to find out and talk shit about it behind my back. I stopped going to church with my mom because my mom‚Äôs entire family goes there and it‚Äôs just so cliquey and gossipy that I couldn‚Äôt stand it there anymore. I‚Äôve never felt a strong connection to anyone on that side. I actually hate spending time with them. 

My dad‚Äôs side of the family is from a European country. My parents got divorced when I was little, so from the age of three, I only saw my dad every other weekend, which meant little contact with my cousins on that side. All of the cousins on that side are close in age to me, but whenever they did things together, my brother and I were never around to join them due to us living with my mom and not being around. That caused them to develop strong bonds but my brother and I to be really disconnected from them. Same with my aunts and uncles on that side. 

My mom and dad always talk about how family will always be there for you in your time of need, and how we have obligations to our family members, but I‚Äôve hardly ever felt strong bonds with anyone other than my mom, brother, and dad. Maybe my boyfriend and my best friends aren‚Äôt blood related to me, but I‚Äôd jump in front of a train for them before I‚Äôd do it for about 97% of my family. They know more about me than anyone and would support me fully through any hardships better than my family would. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs abnormal to feel this way, but I also think that if I said it out loud I would get a reaction. Maybe I just needed to write it. ",26Jun2018,1
12,"19M - I‚Äôm currently a sophomore in community college and I‚Äôm a vocal music major. I‚Äôve always wanted to become a choir teacher and ‚Äúchange the world‚Äù, be an outlet to kids to find themselves and express themselves in a way no other art or subject in school could. But as time has gone on, and the more I think about it, I feel the reality of adulthood upon my actions, like opening a new credit card and paying bills in an apartment with just my mom and realized: Life isn‚Äôt worth fucking with.
   With that said, I‚Äôve been thinking about going to trade school and getting a job that‚Äôs in high demand. I don‚Äôt even know what to do or where to start. Hell, I don‚Äôt even have the knowledge for any demanding trades but only the interest in wanting to enter into a trade or a high paying job. I want to be a man, damn it. I want to be a breadwinner. Then, once I‚Äôm in my late 30s/early 40s, I‚Äôll think about going into teaching music. If anyone has any advice or knows what it‚Äôs like to be in this position, let me know. I‚Äôd really appreciate it.",26Jun2018,2
13,"One party is alleging abuse and the other is fully denying it. They are no longer dating but I was independently friends with them first so I don't feel like I lean to one side more than another. I trust(ed?) them both but clearly, someone's lying, and I have no idea which one it is, because both seem capable of it (and both have psychological issues so the lying may not simply be for a straightforward reason). So far, I've just been listening to both of them and not really giving my opinion, but both are desperate for me to believe them. It's surprisingly hard to be in this position.

14,"I'm not really sure what to say here. I've been in a dark place for a while. I'm so lonely and I'm always exhausted. I hate just about everything in my life and the only thing keeping me from ending my life has been guilt over what it would do to my parents.

I'm very scared for myself today. I like to *think* the suicidal thoughts I'm having today are a combination of waking up alone to a cold empty house on my birthday with five hours of sleep and then. Coming to work, having to go to a farewell dinner for a work colleague who was retiring today (my inner voice was making a bit of a sick joke about it maybe secretly being my farewell lunch too...)

The thing I'm very confused about too is I'm not sure if it's *me* that's feeling like this today genuinely on a vulnerable day or if it's my Tourette's working in overdrive.

All I know is I did something today I never thought I'd do. I googled ""safe ways to commit suicide"".

15,"Hey everyone. I'll make this is fast as possible. I am 30 years old, 6'5 about 300 pounds (Im a big guy! But I definitely don't look 300 pounds)

I used to workout pretty nicely in my early 20's, then stopped when I hit about 25-26 and for the past 5 years I have just been eating SHIT for my diet. Some days I eat good though, some days I eat bad.

I realized this and lately have been trying to eat better (Probably the past 3-5 months have been pretty good) eating salads, veggies, rice with chicken, fish etc etc. I don't smoke, and drink maybe once every 2 weeks.

Anywho, this saturday was one of those drinking days and I went HARD (one full bottle of rum hard...) anywho, I woke up hungover as hell and I was sore obviously (legs were sore, i dont remember what from...)

Anywho, I noticed I had a bit of chest pain on my left side... It was coming and going... I brushed it off... except 2 days later and its still there. Not worse, not better.

I occasionally have a irregular heartbeat which I know the feeling of that (Doctor checked on that too and said it was fine years ago) and I have gotten an EKG and blood work done about 2 years ago which all came clear.... But this pain is bugging me.

There are NO other symptoms, no sweating, no tingling arms, no back pain or neck pain etc etc... Only other symptom is sore calves (which feels more like I worked my leg muscles out...) just pain in my chest... if there was no pain I would think everything was fine based on nothing else happening...

Like I said it comes and goes, and its a sharp pain in my left chest right on the inside of my chest under my nipple and rib cage (I thought maybe I bruised a rib, but I have no brusing in my rib or marks.... doesn't hurt...

Any ideas what it could be? If it is still happening by morning I may go to the walk in clinic, and im going to get a doctor appointment from my family doc and get blood work done and everything else just to be safe.... ",26Jun2018,2

Law is very interesting and the job as a lawyer is definitely unique. Even so, I doubt that it is the right thing for me to do. 

I would rather travel around the world, live in Asia for some time, and in general just live a flexible life. I also love to chill out, playing video games or watching anime. 

The legal business does not allow that lifestyle. I am confused on whether I should take the certain, secure and wealthy road and become a lawyer, or whether I should skip that lifestyle and live a flexible life. 

It is a very tough matter for me, especially because I know of the virtues that comes with being a lawyer.

25,"Yall going need some back story.

My Mom is German. My Grandma is the youngest of 9 kids, she grew up post world war 2 Germany and never saw her dad because my Great Grandpa was killed 3 days after WW2 ended by an American soldier, my Grandma was still a fetus in my Great Grandma belly.

She was born in 46, and in the 50s my great uncle was returned from a soviet POW camp. My great uncle proceeded to take over the position of man of the household and beat everyone senseless and rank himself to death. My Grandma was a young girl at the time and suffered because of it.

Today my Grandma (still alive) is functionally, emotionally, useless. She is a burden more then anything. 

When my mom was 11 her dad died, my Grandma was incapable of planning or dealing with the death. My 11 yr old mom had to bury her own dad. And when I say bury I don't mean deal with his death but also plan his funeral. When my mom was raped when she was 18 my Grandma was again totally useless.

Needless to say my Grandma is useless.

And now my mom is in very poor health. She needs a liver transplant but we got obstacles in our way with her health (Aka she's not healthy enough for a transplant). She's being taken care of by the best doctors in the world. We have the money and resources to deal with it. 

Naturally we got complications, its smooth sailing but tonight I got into a huge fight with my German side of the family. They wall want to come over now. This...is a bad idea. Not only that her condition could improve and we could be looking at months and months and months. She's not dead yet, and there is still a lot of hope. But the last thing we need is my Grandma stressing out my mom. 

And BTW my Mom has requested the German side ONLY BE BROUGHT OVER AT THE LAST SECOND.

And I'm the only German/English speaker on the American side so I'm in charge of dealing with everything and tonight I had to get really hard on my German side.

I basically told my German family ""I'm the boss, sit down, shut the fuck up, listen to me, now stay put until I say otherwise and if you don't like it go suck a cock cause I don't give a fuck.""

I think it worked

FYI I didn't say those words, just the general meaning...I did say fuck quite a few times though.",26Jun2018,3

29,"I am ashamed at what this country has become. I used to be happy to live in the US, and felt fortunate to have been born an American citizen, particularly after my trips abroad to Europe and with what's going on in the Middle East, Africa. Latin America, and Asia. I wouldn't say I was proud exactly, but I did indeed feel grateful to live in the USA as a woman of color, and not some other White majority nation. I always felt that Black Americans didn't realize how truly lucky they are.

That sentiment has changed for the worse. While I will admit that every president this country has 
ever elected had his faults - this goes for Barack Obama too - we have never had such a leader as The Donald. At least, not since Andrew Jackson and while that gruesome old fart was an extreme racist, he might have been a better leader than the current bigot. Trump has zero redeeming qualities at all. He is a misogynist, a worn out elderly fool with an ego the size of the universe, a rich trash fascist with the intelligence of a spoiled toddler.

I would never travel outside the United States these days. I am too ashamed to represent this country overseas or across our borders. I would feel targeted as an American. Sure, the people of the world do realize that not all Americans voted for Trump yet...I'm still too embarrassed. I'd rather just hide. It's too bad I'm not fluent in a foreign language because I could pretend to be some other nationality. Yes, I should have paid more attention in French and/or German class but who would have guessed that my country could revert back to the pre Civil Rights era so quickly, and in this day &amp; age?

When Trump became president, White Americans - and a couple hundred delusional people of color - breathed a collective sigh of relief. Finally! Something is now going to be done about ObamaCare, all these illegal aliens, Black criminals, the Welfare state, violent crime, and Hispanic rapists. Trump will appeal ObamaCare, build that wall across our Southern border, do something about the rising rates of Black crime, get those lazy minorities off of food stamps &amp; Medicaid, and deport those Latino sex criminals back to the 'shitholes' they come from.

Yes, I am really ashamed to call myself American these days. The USA has become a cesspool of all things hateful, and I will not be an ambassador to the world with this racist culture behind me.

34,"Think I need a hodgepodge one.

Let's start weird. Maybe I don't believe in communication. What does that mean? It's something akin to a post-modernist point about ‚Äúinfinite interpretations.‚Äù I know I've probably said everything under the sun about communication, and of course it will never be enough, and yet as despotic fate would have it, it'll never be heard or read the same two ways by any two readers.

And at the same time, of course, we have as ‚Äúobjective‚Äù a means of understanding the world as science provides, and common narrative structures or timeless morality tales that resonate indefinitely. Aren't we communicating? Is there a semantic game here where ‚Äútransfer‚Äù might not quite me ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù or ‚Äúunderstand?‚Äù Is there more impersonal ‚Äúinformation processing‚Äù or ‚Äúdata manipulation‚Äù terms that your senses and synapses can be reduced to?

It gets all the more confusing and more complete when I look at my relationships where I feel I have and haven't been understood. Purely selfish people seem to understand each other. More-sociopath-than-not seem to as well. There's a bluntness in a lack of emotionality that quantifies the capacity to be understood as more of a hammer strike than musical note. And still, you'll find people who enjoy pain more than a song.

If we run with the premise that communication is impossible, but something is transferable, replicable, or reliable, how would we go about finding it or describing it? We can go mildly solipsistic and say ‚ÄúI exist.‚Äù I'm writing these words, mostly to myself, so I'm in communication with myself. I have an all-encompassing narrative that describes ‚Äúme‚Äù and ‚Äúmy‚Äù in relation to everything else. It can go as far as the words I know, or how I can configure them. I can type them as many times as I need. I can read them back and look for them to resonate. I can reliably account for the different states and phases provided I seek to pin down that something as earnestly as each moment seems.

Because it all seems. It seems like a catastrophe should get that name. It seems like there's timeless morality tales that should allow religious traditions to hold sway. It seems that even at our worst we're believing in something and churning through until the next iteration. There seems a fundamental ineffable ‚Äúfaith‚Äù claim to being, be it the endless story of the struggle to survive or the accidentally inevitable sense of consciousness as an end unto itself and its indefinite preservation.

What I don't like is after-the-fact justification. ‚ÄúOh, I spent years in hell for this precise moment of clarity!‚Äù That seems very lazy and cheap, if not dishonest. I don't believe I need to spend a year doing social work for some insight at 70 that's going to make it all feel worth it. I don't think I need my shit stolen to humble me. I don't think I need to pick up a disease or destroy a certain amount of relationships before some ‚Äúperfect‚Äù person or example comes into my life where I can finally apply the lessons and complete the puzzle. I think, if I'm communicating, attempting to better understand, or processing the data, by the only means I know how, I need to find ways to relate to or work with that information, and it's a measure of pure luck or probability that makes it fare better or worse.

What do I control? This. And this. And the ability to say ‚Äúseem‚Äù instead of ‚Äúfeel.‚Äù And I can choose to read this over and over again until I feel some sort of way about it or think I've exhausted where to go. I've been complaining for months about not being able to find an electrician. Part of me knew my neighbor installed his by himself. I talk with him, boom, he offers to help if I get rid of the weeds so he doesn't get mauled by ticks. ‚ÄúYou just gotta do it,‚Äù he says. An ethos I wholly agree with whose thread seems to keep missing my needle.

What am I communicating to myself with that? Certainly a measure of hopelessness. I certainly feel defeated even while I'm dreaming of the hours I'll be out there weed-whacking. Part of me feels like when my mind finally accepted the idea that my stuff was going to sit out there ‚Äúindefinitely‚Äù was precisely the moment the other half of the universe said, ‚ÄúGuess we'll get to work stealing it for you.‚Äù In some magic way my inability to keep myself aware and believing made it so one more hole opened up and swallowed part of me.

What are these fledgling addicts communicating? They care? Their brain is no longer in their control? What do you make of people who quit things cold turkey? What do you say of the ‚Äúenlightened‚Äù person who kills or ignores cravings to the person who might as well be watching a monster inhabit their body from the top of a hill as they destroy themselves one sip, puff, and lie at a time? I still don't understand not having a choice. A choice to view people through as many lenses as are afforded to you. A choice to couch your decisions in a structure of your making that butts against literally everything that would otherwise kill you.

Parts of me certainly feel dead. I don't know that they are, but they aren't helping me ‚Äújust do it‚Äù unless it's a measure of my stupid job. I don't take pride in doing my bottom floor. I don't want to breed comfort. I've talked about that before. I don't want to submit more of myself than I've already done with my 20's to the half-completed ‚Äúdreams‚Äù of what I thought I'd be able to do each week or where I'd be able to go. I saw another statement from a guy who's part of some gaming company with a recognizable name talk about being disciplined. He eschewed the idea of ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù and said to just train yourself to do what you need to do each day. I think both his and my neighbor's sentiment are incomplete.

Again, you don't need to understand anything, communicate anything, or have the slightest desire besides a remote fear to just do anything. You don't have to know anything about the forces at work doing things for or against you. You don't have to pry into a measure of pathology or insecurity. You just have to run up against ‚Äúnuh uh‚Äù and react. There doesn't need to be a plan, a direction, good or bad reason, nothing. Just a whisper. Getting in shape doesn't have to do with eating healthy or caring about looks. A commercial could have rubbed you the wrong way at 7, and no one would be the wiser. Pursuing an academic career could be obsessive compulsive disorder ‚Äúproperly‚Äù channeled. There's plenty of evidence that seeking ‚Äúthe highest highs‚Äù of success in any one field is a measure of pure narcissism.

All you can do is take it and translate. You can pick, ‚Äúnarcissistic asshole?‚Äù or ‚Äúgreatest inventor ever!‚Äù Rapist or innocently-enough drunk? Hard-worker or desperate pipe-dreaming slave? Addicted or excuse ridden? Caring or pretending? Mistakenly hurtful or abusive? Joking or offensive? Somewhat right, or every ounce of wrong? Or a dozen things and a dozen more all at once all the time.

That's the point. I find myself at a perpetual emotional impasse because I've become persuaded of too many things at once. I still know when you're lying to me, but I know even better than you why you don't believe you're lying. I know what you're communicating to yourself, because I know what I'd have to tell myself to behave like you. I know what I'm telling myself to in fact behave like you. The difference is that I'm vocal about why I don't like it. I try to levy the guilt on myself, or you, or anyone who will listen when things don't seem to be working for bad, and a dozen more bad reasons all at once. I get frustrated when you decide not to hear the 10 positive and affirming and responsibility taking sentiments that accompany further questions you also ignore. 

Because when you do that, you're not having honest conversations with yourself, and therefore me. You can never believe you're as big a problem as you are. You can never hear the excuses for how hollow they sound. You can never acknowledge a real hope or light that isn't harking back to that ‚Äúnuh uh‚Äù survival mechanism blindly flailing. You're not you. You don't have a choice. You become another impersonal piece of data to process and figure out if or why I shouldn't bother. You communicate nothing because you are nothing. At least, nothing to me.

But I'm always something, aren't I? I wouldn't always be niggling away at you if I wasn't. If I didn't have a point or a voice, you wouldn't sneak away to read me when you're feeling a certain way or shut up at the opportune moment where you're about to feel or look stupid. My off-the-cuff and quickly forgotten sentiment haunts you months and years later. You've testified as much. I speak to a level of pain or struggle that, as you perpetually refuse to articulate, turns me into all kind of things I never intended to translate. But I give you the excuse. I give you the rope you need to hang me, yourself, and the rest of the congregation. Somewhere, alongside that ‚Äúnuh uh‚Äù you know that my voice isn't mine, and the pain I describe and desperation and hopelessness is everything I'm taking in and relating to on the other side of the screen.

And I'm forced to relate to ‚Äúyou.‚Äù The bullshit you tell me about your bullshit job. The bullshit you post to facebook that you distract yourself with. The bullshit ways you use your finances to ‚Äúkeep on keeping on‚Äù and pay the bills. The ‚Äúyou‚Äù I never wanted to become in taking a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù job and finding myself fielding the same stupid questions from the same stupid coworkers about nothing in particular going nowhere. I'm forced to relate to the silence both my knowledge or my obscenity attempt to court. That is, until someone takes it upon themselves on a kind of pilgrimage once a year or so to get the balls to describe why they can no longer talk to me. They never were, but the clouds cleared in the form of an accusation or point of exhaustion and it's become safe to boldly proclaim the insistence they face and engage is abusive and negligent of their god-forsaken feelings.

I think I've done something right in this blog. It hurt to think at sections. I feel a palpable sense of hopelessness and resentment for each day ‚ÄúI didn't just do it.‚Äù I deserve the rest of my shit stolen or to actually come upon a picture of embers. I've lost the thread and now my life looks like compulsory comeuppance and ‚Äúservice‚Äù for those who are the starkest mirror to the faint voice provoking me. I'm growing addicted to the modern notions of ‚Äúcomfort.‚Äù I could see myself eyeing the fluid lies that protect me just enough to surface from my little homestead long enough to keep the lights on. I could disappear as quickly as they make the choice to erase themselves, as people do from my life, as the conversation dies just as it's getting good. I'll always have my hero stories, and my complicated screen relationships, and my ‚Äúpassions‚Äù that drive me into increasingly specific and overtly compelling descriptions about the end of the world.

I believe this is all I have left. My words. My words in relation to me attempting to process way too much input from every worst source. I don't have what I can do, I need to romanticize the past. I don't have where I'm going because dreaming no longer makes me happy. I barely have ‚Äúright now‚Äù as eye strain and the prospect of paperwork looms larger than my capacity to hold the moment on the goose egg at the center of my brain. I feel like ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù I don't even know what it means, but it's my perpetual feeling. Why to everything. I wanted sad to win when my shit was stolen, but there's more whys than any ability to think it's not just more on the pile. The why pile. I'm the monk who just does his thing and always says, ‚ÄúIs that so?‚Äù Or, I envy that monk.

Like I normalized abuses from my mom, and normalized the bullshit that was school, and normalized a ‚Äúdomineering rapey alcoholic obscenity,‚Äù and we normalized Bush and now Trump, and the families I engage with have normalized a guy following them taking notes, that's all I see winning. It's all normal, it all ‚Äúworks,‚Äù it's all one direction of justification. It's never the other side of the coin. The other side isn't dressed up lies denying the reality of the situation, as people insist, it's figuring out how to take all the shit and render it useful or informative. And if you're not doing it for yourself, it's not getting done. There's another indicator I know you're not doing work. You never really acknowledge the bad, how it operates, how it feels, where it feels, what it sounds like, or who's using it when. So when it pops up? Meh, not so bad, just an opinion, ‚ÄúYou know, I've felt like that too sometimes!‚Äù You turn into it instead of relate to it. 

When do I ever hear people trying to take responsibility for their fuck ups? A tad at work? But even then, quick to shuffle the responsibility back on my plate. ‚ÄúYes, we do need to do better...butyoushouldhavesuchandsuch.‚Äù Bad sign. Dishonest at its core. And what is ‚Äúdo better?‚Äù Better leave that question alone or this talkin' to isn't going to sink in.

In 4 days I'll have 3 grand, maybe $1000 worth of projects to get done, and a weekend. Think I'll follow through? Or will life catch up? Will some emergency kick in where I need to schedule a client on the weekend? Will my car explode? Will I go back to the land and find even more of my shit is gone? Will I get sick? Will I discover lying about depression really does give me a sense of belonging I've never known before? What do you think? Will I flip the switch and after I get something marginally done after 2 and a half months of this job I'll start to feel like it's all worth it, and this blog will disappear into the bin of dude's-old-angst, easily enough ignored if not digested? Maybe I'll just sit, and die a little more each day. Maybe I'll decide money in the bank and my ‚Äúcomfortable enough‚Äù existence sleeping on a too small couch and rocking chair will suffice for another year. Maybe I'll let some ridiculous hippie sentiment about ‚Äúnow is a time for transition‚Äù to blare over any insistence to get off my ass. Maybe I'm never communicating anything ever, even to myself, and I'm only watching things unfold in a way that at least keeps the gun away from my temple.

I don't know, feel free to keep telling me nothing.

i have a few friends but we never do something together. they all have other friends which they go out with and rarely they offer me to come with them.
then i have some people in school who talk about the parties they plan together (i am at the same table) but they dont ask me to join.
so, my friday night is always netflix or youtube or reddit.

i downloaded tinder a week ago, but i dont like this place; either they are not my type, too old(i am 18 y/o) or i think that they dont want a serious relationship or are just looking for hookups.

i have no idea what to do.

I want to find friends and a gf, but i think that tinder is the wrong place. ( in europe btw)

I also have no idea what answers i expect from you all, bit i hope that someone could give me some advice.

Colbert's joke (the original post) is predicated on a rather subjective, and dumb (also subjective), opinion.  


I asked why we care about such things in /r/democrats.  


You can read the rest.  


1. I was banned for ""trolling""  

2. When I sent the mods a message disputing the ""trolling"" claim, I was muted from messaging the mods.

It seems to me that this is the mindset: ""A person who disagrees with me must be a troll. Why else would they disagree with me?""   


I highly doubt they banned /u/seditio_placida for his responses, which included insults directed at me, and bringing up information about me that has nothing to do with the thread (he felt the need to let everyone know that he looked through my post history and that I host a Jordan Peterson meetup).

Anything bad that happened in my daily life, he completely washed away with his big kisses. He gained confidence and became such a goofy dog. He loved every animal and every person met. He hated my hair dryer.

42,"Just to provide some background, I'd been married before.  My wife and I married during college, but she passed away about five years later after a hard fought battle with breast cancer.  It took a few years to really move past it and realize that she would have kicked my ass for just moping around forever.  

I started kind of looking around in earnest about three years ago.  Did the whole thing with Tindr, a few other apps and sites, and just getting friends to play wingman for me at bars and such.  I never mention that I'm widowed early on because I know that would make for an awkward situation.  I've also been able to move on from my wife and just come to love and cherish the past but not dwell on it or let it hold me back.  But even with all of that work, I find that I'm still not really having any luck.  I've had a few dates here and there but nothing has really progressed of it.  Things just seem to fizzle out, then later on I find that whoever I might have had a date with or a crush on moved on with someone with a deeper pocketbook, cooler car, or who spends more time at the gym, whatever it might be.  

It's really discouraging.  I understand I'm not the best at the ""game,"" since I never even really had to play it until the past few years.  But it's really a bummer to have to always be someone's second choice, or to not really have much autonomy in trying to meet someone.  Women seem to have an endless buffet of guys better than me in some shape or fashion, which always leaves me feeling like a runner up.    

I feel like a jerk for even flirting with the thought and the idea, but I am starting to resent the power that women have in this kind of dating game.  I often feel like I'm held at arm's length until they feel like they have no other options available to them.  Or that someone will make tentative plans with me, but they'll just hold out and see if anything else pans out before they have an array of options available to them.  

Meanwhile I'm just sitting around just desperate for any connection or attention whatsoever.  I wish I had that kind of decision making available to me, but otherwise I feel like I'm just waiting for the scraps from every other guy better than me.  

What can I do about this?  How can I better have some autonomy or options in this situation?  I detest the whole weird loner culture I've heard so much about, but I shamefully can start to understand a few of their basic points about the dating game.  It's an absolute bloodbath out there, and one that makes you feel pretty horrible when you don't have the upper hand that most others do.  

\-------  

\*\*TL;DR:\*\* - I've gotten over some rough past and have gotten into the dating game later than most in life.  Unfortunately I've found it to be very frustrating and demeaning, and I've started to be ashamed of myself for having some resentment for women having all of the power in this particular game.  How can I have better luck and also not be a jerk for having these negative thoughts after so much bad luck?",26Jun2018,3
43,"You can look through my post history if you want, I've only ever used this handle to talk about the shit hand in life I got dealt a few years ago.  But long story short, I've had some awful stuff happen to me in life that I don't think I've ever gotten over.

A little over two years ago, I found out my wife had been cheating on me.  She didn't even really care.  I got a little money out of the divorce, but still had to embarrass myself by moving back home and basically start completely over in life.

It has sucked so bad.  All of my friends in my hometown near Atlanta moved on without me, either because they started families or moved somewhere else in the country.  My mom had already died years ago, and my dad passed away a few day after new years back in the winter.  My sister helped me out for a while, but she has a toddler in the house and has her hands full so I didn't ask very much of her.

I've more or less been on my own in the year and a half or so that I've been back home.  I'm leasing an okay condo, was able to work my way back to a halfway decent job and am making okay money, but that's about it as far as positives go.  In the time I've been back home, I haven't really managed to connect with anyone as far as friends or girlfriends go.  I just feel so alone and awful all the time and I'm sure that it probably rubs off on people, even as much as I try to fake it till I make it.

I'm also just still kind of wrapped up in anger over my ex wife.  Even though I blocked her on Facebook and all that, I still can't help but look in on her from time to time.  She married the hotshot creep she cheated on me with and now she's living in luxury out on the west coast and probably never even thinks about how badly she screwed me over or how sad I've been ever since.

I'm just kind of at a loss.  I don't know when things will ever get better, or if they ever will.  I've seen therapists and all that at my sister's insistence and have tried to ""find myself"" or ""find the new me,"" but I just end up hating every version of myself because of how much of a loser I am.  I used to have a good life and it's just so far gone now that I don't even know what that's like anymore.

I so badly just want to have any kind of friends, family, or heaven forbid a girlfriend and some action.  I've tried everything I can but nothing is working, I'm just a poor awful sad guy living alone without anything working for him, no real future to look forward to, and no one to hang out with.

Does this ever get better?

\*\*TL;DR:\*\* My stupid life has just completely gone awful after my wife cheated on me.  I'm just so lonely and feel awful about myself and can't even begin to imagine meeting someone again.  I don't feel like this will ever get better and I don't know what to do with my life.",26Jun2018,20

52,"I know, I know: there is no definition of what a woman should be. Your identity is not set by your sex/gender. I was told this over and over again as I was growing up. I believed it.

A few months ago, however, this all fell apart. 

My friends and I were going to get together to marathon the first few Harry Potters and everyone was bringing some sort of food. Someone was bringing chips, another soda, and I figured I could do better so I offered to make a chocolate cherry cake. I loved this cake because it was both chocolatey and had a great source sweetness to it. My mother had made it every year for my birthday since I was eight. Everyone was super excited and told me they couldn't wait to taste it.

I knew it was ambitious since I'd never made it before but I figured I could pull it off. I had been cooking and baking for most of my life and I always got by just fine following the directions. I thought I was safe if I just set aside a full afternoon and evening. 

It started off fine. Mixed the batter exactly, put in the right tin (9x13 rectangle), and set the oven just right (350 F). Wait a bit, clean up. Take the layers out of the oven, toothpick comes back clean. I let them cool, and then flip them out. They look good in my expertly novice opinion. Snapped some pictures and sent a progress picture to everyone. Leveled the cakes just like I'd always seen my mother do. Finally I spread the cherry jam on top of the first layer. All I had to do now was just stack the other one on top and frost it!

Except it wasn't a ""just"". 

I had to get this huge thin cake on top of the other, and I knew I couldn't slide it or else it'd get stuck and crack. I really wasn't sure what to do. I never had made a cake this large before. I actually called my mom at this point and she told me to ""just"" flip it really fast. She asked me how it was going, I told her it was going great. We said goodbye. 

Armed with her advice, I flipped it. The top layer cracked and an inch fell off the side. Shit fuck shit. I can frost over that though, I thought to myself. Very slowly I pushed it and replaced the fallen pieces. It looked horrible but it was in fact on top. Disaster averted. 

Now to frost it. I wanted to get this just right because I knew that if it looked good it would probably taste good too. I get out a nice dollop and start spreading it on the top. The frosting was sticking to the knife a bit but I found that if I just spread more gently it was fine. 

I moved to the sides and everything was so much worse. The cake tore apart and the frosting acted more like duct tape than the soft sweetness I remembered. The previously smooth cake was starting to look like a freshly tilled garden.

I was about ready to cry. 

I fought through and finished it. It still looked like utter garbage but I consoled myself that it'd taste good if they would just try it. My friends would laugh with my about this abomination and everything would be okay. I put the lid on and called it a night.

The next day I loaded up put the cake in my passenger side seat. I considered buckling it in but decided I'd just stop slowly and try and avoid potholes instead. 

We put our mishmash of foods in the kitchen. We enjoyed the first movie and decided it was the perfect time for snacks before we moved on to the next. My best friend asked to try my cake. Before I opened the box I prefaced it with a warning that while it looks like horrible, it does in fact taste great. I cut a large piece and handed it to her.

I watched her take the first bite. Her smile disappeared and she politely pursed her lips. She didn't say anything but gave me a worried look. Right then and there I realized I had fucked up, and badly. I quickly cut myself a small piece to taste. The cake was mushy and wet, with a texture like 80 cent white bread dipped in water. 

I didn't know what to do. I told her she didn't have to finish it and I quietly put the cover back on and put the cake on the floor. I grabbed something to drink. 

Nobody else asked what happened to the cake. Maybe they knew, maybe they forgot I made one. I hope it's the latter. We finished two more moves and then broke off to go home, promising each other we'll someday finish the rest. I grabbed my cake container and did my best to sneak it out. My greatest fear in that moment was that someone would remember they hadn't gotten any cake and would beg me to try it. 

When I got home, I unclasped the lid and poured it right in the trash. I scraped the pan and tossed it in the sink for future me. I was going to bed.

That night I cried for real.

&amp;nbsp;

This hurt me really badly. It wasn't entirely the sting of humiliation, though that was obviously part of it. I knew what it was but I didn't want to admit it to myself. I had fallen short of what I secretly thought I should be. I thought I was like my mother -- modern, incredibly smart, and domestically proficient. I had failed my role model in every way she shouldn't be my role model.

I have this haunting notion that I'm failing to be a woman. It's not just this cake incident but instead so much more I can't possibly fit into words. I know it shouldn't matter. The idea of a 60s house wife isn't something I should strive to be, and yet I hurt all the same.

I recently moved to southern california from northern california. I lived in a quiet suburb till i was about 14, and there were absolutely no kids on my block. Only old people. As a result, i had a big lack of social experience, and going outside in general. I got waaaay too involved in video games; around 9 hours a day. It got super bad. I was like a young neckbeard. But i was not too socially awkward. When I hit 8th grade (a charter school; different from all my years of public school) i got really bad social anxiety, and got very lonely. I had no friends, i was very sad at times. I thought i was bipolar.

I then moved to southern california that summer. Things started to cheer up a little. I got very involved in hiking and outdoorsy things. I loved nature, and still do today. But that lack of social life and skill caught up with me and i couldnt make friends freshman year. Half of the year I was trying to be super ""manly"". I was playing the ""get them before they get you"" game. I always puffed my chest out, had an angry face, was quiet but smoldering a lot. I imagine it was pretty cringey. It was like i was learning all social rules and stuff in a little window of time. i didn't get the hang of it. I'm pretty shy around new people, and not confident a lot of the time. Sometimes I think I only try to befriend popular people, hoping they'll notice me but never do.

NOTE: I noticed i was socially awkward because i do not talk to people very often, have few friends, no close ones, and get pretty lonely sometimes. It's not social anxiety anymore, it's more just not being socially involved or aware. My social skills are not present.

Here's a list of theories i have on my lack of social life:

\-I try too little

\-I don't initiate

\-I'm bad at conversations

\-I'm too quiet

\-I'm too uninteresting

\-I'm not confident

\-I'm in my mind too much

ANOTHER NOTE: I'm actually pretty chill for a socially awkward dude. I'm not crazy or obsessed with being cool. I used to be that way, like i mentioned.
