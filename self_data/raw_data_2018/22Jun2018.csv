1,"I can’t explain it. It’s just this dread. This feeling that something isn’t right. Somethings very off with this world. Something odd. And I’ve brought this up to a lot of people and they all feel it too. A lot also mention 2012, and how different it’s felt since then...the world just feels like it’s going insane..

upvote if you agree so we know we’re not alone in this feeling ! ",22Jun2018,4
2,"Started taking Vyvanse again for the first time in 6 years because of work reasons and felt myself being consumed by my ADHD again. However I also felt super manic today I think. 

I talked to my sister about all my mental health issues and meds I've been on which I have never shared with anyone ever before. Something didn't stop me today and I was super talkative and social with everyone. 
I also left my number on a card for a girl I talked to today who expressed interest on going to the local pride parade and I would never have ever thought I'd be that kind of guy to do such a thing. 

I don't know if it's the mania from being put back on this thing but this was all post crash too. I feel like I'm never going to feel like this again in a long time or be this open and free but it just feels amazing to feel like this. 

If this is normal I can't believe what I've been missing out on. Probably just the mania talking but I just wanted to get it all out there before the old me comes back and realizes what I've done.

 Just needed to get this out there, thank you.",22Jun2018,5

4,"I’m trying to come to terms with death and the fact that I will some day have to pass(\*1\*), and that it involves the loss of consciousness. Of course with it I lose experiencing the people that I love, and that is probably the heaviest and most painful thing to think about. I can picture myself as an elderly person, lying in my death bed with my partner by my side and it’s such an unbearable yet desirable thought. I would want it to be another way(eternal), but inside the possibilities that life can offer it is the only thing I could ever ask for.

I’m not a helpless romantic; just human. Just today I was reading about existential loneliness in the elderly and it is said they often deal with the angst of facing death alone. I can sympathise with this, I can’t imagine anything worse. Loneliness drives people insane and suicidal. It’s an inherent human need I suppose, to socialise, to reproduce. I would guess that is why love is such a strong feeling – reproduction might be our whole purpose if one was to be defined for us as the human species. 

Regardless of the reason, I can conclude what it is that I want from life – a lifelong companion; someone who I can give myself to and who I can sacrifice myself for; even if I know it’s just for the illusion that I am not alone in the world.

(\*1\*) The reason why I'm trying to come to terms with it, is because I can't just keep ignoring the subject until something triggers thoughts again. It keeps me in weeks or month long depressions. I've also thought about changing my own mind about existentialism and nihilism, reading on Kant and such. So far it helps as comforting thoughts only. 

 I'm also dealing with a lot of self hatred and self punishment currently, so it's very draining to have to bear the two. Thanks for listening.

6,"First of all, I want to say, I really am not trying to self promote myself, I just genuinely want to know if this is a good or a bad idea. I flip my own opinion constantly and would like some outside opinion to help me weigh in. If this is a bad idea, I want to know before I sink any more time into it. 

I created a Youtube channel where I take videos and edit them in such a way that it only leaves in the silent/breathing parts and cuts out all the dialogue. 

[It’s called Silenced. Here's a link if you want to see what I'm talking about.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv1WSXbckPWRbWu1sSj4qAg/videos)


I can’t tell if this is a decent idea for a Youtube Channel or not. Part of me is saying yes as it is simple, predictable-ish content that should be funny and that I can make regularly and people could watch regularly. The other part of me is saying no and that no one is interested in watching content like this. Also maybe it isn't even that funny?

Also, does this fall under fair use? I think so but I would like to know what other people think.  Will I have constant problems with Youtube?

Would you watch videos like these? Multiple videos like these? Would you come back to see your favorite show get “Silenced” or is a Youtube channel without a “personality” behind it deemed to fail?   ",22Jun2018,1

9,"I like my life the way it is. I am with someone who makes me happy, I have  job that is rewarding, and I am making daily strides to healthier living. But, occasionally, I come back to a moment from years ago when a person, who I considered my best friend, cut me out of their life. I could remember all of our good memories and shared experiences...but I choose not to. For a while it was a daily activity to ignore all the moments and events I shared with him. Now it feels like black spots on my brain. Memories that exist but which have atrophied because they have been so inqfrequently accessed.   


I have ways of seeing how he has moved on....something that i choose not to do most the time...but will search out on occasion. For some reason I just hate that he could move on without me when I felt so closed and, objectively, were close.  In the end I was ghosted.   


I remember Adam Green, director of the film Hatchet, relating advice given from his grandmother. Sometimes it would better if they had died, because at least then it wasn't a choice to leave you.   


I remember, back in grade school, when people I two friends  who tol they only liked me beacuse they felt sorry for me. The memory echoes in my mind and I wonder how true that is for all the friends I have made. ",22Jun2018,6

11,"I was doing so well, I'd lost 20 lbs and was  exercising and eating right. I hit a plateau and was at the same 2 lbs for three months. I have an event next month that was my motivation for losing weight and I just wanted to break the plateau so I stupidly bought a gram of meth off the darknet.  Many years ago I had a summer of coke and meth and it was a weird time but I lost 35 lbs in three months. So I knew it would be effective. Anyway, I have been taking a ""therapeutic"" dose every day for a month. Today was my last line of speed and I'm feeling pretty down in general. I have no intention of buying more, I've been beating myself up the entire month so I'm feeling pretty relieved it's finally over. But over the month I lost 12 lbs and I'm feeling really conflicted about it. I wanted to lose weight but the meth made my muscles ache and I stopped exercising a couple weeks ago. I had been feeling so proud of myself for sticking with diet and exercise that now I just feel like garbage that I sacrificed being a better person for vanity. I wasnt even obese, I just wanted to look nice in pictures at this stupid event. And I look great. But I feel horrible. Can I even maintain this weight? Would I want to if it means hating myself?  Now that the meth is gone I plan on buying a single dress for the event and then just accepting that I'll be back to the real me in no time.

14,"I'm a pretty positive, outgoing and friendly girl. I have a ton of friends and seriously can't hold a grudge and hardly get mad. Literally, if the saying ""forgive and forget"" could be put into the form of a 19 year old girl, it would be tall and blonde and have blue eyes and tan skin and look so much like me! This quality is something I like most of the time because it really helps me keep positive vibes and keep lots of old friends and make more too. I try super hard to keep an open mind about people and understand their circumstances and just be a friend to everyone I meet. Now before it starts to seem like I'm bragging about myself, let me assure you: I am most definitely not. While being the way I am is pretty cool most of the time, it's starting to drag me down because I only remember the good qualities of people who have seriously hurt me.

What has sparked this sudden focus on this character trait I have is Snapchat memories. He keeps popping up in them, and they're all reminders of the fun times we had together. I dated my ex-boyfriend for three years, and we were honestly more of best friends than anything. We started dating halfway through our junior year of high school, and saw each other every single day because we were on the same athletics team. We had great relationships with each others' parents and I still consider his younger sister one of my closest friends. We'd take family vacations together, his sisters and my sister and I would plan lunch and shopping dates, his Nanna would invite me over for dinner and my ex wouldn't even have to be there and I had such a great time, my mom absolutely adored him, his dad taught me how to cook; all in all, our families basically became one, and it was incredible. Things were just perfect, and everyone swore we were going to get married. My ex and I had so many adventures together and he was the greatest friend I probably will ever have.

Things changed when we got to college though. He goes to a military academy, and has a seriously demanding schedule. We're also both division 1 athletes, and I'm a math major while he studies aerospace engineering. Basically, we both just had killer mornings waking up early and pain in the ass majors that took a ton of time. Because of this, we hardly had time for each other. I love having tight friendships and value quality time, and he could be okay going days without talking. That hurt me because I was having a tough time with my coaches (honestly terrible people who made my life hell 26 hours each week), and had no one at school to vent to because all my friends were teammates and I didn't want to bring them down. ALSO, I was involved in a shooting, and ended up saving a guy my age by holding a t-shirt up to the wound that went in his cheek and out his neck... that was crazy traumatic even for me because I was soaked in blood and just terrified. My ex was my person though, and I really tried to rely on him to get me through little things like training problems and massive tragedies. He couldn't understand how my life could be hard though because he was at the Academy and I possibly couldn't have had it worse...even with being in a shooting because one day, he'd be shot at daily, and I'd need to toughen up. (In his defense, he was helpful with being on the phone the first night it happened, but made me feel bad about the PTSD I had later down the line.) Everything between us was always a comparison, and he always wanted to be the one most miserable and mitigate any seemingly huge issues I saw for myself. This was tough because it made me feel alone and made us grow apart. He found a brotherhood with his classmates at school, and clung to that and left me behind.

Most of his brothers had girlfriends before college started, but lost them during their bootcamp training the summer before their classes began, and hated me, likely because they were just jealous, and thought my ex should be more focused on spending time with them or studying or training rather than trying to keep things together with me.

We went on for a year like this, and finally broke up in the August that lead up to our sophomore year. Being without him for the first time in forever was double hard because I lost a boyfriend and a best friend. It really needed to happen though. He was toxic. I just, still, even now, have trouble remembering it.

I asked my best friend (girl lol) why I shouldn't miss him, and she reminded me of these reasons:

\- he made me sleep in a Walmart parking lot in my car when I drove 10hrs to see him because he was mad at me.

\- shoved me really hard into his SUV when we were in a fight.

\- told his parents about how I had an eating disorder and tried to kill myself (I'm okay now... the shooting just really shook me up, and my neighbor friend drugged and raped me the night I tried). I understand he was probably trying to help, but I wanted him... not his parents. The info was personal.

\- He was an ass to all my friends all the time.

\- he called my little sister fat to her face and made her cry.

\- TERRIBLE in bed (lol if you're reading this and know I'm talking about, sorry, but it's true, and I faked every time to preserve your ego.)

\- he was only concerned with himself at school

\- his jealous friends told him to ""pump and dump"" me when we were in a fight and he didn't defend me

\- we were in said fight because I found out he had been cheating on me with girls he met on Tinder while at school.

SO. I have a lot of reasons to hate the guy, but honestly still love him because I naturally remember all the fun times we had together, and really have to put in a huge amount of effort to think of anything bad about him, even though there are lots of things to list. Remembering the good things makes me sad and really miss him. I even cried about it the other day... but I am PMSing so cut me some slack.

The problem carries over to other things too. For example, the neighbor guy who drugged and raped me loved the Atlanta Braves. While in the airport a few weeks ago, the team was there, and I was so happy because I know my neighbor would've been so excited to see them. I whipped out my phone and snapped a pic and texted it to him and had a great convo catching up even though he is the reason I almost killed my self and was seriously depressed for a while

Just the other day, this guy I dated freshman year college contacted me too, and wanted to check in and was being super flirty.  I ended up transferring schools because the shooting and neighbor thing was just too much, but before, I left, we had a thing going, and before I told him I was transferring to a school thousands of miles away, I shot him down when he asked me to be his girlfriend.  I really like him and was actually considering suggesting we try long distance when he texted me the other day.  I suggested it to my best friend and she totally disapproved.  I couldn't believe she didn't like the idea of us together.   He's so charismatic, funny, smart, outgoing, friendly, ridiculously gorgeous... the list could go on.... like the dude serenaded me!  He's awesome.  When I mentioned these points to her, she just said, ""GIRL. He's a drug dealer.""  Oh yeah.  I forgot about that.  He was growing mushrooms in his room and selling them to guys in his frat.  That's just not really my speed, and I'm not judging, but personally, isn't something I want to be involved with.  I just completely blanked on that part of him though when he texted me.  I was just happy about all of his qualities that made me want to be his friend.

Another thing is a teacher from middle school who used to purposely embarrass me for not being able to fluently read aloud because of nerves in front of the class, and told me I needed to get better at singing for the school play because I was in puberty and brace faced and couldn't get by on being cute anymore. Her house burnt down this weekend, and I was talking to my mom about how sad it is, and how nice of a person she it. My mom reminded me of how cruel she was to me, and how many times she used to make me cry.  I just forgot about that part of her.  I just remembered how she helped a WWII war veteran see his memorial in D.C. through a fundraiser she set up at school.  

There are tons of other examples, but I think you guys get the point. I genuinely live with rose colored glasses superglued to my face, and always see and remember the good in people. I don't know how to take them off, and want to be able to see clearly without friends and family reminding me of the toxicity of some people. The hardest person to be like this with is definitely my ex because he was such a cornerstone in my life, and I still miss him even though he's not a good guy and a joke of a friend.

I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest and see if I'm alone in this, or if anyone knows how to not forget the people who hurt you so you don't let them hurt you again without losing optimism and positivity in your life. Sorry for the long read! I really appreciate all of the responses. Love to all ya'll :)",22Jun2018,1

It's just a high you are always chasing and it comes in moments that are so clean and beautiful that you can't believe they are real.

Last night I was flying. High, drugged, stupid with bliss and it was mania. I was manic with adoration of the moment. I knew, but really, I only knew that it can't be permanent, I must be on my guard...

Soon some other shred of hysteria would come.

When? In what form? 

What splintering burst of hateful reality would come to asphyxiate my blathering joy?

Who knows?

But it makes my happiness so much more desperate and grasping when I know it's only so sparingly temporary.

And it scares me.

Isn't it better to just mire in the thickets of despair?

No loss there, down in the shallows.

No disappointment there, down if the forests of grief and exhausted despair. 

All is as it should be in tragedy.

Nothing to fall from. Nothing to suffer when suffering is all there is to EAT.

Well, it didn't turn out this way. I hadn't realized how good life was and how many friends I did actually have in school. Everything has gotten so much worse now. I feel hollow, like an empty shell, waking up and falling asleep everyday, going to my lectures, but none of these feel meaningful in any way. Contrary to my expectations, I don't feel passionate about my major, in fact I don't really feel passionate about anything at all. I realize what a loser I'm being, preferring to do nothing at all over doing anything else really, socially isolated and without any chance of academical success. But realizing this doesn't motivate me, I just feel so passionately neutral about everything.

30,"More than a month ago I was having the worst tooth ache of my life. I went to a public hospital for a dental checkup. I thought it was just a hole in a tooth because I'm not the best when it comes to brushing my teeth. As it turns out, my bottom left wisdom tooth had impacted and decayed right down to the nerves. 

My heart sank. I knew what the dentist was going to say next. She told me that I need to remove my wisdom teeth. 

I've heardstories from my family and from the internet where people removed their wisdom teeth and how it was a really painful experience. It scared me. The mouth has got to be one of the most sensitive area in a person's body and, based on gifs I've seen, removing wisdom teeth has got to be one of the most painful things that you can do to your mouth.

I asked if there was any other way, but she told the pain will only get worst if I didn't. I asked if I could be put to sleep by anesthetics, but she told me that they don't practice that for minor dental surgery. 

So, I relunctantly set up an appointment. I chose to only remove my left wisdom teeth because my right ones hasn't impacted...yet. Because it was a public hospital, my surgery date wasn't due until a month later. So, I had to endure a full month of tooth pains before I could go through the procedure.

Fast forward until yesterday, I was really nervous. I woke up early in the crack of dawn and had a cold shower. My brother drove me to the hospital and my mom was there to provide emotional support. My little sister was also there but she just followed along because she's bored. 

I had to take a number and wait my turn. There were six other numbers before me. My heart was beating faster each time a number was called out and it wasn't mine. I just want to get it over with and being forced to wait does not help. 

""2014, room 13"", the loudspeaker spoke. Finally, my number was called out. I walked to room 13 and opened the door. A male doctor greets me and told me to take a seat on the chair for dental patients. I responded to his greeting and took a seat. He promptly gave me some legal documents and I signed it and returned it to him. Then, he told me to lay down and relax. I do as instructed and laid down. I couldn't relax, not at all. 

He told me to open my mouth and started the procedure. He first checked the affected tooth, give it a few taps and several pokes and whatnot with his dental equipments. He asked if it hurts when he does that. I said yes. 

Then, he asked his assistant to bring out the anesthetic. I closed my eyes because I'm not a fan of needles. I decided not to open it until the procedure is finished. He injected my gum four times, twice near the top tooth and twice near the bottom tooth. Surprisingly, there was't much pain. They waited for the anesthetic to start working before continuing.

After I couldn't feel my left check, mouth and the side of my tongue, the doctor wedged something between my decayed bottom wisdom tooth and my healthy tooth. It was one of the most painful thing I've ever felt. Even more painful than when I broke my kneecap. I let out a small shriek and the doctor stopped. 

He injects me with anesthesia two more times and waited a bit. Then, he continued wedging something in between my teeth again. I let out a small shriek but he didn't stopped. The pain was really intense at this point and my body involuntarily started shaking due to the pain. I forced myself to stop shaking, with little success. The doctor started drilling or something on the decayed tooth. The doctor told me that he's almost got it out and that I'll have to endure the pain just a little bit longer. I tried my best to endure when the pain slowly subsided. He told me he finally removed it and is now stitching my gum. 

He moved on to my top left wisdom tooth. To my surprise, I didn't feel anything. There was no pain, just a little pressure. A few minutes later, he said he was finished. He told me to wait for medications. After about 10 minutes, he gave me the medications I needed and some pamphlets, and I went home with my family.

One day later, my gums are a bit swollen and there's a little bleeding but other than that, I feel fine. 

I'm glad I got my wisdom teeth removed. It *was* painful, but only on the bottom left tooth, and only because it has decayed until it reached my nerves. I might need to remove my right wisdom teeth someday, but that's future-me's problems.

I don't really know how to end this. So I'll just end it. And if you read this until the end, you're an amazing person and you're great!

We lived separately but i was very doting and submissive.  He is a narcissist, ive always known that and i battled to see all the ways he tried, and he did try, despite the fact when he failed it was usually epically.  But something happened a couple of weeks ago on a holiday to thailand that just broke the spell, i lost my submissive bond to him entirely and i couldn't get it back.

33,"Earlier tonight I got a call from my boss and he last minute told me he’s selling the business and apparently the buyers are going to come in and evaluate the staff and see how do we things, see how we work and see “if they need us”.. but it sounded as though he’s subtly trying to tell me most likely we’re all going to be losing our jobs.

Fast forward a couple hours later when I went into work for my shift, it turned out the guy who bought the place worked with one of my cousins 10+ years ago at another restaurant/lounge, and he recognized me. I was super young at the time, crazy! Small world I guess.

But after talking to him he was pretty honest with me and said most likely all the staff are going to be let go. Gave me some hope by telling me there’s a small chance he might keep ONE employee, but said that’s IF he needs them. My shift for tonight is now finished and there weren’t that many tables, so he said if it stays like that he isn’t going to keep any of us at all.

Yeah.. jobs come and go.. and I get that.. but I loved my coworkers and my boss and my manager and it just sucks that nothing lasts forever. Maybe I’ll apply to Starbucks or maybe another place and hopefully they’ll accept me..",22Jun2018,3
34,"Okay so basically my friend was looking to adopt a dog, so I helped them track down a puppy on the trading post. This guy was selling off a litter, still had the gender/colour my friend wanted, and wasn't too far away. Asking price was high, but negotiable. We texted back and forth for a meeting time and address, and the seller said he also had another litter available, born not long after this litter. Okay, fine. We went to check them out.

It was a big property, but each litter was fenced into a small area with no shelter. They were soaking wet in the Winter rain, and covered in feces. They seemed like they hadn't been handled, and seemed a little standoffish/antisocial/generally disinterested in the owners or us. They were a little skinny too. The owner told us he's a registered breeder but not registered with the council, and went to great lengths to tell us how great the parents were; that they're from different states but he doesn't have the papers, and if we have any doubts he's happy to provide the numbers of people who had adopted previous litters to confirm how happy and healthy they are (we hadn't said anything about having any doubts in his validity).

It all just struck me as very strange, and I felt awful for the pups, though I'm used to fat, spoilt, indoor dogs. I don't know if I overreacted by reporting him, but I don't know if I could live with myself if I didn't, because worst case scenario, he'll be checked out and they'll contact me to tell me the dogs are fine, right?",22Jun2018,9

37,"In light of all the sad, troubling news, I wrote down all the things that immigration has brought me:

- daughter
- son
- husband 
- in laws 
- happiness and self acceptance 
- a second language 
- I learned a new culture and traditions 
- I became more understanding and less “conservative” 
- I am more open to dissenting opinions
- I can more easily look at issues from multiple sides 
- employees/partners in crime at work
- great group of friends
- food (not just tacos, but my fruits and veggies too)
- lots and lots of my favorite tv shows/movies

And finally, life. My grandparents came here sometime before/after World war 1 (I’m not exactly sure). They were from Europe, and I honestly believe that if they had not, the likelihood of them escaping and still having my father in 1945 would have been slim to none. They came here to be farmers, so essentially migrant farm workers! My gramps then made a midlife crisis type of decision, moved to the city, and became head of purchasing at a huge company. He lived the American dream. 

All these things were a direct result of immigration. Without my husband and his family, I would not have become the person I am (in my opinion leaps and bounds better than I was). In times like this, with all the negativity and sadness, and horror floating around, I needed to be reminded of the positives.

39," Focus is both a blessing and a curse, it has the power to make you see the opportunities you wouldn't otherwise, but it can also make you see the potential failures you wouldn't.  It's all about focus.  Irony is, every thing is still out there, for you to see and for you to act upon.  The only difference is what you focus on.    


There's always a pro and a con to anything.  I've been training and running for a while now, I know what good it gives me and I tend to focus on the goods.  Some might say I use pink colored glasses and they are right!  I do!  And it has enabled me to push forward, grow more and achieve many goals.  Sure, there's risks in training, there's risk in anything!  You can slip on the freaking soap when you take a shower, you don't need to train for marathon for this!  But there's also risks in doing nothing.  A lot!    


Maybe I'm lucky, maybe I'm wired to focus on the opportunities instead of the risks, I know I've succeeded in many things I did, I know I failed in some and either tried something different or changed my goals altogether but, one thing for sure, it made me grow.  And, the more important the failure, the more I've grown.  My failed mariage have made me grow and enlighten so much that, today, I am thankful for it.    


That's a ll a question of focus!  Do I want to reminiscence on the past, the ""what could've been""?  Nah!  F\*ck it!   I'll see the opportunities, the new door opening, the new experiences, it's a  new chapter and it is yet to be written!  


That's where the magic of the focus comes in!  By focusing on the opportunities, you'll see the one door opening, the glimpse of light and you'll focus on this, on the tiniest occasion you have to gain, to make yourself better, to make others better, and you'll work your ass trough it, driven by the goals, driven by the directions, by the progression toward it.  Maybe this time you won't achieve it, but you are so f\*cking focused on it that you'll see another glimpse right after, and you'll realize the path toward it is not that long anymore!  Your goal of doing a 10k run in 40 min. is not 10 minutes away, it's now 8, then 5, then 1 and you'll train harder, you'll focus on the gain, on the goal, and you'll work 10 times as hard on that minutes than you did on doing the 10k to begin with.  And you'll push yourself and you'll be happy you did!    


Then, the 10k turns into a 21k, then a full marathon, and you've failed at achieving goals so many times, but your focus is not there, it's on the one time you did, because you succeeded on that 5k, then you succeeded on that 10k, and no matter how many times you've failed, you have succeeded and your focus is on this.  


You can change the ""running 10k"" to loosing 5 pound, to talking to gals, to learning guitar, to reading a book, to writing a blog, you can setup carrer goals, health goals, relationship goals, gaming goals, entertainment goals, whatever!  The important thing is the focus!  You try, you fail, you learn, you adapt, you retry, rince, repeat!

In the end, it's all a question of what you chose to focus on.  


TL/DR:  Yeah, you really need to work on your focus!!",22Jun2018,2

The really crushing part is that I do enjoy the fantasy. I can see myself with someone like her, but seeing and feeling are two different things.

42,"Well, I'm in a long distance gay relationship with my gay bf for like 3 months now. We both are 16 (if this is important I'm a cancer, he's a libra) We always were able to talk and we always talked about our problems. We had really strong feelings for each other, I played a lot of piano for him while he was doing a lot of art for me. Even if we had some very small conflicts we were able to fix them easilly. And we never obligate each other for everything, we stay honest, caring, helpful and we give each other enough freedom. We even sent each other packages with hoodies, sweets and letters.


In my opinion we had a perfect relationship and I thought like our love feeling will never die. But lately we've been talking about very VERY serious topics for us and he said something like ""I was thinking like this was a bad idea... and with every week feeling no feelings I think like it might've been a bad idea"". I got really confused cuz we already survived a lot and I heard him a few times already crying out of love for me. He always seemed to me like he felt something, but when I heard that I got lost and I really need help...


I can add that he had a very bad past experience. He was in a relationship with a player which cared only about sex(erotic roleplays). My bf let his ex do erotic rps only cuz he was his first boy. And he told me that he felt something to him only at the beginning then the feeling died. I wanna add that he had like 17 breaks with him.


There was like one time when he actually felt like his heart was alive, it was a romantic roleplay with one of his friends. It looked like that:

A: *notices sleeping B and gets on the bed*

B: *pulls A closer and cuddles him*

44,"Hey, 

I just answered a question from a guy who feels like he is going to have the crappiest summer ever, he is constantly on his computer and feeling bored. 

So this hit home for me because when I was in grade 8 I had this same experience. The last bell of the day rang out and everyone went home for summer. I said good bye to my buddies and walked home alone. I made a lunch for myself, and went upstairs on my computer browsing. 

I felt horrible, the sun was out, it was super warm, I should have been celebrating right? But the thing was nobody asked me to do anything, so... that was it! 

After a few weeks/a month of waking up at lunch time, eating crappy food, and spending my days either at work or upstairs in my room my parents confronted me. I mean here I was, a healthy, young kid with friends and pocket change and I was out of school for the summer and what was I doing? Barring myself in my room, isolating myself and doing nothing. 

They told me that I couldn’t just wait for stuff to happen that I had to make them happen. So I did just that. I invited my friends over, even though they left me out of everything. Turns out they just thought I didn’t want to come. We spent the night having a campfire and getting take out. It was awesome. 

BUTTT then I found that if my friends didn’t invite me or if they were busy I was feeling down again. So again my parents confronted me and told me that I have to learn more about myself and how to be alone. So I did that... I bought an old guitar and learned how to play outside in a park... I borrowed my cousin’s skate board and taught myself at our local skate park and ended up meeting some really cool people, I joined a base ball team and met friends that were in my school who I never even knew existed. 

I put myself out there. I realize that is really hard thing for anyone with mental illness or phobias and I have been there too. Before you can do any of the above you need to take care of yourself and reach out to someone to help you be proactive about your illness. For me it was realizing what self care was and how to gain my confidence back. 

I created a routine for myself. I started waking up at the same time each day, I ate half decent meals and I made sure to always shower and get dressed no matter what. I even forced myself to stick some ear buds in my ears and go for a walk or a run by myself every now and then. 

And of course I still played video games and stuff... we always need to have our guilty pleasures. But seriously, if you are able to don’t let this summer be another isolating experience. Put yourself out there and make it happen!!! I learned so much about myself that summer, what I liked to do, what I was capable of and just how to show myself some love. I learned how important self care is and how dangerous it is to isolate yourself. 

You can do this, give yourself the summer you deserve! No more fear of missing out! Do what you love! ",22Jun2018,484

46,"I almost always love my life. Today I am feeling suddenly terrible. I can’t stop going back and forth between how much I love the things I have in my life vs how much emotional and mental turmoil they put me through. 

My boyfriend is so sweet and goofy and helpful with things like taking me to work, being sweet to me on dates, listening to me cry, etc. lately I have noticed more and more how I have to micro manage everything he does. It’s like when we’re in the same room together he suddenly loses half of his brain. Recently he needed paper towels because our puppy had an accident, he opened the closet to get them and said we were out. I told him to look in the closet and he said “I did!” 

So I got up from where I was relaxing and opened the closet, to find the paper towels sitting right at eye level, behind absolutely nothing. This isn’t a unique thing, often times the thing he is looking for is right under his nose if he would do anything but look lazily in 3 general directions. I have to lose my mind for him to clean the kitchen, he is the cook and he is the person responsible for the kitchen. I clean the living room and the bedroom and the bathroom. He is responsible for one room and he won’t even do that correctly, i have to constantly remind him to clean the counters so they don’t get sticky. I feel like I’m being used so he can turn his brain off. He has lived on his own before we met, I do not understand how he lived. I never get to turn my brain off. I even have sleep dreams of stress and micro management. 

Over the weekend a friend of mine needed a place to stay so he could attend a job interview. I let him stay and he complained about the state of the house every day. Yeah, my house was a bit messy but it is not a pig sty by any means. I work full time in a very physically and mentally demanding position. I get a minor injury at work every day, I’m covered in bruises and scrapes and I come home exhausted, but I still have to muster the energy to feed myself and play with my puppy. He is just a puppy, he does not understand that I come home from work tired. He is only 11 weeks old, he takes priority over cleaning the clutter (which isn’t even trash, it’s just our own items that need to be organized). 

After complaining he went home for two days to collect the rest of his things. He got the job! I’m happy for him, but then last minute he wants to leave his bird with us. We let him bring his bird as a favor to him, because I know they are very emotionally attached animals. We did not expect him to ask us to watch the bird as well. We let the bird stay for the two days. I still feel used. 

My friends come over once a week, sometimes only once every two weeks. They don’t have any fun and leave early. I offer games of all types and levels of commitment and nobody seems to want to play.
I love my friends and I just want them to have fun when they hang out with me like we used to a few months ago. 

I am stuck and scared. I am literally bleeding and bruised and exhausted from life and I do not feel like I belong to myself anymore. Making myself look nice feels like a chore, it used to be fun and gratifying.

It’s been a long journey to self love. I’m 21 years old and I’ve been suffering from mental illness for 8 years. I socially isolated myself after the darkest depressive episode of my life in 2016, and still in the same friendless position since then. Part of my anxiety is pressuring myself to fix me. It’s me thinking that if I tell people about how I feel, I would be weak and stupid.

I’m trying to see my cousin more often now and yeah. I’m going to be reading and learning and writing again. I’ll probably start building my website for my portfolio in programming. 




Either or, I kind of have a passive feeling about this. I am hoping this summer is going to change my life. I hope I meet some likeminded people that I can be myself around them and they can be themselves around me. I hope I find myself loving myself conditionally. I hope to spend more time with the people that already in my life. I’m just hoping for a good summer. I never had one.

51,"What I know is a big roadblock has gotten its way into my life lately, and I'm not sure what to do about it.

I'm about to turn 34 in a few months and I just have nothing going on in my life in terms of meeting a solid partner or getting anywhere near starting a family.  I've had dates, girlfriends that have lasted a while, but so many different things have happened in life which have kept me from making a long lasting connection with anyone.

This all is really getting to me lately.  I realize I'm not getting any younger or any better, and it's starting to shatter my confidence.  I understand this is a chicken and egg thing.  I won't get anywhere without confidence, and I need to get somewhere in order to have authentic confidence.  As I'm approaching my mid-thirties now, I have to be realistic and understand I am a far less desirable catch as I age, and that my options for potential partners are becoming far more slim.

I in no way want this to make me look like one of those ridiculous incel guys because I see their mindset as disturbing and disgusting, but I'm starting to feel somewhat powerless.  At this point in my life and within the dating game, I'm realizing that I have very little autonomy.  

The single women who are in a desirable position in their lives have a virtually limitless buffet at their disposal, with my competition doing everything they can to throw themselves at their feet.  It just seems as if there will always be a better guy with a better job, more charismatic personality, more money, who is better looking, or is just better than me in any given array of aspects.  The single women with so much power at their disposal can pick and choose from so many better options, which continually reminds me of my lack of worth and lack of options.

Many had suggested for me to see a therapist for a long time and I have for some time now, which has helped me navigate many things and have helped my despair from getting worse.  However, even feeling okay about my life otherwise, I'm not getting anywhere otherwise.  Meanwhile I'm in my house alone with my cat without anything else to really look forward to.

I'm really starting to feel so powerless and depressed over it lately and I am just not sure what to do.  Anyone have any ideas?",22Jun2018,3

53,"Hello everyone.

Longtime lurker here, having a pretty big problem with myself. The thing is, in the last few months I often feel lost, almost as if I had no purpose in life right now. I've spent quite some time on this subreddit, and I do know that the community here is very helpful and friendly - so let me give you a brief summary on my life so far, just so that I could get it out of my system.

I was born in a small town in a certain third-world country, shortly after the USSR has collapsed. My family was quite poor, we had to save money on literally anything, and the city itself was very depressing, with very few good places to work at. On top of that, I also got into a lot of fights at school, my grades were terrible, and I was regularly beaten up at home. All these events gave me a lot of ambition and determination, just to do anything to get away from that hellhole(along with a good amount of self-hate and minor suicidal thoughts). So it was just natural that a year or two before I graduated high school, I decided that I really don't want to spend the rest of my life there, so I moved to a nearby city to enter an university, and change my life for the better.

A few years have passed, and here I am, a few years after graduating from my university. I've spent the last two last years working almost non-stop, for 10-12 hours per day, with no proper vacations, and now I have finally managed to get a very well-paid remote job, with the wage that is more than enough to live as a king(in my home country, at least). But the problem is, I don't feel very happy about it - I almost feel like I have lost so many years working and studying, while the other guys were partying 24/7 and enjoying their carefree life. I also have a feeling that for me, it is just a very unhealthy way to overcompensate for my almost complete lack of personal life, my mediocre appearance and all the personal problems I have. All that hate and resentment that has incubated inside of me for all these years is still there, and it is not going to go away just like that, no matter how much I make or where I live. I do understand that the situation is not that bad, my physical shape is not that bad, and there are a lot of good points about me, but still, it is extremely difficult to admit that sometimes.

So, questions:

1)How do I find myself, and come to peace with myself? I would really like to learn to love myself and become more confident - and while I do have a few things planned in my head, maybe you guys can recommend something. 2)What do you guys can recommend me on a personal development topic? I've been really neglecting most of the books/movies, and wasn't thinking about myself in general, but right now, I would really like to become a better person and change myself, both physically and mentally. My mind is open to nearly anything - so feel free to recommend me anything you like(imagine that you have a younger brother that asks you about interesting stuff). Maybe there was a book that has changed the way you live and think? 3)Is this a topic I should approach a good psychiatrist with? I am a little afraid to open up to someone in real life like that, but I will do it if that can help. 4)And finally - which country would you move to if you had a remote job? I can't leave the country for the next few months due to legal reasons, but I will do so at the very first opportunity. Can you give me an advice on that?

Thank you.",22Jun2018,3

55,My pt has been late ever since we started 4 months ago while I’ve always been 15 min early. I decided to stop taking his BS and today I took a drive around the city before coming to the gym. I’m now 17 min late :) (he’s been late up to half a hour -_-),22Jun2018,1
57,"I had big exams this year, the first state exams I've ever done. It was a big year, I've always hated school so this school year dragged by for me. Because of this, I was upset for quite a bit of the year and I started isolating myself from my family. I've never been one to study hard, due to my lack of interest of any subjects in school and my daydreaming. I've always had desires to be a full time artist when I'm older and find myself drifting off to another land when I'm trying to study. My older sister has always done exceptionally well in school which raises the bar higher for me. Over the year, my parents were extremely disappointed with my test results (they were very bad), and they were only getting worse. I knew I was in the wrong, but I felt no motivation to fix the situation I was in. At this point I was also coming to terms with my sexuality which was hard to do. I started to have sexual feelings towards boys at 13, but it was only at that time (at age 15), that I was actually accepting these feelings. It wasn't fun, and I was crying myself to sleep at least twice a week. Luckily, I have great friends that would make me feel better and would keep me from feeling upset all the time. I would try to disconnect myself from reality as much as I possibly could, so I was living in my own little echo chamber in my mind for a good portion of the year. It was like I was living in a dream for a few months. Not in good way though. Repeating the cycle of school everyday felt like a reoccurring dream. Towards the end of the school year I started waking up out of the dream. That original feeling of sadness mostly went away, but what replaced was a feeling of dullness. Life and everything around me lost it's colour. Things actually started to look desaturated. I sometimes had to remind myself that I was engaging in real life and wasn't in some day dream. I felt like this for a good 2 months until my exams really started to kick off. In a way, I was the happiest I was all year doing my exams as my parents were being very encouraging and it was also something to keep me on my toes. It took two weeks to finish them and I just finished them up on Wednesday. Once I was done them I was really happy as I now have the whole summer ahead of me, but something clicked today. I started having this feeling of hollowness all of a sudden. I was so excited to finish up school as I thought that would be the end of feeling miserable, but since today, I feel like a part of me has left me. I'm not sure if this is the reason why I feel like this, but this seems like the most logical answer. Can any of you guys relate?",22Jun2018,0
58,In certain subs I used to never be downvoted for my views now In those subs it seems I am becoming more and more limited in what I can say before the brigade finds my post.,22Jun2018,1
