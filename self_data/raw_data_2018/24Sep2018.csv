0,"Ok, so June 2017. Doing my Grade 8 graduation field trip to a camp for one week. Night 2 or 3, I was getting ready to go to sleep, when I heard from some of the other 6 people in my dorm room that a spider was somewhere in the room. To make myself clear, I HATE spiders. Like really, I do. So, they had lost the spider, but then someone told me the spider was climbing up the wall right next to my bunk bed (I was on the top bunk). So I was like ""Well crap, I'm now terrified."". A few seconds pass of me staring at the wall as if I was looking for cells through a microscope, and I see it. That ass was huge, must have been 4 cm long at most. I thought it was a little guy, BUT NO, HE WAS HUGE! So, my first instinct was either run away and be more scared, or wham my fist at the wall while I yelled out at the top of my lungs ""СУКА!"" (when the teacher had told us to start being quieter). If you haven't guessed, it was the second one. The spider eventually fell to the ground somewhere. We couldn't stop laughing about that for the next 5 minutes.",24Sep2018,2
1,"I tried to make a joke on /r/slavelabour (in response to someone else's post) but the joke was so bad I got banned. 

To clarify, the OP said he would make an honest and positive review of a product for some $$$, and I said that my products were terrible, so he couldn't make both an honest and positive review (I don't have a business or sell any products)


It was all cleared up with the mods and I was unbanned, but I learned to not make jokes on that sub

2,"After looking at this kavanaugh case, I see what happen if one waits till a man is about to reach incredible power to document sexual assault against him.

So maybe I should do something about the fact that 3 years ago I was assaulted by a co worker and never told anyone. Since that time, I was laid off by the company (though not by this man) and he is still there in a different division. 

His behavior was outright disturbing and I know he has a pattern of behavior in pursuing co workers when drunk. 

So I got laid off and am not even at this company. He didn’t get laid off because he transferred to a different division before my division had lay offs. But maybe I should ask to speak to hr there just to document a complaint? ",24Sep2018,6

7,"Every time I look in a mirror all I can see are the pounds I need to lose. When I eat alone I think bout the numbers on the scale going out of control. When I eat with people around it’s like I feel them counting every bite I take. Thinking of having to eat in a public place or with other people is stressful. I feel like afterwards I have to skip all my other meals or spend hours in the gym to make up for it. None of the people I’ve talked to will help me lose weight. They say it would be unhealthy. Maybe they’re right. I’m 5’6”, 119 lbs. I should be fine with that, but I still won’t look in the mirror. They all say I look fine, but I only feel fine if I’m hungry. So I’m sitting at the kitchen table hungry because I skipped dinner again and I’m starting to hate it. ",24Sep2018,1
9,"I used to be a writer. I used to write day in and out while in school. I preferred that over listening to the lectures or reading my books; because I was stressed out. By what?

By grades, by my home life, my social life, my personal life, by my anxiety, by my depression, by the heavy, heavy loss of a very close family member. I'd rather just tune it all out and write about my imaginary woes on paper,where it seemed at least there I had control. I had catharsis.

It was like a weight lifted off my shoulder every time, being able to take how I was feeling, what I was dealing with -- those inner demons -- and put them to rest.

I never edited what I wrote, at least, not seriously. Never had the courage? The care or whim? To publish them. They were short. They were personal, personal enough for me that I remember when I wrote them, what I listened to when I do, where I was when I wrote them, the long hours of writing them... That I didn't think anyone would get it. They never did.

My depression got worse. Instead of being able to write and wrestle with what I dealt with, I became numb. I just felt this haze over my brain that was suffocating. It was as though I couldn't focus on anything else but it.

And so, my writing slowly stopped. I journaled, but, I receded from that too, as I didn't want the world to have a raw look at my own troubles.

I always described what I felt as a ghost. I had no reason to feel so heavy, so why did I? Why was I feeling like there was something lingering in my space that made me feel so awful? It was like I struggled with lucidity. Feeling mentally clear one moment and the next I'm stupid with depression.

My last, best writing, I wrote for a friend. I was drinking, and crying, and I was so torn up after everything we've been through. I was scared for them. For myself. I had been there for them, wanted to be there for them. So I wrote. And it was the last thing I felt proud of writing because it didn't feel forced or pressured, and to me, it said everything I wanted to say without ever having said it.

But now... I'm alone. I've reached out to close friends, I've tried making calls. I've had to shut out some close friends because it was healthier for me. I didn't have thst many to begin with, so it hurts that much more.

I'm alone. I don't even have my words to console me now. I feel as though I'm a pitiful mess between blabbering that I'm sorry for being a mess, and letting my anxiety tear my neurons from their sheath. I'm not quite there yet, but I'm at the edge of the metaphorical cliff of an anxiety attack with no one to talk me down.


Sorry. This got heavy. It felt good for a while until I remembered I was alone.
It also got longer than anticipated. Sorry, for that, too.

But, thanks for reading, if you do. ",24Sep2018,13

14,"Martin and Daisy were close friends in high school.

Although he's a geek, Daisy did always think Martin had a cute bubble butt &amp; was attracted to the nerd. Though they went to separate colleges &amp; grew apart, years later during the summer when both are 22, Daisy spots her friend Martin at the beach.

They start up a conversation. Perfectly normal except---Daisy is in a shoulders to toe wetsuit, while Martin is butt-naked!

She was so surprised to see him from behind. ""Is it...could it be?"" But then he nervously looked both ways, and it was unmistakably Martin.

Martin in the NUDE.

And wow, a surprisingly cute, ROUND lily-white butt on that geek!

Starting a conversation with him was for her own curiosity, but also she just couldn't help this devilish bit of fun.

Daisy knew Martin was shy in high school &amp; that he is clearly embarrassed at this. She also happened to hear recent gossip from her girlfriends that Martin was actually still a virgin. It's obviously his first time at a clothing-optional beach.

She did always think he had a surprisingly cute, round butt, and there it is, exposed in the flesh for the world to see!

His friends told him to try it out NUDE by himself to get out of his shell because who would know him at a beach 50 miles away?

Martin tries to play it cool, hands at his sides, but he's blushing red, his bare feet burning on the hot sand as he shifts subtly from foot to foot. Daisy thinks it's cute, but is still a bit sore at Martin for turning her down for the prom back in high school to ask out the cheerleader he had a crush on (she said no). She heard he's still a virgin.

As Daisy:

How old are you? Are you a geek, or outgoing?

What is your reaction at spotting Martin from behind in this situation &amp; what are you thinking? How do you get his attention from behind?

Does he look vulnerable? Why?

Does his status as a 22 year old virgin make you giggle that he's on this beach nude? Why?

What is something funny you can say in conversation as you take a subtle but noticeable look down?

As Martin turns his bare buns to leave, you say ""Hey Martin, one last thing..."" &amp; say or do WHAT to make him REALLY blush red &amp; run down the beach for his towel?

Thanks!!",24Sep2018,0
15,"So first, I made a throwaway because my username is the same thing I use for everything else, and second, I wasn't sure what sub to post this in so I'm posting here. If there's a better place i can put this, I will absolutely do that. Also, I really value honesty and unbiased accounts of things so I'm going to do my best to tell everything as it happened.


I'm a junior in college. I started dating a girl a month into my freshman year and she was the first real relationship I've ever had. We dated for about 2 years before she, quite unexpectedly, broke up with me. After a post-mortem months after she ended it, I realized that she treated me terribly a lot of the time. I can't remember anything specific because my memory is hot dog shit, but she basically wanted me at her beck and call 24/7, then would say I was suffocating her because I was always with her; shit like this all day, everyday. I didn't mind doing things with and for her, I loved being with her and I just enjoy doing things for other people. The way she broke up with me was especially harsh. I was starting to be more confident and going to the gym more. We were hanging out one night and it was a great night full of laughter and love. The next day, she's gone radio silent. I attempt to make conversation and she asks me to come over. Completely out of the blue, she dumps me. No prior warning signs or fight. Just fucking over. I'm still fucked up from this relationship, as you'll see in a bit. 


After awhile of being apart, we try to fix things and be friends because the only friends I really had were all friends we shared. We had our ups and downs with each other but, for the most part, we were civil and sometimes flirty (much to my confusion). Then she moved into her new apartment with our friends and had a housewarming party. Everyone came over and we drank and made merry all night (or til like 2 am. Who's counting?). Now, I had only had alcohol once before and I was fine. This night was a bit heavier than my previous experience. Everyone who didn't drink drove the other people home. Eventually it was just me and her in the apartment (I was supposed to take her to church early the next morning). We were both pretty drunk but my fatherly instincts kicked in and I started making sure she was ready for bed. Once I was satisfied that she was fine, I went to the living room and laid down on the couch. She called for me to ask if I still was ok driving her to church tomorrow. I gave the affirmative to which she replied that it was too hot. She proceeds to take off her shirt (with no bra on) while I was still standing right next to her. For some reason, my brain decided to ask if she wanted a cuddle buddy (ugh my drunk brain is fucking cheesy). She said yes so I hopped in bed. Eventually, we just started having sex. After a bit, she decides we shouldn't be doing this and tells me to go. I don't continue, I go back to the couch because I'm still too drunk to drive. I left the next morning and didn't take her to church.


A couple days later, we sit down to talk and agree to forget it happened and we don't tell anyone. Another couple days later, we get into a fight (because I was, admittedly, being immature) where she insinuates that I sexually assaulted her. I counter and say it was consensual because i asked her to call me daddy and she did willingly (pls don't kink shame me, daddy). But I said it meekly because I'm a bitch when it comes to arguments (thanks mom and dad) and my point doesn't have the same sting as it would if a competent person said it. We haven't had talked since. 


I spent my summer living alone, working on making up hours at school, looking for a job, and trying not to think about her. I had little interaction outside the person at the gym that swipes my card. All in all, I loved this past summer. It gave me plenty of time to ""find myself"" and all that bs. Then, I had to move into my new apartment... directly across from my ex and our friends. It sucked for awhile but then I just stopped caring. I started using tinder and eventually bumble too (I can't follow rule 1 or 2 so I don't get many matches. I did match with a few and I hit it off with one girl I've been kinda sorta seeing. 


(I promise all this set up is going somewhere. If you're still reading this, you're my favorite &lt;3)


My 3 current problems reside with (all names changed):
- Maria (my ex)
- Karen (the current girl)
- Bianca (one of my friends


Maria (my ex)- She and a few of my friends showed up to my place of work the other day. I saw them before they saw me and texted Bianca to please not come to my section. She didn't see the text until too late, but it wasn't a huge deal. Nothing really happened other than some really weird flirting-type shit. But seeing your ex isn't the most calming event so I was still freaked out afterward. I worked overtime (with permission, thanks manager) to try and stave off the thoughts I knew were coming. I miss her all the time now. I know how she treated me and I don't want to do that again. However, I can't help but hope she comes over to talk about us. It won't ever happen and I know that, but the hope remains. 


Karen (the current girl)- So she's a really good person that I like quite a bit. Text conversations can get a bit dry sometimes but otherwise its fine. She's a freshman and a few years younger than me but that was a problem, initially. I realized that she may be making the same mistake I was by jumping into a relationship at the first chance and missing out on other college experiences. Also, what if I'm trying to force a connection to make myself fell better? Or to prove (to myself or Maria) that I can be in a relationship? What if I continue with her and end up fucking her life for my own self-servicing needs? It may not even work out with her but I think this applies to any other girl I decide to try and date. 


Bianca (one of my friends)- Admittedly, I kind of used her as my personal talking dump. I have this weird need to have my thoughts and feelings be heard no matter who hears them. I would talk about shit from my own very important opinions on cheesecake to other serious shit like everything above. Without warning, she blocked me on snapchat and won't answer any of my actual texts asking why. I haven't attacked or accused her, just want to know what the fuck is going on. This is a somewhat common theme. I feel like i have maybe 3 actual friends left because I keep driving them away. And I'm too antisocial to make new friends, no matter how hard I try. 


I feel unwanted and unloved constantly and I'm not sure what to do or where to go. I unintentionally drove for an hour to a neighboring college town today because I was lost in thought. I'm not suicidal or anything so please don't worry about me in that aspect. My roommate isn't any help and is constantly a dick to me for no real reason. I want a dog but can't afford it. I can barely afford rent. 

This ended up being a really long rant and now I'm not sure where to go with it. I'm lost in my own brain and probably won't get out anytime soon. I trapped in a whirlpool where I can't figure out whats anxiety and what is an actual problem. I've heard people say that your early 20s are some of the most anxiety-filled of your life and I really hope that's what I'm going through. 


Sorry for the long post.

16,"A girl who I've known for a long time invited me to her place on Friday night to catch up as we haven't seen each other in years and she recently broke things off with her abusive fiancé, just over a month ago. We spent a lot of time just talking and drinking tea and listening to music and had a great time. We went for a nice evening walk and she kept saying how she was just so ready to be in a relationship with someone that really cared for her and saying she wanted to see me again and hang out with me. We had previously taken a dancing class together many years ago and she talked about how she never forgot how much fun we had that day and I mentioned we should do it again and she got really excited when I mentioned I cooked and that I wanted to make dinner for her sometime. 


I wasn't going to try anything but we were watching a movie and she was being really touchy so I ended up kissing her while we both got up to adjust something on the TV. We kissed a bunch, it was really passionate and made my chest flutter and just felt so good, then we cuddled and I didn't press anything too much further because she's a bit more sexually conservative than me, which I'm totally fine with. We ended up cuddling and talking until a bit after the movie was over and it was just so amazing. It was like 1:30am by the time I had to leave, I texted her the next day briefly and we were joking around a bit but we didn't talk too much because she was at a friend's wedding. Since then she's reading my texts and not replying but posting Instagram stories and it's so unusual. I asked her if something was going on and she hasn't replied to that either. I'm not sure if I completely misread the situation or what but it seems like every time I try to start something that's not just a friends-with-benefits situation things just get weird like this. I'm worried I'll only ever be the kind of guy that girls want to see for one night and that's it. Maybe I'm in the wrong. Maybe I shouldn't have kissed her because it was too fast or gave her the wrong impression that I just wanted sex or something or she just wanted to be friends? 


I spent tonight at the gym and had a great workout because I was feeling bummed out all day. I don't want this to affect me in the long term because I started this year off in a hefty depression and don't want to go back to it. No drinking, no weed. I'm just going to meditate for a while on this I suppose. If she never talks to me again I know I'll be upset though.

I’m feeling pretty anxious not sure why tho. 

So, a few hours ago I was watching Netflix. I heard someone outside (my door was closed) I figured it was my dad going to the bathroom so, I went outside to get water expecting dad to be in the bathroom and there was no one.. when I saw there was no one outside I thought it was still my dad (I was still hearing noises like someone hiding in the kitchen) bc at times... when he thinks everyone is asleep he goes to the bathroom naked... ya he’s weird don’t ask lmao but yeah I thought he was naked so he was trying to hide from me. The water is in the kitchen of course so I went there and as I was walking to the kitchen I was still hearing those voices until I stepped in. I looked around the kitchen and dude I swear it was calm af. There was no one there.. 

Okay so at this point I’m starting to feel a little “off” my parent never lock the glass door in the kitchen so I thought.. maybe.. someone had gotten in. I go and look outside (through the glass door) I turn on the light and nope no one there.. 

My ears so this thing where they flare out a little (barely noticeable unless you’re looking for it) whenever I subconsciously feel uneasy and my ears were doing that shit.. 

I just turned off the lights and walked to my room. Continued to watch Netflix. 

Initially, when I went outside one of the hallway cupboards was opened and the living room light was on. I’m sure I was the last one out there but I’m not sure if I left the light on. I’m usually pretty good about turning off the lights but.... I’m positive I didn’t leave the cupboard door opened tho. 

Wouldn’t say I was scared but by the time I was walking back to my room I definitely felt uneasy. ",24Sep2018,4

20,"Stop running. 

Stop blaming it on being alone. 

You’ll have so much love you won’t know what to do with it. So much love that it will tear you up inside trying to decide which way to go. 

You’ll be everything he ever wanted, everything *he* ever wanted.

And they will both know about what you do to yourself despite their constant reassurances. But they will love you anyway. 

And you will still be bulimic.

You’ll still feel alone in crowded rooms. 
You’ll still feel like you’re not enough, never enough, it’s all your fault, it’s always your fault

The gaping hole inside you can’t be filled with the validation of another. It’s like an hourglass. One side fills up, then it flips. The other side slowly fills. Flip.

You can only give yourself the gift of freedom. I wish you already knew how to love yourself the same way you love them...there’s no holding anger, there’s no harboring of resentments for past failures or wrongs. Sometimes you’re still selfish with the love you show them, so maybe you had to learn it backwards. 

You have to learn that if loving them means wanting whats best for them even when it hurts, even when it might feel wrong, then loving yourself has to mean the same. The hard thing is facing the pain head on; its welcoming it so you can move forward. 

And it will hurt for awhile, it will feel wrong for awhile. But it’s best, and it’s right, and it’s true love because it’s those two things first.

22,"We've been on/off in a weird fucked up emotionally back and forth way for a while... 2 and a half years? Idk. Time is weird. Kinda long distance physically. Extremely long distance emotionally. It was kinda fun and then kinda sad and then fun again then just kind of... Neutral, I guess? 

At some point I got kind of fed up with the whole thing and decided to stop going out of my way to see him. When I did finally see him, it was because I'd caved, and carved out time to drive the 160 miles round trip. I found myself distracted and anxious to leave within an hour, when every other time we'd lose track hours just talking and being close. I broke things off a week or so after that.

First few days were hard. It got easier. It was still getting easier. He sent me a package. His name was on the return address so I knew it was from him. I threw it in my car and texted that he could have given me a heads up first. He said he didn't know what to do so he opted just to send it and not say anything, but thay he included memes (yes we are adults I promise). I didn't know what was in it. I let it sit for a while. I don't know how long it's been. A week? Two? Time is weird, like I said. It lived in my car and I just lived around it.

I sent him a meme on Saturday. I didn't even realize I hadn't messaged him since Tuesday. It's always a meme, he'll laugh, we both resist the urge to check in on each other. But I went days without sending anything. Cool. It does get easier! Still, I sent him a couple more on Sunday. Then i deleted him from my address book and deleted the text thread. It felt good. Right as I did that I got a sweet message from a man I really like and I know he wants to be more than friends when I'm ready (spoiler: I'm not ready). Cool. Life is alright, shit moves on, I'll move on. 

I go to the store. It's 2am. I'm bored, can't sleep, figure errands are better than drinking on a work night. So I do that and load my groceries. I have to move the package so I toss it into the front seat. I drive home and I figure I shouldn't avoid it any longer. I had no idea what I thought it was. Maybe the photo strip we took on our first real date? Or I think I left a shirt there? It had some heft to it, maybe a book? Surely he wouldn't be so fucking dense as to...

Yep. He was. The sex toys we used and a used bottle of lube. Included was some printed irrelevant normie memes. And a note that was so fucking bland that it wasnt even addressed to me or signed at all, that read like the entirety of our relationship ""Idk what to do despite you telling me what to do prior to this, and it isn't my choice to make but I'm gonna make it anyway despite you expressing your desire for me to do the opposite of what I'm doing but anyway here's a meme"". 

Honestly it would have been less of a total kick in the face to just get the items without the note/memes. Or just an envelope with a note that said ""lol u got nae nae'd"" because obviously I did, over the course of 2.5 years. Cool.",24Sep2018,1

For context, there is a band that me and my friend are both a fan of, called Cigarettes After Sex. About a month ago, we had a pretty long conversation about the band, but I'm not sure her brother was apart of it. My coworker introduced me to this band.

When I ran into them, I talked with their father for a while, just getting to know him based on things they had told me about him. It was pretty pleasant. After a bit, I mentioned I was on my way to work and started telling a story about my coworker that introduced me to the band.

In order to kind of connect my friends who I was referring to, I brought up the band. Except I did it in the worst way possible.

 I spent the last year fighting to get my grades up so I could enter college I wanted, I did great and here I am ! My parents are happy with me for the first time in years, that’s a great isn’t it !?

In the beginning of the year I was really money focused, I wanted to be one of those young millionaires you see on the internet, driving their Lamborghinis in Cali, unfortunately my business failed after a good start. No problem, it happens!

Trying to make money is emotionless, so after my business failed in the beginning of the summer I started investing on spending time with my friends. It was a great, we would all just chill, watch Tarantino movies, smoke weed... it was a fucking good summer.

Im realizing for the first time that life is all about being with other humans and having meaning full relationships, and of course, enjoying our selves.
Yesterday it was a clear night in my city and coming home late I realized that we are so fucking small in the universe, I was looking at the moon and at the stars and I was trying to understand, why does college matters so much in our lives, why is money the ultimate goal, why will I need to give 100% in college so I can get a good job where I will have no time to enjoy myself?!? 

Im also kind of shy, but I have good looks, I would have no problem getting girls, but for some reason I just spend money on luxury escorts and have robotic emotionless sex. I’m going on my first date in years next Friday, sex is not what’s on the table, I just want to go eat with another female human being, know about her, talk about movies, music and deep philosophical shit and then go for a long drive with no particular destiny. I just want to have an experience ya know.. 
 
Life is just too short to hang with fake people and stay at home, and we are too small to care so much about everything else besides the experiences we have.
We all need good relationships, good sex and good times... college and all that is just acting, it’s important, but life is not about that.

I know I was supposed to ask for advice, sorry, but I ended up ranting about life. I think I gave myself advice by writing this, so if I can help some young heads that’s good enough for me.

31,"Happiness is such a weird construct, isn't it? For most of us, it's taught to us from a very young age on how we need to behave as a person to achieve happiness. Religion plays a big part for some of us. Religion tries to tell us a set of rules to follow. If the rules are successfully followed, happiness and blessings await and non-compliance would be mean, eternal sadness. 

It sounds fairly simple to a young mind, and it did to mine. I love order and organisation and couldn't wait to feel happy. 

But then as I grew up and saw the world around me and the how people behaved amongst each other, it didn't make sense to me. Why so many different lifestyles if there was an easy way to be happy? And I grew frustrated as happiness eluded me. I saw suffering, suicides, terminal diseases, broken hearts and civil wars. 

I left home for to search for a home and landed in Dubai and found different opinions about happiness from almost everyone. 

Happiness was just one more drink away, one better phone away, one Europe trip away, one night out getting wasted away, one kickass job away, one promotion away, one new car away, one better home away, one HD TV away, one more expensive bottle of water away, one expensive and overrated cup of coffee away. I kept reaching all these 'goals' and still felt so empty. I would go in malls and see people laughing and smiling and would feel envious. I would want to go up to them and ask them their secrets. How did they achieve this and what am I missing? How did they manage to switch of their brain and keep out all the sadness? Are they abnormal or am I? 

Sitting in a coffee shop right now having the worst cup of coffee I have had in ages but hey at least it's something? Everybody so caught up with their stories that this almost feels like a simulation. 

Is it possible that someone of us don't belong here? They kept telling me that people who commit suicide are cowards but what if they realised that this wasn't for them. They saw everything the world had to offer and decided that it's not what they wanted.

So she bought a studio light while out in america for her youtube channel and brought it back to the UK.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to give it a go for my channel and asked her several times to use it and she said no. (that bit is her version but I don't remember asking more than once)

Anyway I plugged it in and it blew as she hadn't warned me or made me aware that this could be a possibility due to the fuse. Something that being in the US for a year and taking UK electrical goods/using US goods I thought she would have been knowledgable of after the fact. Of course as soon as it blew I knew straight away it would've been because of the fuse issue.

Anyway fast forward to the current disagreement.

She feels that I should pay her back every cent ($90/£68) because I broke it however I felt that's a little unreasonable as she gave the final say for me to use it with the knowledge and past experience being in the US that at least there was even the smallest possibility it would blow.

Me on the other hand I'm not completely denying all responsibility (even though deep down inside I feel if I don't instruct someone the proper way to use my equipment and they break it because of lack of information, isn't that on me?) I am open to giving her HALF of the cost.

50,"It is actually the most irritating, frustrating, and emotionally draining fucking thing.


The last time I orgasmed during sex was 4 years ago.  It was as I was weaning myself off of anti-depressants (completely off of any and all prescribed medicines now!).  I know SSRIs typically cause that problem, but since I've been off of them for years, I don't know why I can't manage.


It really ruins the sexual part of my relationships because my partner feels like they are not satisfying me, but that's not true.  I am usually feeling a lot of pleasure, and it feels like I can orgasm, but it just doesn't happen - ever.  Even if I try to finish myself.  I don't watch much porn or masturbate much (even when I masturbate it takes longer than I'd like it to - and it's not always guaranteed that I'll cum).


I've tried a lot of shit to make it more likely that I'll cum.  I've not managed.  I've tried being high, I've tried being sober, I've tried being drunk, I've tried it with long-term partners and short-term hookups; it just doesn't work even though a lot of the times it feels amazing.  


It's really disheartening that I can't experience the climax of pleasure during sex like my partners do.  Sex feels like a chore.  I hate watching my partners work to get me off like I got them off and them slowly recognizing that I'm not going to cum.  It makes them feel undesirable or like they aren't good enough.

51,"I work as a barista, and have for 6 months. For some people it’s the worst job ever, an entry level position because they couldn’t do any better, too stressful, etc etc. But so far it’s been a dream job for me. I’ve never had a food service job that I actually *enjoyed* before this one. There are a million reasons I love this job: the regulars, the free coffee, the hours, the benefits, my coworkers, literally everything. 

My first day of work I was paired with another barista, let’s call her K. I shadowed K for about a week before I was allowed to be a “real barista”, even though K wasn’t a manager of any sort. K had worked there 6 months longer than I had, and worked long and hard hours, 35-40 hours per week. She’s very smart and definitely helped me learn a lot. 

K and I also became really good friends. *Really* really good friends. We went to each other’s houses all the time, I gave her rides home, we went on doubles dates and hikes...All the time she complained about how she does all the work of a manager without the pay, how she’s excited that x shift manager will be leaving soon so she can take x’s place, blah blah. But for some reason she still wasn’t getting promoted, no matter how much she asked for it. 

A few days ago, on my day off, my store manager called me. This was bizarre, as he’s usually pretty hands-off and doesn’t want to bother us on our days off. He basically told me: fuck it, I want to promote you. He spent the whole call inflating my ego past repair, calling me smart, reliable, good with customers, you get the picture. He told me he’s wanted to promote me *since he hired me* because he saw such “incredible leadership qualities” in me. 

I’m incredibly flattered. But this meant that there was an open spot for a shift supervisor, and that it was being filled by me, and not K. And I can kind of see why. K is nice but passive aggressive, she’s good at explaining but not at leading, she’s smart but forgetful, she’s reliable but doesn’t have a car so she has to rely on the bus (or me and my car). 

At the same time, I have a very strong case of imposter syndrome coming on. I know I’ve worked hard for this, and I do love my job, but there are at least 3 other baristas who have worked here longer than me who will now be under me. Baristas who I still have to ask questions because I’m unsure of this thing or the other. 

This morning, I came in to a note from the store manager saying that one K came in, I would be in the back room doing manager training on the computer. The thing is, *I haven’t told K about the promotion yet*. This means that I would have to look K right in the eye while *another manager* told her that she would be taking my place today, while I sat in an office chair and watched training videos. 

We didn’t do much more than exchange a glance before I slipped away, but it was enough to make me feel guilty and sad that she was hearing this from someone other than me. I’m scared that she and the other baristas won’t respect me as a leader and/or will complain to the SM (or worse, to each other) about not being promoted ahead of me. 

I know a lot of this is just my paranoia. But all I want is the respect of my peers *and* the job I love. ",24Sep2018,20

Never treated me mean (and if she did, she profusely apologized), comforted me and supported me when I needed it, and was someone who I felt enjoyed my company a lot when we hung out. She is awkward (like me) and I accepted that but she did things that made me very frustrated and upset a lot. Started small in our text conversations -- like when she was not in the mood, she wouldn't respond at all. This continued during last school year sometimes but never became a super major topic of discussion. 

Then came just last month. Straight off of a really fun hangout, had a heart-to-heart (which I feel was the case but she said I said nothing to upset her), and then after a few weeks, she just left.

Talked with her brother and in the beginning, he said that she was just stressed and told me her living conditions, because her loan got denied for her school and she had to stay with her grandma. Maybe she was embarrassed by that? But don't know why she is still ignoring me. Time goes on and he says that she seems to be doing better, but still ignoring my texts and calls. He asked her if I had did anything to upset or annoy her or anything and she said no and even assured him the opposite. But still ignoring me, it's going on a month and a half.

Something I learned: True friends would at least give you the comfort to text you that they are not feeling good enough to talk if you are worried about them. Despite awkwardness or anything. True friends wouldn't blatantly ignore you when they are not in the mood it dealing with life stuff (without giving you a heads-up first).",24Sep2018,1
55,"I graduated high school several years ago and I’m in college now, but today I heard that a boy at my old high school brought a gun to school and shot himself. I come from a very small rural town where things like this don’t happen often. However, I have seen first hand the clique-y nature of the school and how cruel people can be. Now I don’t know for a fact that this kid was bullied, but I have my suspicions. Even if he wasn’t, the attitudes of the kids from affluent families can definitely make people feel like outsiders. I’m so thankful this kid decided not to end anyone else’s life before he took his own (I have 4 family members at that school), but the thought of what must have been going through his mind makes me well up with tears. I don’t know all the details, but I imagine some kids saw it happen or saw the body or heard the gunshot, and I can’t even imagine how traumatizing that must be. 

I know the counselor at this school; she was once a family friend, and I shit you not, just a few months ago I heard her talking HORRIBLE things about some middle school girls. Calling them whores, talking about the way they dress and act, and the pictures they post online (I can only imagine what she says about the ones in high school). In fact, the reason she is no longer a family friend is because we found out she told every piece of information we ever told her in confidence. I don’t know if this kid ever talked to her or not, and I’m not blaming her in any way, but just the thought of this woman being the only resource these troubled kids have to go to makes me sick to my core. 

I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post, I just needed somewhere to vent. I’m feeling so sad for these kids and everyone involved and I just wish there was something I could do. I want to be able to be there for everyone. I want to talk with everyone who is struggling and I want to be a friend to them. I don’t want anyone to ever have to go through this, and I just feel so incredibly helpless. With that being said, if anyone sees this post and is struggling with anything at all, please message me because I would love to talk with you. I don’t have all the answers, but I care so much about every single being, and if there is any way I could make someone feel better or just not feel so alone in the world I would love to do it. 

Again, I’m sorry for the ramble everybody. I just want to make a difference some how. If anybody has any suggestions for what the school could do to deal with this problem (both gun and mental health), I am 100% open to hearing your ideas! My family is highly involved in the community and could maybe bring some things up at city council or board of education meetings. 

Just to reiterate, if anyone here would like to talk I encourage you to private message me! And I’m sure it’s been posted before, but here is the [National Suicide Prevention Lifeline](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org) if you or someone you know may need it and a phone number below.

A few things have happened since we have gotten engaged that has made me just want to not do anything for the rest of this year. 

To keep it short, our dog required a surgery on her leg that was needed before the wedding since she’s going to be our flower girl. A month after her surgery, my fiancé got into a car accident and the car was totaled. The car was t-boned, he spun out and slammed against a wall.  I am so thankful that he only has a couple herniated discs and pieces of cartilage broken - he’s functional. I got a new car and gave him my other. 

And then for wedding drama, my father is not coming to my wedding because he apparently can’t get over how awful of a child I was. My brother and sister in law were upset my nephew wasn’t ring bearer. He is now and so help me if he is in a bad mood (reason why my fiancé and I have not wanted him to be - he’s been having extreme mood swings). One of my friends was upset she was not a bridesmaid so now she is. My MOH hasn’t wanted to do shit and my fiancé has been the best MOH ever. She’s not even giving a speech. Thanks, cousin! It helps that he absolutely wants to be involved so I haven’t been doing all the planning on my own. And one of the other bridesmaids needs me to talk to her family about some internal drama because apparently that bridesmaid just can’t deal with it anymore because she has so much to deal with as it is. 

I’m just fucking done. This is not fun. I want to be happy with this but it’s just become such a burden. And on top of all this, I have been dealing with depression. It’s been feeling like this is not my life. It’s been really bad this past month where I randomly start crying. Even my fiancé’s hugs don’t help anymore - it feels like I’m not even there for them.

I can't change the world, for sure - even changing myself is nearly impossible or at least proceeds at a glacial pace. I'm not an adult. I'm barely a child.

And I feel so guilty for refusing my big brother's desire to take me out for my first alcoholic beverage, because apparently he's been looking forward to that for a long time. But as many horrible things as I may be, I am not a drunk and I do not want to take one sip of alcohol if I can avoid it. Same way I'm not planning on having sex with anyone anytime soon (both, of course, are due to long-standing guilt complexes and obsession with purity that I can't even justify as coming from any religion). I take perverse comfort in the fact that though I can't make myself do things I need to do, I can yet at least prevent myself from doing useless or potentially harmful things just because they're ""fun"". What is fun anyway, but yet another way of wasting time besides all the others I spend my life in?

Like studying math. I've spent the last month studying all sorts of branches of mathematics. Why? Not because it's likely to be useful. I'm interested in pure math, not the applied stuff. No, I study it for the same reason that I study linguistics, that I make art, or music, or poetry, or do any of the other random bullshit I do - to occupy my mind with something so that I won't remember how worthless I am and how incapable I am of being a real adult human and how I'll never amount to anything and how the entire fucking world is going down the drain and everyone is just calling each other names instead of trying to fix it because the rest of humanity is *even worse than I am in terms of being utter losers*.

Oh and let's not forget the fact that during my entire teenage years I never once had a normal teenaged experience. Mostly my own fault of course for not seeking it out, due to fear and social anxiety. I was homeschooled, you see, my whole life. As a result, in one of the few positive things I can say about myself, I am highly intelligent. Not as if it's useful. I can understand higher math but I can't do anything to improve my own life. Point is, I don't regret being homeschooled. And I probably wouldn't have enjoyed the company of pathetic teenaged Southern dipshits anyway, even if I had gone to public school. But is that really true, or is it just sour grapes? What have I missed not being a real teenager? How can I ever know what it is like to be young? I will never know. I have never been young. I have gone straight from the blurry haze of childhood to the cynicism of pretend-adulthood with nothing in between.

To be honest, I don't know what it means to be *alive*, not just to be young. But who am I blaming? Who am I railing against? Why do I complain? I'm only complaining about the ways I have treated myself, ultimately. No one can help me because I am in a prison of my own making and I suppose I have not likely ever even had the key.

I got to a local meditation center every week. There are many nice people who see themselves as my friends, and I always use that word to describe them. I have various online ""friends"" too. And I always feel ""happy"" when I'm around those people at the meditation center. But what the hell is happiness other than a bunch of chemicals? I can't honestly say I love or care about any of the people I call my ""friends"" or ""family."" How can I? I don't know how to care about myself. All I see when I look in the mirror is a failure, a disappointment, an inadequate approximation of the impossible person I have always been meant to be and will never be. That's been true for as long as I can remember having self awareness. Naturally, I objectify everyone else as much as I objectify myself. I'm honestly not sure that I know what it means for someone to be a ""person"", rather than just a talking object.

Honestly, I don't know where I'm going with this. I just feel like shit and decided to vent.

59,"I've always been a night owl. My brain just doesn't turn on until after 9am and I feel I have the most energy after 5pm. Mornings basically have sucked for me my entire life. It doesn't matter if I get 12 hours of sleep or 8 or 3, i'm just as tired either way. I finally went to a sleep clinic (referred by my doctor when they coudln't find anything wrong with me) as I feel like I'm always more tired than everyone else despite having a decent sleep schedule (I average about 8 hours a night and don't often wake up much). The sleep clinic put me on a very strict schedule. bed by 10pm and up by 6am (for work) but didn't allow any sleep in days. For the last 8 months I stuck pretty strict to a 10pm bed time (give or take an hour or two and up by 6am every morning with no sleep in days. It never got easier to do but I continued as I just really want mornings to be more productive for me. My doctors and sleep clinic thought i was ""fixed"" as I've been on the schedule for so long know they assumed my body would just wake up early. Well, Sunday I had forgotten to set my alarm as I had nothing to really do before noon. I went to bed at 10:30pm Saturday night and guess what? I didn't wake up until 11:30am! WTF body ... Now my doctors are talking about having to reset everything and all my hard work gone due to one mistake! I just want 6am to not suck so bad. ",24Sep2018,1

No one knows that deep down inside I’m hurting emotionally.  I don’t like the way my life is going and it feels as though life is stacked against me.    
I’m trying to get a better job as I know my coworker gets preferential treatment in the workplace.   I can give 100% and get passed over everything.   Mocks me for having a degree while he gets by with probably more money an opportunities.   I need to get out.

I don’t have a feeling of belonging to my group of friends.    I’ve known them since high school and they’re all white.   I have nothing against them but I feel as though I’m an outsider.   I feel as though I can’t relate to them and there are times they rarely sneak in some racial remarks of other races.   I don’t feel comfortable because what do they say around my back?   I need to belong but I don’t know how or where to start.  I need new friends. 

For the life of me I’ve been going on tinder, bumble, CMB, Hinge and can’t find a date almost a year.  I’ve never been in a real physical relationship but only online.   I can offer so much to whoever she might be but will never get a chance at this current rate.  I feel cursed.

64,"It seems like a lot of people find me weird, just today a very ungratifying event happened. I was speaking to my friends in discord. Then this one guy comes in, let's call him Tom. Without providing any context, he just straight up says ""Oh, it's that weird, dumb, guy. I'm gonna mute him."" He doesn't mute me, but I've met Tom, one time before during the last summerbrake, where me and some my friends played basket with his group, out on a school yard, I saw a cat, I picked it up and played with it a little, carried it around for a bit, and put it down gentely. Tom just says ""It might have rabies"" and I say ""That chances of that happening are minimal."" He just blushes and goes on with his day, we've spoken a few times, not really have been in a conversation, but still he calls me weird. I've been called weird by other people too, but it was a few years back, it was only because I added these two girls from my friends class on snapchat. 

There have been a few occurrences in recent time too, just a few guys I've never heard of, come in on discord, their first reactions are the same ""It's that weird guy."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I really didn't care until I thought about it today, why do people call me weird? I'm not a very energetic and mean person, people say that I'm charismatic, which I don't know anything about but either way, a lot of people have called me ""nice"" and ""funny"" too, I just don't know why people would think I\*m weird in a sense.

Why would people call me weird? Can it be that they're judgemental in nature, or just base their opinions on first encounters??

We haven't had sex yet because we both live with our parents still and have busy schedules. So here's the thing, she has me completely caught off guard and love struck. I was not expecting things to go this well when I first matched with her on tinder. She expressed the same feelings as well. I have strong feelings for her, but I don't know if its love? I enjoying hanging out with her, I think about her a lot and she told me she feels the same. She said she wasn't looking for anything too serious in the beginning, but after getting to know her, she is very shy/introverted and has little dating experience.

70,"Hi friends, I’ll be 21 this week and this year will be the first time I’m spending my birthday by myself. I’m away for university so I celebrated with family on the weekend. My birthday falls on a weekday so I have classes. My best friend has a bunch of classes too so she offered to go out with me the next day instead. That means on my actual birthday I’ll be eating dinner alone...which makes me kind of sad. I could force myself to hang out with my housemates but they’re kind of toxic people, so I’d probably be better off being by myself. I’ve also been feeling down lately so I don’t feel like socializing with them. They offered to have a mini celebration sometime this weekend but who knows ??? Everyone is busy (including myself) and I’ll probably spend my night doing assignments.

Anyone else spending their birthday alone? What do you plan to do?",24Sep2018,10
71,"I have the tendency to get very interested in things, but I can't ever focus on them long enough to actually take anything out of it.

For example, this morning I was getting rid of old clothes and I found a t-shirt that I wanted to turn into something else. I put on music, thought about what I wanted to do with it, sketched it out, and got my sewing kit out. I got on the laptop to change music and got distracted by something which then led to watching a video on Youtube and my initial task and interest was gone.

Things like this has happened countless times in the past. I got into surfing, bought a surfboard and a wetsuit but only went like 2 times out of the year. I wanted to learn an instrument so I bought a ukulele, but never learned to play. I got into yoga, so I started doing yoga every morning for like 4 days and then stopped. I was interested in embroidery, and I got one as a gift but only made one creation.

Even with things like reading a book - Other than the Harry Potter series, I've never finished a book (other than short stories) from beginning to end. It's hard for me to finish a move as well. Unless I'm at the theatre, I rarely finish a movie on my own.

This seems to be the story of my life. I remember when I was younger I would be interested in various jobs, Veterinarian, Actress, Dancer, Designer, but I never narrowed it down to one. At age 23 I am still unemployed and unsure of what I want to do. I took a programming course for 3 months in which I was very interested in, and did well in, but after it finished I lost the drive.

It is so frustrating because when I am initially interested, I am truly, from the bottom of the heart excited to do more with it. But then it fades away, very quickly, and I can't accomplish anything. Any feedback is appreciated.",24Sep2018,230

I do my best to teach my classmates, even taking some time out of my day to teach them. 

Just last night I had about 6 people message me, and this is a regular thing, asking me help for our homework. I usually slide and help them do it. 

But this one dude had the gull to straight up ask for my answers. Not even just for help, just straight up for the answers. And when I declined but offered to help he sounded really offended and just said goodnight after that. 

That message just completely broke my ego and made me wonder if I should really care about helping them too, or are the exploiting me?

And now everyone just tells me to get over it and they aren’t worth it. I’m sorry but I can’t. I still think about it every day and it hurts even more because I keep seeing stuff about them on social media. I keep blocking people but then someone else posts it. I just can’t escape and at this point it feels like I’m the cause of it all. It feels like the world would be better off without me. If they were better off why not everyone else.

77,"I bought a car and got temp tags. Did everything I was supposed to do and even called to confirm it a few times as the expiration drew closer. Every time I was told I did everything correctly they were just waiting for something from my loan. I leave that business for them to duke out as neither had reached out to me to tell me I had to do something to move it along. I called several times asking for updates. Now they’re going to expire and I still don’t have my permanent plates. I called to get an update and the person I spoke to wouldn’t listen to me and was a huge bitch. I wasn’t even being rude either! I’ve been cordial with everyone I’ve dealt with there but had to hang up on her before I lost my temper. So I wrote a review and singled her out saying she was terrible. 


I dunno I’m feeling a bit guilty now. Not for singling her out cuz fuck her. I have been nothing but patient and reasonable and this is what I get. I don’t know what else to do.

78,"I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't hang around people who did questionable things ever again. It was mainly to protect my goals and aspirations because I know I'm easily influenced by peer pressure. Anyways, after high school, my good friends who always encouraged me to be better and follow my dreams moved away. I was having some trouble making friends until about a week ago.

I met this girl and we clicked immediately. She was so much like myself, and we had a lot of fun talking after class and everything. It seemed too good to be true. 

Anyway, it was. Today she was telling me that she got some new pens, so I thought they were cool and I asked her where she bought them. She said she stole them. I laughed because I thought she was joking, but she wasn't. She also told me she smoked pot (I get that everybody does it in college, but it's something I really don't want to be around. I get that it may not be dangerous, but at the very least, stoner culture is trashy and I don't want to be around it), so it reassured my decision to limit my interactions with her. 

We were going to a concert this weekend, but I cancelled on her because I know I can't trust someone who steals things and doesn't even feel guilty. I feel sad that I lost someone who I had a lot of fun with, but at the same time I feel like I was protecting my future. ",24Sep2018,2

I have kept suicide at bay and accomplished two of my dreams. I have refused to settle for a job that would have kept me comfortable but docile. I have my physical and mental health. I have mindfulness. I am making friends in this new country. I am surviving. And most importantly, I am creating new dreams to accomplish. This is what gives me meaning.
