0,"I'm 24 years old and I'm starting to feel ancient. My knees and back hurt quiet a bit and I have crackly hands. My back has a bulging disc and I just feel bad all the time. Even my digestive system feels old.


I didn't sign up for this shit. Next thing you know, I'll be gray and bald at 25.


I work out a lot and it seems like the stress is just going to my joints instead of growing my muscles.



I remember a highschool teacher (who was also the cross country coach) making fun of his friends for saying they feel old but they we're actually out of shape. I feel like those men did even though I exercise almost everyday.

1,I’m 24 and have a restrictive eating past. I have been to treatment and am recovering now for over a year. But I feel hungry all the time which makes me feel fat and ashamed. I’m 5’5” and I am 110.4 pounds. I feel huge and I’m so scared to keep gaining. I feel stuck. Is this a normal weight? Should I lose a few pounds? ,16Sep2018,1
2,"I’ve recently read an article about some teenagers participating at a debate contest and I’ve just remembered how much I would like to take up public speaking &amp; debate classes. 

This has been a thought of mine since I was in the last Physics class in 12th grade, right before graduation day. My former teacher - who’s an amazing person and became my role model - wanted to just talk to us about anything else than formulas and theories, so she challenged us with an interesting topic. Being known that adaptability is a sign of high intelligence, she asked us whether or not we think that our generation is smarter than our parents’ generation, only from this point of view. 

I liked so much that class and I look back on with great nostalgia, remembering everyone’s excitement and commitment to bring up arguments. 

I want to debate, but when I was a kid, parents used to tell me I’m too stupid for anything - and they eventually convinced me. I would surely make a fool of myself, wasting everyone’s time and I simply don’t deserve to be among smart kids, discussing topics above my pay grade. 

I thought about starting to draw, as I used to love those relaxed moments during art classes, but I feel that there’s so much effort to learn how to draw decently and I’m not that diligent. 

It’s hard to care about your passions when you aren’t encouraged. ",16Sep2018,80
3,"It isn't like i am depressed. I've been depressed I am used to the feeling of depression. This is more like a slow shift to an abysmal dull existence. Party's aren't fun, reading is a chore, even my video games are lame. People are less exciting to meet in recent times, as it's a bingo game guessing what won't offend them, and when you do meet good people, generally you fall into the same boring patterns of socializing that can be cookie cuttered into any social group. Weed isn't even an interest to me anymore. I work a physical job but even that is considerably boring. It's like, if life were to be edible and have a taste, currently mine is ashy. I tried looking attractive, lost weight, look good. Why? What's the point? My girlfriend is amazing but even our interactions seems like just the same social chess game. I started a hobby, I write. That lost its edge already. Tried freestyling. Cool, decent at it, but it's lost its edge as well. Tried rollerblading, why not, goofy and retro. It has lost its shine too. Went to the store, maybe I can buy something arbitrary and fun. Did that a couple of times. Now I have less funds and items that no longer pull me in. Even mushrooms bore me, and they pull you into another world. I tried audiobooks and learning. Now I am smarter, but more dumb, because what's the point of the knowledge other then to frustrate you because ultimately you know that there was no point in gaining someone else's information, it's not like you can make progress with it, and even if you do, without years dedicated to the field nobody will care what you have to say. I tried living in the ghetto, and other then the occasional threat of bodily harm, the excitement soon turned to disgust at human failure and depravity, and so I left it again. Middle class suburban living is just as depressing , nothing happens, there isn't this open community like it used to be, where you can see activities and watch people be people. Lot of empty front lawns and parks tho. Clubs and shit are filled with shitty actors, people pretending to be what they are not too get what they can't get so they settle for what is alright, or fight about it in the streets. So much pain too, just hidden enough that you can only hear it in the influx of drunken shouting. 

It seems like everything we do is calculated, planned. Like whatever people do is incredibly predictable. Even when they are being unpredictable, it's easy to see the pattern of the action and the psychology that drives it and it makes it no longer exciting or unpredictable. I am living in a rerun, but not a fun rerun but a bottle episode where nobody leaves the room and it is a bunch of useless flashbacks. I can't see fun anymore, just ugly people in porcelain masks, afraid to talk about anything deeper then what is in their pocket. And the ones that do, seem to be just as lost in terms of existence as myself, and so we just row ourselves in circles, moving-but nowhere in any sort of speedy fashion. 

Sometimes, and I know this is due to my mental disorders, I feel as if I am an alien or God of sorts, watching humans struggle emotionally through things, where as I coast through poverty, betrayal, family breakdowns and the like with ease. I work because it's expected of me to survive, but when I don't work, I manage to survive as well, just with less opportunity to distract myself. But the struggle of living is an exciting addictive way to distract yourself. Walking 10 miles to work 6 hours, cleverly calculating your resources to pay bills and feed yourself and hopefully fuel addictions. But, it gets boring too. Why? Why is everything boring? Why isn't there an edge to life? Do I have to physically put myself in harm's way? I have almost died more then 3 times in my life, and the high you get from it, I will be honest, is amazing. But again short lived. So will I have to continuously almost die somehow? Fight in a war or join a gang or something? I don't understand myself, I just want to be like an average dude, who can wake up and challenge himself and be happy .

4,"I don’t know why I’m even posting. I guess to feel heard but strangers replying to me on the internet doesn’t make me feel better. It makes me feel worse.

I haven’t had friends for three years. Haven’t even been in a conversation with someone my age in three years. No one has ever had a crush on me or anything like that and all my friends have been in my head. I talk to myself a lot and the only thing that makes me feel better is imagining people who aren’t real which is basically just another form of imaginary friends. Very cringe.

I don’t understand it. How do people even come to have friends? I go to the store and I see couples guaranteed or families of best friends. It just gets me depressed. I eat a ton of sugar to make myself feel better and it works for a short period of time. I watch a lot of tv and YouTube videos. That’s all I ever do. Work and eat and sleep for like 5 hours. Then repeat.

If I had a gun I would shoot myself and end this waste of a life but I don’t have a gun and all other suicide methods seem pretty painful. Life has been difficult enough as is. Why would I want to go out in a painful way. 

And worst of all I am so anger. Just seething with rage because I don’t want to be here. And now because I was born I have to die to escape this misery and waste of time. When I’m dead the people I leave behind (just family) will get to feel how I felt for the past few years. Sure I feel bad for them but to be honest I feel worse for myself. And I am just so so angry that I can’t even eat or lay down or do my stupid work without wanting to break something. 

I am broken. The one thing that kept me going was hope for the future and now I’ve lost the one thing that has been keeping me alive for so long already. My plan right now is to keep searching for a quick and easy suicide and then I will have true peace and happiness.",16Sep2018,2

8,"Throwaway acct here

I guess you could say I’m just sad. I lost my dad almost two years ago (November 6) when I was only 19. My brother is moving to Hawaii and flies out of LA in a few days. He drove from the other side of the country with his wife, and they stopped in my hometown to see my brother’s friends and some family. I’ve moved about 30 minutes from said hometown, and he made no attempt to see me. I’m his little sister, with essentially no close family, and he didn’t try to see me. 

He said he’d text me today if he didn’t end up hanging out with a friend of his. Never got a text. Now that I mention it, I never really get texts from him. No check ins, no “hey how are ya”s, nothing. We are not close with our mother and choose not to have contact for our own sanities. I live with my boyfriend who just doesn’t understand.

I feel very lost and alone, and I’m so hurt that he’s made plans with everyone but me. I could see him tomorrow if I didn’t have to work, but he’s driving to the lake to see family anyways. Never attempted to make plans with me. 

I just want to feel like I’m a part of a family. I want someone other than my boyfriend to tell me they love me and that they’re here for me. I can’t stand that I can’t call my dad. He’s the only person who would ever call me just to see how I’m doing.

I’m just sad, and I’m tired of being sad. I hate the holidays without my dad, the only man who hated holidays as much as me. At least we could hate them together. 

I don’t want to be so alone.",16Sep2018,2
10,"I remember seeing a TV show when I was little where a girl was being mean to her sister. In the end the mean girl gets shrunken by a spell right in front of her sister. I don't remember the exact show but I totally remember the scene. The mean girl was looked exactly like me. She was even wearing the exact same outfit as I was. I remember her getting smaller and smaller and looking all around with a confused face. I remember her getting even smaller than her sister and her clothes getting loose and bunching up around her. When she stopped shrinking she was so tiny and she adjusted her overalls to fit her and her sister started to play with her. I immediately imagined myself as the girl. Ever since I saw that I wanted to get shrunken in my overalls by another girl. I started to read books and watch TV shows and movies with shrinking in them. I am totally obsessed. I even wear overalls everyday because I want to get shrunken in them.

I've only met one other girl who thinks that would be cool but she wouldn't actually do it in real life. For some reason other girls do not want to shrink. They think it is freaky or something. Even my friend who thinks shrinking is cool thinks other parts of my fantasy is weird. People don't understand my obsession with overalls too. They also think it is weird that I'm really really small in real life but I still want to get shrunken.

Why do I have my fantasy and why don't other girls have it too?",16Sep2018,3
11,"One of the things I feel most strongly about myself is having a pretty neat and detailed memory, That I can recall things easily regardless of how they affect me emotionally or otherwise. Repressed memories have always been something alien to me, I don't understand how someone can have a bad experience and then their brain can just completely block it and they don't realize it even happened, and they may or may not experience the repercussions without realizing were they come from. I read a lot of my own diaries and stuff related to past experiences, so I'm always recollecting stuff, obviously under my own bias since it's stuff according to what I cared about and was important to me and how I felt at the time I wrote those things, but since it's me I also get more in depth and uniquer insight that no one else can have reading my diaries.   
That's not what I was doing today, I was shopping for brushes and paint on my computer, And suddenly an image popped into my head, a piece of cranial bone. I recognized it as a memory but it's a memory that I didn't know I had, and there was really nothing prompting me to recall it so I was weirded out. so I try to place this memory, It's fuzzy in my head and I'm still not sure of the exact moment and time, I know I was less than 12 maybe even less than 11 years old, And I was older than 7, so around 7 and 11 years old. I was with my brother and some adults, most likely my mom and at least one more person, I don't think my dad was there but he might have been. We were on a road and there was some sort of accident, I don't think we were on a vehicle, we probably heard the commotion and came out of the house, it was near my house. the cranial bone was from a young woman who I think was on a motorcycle, I don't know if it crashed against a structure or if it was a vehicle collision, or a truck or a car that hit her while she was walking I know that I knew what had happened then, because I knew exactly what i was looking at and why. it was one of those things, I think she was alone. So we were there and her bones and blood was all through the pavement. Someone kicked part of the cranial bone, they didn't know what it was, but I did, my mom told me, she told me to stay home but I didn't listen. She was way far from where all the blood and bones were (the woman who died) And there were two more accidents in that same place, one was a bus and the other one was a motorcycle, so I think this one was a car or a truck that ran her over.   


I had forgotten this for 10 years... I used to have a lot of creepy nightmares, I remember them all, I never had nightmares about this, I would remember them. I remember her name was on the news, I remembered her name for a long time, I think she was young and her family was very heartbroken. I don't think they found out who did it

14,"I love my mom. She’s the only one I have. My dad died when I was young and my stepdad died a few years ago, he wasn’t perfect but he was the only dad I had. 

I still blame her for his death. She got together with him 9months after my birth father died. 

Don’t get me wrong, he put her through hell. He cheated and was drug addicted. He gave her “permission” to cheat on him to make up for his mistake so she did. She tells me she quit using drugs when she had realized we kids weren’t getting fed. I took care of my little brothers for the most part during that. I was 10, they were 8 and 5 my 16 year old stepsister lived mainly with her mother.

My stepdad was more like a mean big brother than a dad. He got his payback for all that when he had a stroke and a heart attack about 10 years ago, he got clean and it humbled him. It left him in a wheel chair and eventually took both of his feet. 

She stayed with him through all our childhood. Through the drug addiction, the beatings (he never laid a hand on her but we got spanked with whatever was closest). She stayed with him after his stroke.

She decided that the time to leave him for another man was after we all had forgiven him. After he formed a relationship with my kids. He was a better grandfather than he ever was a dad. Ten fold. She left him for the man she had an affair with all those years ago. 

He moved in with his borderline elderly sister. He was miserable. I could see the sadness and hurt every time I saw him. I had to take care of him emotionally when his sister couldn’t. It killed her too. They had just lost their mother a year before. She couldn’t bear to see him like that but he had nowhere else to go. To see not one ounce of guilt from my mother just hurt and angered me to my core.

Not only that but I told her some deeply emotional shit in confidence and she used it to hurt my dad more and use it as part of an excuse to why she left when she was already seeing the other man. She would only cop to it after they split. 

On Christmas that year he asked me to buy him a gun. He claimed it was for self defense but I knew he would end his life if I gave in so I blew it off. He killed him self by neglecting his health instead. He was having heart failure and didn’t tell his doctors. He stopped taking his medicine for diabetes. 

He had a heart attack and died at 52. 

I always had a wonderful relationship with my mom. She was my best friend. But as soon as she left my dad it was like she washed her hands of anything to do with him.  

My older sister and I were left to plan and pay for his memorial, make the decision to donate his usable organs/tissues and she never offered to help, not even for moral support. 

I can’t imagine what kind of a toll it must take on a person to physically care for someone who was bad to you for years. But she sat there and watched him do what he did all those years, made our childhood shitty, risked our lives by having druggies in our home... to leave him after it was all over. 

She married the new guy 8 months after they stared seeing each other which was about 6 months after she left my dad and 2 months after he had died. Nobody was told they just eloped. 

She had the gall to tell my kids this was their new “grandfather”. She makes zero effort to maintain a relationship with my kids. They miss her so much. When I invite her over it’s always a shit poor excuse. And her new husband shows zero effort in wanting to be a part of my family.

I asked her to come celebrate our 11 go’s birthday this weekend for a game night and it’s “oh I have to work early” and “I don’t much patience for games these days.” Bitch neither do I but I do it to make my children happy. I’m siting here with a shattered knee and I still do shit for my kids. Do your kid a favor and come spend time with your GRANDKIDS. 

I’ve never let her know how I really feel. I don’t like conflict. I want her to be here with my kids and have even welcomed her new husband into my home. I’m trying. But I still resent her so much.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I just needed to get this out somewhere before I lost it. ",16Sep2018,1

‪Even though I’ve been sexually harassed more frequently by men than by women, the harassment endured from women has been consistently more intense and harder to protect myself from.‬

‪HR, managers, and other authority figures don’t generally perceive women as physically threatening. If you try to report that a woman is sexually harassing you, it’s usually brushed off. The woman is just “playing” and is rarely considered a real danger, even when she is. Being sexually harassed by a woman is considered uncommon, often nonexistent, and as a result goes ignored to a scary extent when it does happen.‬",16Sep2018,2
20,"A few weeks ago, I was approached at night by a man asking for 40 dollars to get back to his kid. I felt bad, as his story was convincing, but told him I had no cash, and stupidly, that I only had my card.  He immediately chimed in that an ATM was not too far away. At this, I felt like something was off, and because I'm an idiot, elected to get up and go to the ATM instead of telling him to fuck off. My plan had been to say that 20 was all I could spare, as I had just spent a ton on goods at an event I had just left. I dropped that idea when he turned around to lead me, and my bf who was with me, to the ATM. In his back pocket was, what looked to be, a knife. So, since neither I, nor my bf have been trained in knife to hand combat, I pretended not to have noticed (I'm pretty sure I was the only one to notice) and forked up the 40 he'd asked for. Yes, I'm a moron.  I tried to play it off like it was no big deal, and truly, 40 bucks is not much to pay if it means I avoided a good stabbing. I pretended that I believed I was doing a good, if not very stupid thing. And guess what. On the whole, the night was amazing. Today though, we were back in the area. This guy comes up to us again and begins his script. He stopped when he recognized us, and turned and left. He knew we recognized him as well. Anyway, I feel like even more of an idiot, I had all but forgotten about him, but now I feel like I should have done something about it, but what?

24,"Until you learn to take a trip inside yourself, you will not gain anything. Even if you want to know God, it starts from knowing yourself. If you want to truly understand the world around you, it starts from knowing yourself. The core of all knowledge and understanding is self awareness.

&amp;#x200B;

Being a stranger to yourself is the root of all your illnesses, pains and struggles. Because not knowing is the root of all hardships.

&amp;#x200B;

A person who thinks they know a lot, but doesn’t know themselves, they don’t know anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

All pain starts from yourself and all cures are all also hidden in yourself. All the stages that you go through after death, is truly coming face to face with the reality of who you are.

&amp;#x200B;

Self awareness is complicated, because you run away from confronting yourself by taking refuge in others. Also because who you are and who your are trying to understand are the same person. You have to get to know yourself and you have bias towards yourself and with bias, what is there will remain hidden. 

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore self awareness has two prerequisites: 

1. Forgetting about others and focusing on yourself 
2. Removing bias towards yourself

The shortcomings are from me, but I blame others. Whilst you don’t search for the blame in yourself, you will not find the main reason. Until you don’t blame yourself, you will not find the real culprit.

25,"Someone asked me how do I channel things?

I guess I channel things by becoming a channel myself. Like a sieve which is having water poured into it from above. I let things pass through me. Whatever it is. I don't hang onto anything because I can't. I'm a sieve. It's not something I'm capable of. It's not my purpose.  

That's not to say that everything is in one ear and out the other. There'll always be some sort of residue or trace left behind, however temporary, along the surface of the sieve where the water hit it, and that is where I came into contact with an experience head on, looking straight at it as it touched me before carrying on its way through.  

I try not to hold onto any powerful experience or emotion running through me, whether it be beautiful, terrifying, hopeful, sad etc. Of course I try to feel it fully in the moment, and savour it in real-time, not file it away to be unpacked and perused over another day. I try to be 100% present. Right here. Right now.   

Looking long-term, I'd rather focus on what kind of residual mozaic will be left upon my soul after being touched by so many different hues of experience, and having some sort of overall shape or form in mind today as I go forward. A life-time piece of internal art which many people hope to only complete when they know they are experiencing their final hours, comfortable and wanting for nothing, surrounded by all the people that love them.  

Seeing myself as a sieve I think was a strategy I had to adopt because I feel things too much. I needed a way to carry on feeling the essence of things but not have to block out those things that were too painful or too beautiful for me to contain.   

Holding onto things, even amazing things, trying to preserve them inside me forever always becomes too much, and something eventually gives way because I'm not allowing whatever it is, to carry on its way. And so the concentration inside increases as I harbour the experience/emotion against its will, and at some point it will become toxic to me ",16Sep2018,0

33,"Hello, this is the first text I've ever posted on Reddit so if there are issues my apologies. I am 24 and I just moved to a new state for graduate school about a month ago. My mother died last March. The specifics surrounding her death can be boiled down to a relapse of alcohol. She was sober for about 17 years and over the course of her final year she relapsed heavily. I have my theories about why but those are not necessary here. She essentially drank herself to death, and while what killed her was a result of a wound turning septic, she sustained said wound almost certainly due to an accident revolving around intoxication. I say that because I was living with a friend the last week of her life because it was too much to be around, and for that I still sometimes hate myself. She was a great woman, she cared deeply for me and her demons got the best of her. What I am struggling with is the notion that I never felt as if I grew up until she died, and as a result she will never see me as the man I am, and will become. The more that time goes on the harder it gets. The more time goes on I realize all of the things that never occurred to me while she was alive, or even shortly after her death. I know this sub sees a lot of activity, but if anyone can lend some words it would be much appreciated. As I said, I am in a new city, and I don't have a lot of people to talk too, and I don't want to always burden my friends back home with these things.

I’ve turned into a lazy dopamine junky. With the snap of a finger, I’ve got my dopamine hit. My brain is being rewarded on command - with each item on the list being detrimental to my mental and physical health.

I stopped going to the gym and stopped giving a shit about improving myself endlessly. I have things I have to take care of, and these addictions are preventing me from getting to where I want to be. They’re shortening my life.

Any advice on what to expect and how to handle quitting these addictive habits is greatly appreciated.

35,"Over the last two years, I've spent time being as angry and suicidally depressed as probably anyone else on the Internet.  Yet tonight, I finally realised that even with all the horrible things that are happening in the world, I can still find reasons to be happy; even if said reasons are no more complicated than computer games and a box of pizza.

Suicidal depression honestly is a choice.  Play a computer game, go out and watch a film, spend some time with someone, listen to some music, take up a hobby.  I've felt better from watching videos about hydroponic vegetable gardening on YouTube, recently.  It's apparently possible to grow edible microgreens in ***days.***  I previously had no idea that plants could grow that fast.

Don't waste time being depressed about the fact that you might not have a relationship, either.  Don't make your happiness dependent on another person.  It doesn't need to be.  You can be perfectly happy and fulfilled by being completely on your own, if you stay mentally active.  Keep your focus off the bad news, and focus on what you enjoy doing instead, and actively look for new things to enjoy.  The possibilities are literally endless.",16Sep2018,1
36,"I can be a bit of a know it all. And I think my way is always right. But finally, after years trying to sell my novel, I realize I need a new perspective on a key scene. Can someone please help?

Can a woman here please help??

Martin and Daisy were close friends in high school.

Although he's a geek, Daisy did always think Martin had a cute bubble butt &amp; was attracted to the nerd. Though they went to separate colleges &amp; grew apart, years later during the summer when both are 22, Daisy spots her friend Martin at the beach.

They start up a conversation. Perfectly normal except---Daisy is in a shoulders to toe wetsuit, while Martin is butt-naked!

She was so surprised to see him from behind. ""Is it...could it be?"" But then he nervously looked both ways, and it was unmistakably Martin.

Martin in the NUDE.

And wow, a surprisingly cute, ROUND lily-white butt on that geek!

Starting a conversation with him was for her own curiosity, but also she just couldn't help this devilish bit of fun.

Daisy knew Martin was shy in high school &amp; that he is clearly embarrassed at this. She also happened to hear recent gossip from her girlfriends that Martin was actually still a virgin. It's obviously his first time at a clothing-optional beach.

She did always think he had a surprisingly cute, round butt, and there it is, exposed in the flesh for the world to see!

His friends told him to try it out NUDE by himself to get out of his shell because who would know him at a beach 50 miles away?

Martin tries to play it cool, hands at his sides, but he's blushing red, his bare feet burning on the hot sand as he shifts subtly from foot to foot. Daisy thinks it's cute, but is still a bit sore at Martin for turning her down for the prom back in high school to ask out the cheerleader he had a crush on (she said no). She heard he's still a virgin.

As Daisy:

How old are you? Are you a geek, or outgoing?

What is your reaction at spotting Martin from behind in this situation &amp; what are you thinking? How do you get his attention from behind?

Does he look vulnerable? Why?

Does his status as a 22 year old virgin make you giggle that he's on this beach nude? Why?

What is something funny you can say in conversation as you take a subtle but noticeable look down?

As Martin turns his bare buns to leave, you say ""Hey Martin, one last thing..."" &amp; say or do WHAT to make him REALLY blush red &amp; run down the beach for his towel?

Thanks!!",16Sep2018,0
37,"I usually have 2 bottles. One for home, one for work.  Don't recall removing the one from my work bag. 

Rarely need them so don't take too much note.  But when I do, I neeeeed them.  

Wife asked if we had any advil, and I said 'one min, I'll check my work bag'.  Nope, no advil... No Ativan either.   

Talking a half month full prescription worth.  

Since I hardly use them, I don't notice until just now.  As much as I hate having stuff stolen, this is just beyond low.   

I'm off work for a few months currently, but had I had a panic attack while there and no safety net, things could get pretty dark for me real quick.  

So, if you are the kind of person to steal meds, I know you probably don't care, but at least have the mind to leave enough that the person you stole from does not have a severe uncontrollable reaction they have no meds to control the situation. ",16Sep2018,1
38,"you and i won’t see each other again, the chance for reconciliation passed, the heart changed its mind, the wind reversed direction, i grew up, you matured.  i come up with a lot of good reasons why we couldn’t be, none of which make forgivable excuses, because love has this unfathomable habit of escaping reason and an urge to excuse.

i found other lovers to occupy me, smooth the wrinkles in my ego, divert me from a self i refuse to investigate.  the mirror tells me everything i need to know.  the length of my hair, the weight i carry, the plump skin on the back of my hand, are all the confirmation my image believes.  how beautiful is the outside of me when the light and the mood sets the tone.  how sensual, mysterious, persuasive of me when i expose contoured slivers of skin.

who needs love when you have the charm of yourself to admire?

i tell myself i frightened you off, i was too passionate, intense, a free and voracious spirit.  the cries of desire, vicious reprimands, my face turned against you, the scalding from my burning demands, none of these lovers acts were meant to be nails in the coffin of you and me.

it was a drama, a tragedy, a Shakespearean play, an amusement, entertainment, my ignoble foreplay.  a way to force meaning into my mundane little life.

41,"**Be good and kind but don’t see it**, when you see that you’re good and kind it changes to bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Be good but don’t measure it, when you start counting how good of a person you are, it becomes ugly.

  
Be a good person but don’t show it off to other people; when you brag about it, it becomes lame. Be good and protect it, **don’t let it change to bad**. 

  
Humans don’t know how to be good, they run away from it, or they waste all their hard work and sacrifice too easily.  


Isn’t it so that in your career and life you try to protect your hard earned work from getting ruined by other people? Isn’t your most valuable asset the good acts you do? Don’t you have to protect it?  


&gt;Don’t be one of those people who count and measure how good of a person they are. 

&amp;#x200B;

Try to lean towards being good when you interact with other people! Don’t be afraid! It won’t be for naught! **Be sure that the good you do will return to you.** Believe me, it’s the most profitable investment. 

  
In your interactions with other people don’t say that he/she doesn’t deserve better than this, **say I am worth much more**. 

  
If you want to interact with an animal, how do you behave? Don’t you treat it like a human?

  
So how is it that when you want to interact with a human, no matter their faults and shortcomings, you don’t treat them the same? After all, it’s a human. They are like you. 

  
When you want to interact with your kids, don’t you give them all you got, even if they don’t deserve it? **What is the difference between your kids and other people?** 

  
Do you know the difference between God’s close friends and other people?  


&gt;They treated other people just like they would treat their own families. 

&amp;#x200B;

If the person in front of you is not worth it, your worth is high. **The definition of good is that it has no limits**. It’s like saying beauty is good but too much of it isn’t good. 

  
A lot of people say that being too good, isn’t good. **These people have not understood the true meaning of being good.**  ",16Sep2018,2

That bench that we used to sat and talked all things

People and things come and go
No more messages 
No more chat 
No one sit at that bench anymore
Everything disappears gradually

I’m sorry because I can’t manage my busy schedule, my work
We all have own ways now
We all have own ambitions
We chose to take different ways

Present to memories

44,"I’ve been friends with this guy since the 6th grade, we’re both 23 now. We went through middle school together and high school together and were always super close. We had other friendships and girlfriends throughout the years that kept us someone apart, but still great friends. 

During summers when we were home from college we would hang out all the time, but last summer after graduation we both made really poor choices that hurt our friendship.

Here’s the thing, we would hang out with our other friends together. But for about a year we would NEVER hang out together just him and I. We would only hang out if there were other people around. Him and I both knew it, it was awkward, but neither of us said anything. So if at least three of us couldn’t hang out, my friend and I weren’t hanging out. Even though we used to chill all the time. 

Last night I said fuck it, and called him and asked if he wanted to chill, him and I both knew it would just be the two of us. It went really well, it was awkward, but it went well and it went in the right direction for the two of us to rekindle what once was an awesome friendship. I’m really happy, and I’m at work now but when I get out I’m going to his house to watch football. ",16Sep2018,31
45,"I’ve struggled with depression since I was 8, and anxiety since I was about 18. I get into these funks where I won’t do anything but go to work. I barely shower, I eat too much, I refuse to hang out with friends, etc. This has plagued my life for so long I almost got used to this life I was living. 

I started a new job in the field I went to school for, and took a massive pay cut. I used to make about $3000 a month waitressing and now I make $1000 a month. I had student loans, and in order to pay them off fast I was spending half my monthly income on them. I was living off of $20 a week after my other bills. Thankfully it wasn’t less than what I NEEDED to survive (I live with my parents for now before I get married), but I was so used to filling my void with consumer goods and shopping and eating that this little amount of money caused all of that to stop and I had a hard time adjusting.

Fast foreword 6 months in to this new job. I’m fairly used to living on little to no money. In 6 more months I will be promoted and the penny pinching will be a faint memory. I stumbled across this video on YouTube that for the life of me I can’t remember the name, but in it was a girl explaining how she lives off of a small amount of money every month. She mentioned her minimalistic life so I then researched minimalism. And here we are.

Last weekend I decided to donate, sell, or throw away everything in my life that 1) didn’t bring me joy. 2) wasn’t something I used often. 3) didn’t fit. 4) was just generally not for me anymore. 

I’ve condensed my depression nest/hoarding mound down to a peaceful amount of only the things that are beautiful and functional. My room isn’t disgusting anymore, I can find clothes to wear in the morning, my laundry pile is manageable, I can sleep peacefully in this sanctuary instead of being surrounded with clutter that would zigzag my vision with pure chaos and failure. 

I donated 5 bags of just clothing alone. I threw away any remnants of sadness that were left in my space. I cleaned my sheets. I put down a rug. I feel normal and peaceful. This week I had $30 in my wallet. I put $20 in my gas tank and I haven’t felt the need to use the last $10 because I have everything I need in its own little space in my room. 

I’m not sure if it has actually helped my depression and anxiety or if I’m just hoping it did so I’m convincing myself it did. But dang, it’s worth a try if you’re someone like me. 

TL;DR I got rid of 80% of my belongings in an attempt to use minimalism to help my depression and anxiety. Now my wallet and mental illness broke up with each other and I am a productive human again. ",16Sep2018,353

All the while I've been trying to take care of my mom who has multiple sclerosis and can hardly walk even with her walker. Cooking, cleaning, taking her to the doctor, shopping.

Now I just got a job. My first job. In the deli of a super market (salads, meats, hot food, desserts). 

I'm honestly so stressed out it's making me angry and upset. I can hardly do anything on my own time without panicking of ""what if I fuck something up? What am i getting myself into?"" 

Should i just tell them it isnt the job for me and try to find one that's going to be less stressful? Should I just try to power through it? I can hardly play games in my free time which is normally what I do without getting angry and just snapping from all thos weight on my shoulders.",16Sep2018,5

Last year was at a college, not at an actual university, though part of the university. This year I'm a first year at a university.

The day started alright, I moved all my stuff to my new flat, and went out to visit the city. A year ago, I didn't know anyone or had any experience partying (not that I have a lot of it now), but now I feel like I have more experience, so after hearing that the university is throwing a party and I thought I'd go, called my few friends that I've know a bit less than a year, but two of them have met their flatmates(we all live in different flats or accommodations), and the other one doesn't want to go because he has plans going to another event another day because his flatmates and friends have asked him to go.

&amp;#x200B;

Although I say friends, they don't necessarily like each other, especially two of them, but I hang out with all of them at separate times.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to achieve anything special, I just wanted to meet people and make friends, but after going to the party, alone, at the right time, and barely anyone there, I thought I would go since there was nothing to do, those guys that were there were probably the organizers or something.

I live in a cheap country if you earn in usd, i support my family of 3 by working online with art. Pretty proud of myself about that honestly, done that for the past 2 years. But working online all the time means i never leave my house. I don't have any local friends or places to go (work school etc) don't have that much money to go around places to have fun anyway. Because of timezone i rarely talk to my internet friends. I get pretty lonely sometimes, now i'm pretty used to it. When i was starting out and had almost no commissions coming in without any internet friends and the heavy responsibility crushing me, i was pretty depressed. 
I'm busy all the time, if i work my hardest for another 3-6 years i might get good enough at art to earn enough money to leave to a first world country.

I'm a computer science undergrad in a developing country working as a software engineer on bank systems 4h/day for 3 years now. I make OK money, enough to get by, pay off student loans, save a bit and still have time to work on my own projects. I fell in love with this field but things have changed.  


My parents (well educated people) are pretty low on income the last five years or so but since I got work I'm not so much of a burden to them now. My boss' bank account is in the negative. Some of my friends just gave up trying to buy quality food because the money won't cut it. I see everyone making concessions while they are deserving of so much more.  


I sometimes have an intense urge to drop all of this mad big city haste and get the fuck away. Here's where it gets tricky. Costs here are off the charts and everyone I know is basically working to survive solely. The ones who are not are creating debt day after day with loan interests and calming themselves with cheap drugs or cheap mind-dulling entertainment fucking up their mental or physical health. I feel like getting up on the professional ladder is (while doable) just insufficient. Think about it.  


I can get fired tomorrow. You're gonna say, ""ok, get a new job"". I can get fired from that as well. Prices can go up and my salary may not. My salary may go down. My boss or any ""boss"" for that matter has no guilt in this. Then what? Am I going to cut eating meat? I'm living on pasta at least 3 times a week.   


Neanderthals didn't know how to compile a kernel or code a driver and they lived well enough for us to be here. If you don't have a million dollar+ networth you are a slave to someone who may be a slave well. My point is, this is not sustainable and may never be. You eating food and drinking water means dependency on other people if you don't make/get your own. We cannot leave our cave and slaughter down a deer and be fucking satisfied. There's a lot of complicated things we have to do in order to survive and plan ahead the rest of time we have on this forsaken planet.   


The average user/person does not need high-level technology. Some people, 1Mil$+ people, they need it. They need it to control the lives of the people who just need a meal. We sent a car to space?

I was walking home yesterday and there was a kid playing in a trampoline watching a homeless guy drag a cart full of cans, probably all he has and he stopped jumping, I'm not sure why. This scene hurt, left me grasping for air unable to blink.  


If poverty and technology can coexist after so much time, I cannot help it grow. I must not. It means \*\*it is not working\*\*. It's a tool being used only by people who do not truly appreciate it.

People can’t handle the fact that the illusion they’re running after is now shattered because it caused the tragic death of some of my favorite role models like Elvis, Jimi Hendrix and Tom Petty etc so they gloss over it by just saying “oh how tragic and sad” “they had a really rough life” so let’s go to Prince memorial concert to hide the truth bomb staring me right in the face and cover it up with feel good emotions and waving my hands to McCarthy singing Let It Be.

She had asked my husband to do a nude shoot of her and he obliged, with his self rule off “I won’t tell my wife about this”. I was devastated when I found out, and the dozens of lies afterwards.

He said he wanted a divorce later on from other issues we had. I contested. He began to spend his days with her. I contact her to tell her the photo shoot had hurt my marriage. She told me to stop talking to her and my husband. I began to feel fiery. 

So they began to date. I would refer to her as a whore to my friends and to my ex. This was all 5 months ago. My ex broke up with her and somewhat rekindled a friendship with me. Realized she wasn’t nice. That she was fake. That she defended her friend that cheated on her fiancé. And as I had suspected that she had been planning to be with my husband for some time, I think he somewhat believed some of it was more premeditated than innocent as well.

But I called her a whore. And I feel awful about that. She’s not the type I could just message and be like “hey sorry I called you that”. She’s still after my ex husband who tells me he just ignores her. She’s the type that tried to get him to get her pregnant within a few months of dating so he couldn’t leave her. He has warned me to not reach out because she hates me, not because of what I said but because she sees me (he picked a friendship with me over a relationship with her) as the reason her “perfect man” and her didn’t work out.
