0,"Good afternoon peeps of r/casualconversation :) 

Today I achieved another mini goal towards my ultimate goal. 

I’ve lived in an abusive house all of my life (my parents duh) lmao so yeah.. I’ve always wanted to join the military but wasn’t sure if I could for medical reasons but a few weeks ago I made the first step towards my goal which was seeing a recruiter. I was told I could join but I needed to meet the physical requirements. 

My problem wasn’t that I was too big to join it was kinda the opposite.. I’m kinda weak lmao. So today I was able to do a pull-up:) requirements to ship are 2 pull ups 1.5mile run &amp; sit ups I believe? I’m able to do all of the above except for the pull ups but today I was able to do one . 

My goal is to hopefully join by the end of summer classes in college (2 months) let’s see what happens.",16Jun2018,2
1,"It was Dangerous Personalities by Joe Navarro that changed my life. I bought the book for the checklists. I've been trying to figure out what's wrong with me for years. I've spent my entire adult life relying on alcohol and marijuana to help cope with the stress of my life. When I went through the unstable personality checklist it became obvious that I was an unstable personality.

It felt like all of the pieces were finally falling together. I felt completely devastated. I wept, I wanted to die. I almost checked myself into the hospital. I thought of every possible option I had but I kept circling back to wanting to just end my life. I didn't feel like I could overcome my nature. I thought about all of the people I'd wronged and all of the good things I'd had which had fallen apart. The guilt was overwhelming. 

Instead of killing myself I called the crisis intervention line. I spent an hour and a half on the phone crying most of the time. The person I talked to referred me to mental health services. 

I took time away from work. I wasn't able to do my job. I was emotionally wrecked. I spent the next day trying to get in touch with the services I was referred to. I called one place and was put on a wait list. The next place didn't take over the phone referrals so I had to go in person. Sitting in that office and filling out those forms was the most difficult thing I've ever done in my life. I cried openly because I felt so defeated. I felt like a complete loser. I had gotten myself into a horrible place in life after spending my entire adult life trying to cope. Now I was there, in a small quiet office as a grown man crying while filling out forms. Guided there by a boss who bullied me, a lover who manipulated me, a parent whose concern turned to wrath, a book which had pointed out expertly all of my flaws and a person on the phone who listened calmly while I came apart at the seams. I had given up. I was submitting to my feelings, to my situation and to life itself. My reasoning was that at least I'm trying. At least I've made some effort. How much worse can it get? I'm an alcoholic struggling with his finances, career and personal life, how much worse can it get? 

It got better. I met with a counsellor and she helped me through my crisis. It wasn't easy. I detoxed hard. I thought the government was out to get me for at least a week. I went through bouts of mania. The lover I mentioned? She tried to force her way back into my life. She stalked me, manipulated my friends, tried to go through my family and even showed up at my door several times. That ended when I called the cops on her. 

I didn't go to the hospital. I was afraid they'd never let me leave if I did. I stayed at home. I ordered food and I watched TV. I went jogging when my mind raced. I tried to reach out to friends but only one came to my rescue when I needed it. One family member stood by my side. Those people and my counsellor are the people who kept me alive and safe during that time.

I've been making a lot of changes in my life. I left my job and found a new one. I went to the bank and restructured my finances. I finished another book that's been helping me learn how to manage the panic and fear I used to feel constantly. The ex is gone. If she comes near my place again all of my neighbors know to call the police. I changed the locks, reset all of my PINS and passwords. Can't be too sure. I've been working on setting boundaries with my family. I haven't had a drink. I've cleaned up my diet. 

My life isn't perfect now nor will it ever be. At least I'm not drinking. I refuse to be anyone's doormat. I set appropriate boundaries and maintain them with vigilance. I care for myself first. I don't hate myself anymore. I have ways to deal with panic, worry and stress. I have plans for my future. Maybe one day my life will be happy and easy. Maybe one day I'll do the things I've always wanted to do. I've dug myself a deep hole. I just hope I can get out of it. ",16Jun2018,21

3,"All of us girls climbed back into that van with the highest of sugar highs.  The giggling and babbling only intensified.  I was happy.  I knew that this is where God wanted me.  I was right where I was supposed to be.

Stacey commented that we were almost to the house.  She also said that her and I needed to go into the offices real quick at the main house.  

“It will only take a minute and then I will bring you to the girls house to get settled settled.  You still have 5 more girls to meet.” Stacey told me.
We pulled into an almost empty shopping center parking lot.  As we rode past the store fronts, I could see that a lot of them were empty save one used as a work out gym.  

Almost there... I didn't know what to expect.  I had never been in a place like this before.  I mean....do I have to eat a live chicken on my first day?  I wasn't even hungry.   My anxiety was reaching catastrophic levels.  

Time to bail? That's when that little annoying voice came back.  

“You can still leave ya know?  Whats so wrong with living high in the first place?  Some arbitrary law that says that we can't have certain things...why?  Just because some other moron decided to go and get himself killed?  Those rules don't apply to you.""   Again, I told him to shut the hell up and leave me alone.  

Stacey saw me struggling and kept and ever watchful eye on me as we came to a complete stop in front of the main house of All The Way House.  I remember thinking...All the way where?
Through the glass doors and windows I could see that the lobby was very nicely set up.  I looked further down the shopping center and saw a few other empty store fronts, and, at the very end I saw the church, Miracle Place Church.  My attention was brought back inside the van when I overheard Kim say to Stacey, 

""Look, all the guys lined up to see the new chicken.""  

Wait!!! What!?!? Chicken??  You mean there are guys lined up to see the new MEAT??? Meaning...ME!!! No No No No!  I was literally a hot mess.  I was in no condition to meet anyone of the opposite sex.  I looked into the windows once again only to see the lobby PACKED with a bunch of dudes...Click my clogs together and repeat after me...Theres no place like home.  Theres no place like home!! Oh right....I have no home.
Stacey looked at me through the mirror and said, ""Are you ready? Grab your stuff and follow me.""  It wasn't a request.  It was a command.  

Amy turned to me and grabbed my hand and said, ""Go ahead.  We will see you at the in a little bit and get you settled after you meet the rest of the girls.""  

I grabbed my stuff and climbed out of the van into the humid air.  I had lost my rubber band earlier so my hair hung in a frizzy mess past my shoulders.  My hair also started falling out when I was in detox.  Stress, the Doctor said.  

My scrub bottoms were too small and only came up to my hips.  I had to hold onto the waist band to keep them from falling off when I walked.  Luckily my XXXL shirt was big enough to hide everything, including the fact that my pants were in danger of falling off.   

We walked up to the door.  I could see all the eyeballs by this time.  All of them....waiting.....like vultures...for the chicken...ugh!  I held my head high and I refused not to lower my eyes in shame.  A blast of ice-cold air hit me as Stacey opened the doors to the lobby.  Oh yes!! That felt good.  I walked in, following Stacey, and tried to give the guys a once over.  See if there was anyone cute enough to flirt with to make my stay a little easier.  One caught my attention.  He was wearing sunglasses inside.  He was at least 10 years younger than me.  I was making a mental note of what he looked like so I could ask later on who he was when I almost bumped into Stacey as she was unlocking the office doors.  Now I knew.  The house main offices shared space with the boys dormitory, or the Man Cave.
Stacey brought me into this little office room and directed me to sit down.  This little girl came up to me.  She couldn't have been more than 7 or 8.  I could tell immediately that this had to be Stacey’s daughter.  Penny smiled at me and handed me a drawing that she drew just for me.  

Stacey told me, ""Penny has been waiting on you.  She loves meeting new girls that come in.""  

I smiled and did my best at being a good conversationalist, but I just wasnt feeling right.  Stacey sensed this and asked Penny to go wait in the other room with Matt.  

I don't remember what we did but it wasn't long till we were making that walk back through the lobby and back into the van.  By this time Amy and Kim were gone.  I was glad to be away from all the guys and looking forward to seeing what would be my home for the next 9 months.
We drove to the further side of the  shopping center, to this little pink house.  Actually, I could tell that it had been a Pizza Hut at one time.  Apparently they had bought, gutted and remodeled it and turned it into the girls house/pantry/kitchen.  

We walked into the back door where I came face to face with my first sister, Christy.  She was an itty bitty thing.  She was sitting on stool, leaned over 2 massive  baking trays filled with chicken quarters.  OH! Chicken!!  

“Not everything has to be about you Brook,"" I said to myself.  That’s when I was told that, Monday thru Saturday, all meals are planned and prepared by the cook.  On Sunday, it was the girls responsibility to make sure everyone is fed.
The kitchen was separated from the rest of the house by a door.  As I walked through the door, I walked into one, huge, single room.  This room served as our livingroom, diningroom, bedroom and pantry.  I could see all the carbohydrates....I mean food, behind a half wall just beside the livingroom.  To put it mildly, there was enough food there for all 8 girls to eat everyday, every meal, for the next 2 years.  And more came in weekly, I was told.  

Stacey, once again, grabbed my bags and announced me to the girls in the house.  All the girls came speed walking up to me to meet me.  They seemed genuinely happy to meet their new sister from another mister.   I was introduced to each one individually and was told to pick a bed.  I looked up to see 9 twin size beds line the walls.  I couldn't decide.  I was in no condition to make any kind of decision at this point.   Another girl, Emma, took me by the hand and led me to the bed next to hers.  She had long black hair and the biggest boobs I have ever seen on a white woman.  She sat me down and plopped down on the bed next to me.  For some reason it felt as if I already knew Emma.  She looked familiar but there was no way I knew her.  She's just one of those people you don't forget.  Full of life.  She could tell I was feeling no joy.  She grabbed this spider looking thing and started messaging my scalp.  It felt good but I was worried that she was ripping hair out of my already thinning scalp.
I met Kennedy, young girl, only 21 years old.  I could tell immediately that she would be considered the ""class clown.""  She had the most amazing laugh and was hilarious.  Shanna was this short, little woman. Older than me.  Another sweet little lady, but I noticed she kept to herself a lot.  Each of these girls, along with the ones I had already met, were in the program.  Debbie, I met along with her 2-year-old, cute as a button, son, Jacob. She was not in the program.  She just lived there while she worked in the media department for the church.   She was a big ol girl from Maryland.  I don't remember her story as to how she ended up all the way down in Baker, Louisiana.
These were the ladies that made up the girls house when I entered All The Way House.  Land of misfit toys.  Where they take in the ones that no one wanted.  The place that turns no one away.  The place that God told me to go......so I went...",16Jun2018,1

6,"Hello Reddit!
So its been two weeks since I’ve started to notice all this but to be honest I think I’ve been feeling this for.. almost more than that.

So two weeks ago school ended, (And please don’t correct my grammar errors, English is my secondary language) and to most kids it’s an amazing thing! Yeah but to me it’s.. kinda sad? And ever since it’s ended I’ve had a mixture of all kinds of emotions.

The emotion I’ve had the most were 
Loneliness and Confusion 

The first emotion I want to talk about is loneliness,        I feel like I’m on a different planet than the rest of my friends and family. I want to bring out all these kinds of ideas and stuff like music, comics, cartoons and movie stuff but to my family... it’s just a dream and it will never happen. I’m lonely, no one to talk to about my ideas and interests cause apparently if I don’t like the latest hit by The ChainSmokers than I’m considered “Weird” and I’m distant from most of my family members and even friends who keep telling me that I’m just an outsider.  And will I ever be loved? My dad keeps bragging about how he had 4 girlfriends when he was my age and that kinda takes my self confidence down a bit and makes me think about how no one will live me..

The next emotion is what I’ve been hit with the most is confusion/questioning life.

I’m confused on how life is going to be in the next 5 years. Will I be what I’ve always wanted? Will I get out of high school and become something people will like me for? Will I become like my dad and make chairs for a living? 

I have nowhere to talk to about my problems in life cause.. to be honest I’m scared to talk about these things cause then people are gonna think that I’m complaining about life when really they are just telling me how to live my own life which I don’t want to have a boss telling me how my life should go on...

If you took your time to read all this,
Thank you.

(Also just a note that my family isn’t abusive. They are really amazing but just have their own problems and all)

15,"Sup all. This post is kinda more for myself. Kinda just ranting/venting but if you decide to read thanks ig? Lol 

Mk so, socially has serious issues. Let’s start from the beginning/background. I grew up in an environment were being fat was praised and being skinny was seen as being bad. Well there goes 14 year old Dylan and dumbass thinks it’s a good idea to try to lose weight. HA my ass. It was a horrible idea. Well fast forward a couple of months/ years little 14 year old Dylan got bullied by his own family for even trying to lose weight. Little Dylan is me FYI.. anyway.. for years I fought against my family. Even though I’d at times get discouraged and went back to being fat I never stopped trying. 

Fast forward to last few weeks of high school, I was 158 at 5’11 I was skinny so eh.. I decided to step up my game and work towards a new goal which was get buff ish. Then again fast forward to a couple months after starting college I started weightlifting, at first it went by really slow but then I somehow started to make progress really fast. Not sure how or when it happened but it seems like from one day to the other progress started going faster. I’m currently 5’11 at 169. 

Anyway here’s where “society has issues” starts. Whenever someone even remotely mentions something even close to idfk people get all bitchy. Example: for me getting anywhere near defined, muscular arms (and more so in the short amount of time) has been somewhat of a “shock” one day I had fat arms the next muscle. So logically imma have some questions. Every single time I have mentioned anythingveven close to “muscle” on a reddit post it’s like nope I get hate/ignored lmao wtf people??? 

Society has issues 2.0
Any time I have made a post about how my family has made a conscious choice to stay fat while I decided to go completely in the other direction I’m AUTOMATICALLY a jackass . Why? Well because somehow it’s my fault that they decided to keep shoving food down their throats. Wtf??? Y’all r just salty I swear. 

Society has issues 3.0
Ok so. I have been called attractive, and “hot” on a few occasions throughout all of this. But somehow whenever I mention anything related to “attractive “ + me somehow I’m a narcissistic asshole. Ummm???? What????  

Society has issues 2.1 
Dude every time I make some kind of post in which I briefly talk about how I decided to go in the opposite direction from my family and talk about how they constantly eat and eat then eat some more and talk about how fat acceptance etc all of that is harmful to people’s own idfk mentality? Bodies? I’m somehow fat shaming people. Oh yes totally that’s what I’m doing -.- 

Conclusion: 
What I got from reddit from interacting with other people is that people just don’t like to be reminded of their failure. People project their insecurities onto other people and point fingers because it’s easy when you’re not face to face. 

I worked my ass day and night to have what I have right now. You have no fucking idea how much effort it took for me to get to the point I am and somehow you think it’s justified to call someone a jackass because they remind you of your failures? You have no one to blame but yourself for failing. You have all of the tools right in front of you to succeed in literally any goal you have and you choose to instead sit in front of the TV with a bowl of Doritos and blame others for you picking the life you have picked. 

Somehow we life in a society where it’s more acceptable to point fingers instead of doing something. It’s absolutely ridiculous. 

Just to tie things up, things I have done tog day where I am right now: 
- I fought the cravings for years. 
- I had the will power to fight against my family’s insults and constant put downs 
- I kept trying when If failed 
- I got off of my ass and did shit. 
Things I didn’t do include:
- I did NOT blame others for my decisions.
- I didn’t give excuses for my behavior 
- I didn’t cry myself to sleep when I failed 
- I didn’t give up. 
For fucks sake I came from the same genetic make up as the rest of my family. My genetics day I’m supposed to be “thick boned” or what ever you people like to call it. 

So for the real conclusion: 
I do love my muscles, I do love that I was strong enough to resist all of my family’s bullshit. And what I love most of all is being a constant reminder to my family about what they have tried so many times and failed at so many times. 

I’m proud of myself :) fuck haters.

19,"You know how a nice thing done done by a person you like, can feel icky from a person you don't... 

You know that face-palm moment when you want to tell a person to take the hint... 

I am the icky, face-palm inducing person. ... Desperate to know if my friend(?) Is ghosting me or if he really is just shit at returning messages. 

But look at the reason I SHOULD call him... 
We've always been the friendship that goes in fits, a week of hanging out then a year or so off... For 13 ish years. 

Here's the set up for my dramatic delema: 
3 years ago we spent a month hanging out a lot. He discussed his SO issues, I discussed my SO issues. During the course of our talks, it definitely felt like we were acknowledging that WE were not suited for each other, while possibly giving a nod to an interest... Though only in wordplay, and nothing at all serious. 

Later, we have a talk where he explicitly says I should be with my on-off SO (to whom I am now married to with child and domestic bliss...)

After this talk, I guess... (Because fuck me, I can't remember any other details...)
I dropped off the radar for a while. I'm pretty sure I checked in that I was engaged. And eventually that we had a kid...

So, a few months ago I see him on FB, realize I left our last nonsense conversation trailing... And decided to check in again. 
And after a month of trying to make a date to hang out, we did! And it was like old times. 
Except the casually thrown, bombshell statement about how he was there when I needed him and then I stopped talking and it's been 2+ years. ... To which I cooly said, he could have called me... 
Phone works both ways...

But now, I'm regretting because. ... 
(Cringe here)
Dispite our hanging out for hours, and saying he'd want to meet up before going out of town again (he travels for work) he hasn't answered any of my FB messages, 1 voice mail or 1 text.   And I mean, he hasn't even read my last 4 FB messages (I hate that I can tell)... 

Every message was casual, very ""how's it going""... But that was months ago! 

I want to talk! I want to check that he didn't feel abandoned or discarded! I want to beg for forgiveness if that is the case and tell him how much I value him. 

But maybe I'm just a blip, a practically inconsequential aquantance type friend who just doesn't require the effort. 

Or Maybe he was just as heart-achey as I once was about our total incompatibility and he resents me actually moving forward with my SO. 

Or maybe he's trying to prove to me that he really is an asshole (a label he has given himself like a badge of honor)

Or maybe our relationship was always about that precipice of if something more would happen, and now that it's not, it's not fun anymore. 

Hell, how do you ask a thing like that? 

I have always played it cool with him. Never asked too many questions or been demanding of reciprocation... It seemed like he perfered being aloof. 

But I am anxious, there's this giant question mark and I ... Just want us to be cool... 
I wish we could go back to talking with some amount of frequency... I miss his energy, our talks and long hang outs... And I feel guilty for potentially missing being an asset to him.

Fuck, can I just send him this rant? Does it ever work to just clear the air? 

What if I tell him I need him again, vague and enticing, to see if he'll respond. 

It's been 3 months since my last attempt to make contact..

I was thinking of waiting till his birthday, a typical day of saying hi... But if I am a source of stress I don't want to do that ... 

What do I say to fix this? Over what media? How do I know if he really is ghosting me, if we usually talk once a year?  I am not cool. It's hard pretending. 

I want to leave a VM, ""I feel like you're ghosting me, I really want to talk, please call me..."" and then if he doesn't respond, give up? Or is it overkill... Just be done already and avoid any further embarrassment?

I feel like a damn teenager. I hate interpersonal struggles... Good relationships can't be forced... 
But good relationships take effort... 

Fuck.",16Jun2018,1
20,"Ok so some back story:

I'm raised in an Islamic household but I guess its more 'cultural islam' than like strict islam. I go to a muslim school but otherwise islam isn't very heavily enforced upon me. In my school, we wear a hijab but once I got home I'd take it off when I was younger. 

So when I was 9 years old I decided to put the hijab on because I saw my cousins wearing it. My parents were initially against it. My mum never wore it and and they said that I'm too young and it makes me look 'too arab'.  But I was adamant and they eventually gave in.

After a while my dad became very proud of me and he'd tell his family overseas about me wearing a hijab. Once I became 12, I became very religious and prayed 5 times a day and did all that shit because I was told that that's when my deeds start counting so if  i don't and i die, i will go to hell. This eventually took a toll on me because I thought that any action I do will result in me going to hell. Although I used to question my teachers at school constantly about islam, I used to still believe because they gave me bullshit answers like 'god knows best' or 'we will find out in due time' or something. But when I was 13 I started thinking about it more and when I became 14, I decided that religion was bullshit and all my doubts were valid and not stupid (philosophy helped because I realised all the stupid questions that I asked were actually questions that people spend years questioning).

Now I'm 15, and I decided that i want to remove my scarf because I feel like it isn't part of my identity anymore but I don't want to make my dad sad. He is so proud and I guess I don't want to hurt him. My mum won't really care but my dad might start asking questions like why I'm doing it and stuff but he'll get over it in a few days.

Even when I do take my scarf off, I'm not going to be going out that often because I basically stay in my room 24/7 but because I wore a hijab for so long, I don't know how to wear my hair. And it doesn't help that i cut my hair really short because I thought that well know one sees my hair so there's no point of keeping my hair long.

**tl;dr I want to tell my dad that I don't want to wear a scarf and I know he'll get over it but I am nervous and don't know how to start the conversation**",16Jun2018,4
21,"I get called kind quite often, usually because I’ll do someone a favour and not expect anything in return but recently I’ve started to worry about my character as a whole.

I kind of realised yesterday that although I’m nice to lots of people, this niceness is derived from my extreme desire to have people like me, not from my love for other people. I think I do nice things for the validation I receive and I wish that wasn’t the case. I guess what I’m asking is how can I have more love for other people and be kind out of my gratitude for someone being a friend or being part of my life? I just worry that I’m not empathetic enough and that everything I do is driven primarily through my own self interest. Any replies are appreciated and have a great day! :)",16Jun2018,2
22,"The problem with Reddit is that it’s a democracy, meaning 1 user = 1 upvote. This leads to bad advice which sounds good being upvoted, while uncomfortable and direct truths being viciously downvoted. It took me a while to adjust to this system, and now instead of fighting it I embrace it. 

For example, I once wrote a post about personal finance where I made the bold and controversial claim that you can increase your net worth not by increasing your income but by decreasing your expenses. For example, if your income was $50,000/yr and your expenses were $40,000/yr, your net worth by the end of the year would be **$10,000**. Now compare this to a scenario where your income was $50,000/yr and your expenses were $20,000, your net worth by the end of the year would not be $10,000, it’d be **$30,000**. Thus illustrates the fact you can maintain the same exact income and increase your net worth just by focusing all your efforts on cutting expenses and spending as little as possible.

This did not go over well with a group of people who is so enthusiastic on getting rich and increasing their net worth by making it big with a larger income. It was revolutionary for me to introduce the concept that it’s spending, not income, which should be focused on in order to boost net worth. Everyone hated it, lashed out at me, and demanded I delete my post. But through it all I didn’t get offended, instead accepting the feedback to my presentation and writing explanations, not to the content itself.

Through the haters, the fighters, and the trolls, I better my communication skills and understand how to take what I know and present it in a form which is helpful and useful to others.",16Jun2018,0

* aloofness

* numbness of emotions

* lack of care towards people

* a feeling that I'm ""acting"" normal rather than being it

* way too self-conscious at times

* a significant decrease in will-power and more screen-time

* preferring to be the listener in a conversation (if that makes any sense)

26,"(This is a repost from r/SelfImprovement because it seems like the sub there is a lot less responsive to posts)

I've always have had this extreme unwillingness to do work or even basic things with any connotation to them that I might not like, things such as replying to serious messages or emails, school work, or even private projects of mine like making Youtube videos or language learning.

I've always had this extremely bad work attitude in life where I would work on something and at the slight encounter of an issue or problem that stops my progress, I stop and don't ever want to keep working on that thing ever again. Some might call it procrastination, but at least procrastination comes with the intent of returning back to what one is doing. Me, I rarely ever want to even do work in the first place.

I'm not saying that I never ever want to do work ever anymore in my life, but my current issue is that I find myself unable to even want to work on the stuff to help me get into the industry I want to get into, and I haven't even started working on my portfolio since graduation which is very important for the kind of jobs I'm pursuing.

I'm currently on holiday since graduation and I currently have almost a few months of free time before being drafted into the military where I will serve for 2 years and come out back into the workforce where I'm expected to find a job or get into a university.

I told myself I wanted to spend this time to improve myself and do things like creating Youtube videos or improving my 3D modeling skills and even considered using websites such a Skillshare to better my 3D graphics, editing and motion graphics skills. But as of right now, I can't even get myself to write a script of a Youtube video before getting put off after writing one sentence and going off to watch Youtube videos made by other people or going back to playing video games for the rest of the day without even coming back to commit to my work.

I know that sometimes I can be doing work if I'm really forced to or if something happened that really gave me a wake-up call that also forces me to be hard working for a while until I slip back to being lazy and unproductive again.

It's not only things like work, even things like duties and responsibilities get me extremely put off from doing them, till it gets to the point of me letting other people down, things such as responding to important messages asking me if I'm showing up for an event, or even meeting a freelance designer who could potentially get me networked into a job however not contacting him yet always gets me dreaded into doing them and I only respond to them really late once they're annoyed and angry at me for not taking responsibility.

I don't know how to break out of this shitty attitude and I don't even know if I truly want to change, maybe this is just procrastination taking place in the highest form or its just plain laziness, perhaps finding this subreddit and seeking help might be a changing point. I don't know if you guys have been and felt the same way as I do, I really do hope maybe after posting this I might be able to change for the better.

27,"So , I'm doing good in my life. Learning driving and hitting the gym but lately I have been feeling a Lacunae in my life. This lacunae came into being after a relative mentioned my best friend who saved my life from suicide and asked her where abouts. 7 or so months ago, we had our last call and then texted daily. But after some weird-shittery and I going almost crazy behind an online gf and crying after her telling me to fof, I thought that she ain't a good friend and thus ended it. Now I want her back in my life.  The best girl I met (NO crush though) and a really lively person. The only contact I have with her is on instagram where I follow her,she does not follow me back. I cannot move on. I really don't know how to apologise to her for my crazy behaviour she had to always put up with and the last time I begged her to come back in my life was 6 months ago. Not a needy guy, can do without her. But with her, it would be more worthy living. Please help me!

I'm keeping my responses dry because as soon as I could tell she was flirting in my head I'm running through the logistics of the ""after the show"" which was going to be ""pay for a hotel + lose sleep + be more fatigued than I want to be the rest of the weekend for having to stay up late giving good sex (because if you half ass it what's the point)"", I'm not in the mood for it so I'm giving the dryest responses I can think of hoping she'll take the hint, but she just keeps leaning in closer and pressing harder (which turns into blatant come-on remarks from her) probably because she knows what I'm doing and is frustrated/angry/disappointed by it.

And that's what ruined my mood really, it seems like every single time a woman expresses interest (especially if they're attractive because of course they know they are) you aren't allowed to not be interested.  I ended up having to look her in the eye and very sternly say ""I'm only here to watch the band play"", which made me feel like a massive jerk (even if I knew what she was doing it's still nature and it doesn't make me feel good to be like that), which got her to stop talking but she stood there for a minute before she left (assuming to a different part of the floor).

The show ended up being only decent and overall the whole thing has turned into one of these sour ""why did I even bother going out"" things, since the show was only decent and now I have this crappy leftover feeling in me still from preferring I could have gone out and been invisible to just leave being disappointed by a band being only decent instead of being reminded of some bitter people crap.

30,"So, I was at a casual event that featured an open buffet. With this, I had a desire to try everything (even though some of it somewhat conflicted with my values and was similar to what I ate earlier in the day). So, I filled my plate (it was just a standard paper plate, so it's not like it was even that much) to enjoy my meal. When I was walking with my plate to my seat, everyone I interacted with, from my friend, to the person I was sitting next to, to the leader of the event made casual comments on the food I grabbed such as ""have you eaten this week"" ""look at you filling up your plate"" and ""you must have the appetite of a teenager."" This made me self-conscious and partially made me consider throwing my entire plate in the garbage. Honestly, all the food seemed really good, and I wanted to try everything. Plus, with my schedule, eating habits and how my body functions, it's easier and I prefer to eat fewer but larger meals compared to many smaller meals.

36,"I have been talking with several students and watched many commentaries from youtube and other platforms.

I want to share to you other's students perspectives, starting from FlyingMonkies325 (youtube) that said:

&gt;""As someone who's a victim of the system too and that it's hugely failed who went through nothing but **bullying** and **alienation** from both teachers and students even the odd teacher **encouraging** other students to bully and alienate me to use me as an example to make the other people scared of fighting back and asking questions using fear as a way to some how ""motivate"" and oppress them and being nothing but punished for being quite an Observant and Analytical Thinker for being intelligent i understand exactly what it's like and it's **disgusting**, **cruel** and it does nothing but **wastes**peoples time and energy it grinds people SO far down in themselves that they're willing to just accept anything even treated horribly at work just to have money but even if you try to get some where better you won't... i **spent** 5 and a half years in college courses and i wish i cut it short at 4 and a half because the bullying and alienation got MUCH worse, the demeaning, demoralizing, degrading behavior got worse, how much people ground me down got worse and i just had to stop and pull myself **outta** **there** for good.  
I severely **suffered** at the hands of the Education System but the System in general because it doesn't want to give people a chance, it **doesn't want people to succeed** because the government are too scared of **competition** but they aren't too smart themselves if they think they are when they only destroy our planet for their own selfish benefits and now at 27 i still don't have the **skills** or **experience** i may need to do anything other than work as a pot washer, cleaner, waitress or in some supermarket or café like most people, now i'm playing catch up and on my own i can tailor my own learning experience to how i think, to what i'm interested in and help hone my Observant and Analytical mind, i just simply search things up here on YouTube that i want to know and i can learn more in 5 months that i EVER could in 5 and a half years spent at some college that just all about making money. I don't pay for online courses or anything because it's still very one-size-fits-all and that's just NOT working and on size DOES NOT fit all... and it's one of the things that forces people to just work for money in whatever job they can even get not to be in a job they love to do.  
Indeed it's oppression of ANY kind of original or independent thought because it's just like **""do what your told""** even when you knew deep down even in high school that what we were given to do was **pointless** and isn't **realistic**, it doesn't teach us anything **valuable** for our Adult Life yet the government still expects us to work? yet they mess up peoples minds by getting schools and college to claim they are preparing us for our Adult Life that they're teaching us skills for work... but they do no such thing... even the environment they make us work in giving us work sheets and assessments THAT'S not how a job is... we don't sit at some desk copying things down or answer questions that don't mean a thing and it's certainly not all just constant power point presentations every single day like... HOW is that going to help anybody? it's not...  
One thing that makes me the most sick is how they **profit** from all of this, they profit even from people with Disabilities, Mental Health Issues and Learning Difficulties but they try to **convince** whoever they possibly can that they have Learning Difficulties just think of how many people are walking around convinced they have some sort of **Learning Difficulty**? you can imagine they tried to do it with me quite a few times ""I think you have a Learning Difficulty, i just don't know what..."", don't know what? are you serious? lol more like ""You're a **threat** to my job and the government"", they're trying to make me think i'm stupid and there's **something wrong with me**, i hope that every person out there ever convinced of this re-evaluates what teachers and lecturers told them and same for parents and they convince parents of their kids ""Learning Difficulty"" in order to **oppress them through their own parents** and that's disgusting... they tried to that with my parents too.  
I feel so much fury, anger, disgust and resentment towards the System and the thought of them doing to other what they did to me infuriates, disgusts and upsets me, **best way to go is home schooling until 16** then find some apprenticeship in the hopes your kids can get a better start and it's the reason why people who drop out of high school do better because they didn't waste time on high school they just went straight into learning in their chosen industry, more and more teens drop out of high school these days and it's just like... What is the point of the Education System if they aren't really doing anything?.?

# Second comment

&gt;How can we create a better Education System? well as you said first off teach people in the way **THEY THINK and PERCIEVE** things, let them work at the **speed THEY work** because we all get things at different paces, let them **focus**their time on only **specific** areas that THEY KNOW are more adept and experiment and discover **WHO THEY REALLY ARE** not who we're **told to me**... i got a taste of what that's like in the primary school i went to many years ago... and even if i was still forced to do things i didn't want to nor was i good at, to do **silly** work sheets and tests they still encouraged me in the things i was good at especially **creative** things like arts and crafts and singing, reading and they tried to hone my **natural** observant and Analytical mind as best they could, during reading and spelling they rotated us out of class within a group of 4 or 5 with a Support Worker the didn't just use Support Workers to babysit people with Disabilities but really utilized them to help each of us with our learning and i wouldn't be able to even type all this now if it wasn't for them...  
Now? i'm not happy doing things any other way and even if my **parents as blind as they** too were put me through a lot and then i put myself in harms way i can always rely on the Mastry Based Learning in the Primary School i was in and that's the way that Khan Academy teaches and it's been known to be successful with most people because it certainly **doesn't force us** on deadlines it just lets us take our time and i tried it for Maths because i was never good at it and it just doesn't take in my mind, i still managed to get through dozens of questions and being given the chance to practice i got them all right, would i be able to do that in any High School or College? noop... not with any subject.  
The system is very rigid and uses **oppresion** to stop anyone from even learning in such a way and that's the first issue we have to get passed but in my mind schools don't work not really... because learning is a **life long thing** it's not a 1 - 5 year thing and then it's over... i think it's unrealisitc to what life really is and we're ever growing, ever changing but if they DO keep schools then it needs to **change** even in not confining people to 1 building but allow people to have that **support any where**.?""

These were the two commentaries.

Seeing students passing though what i did disgusts me...

I will continue posting more about the perspective of other students i come in the way.

45,"In January of 2015, I met a guy who knocked me off my feet. He had a smile like a Colgate model, a laugh like you'd find on /r/contagiouslaughter, a sense of humor that was just as charming as some guy off some romantic comedy movie. 

He was also a motherfucking mess. Alcoholic, DUIs, bad temper, always drama in his life. But damn, was he charming. We dated for two years, took a break, dated another three months. I knew he was a POS, but that charm just kept me going back. We broke up for the last time right after Christmas this past year, and I've healed a lot, dated a little, gotten some butterflies here and there, worked on myself. It's been a good six months, no contact with ex asshole. 

So today I get a text from a number I don't recognize. 

Unknown: Hey, is this /u/UpvotingSince2010?

Me: Who's this? 

U: This is (Name). Do you know (Asshole)? 

Me: Yes, why? 

U: Did you date him last year? 

Me: I'm not comfortable answering any more questions. Sorry. 

U: I just had some questions for you. I was pregnant with his child when you guys were together. I probably have some answers you were looking for. 

Me: Why did you contact me? 

I then got sick of texting and just called. Something weird was happening. 

Turns out, this lady is fighting to get full custody without parental rights to (Asshole). He's still an alcoholic, still has rage problems, and she doesn't feel comfortable letting this guy in her child's life. 

I tell her he also got pregnant, told me he would leave me if I didn't get an abortion, and then left me anyway. We come to realize our due dates were two weeks apart from one another. What an asshole right? 

It gets jucier. 

This lady has somehow managed to do recon on Asshole and has contacted FOUR different women who she (rightfully) suspected he was with around the same time frame. He was with her four five years, me for two years plus six months, another girl for a year, another for two, another for four. Most overlapping with one another.  

And things started to make so much sense. He wasn't stressed about work. He wasn't too busy with his family. He wasn't too busy with this or that or the other. He was a master serial cheater, and while we all had suspicions, he was so good at keeping it under wraps, none of us ever had any concrete proof. 

Master manipulator. 

She's asking for our help in building her case to get full custody. Four of us get on a conference call and we're talking, sharing war stories, sharing stories with each other that the other person had more information on (he wasn't in Florida that weekend, he was with me!), talking about his bullshit, his lies, his downright trash. 

None of us really know if we can help her in her case, and if we can't, that's fine. But all of us had such a good time together on that call, and we're all going out for drinks (except one, who lives out of state) next week. 

It's not about ""Let's bring that asshole down,"" but I think I might have just made a bunch of new friends, and we all have a common story: we all got hurt by that asshole. 

I guess this may be the seedlings that sprout after a forest fire. ",16Jun2018,83

48,"Hello I (19 M) am a newly out panromantic demisexual with really bad social anxiety and I’m struggling to find people to chat with. I dont have very many LGBT+ friends, nor people who I’m comfortable discussing things LGBT+ related with. So I created a groupme for other LGBT+ people who may be in the same boat as me, or for other LGBT+ people who just like to chat. 

You're invited to my new group 'LGBT+ Friends' on GroupMe. Click here to join: https://groupme.com/join_group/41400909/a4gTBm",16Jun2018,1
49,"After living with waist-length hair for over a year, I’m proud to say that I got the wonderful opportunity to cut my hair again! 

It feels really good to have shoulder length hair (seriously, my head feels lighter), and I can now enjoy some simple tasks without having to wear my hair up. Now, it’ll also take less time to style. The best part is that someone out there will hopefully enjoy the donated hair :) ",16Jun2018,7
51,"For anyone with Father or Mother Issues I share this correspondence with a young friend:
My father was a hard ass strict person. I was his nightmare. I could never do anything right. No matter what I did it was not enough. He prided himself on never making the same mistake twice. A strict perfectionist that I could not please. Yet, I ended up happy.
How did I manage that? Because I learned not to look to others for my happiness. I realized that the source of happiness for me was me. I came to understand that other people are not the cause of my feelings and reactions. I am.
I am. I choose happiness.",16Jun2018,782
