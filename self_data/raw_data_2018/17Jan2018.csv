-You look so good in that dress like a bombshell 

-You look so beautiful -You look so fucking. . . uh never mind (while i was sitting right there) 

-(over text) Hey, don't tell 'my name' this, but you just have one of those asses. 

-(late at night via text) Do girls masturbate? (clearly he knows the answer and what does he think he'd get out of asking his friends girl friend? 

-Openly talking about masturbation and stuff that makes he uncomfortable 

-Are those knew pants, you look so good in them 

-Many times messaging her and saying she looked beautiful that day, etc.


And on top of this get this, he's told me that for about 5-6 seconds, while masturbating, my girlfriend has popped into his head.

This kid is a good friend of mine (over many years), aside from all this, great guy, but i wanna fucking punch this kid in the throat. He's crossed the boundaries on many occasions and makes both of us very uncomfortable. He does this with no other girls and I wanna tell him to stop (don't think I'm a pussy cause im gonna), but just don't know how to go about it.

Please help before I fucking knock him on his ass.

2,"You never really think to ask that during the day, and it never evokes the same response as it does when you're actually dreaming.

But you know how, when you dream, you're not really thinking in a linear pattern, it's more like a big uhh... a constant stream of situations you end up in, laid on top of each other? I can't describe this well, but you're one place and you instantly appear in another. You suddenly jump between perspectives, like a movie, with different shots all the time. 

But in a sense, isn't the waking mind like that, too? You have different thoughts, also laid on top of each other, also jumping between perspectives, and the only thing keeping this dream more real is that your senses stay so consistent with what's around you, and they are so interrelated. When you feel intense pain in your arm, you look down and it's cut or broken, or maybe you just heard the sound of it hitting something, and your vision matches up to that. 

That's what makes a dream a dream, right? That inconsistency. You have to be really paying attention to notice that the segue-ways are artificial. 

I wonder if you would notice if life just started playing a dream while you were awake. 

I used to wonder why Schizophrenia so commonly accompanies a lack of awareness that the person is hallucinating, which you would think would be pretty obvious. ",17Jan2018,3

Can anyone provide some insight as to why they’re requiring I provide one? I never chose to resign, I got no help from the company I had worked at as a student to find full time employment.

This is the twitch chat during the finale of Twitch Plays Pokemon, which attracted thousands upon thousands of people and introduced the site to many.

It's so weird to see so much text and only a handful of emotes here and there. If this were to take place now, you'd see tons and tons of PogChamp, monkaS, NotLikeThis, LUL, WutFace and more. However, back then, many people (including me) didn't use emotes that much and instead used actual words. 

As expected, there's a lot of ""YES"", ""OHHHH"", ""YAY"", ""NOOOOO"", ""OMG"" and the like instead of emotes. I don't know why I find it so fascinating, but I guess after years of being used to the emote-heavy nature of twitch chat, it's jarring to see such a super populated, super fast twitch chat with about 90% text.

So basically, I was driving to a supermarket half an hour ago (around 10pm) and pulled up at the traffic lights. I didn't notice initially but on my right was a car filled with a bunch of hot young sluts. 

My car window was rolled slightly down due to heat, and one of them said ""Heeeyy"" in a fun, seductive way. When I looked and noticed them, I instinctively said hey back, though in a low voice, and turned my head back to the road ahead. I think I got intimidated and was surprised, so didn't know how to act.

Then, when the lights went green, they followed me by my side for a bit until they realised I wasn't really interacting with them, then laid off a bit. I would have liked to interact, but I was feeling real awkward, and they just took me by surprise   :(

He told me that him and his fiance are on the rocks, and have been for a while. She had some sort of illness a while back, and my co worker helped financially as much as he could. She's now working, but he still helps pay for her cell phone, amongst other things.

He told me he deals with anxiety (I do too), and the fiance combined with a couple of others things are really getting to him where he definitely seems depressed or down.

They haven't slept in the same bedroom for a bit of time (not sure how long), and about 3 weeks ago her sister moved in temporarily because she is coming form out of state. So, now he has his ""fiance"" there, and her sister. 

He said he got into a small argument with the lady, and she told him to leave her area. He didn't right away, so she I guess pushed him away to the point where he definitely has some scratch marks on him.

Basically, I told him that he needs to separate himself from her for the time being. I said that he needs to give her an ultimatum regarding their relationship. They aren't even married, and they aren't sleeping in the same room due to differences. What happens if they do happen to get married?

Throwaway.

This is a crazy story I know, but it's true, and I would never dare tell anyone in real life.

I am a huge geek in college. 4.0, Dean's List calculus geek. I'm a 22 year old senior. Still a virgin (blush). I'm kind of known as being a ""know-it-all"", and one day I made fun of my friend Ashley's pronunciation in front of some guy she really liked, and both the guy, and all our friends, laughed hysterically.

Little did I know, I would eventually pay for it.

I really, badly needed a job to pay tuition during my last semester. I saw a listing for a desk clerk position at a resort that perfectly worked with my schedule, and found out it paid twice as much as any in the area.

I got there and found it was a NUDIST resort. And that even employees had to respect the dress code...

This is insane to me. I am a total geek. I never even take my shirt off with friends at the beach. Just the thought of standing there all day...exposed...just at the mercy of nature...made me blush red.

I am about 5'7, a bit of a ""Studies While Eating Doritos"" belly. A surprisingly big, ROUND bubble butt behind me that my friend Ashley always teases I'm ""hiding"" under my ""nerdy khakis"" and not exactly the biggest package in the world (Hey, it's a throwaway!). Plus I was lily-white from the neck down.

The idea terrified me, but in the end...the money won out. And I actually worked a full semester as naked as a jaybird, wearing nothing but my glasses. I would just tell myself, hey, my bottom half is hidden by the desk!

I only told my friend Ashley because she was out of state with her longterm boyfriend, and she thought it was hilarious of course. But I only told her the type of resort, never told her the name or where it was. It's even very discreet to look up on Google.

Finally, one day I absentmindedly thought I was sending an email about a shipment, but I CC'd Ashley on an email that had the address.

Guess who showed up giggling mid-shift in the early afternoon while I was blushing and bare-assed naked behind my front desk?

""Hehehe are you really NAKED behind there? Like you have NOTHING on?! hehehe""

""Oh my God, you're actually getting tanned!""

""Do you have a fig leaf, at least? hehehe""

At one point I was distracted by another guest (40 year old woman), and Ashley snuck behind my counter, grabbed my neatly folded pile of clothes (even my sneakers and socks!) and said ""Have a nice ride home, nature boy!"" and SPANKED my bare butt as hard as she could as the guest laughed and Ashley ran out of there holding almost LITERALLY everything I had.

I started to chase wearing nothing but a blush on my face and a hand on my package (she turned around and got quite a laugh out of THAT image) but I chickened out about running through the parking lot in my birthday suit in broad daylight. Plus, what if she had her cameraphone in her car? (Cameras and/or phones aren't allowed to get into the front entrance)

Anxiously, I stood at the front entrance, naked and helpless, hiding my bottom half behind the front door and poking my head out, nervously waiting for her to walk back up laughing and give me my stuff back.

As I waited, the female guest said ""She got ya good across both of those cheeks, honey! And it looks like you're drivin' home NEKKID tonight! hahaha""

I faked a laugh, and stood there bare waiting for the relief of my friend returning my clothing.

Suddenly, I hear an engine roar, and there went Ashley speeding off in her car past me yelling ""WOOOOO!!!"" while swinging my boxers in a circle like a victory flag out of her car window. She then tossed my car keys out of the window and onto the pavement.

I just watched her drive off, with my package exposed in the cool air conditioning, and my bare butt-cheeks still stinging from her admittedly hard slap a few moments ago. She didn't just have my clothes. She had my phone, my wallet, my money and my ID!!!

I just sheepishly scampered out into the bright sunshine to grab my car keys and run back inside before any incoming guests got an eyeful.

At least I knew I had, at the very least, a towel in my car and an extra pair of sneakers to wear on the ride back.

Feeling even more naked than usual the rest of my shift, finally we were closing for the night, and I when I got to my car I saw that, to my horror, Ashley went in there and cleaned it out.

No towels. No clothing. Nothing. Not a garbage bag. She even took the freaking floor mats out.

Since I lived very close by, only about a 5 minute drive, I actually took a deep breath and got into my car and actually had to drive home naked and blushing. Ever drive a car with bare feet? Simply awful. And then I had to slump down nervously in the front seat when someone pulled up next to me at a red light!

Luckily, she left my belongings in my mailbox, but not a stitch of clothes. She mailed them to me later to make sure I had to make the naked walk of shame into my house!

I had to exit the car, run butt-naked across my front lawn, past the front of my house, get my bare butt through the gate and get into the backdoor.

I was the victim of the ultimate prank!",17Jan2018,3
43,"This is dumb stuff, but I'm having a bad day and I need someone to tell me if I am actually worth something as a person. So this is basically going to be a long, somewhat rambling post about my situation, with an attempt to put as little negative emotion into it as I can. If you're not cool with that, don't read. Otherwise I'll take opinions and questions, because I need help and someone to listen to me for once.

I'm 27, white, overweight with a full unkempt beard. I don't like to think of myself that way, but I am your typical neckbeard guy - fat, dirty, smelly, alone. I've tried to change and lose weight, keep shaved, etc., but I always fall back to normal because there is never enough positive stuff that comes from it. Of course, I've got a host of mental issues including depression and anxiety, and probably more I'm not aware of. Not even mentioning the physical problems, though at face-value it's mostly just the obesity. I try and carry myself well enough that it doesn't impact my day-to-day life, but it still does some. At least I don't waddle! And aside from the weight, I think I could be fairly attractive. At least a 7.

I've got two jobs, so don't have a lot of free time, but when I do have some I don't do anything with it. And I don't mean any productive stuff, I just sit on my computer and refresh the front page of reddit, look at youtube, and maybe mess around with some D&amp;D stuff. Which actually is the only social thing I do, play D&amp;D on Tuesdays with work friends. It's only been going on for a few months now, but it's the most fun I've had in years when it happens. But that and work are my only social outlets, and I don't interact with friends outside of those two things. As for trying to do other things on my own, I don't. I can't find enough interest in doing other stuff enough to go out. I could go to a bar, but why, I don't drink and wouldn't fit in. I don't walk, so park is out. Everything, even stuff I do enjoy like video games and graphic design and programming, it's all just...blah to me. I don't have enough interest in things to push myself to do them, when I could just sit here and sleep or whatever.

I had a late start on a lot of stuff. Childhood life was never good, for various reasons that boil down to my mother was a psychopath and my father overworked. I failed school, had to get a GED. Didn't learn to drive until I was 24, didn't get a car until 25, didn't leave home until almost 26. Didn't have sex or a first kiss until 26 either.

Which speaking of, relationships has to be touched on. It's one of the main reasons I'm writing this, since I don't feel like I'm worthy of another person. Because of the late start, I feel like I'm damaged, and the people I'm attracted to, other guys who are pretty much my opposite, aren't attracted to me. I have had sex, but only a few times and I'm pretty inexperienced and unconfident. It was awkward for a lot of reasons the first few times, then I found someone I'm really into and a lot of the awkwardness went away, but then we stopped seeing each other for reasons. I don't really want sex anyway, at least not as the focus. I don't know if it's cliche or not, but I don't feel comfortable with a relationship based purely on sex, I want the comfort of another person - in and out of bed - more than to just get my rocks off. But I'm also far too unconfident to try and get that sort of relationship, because I feel worthless and like I wouldn't contribute much to the other person as much as I would take away from them.

44,"Not really suicidal or anything, but I think this is one of the days that I feel melancholic or have existential questions on what's the point of living. Like..there's no value? I guess it started when my co-workers were talking about 401k savings wanting to retire early. I don't understand. I max out my 401k, my roth IRA, and I'm still saving money on the side. But I'm getting the feeling like...why am I saving so much when I can do things now? My co-workers were saying they want to retire early or with enough money, but I feel like I can already feel that I'm getting older in my bones. I can't really imagine how I will feel once I'm in my 60s. I just..honestly don't know _what_ to do.

Also, I don't think I have an obsession with saving money. I just don't know what to spend it on. I feel like I have everything I need and more ever since I started de-cluttering things that I don't care for. I just feel a little aimless. I tried travelling, and I realized I did not enjoy it. I flew to a every weekend to a different city for a month and a half before I took a one week vacation and then a two week vacation. In my heart, I don't see the joy of travelling. It's actually a little stressful to me, but people say they want to retire and travel the world. I guess it feels like there's something wrong with me. 

Also, People are telling me that everything will change when I have kids, but. I'm 26, and I don't even think about wanting to find someone to marry or have kids. I don't even know if I want kids? If it happens, it happens, but. I'm not really making a conscious effort. Sigh.

Basically, it feels like I'm just doing nothing with my life, even though I have my own place, a good-paying job, have a social life, and I'm healthy. I volunteer my time, and I have my fair share of relaxation, but am I missing something?

I did feel like when I first bought my place, my goal was to fix it up. It's fixed up now. It was fun while it lasted, but I'm not sure if I would want to go through with that again. Next thing was decorating it until it's cute. I feel like..that's done and now what? I also have like...small goals that can easily be fulfilled. I complete them, and I get gratification for a bit.

I heard that some of them hung out yesterday, and I felt horrible that I wasn't there. Even though I was getting drinks with some other people. If I think realistically, it's not like I would rather have stayed at home. But I still hate that I couldn't be there and meet them like that. 
I would say I am pretty good with keeping myself busy. Of course I need my downtime sometimes and stay at home to rest a bit. But of course, other people are doing something fun during that time. And even though I would actually rather just lay on the couch and watch netflix. I still have that need to be there with them. 
The two steps that I have already taken to deal with this problem a bit, are that I no longer look at stuff like snapchat and instagram stories. This way I get confronted less with what others are doing. And forcing myself to be alone sometimes. Which still leads to quite a bit of actual anxiety.
I hope someone has some tips on how to deal with this feeling. Thanks for reading:)",17Jan2018,1

48,"I hate that I care about other people so much. 

I came to college and made one good friend and barely any others. We got along great and hung out all the time. Then she meets 3 other girls and suddenly puts me on the back burner. As hurt as I was, I knew I couldn't expect her to invite me everywhere or to make her include me.

I finally meet her other friends. They seem nice enough, but I don't see myself becoming close with them ever. As weeks go by, they repeatedly leave my friend out, ditch her, etc. Each time she rants to me about their behavior and each time I make sure I'm there for her. 

Then, next thing I know she's ditching our plans to go to dinner last second to go out to eat with them instead. I get pissed and upset, but ultimately forgive her. 

A couple days later, she's upset once again because they don't invite her somewhere. I make plans with new friends and she complains to me that she has nothing to do. I invite her along because I feel bad. Then lo and behold, she ditches me and these new people mid-plans because the other three suddenly want to be her friend again. 

I'm so so sick of being the second choice. And letting her treat me as a second choice. I hate that I care too much about people that don't give a shit about me. The beginning of college, she isolated me and wanted to be bffs until a better option came along. Now, I'm struggling to make real friends bc I allowed myself to be isolated in the beginning. I keep letting her hurt me and I hate myself for it.
