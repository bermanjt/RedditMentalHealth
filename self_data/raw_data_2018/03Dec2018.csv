0,"all my life i have never had to work for anything. it was simply given to me without question. i come from an extremely wealthy family and my parents have lots of pull within my province. i am also very good looking. being wealthy and good looking may not sound like problems to most, but they have become problems for me. i use my looks and my money to get whatever i want. admission to university, jobs, friends and women. i have become so cold and calculated with people. i feel no true love for anyone, not even my mother. i see people as objects. i do not care for the next man or women or child for that matter. any women i am with i pick apart. the smallest physical imperfection becomes all i can see in that girl.  i care for no one truly but myself. as i get older, now twenty three, i have found my way of life unhappy. i want to care for people, i want to work for what i have, and i want to know how to truly love a women. i just don't know where to start.

1,"I am a freshman geek in college. About 5'7. ""Studies while eating Doritos"" Freshman 15 belly.

I have been playing poker for years. Always known as the best among my friends.

This weekend, a cute, very tall senior girl (maybe 5'11? Possibly 6'0?) stumbled into our small party. She heard me brag about how I've won 11 tournaments in a row.

She challenged me to a heads-up game. I said sure, let's do it.

Only 30 minutes later, she took every penny I had. $330. Which was my textbook money. I asked for a shot to win it back.

She said ""Well, I already have all your money. How about your clothes? But when I take those little panties too, you go home without them.""

That admittedly intimidated me a little, but maybe she liked me and this was a chance to finally get laid.

30 minutes later, I handed her my boxers, which she swung around her head yelling ""WOOOO!""

I was as naked as a newborn baby.

Totally untanned from the neck down as everyone giggled to their ultimate amusement.

""Finders keepers, losers weepers"" she said as I shuffled to the door wearing nothing but my glasses and a pink blush on my face, pathetically covering my package with my hands.

Towering over me from behind, she said ""Now RUN HOME, BIRTHDAY SUIT BOYYYY!"" and leaned back and SMACKED my round, plump white bubble butt and I gasped, let out a yelp of pain, and ran through the door, gasping as my bald buttcheeks felt the 35 degree weather, down the steps, across the quad, and across the football field, 2 miles back to my dorm, as naked as the day I was pulled screaming from my mother. Hiding behind dumpsters and trees the whole way. Desperately clutching my little dorm key-card in my hand.

I was caught on security camera running buck naked into my dorm and kicked out of my dorm. Now I have to commute from home.

I didn't have the heart to tell my parents the real reason, so I pretended it was excessive drinking. Which really pissed them off.

tl;dr thought I was the best at poker, got sent running home naked in 30 minutes",03Dec2018,1

* Having friends,
* Hanging out with anybody,
* Study groups,
* Parties, or sleepovers
* Smoking pot 
* Having a relationship,
* Dating,
* First kiss or even holding hands with anybody

I 'm looking at the world from the outside. Because I'm too scared to interact with people.. Because nobody wants to interact with me either so I never get the chance. And people tell me 21 is young but no.. I'm an adult right now. I just wasted all of my teenage years never getting the chance to do normal things that teenagers do. How am I supposed to live the life I want if I'm too scared to start talking to someone, something that everybody else can do easily??

I was really ecstatic and then you just gave the whole order to me for free. 

It probably wasn't a big deal. You just wanted to keep a customer happy for the inconvenience.  But honestly, it meant a lot. I'm trying to get better at budgeting and probably shouldn't have been out buying fast food anyways, but I didn't get a chance to go grocery shopping.

5,"I’ve only told my spouse very limited details, because I’m terrified to open up about this. I’m almost 30. Currently on depression and anxiety meds and trying to find a new therapist after mine left town. Never officially diagnosed on paper, but was told I most likely have PTSD, dissociative anxiety disorder, and depression. 

I’ve been hearing/seeing things since I was around 12/13. It started as hearing people call my name, seeing an animal run across the street that wasn’t there, little things. Over the years, it has progressed to seeing and hearing people or creatures. For example, I was waiting in the car while my spouse ran into the store and I saw a man put his hands around his eyes and look into the back window - like he was looking into my car. I was scared and even more scared when my spouse walked out and told me there was nobody there. I’ve been seeing what I refer to as “the cape” for about a year. It’s always peripheral and whenever I look at it, it drops. It’s basically a 10-20 foot wide black cape with a hood that is always unrealistically far off the ground. It’s kind of like a dementor from Harry Potter, but whenever I look directly at it, the cape falls to the ground and disappears - like the thing knows I saw it. Same concept as the ghost from Mario, basically. The most frightening one was when I went to the kitchen to get a drink around midnight. I heard really quick footsteps and saw a woman like creature coming at me on all fours like some human/spider hybrid. When it got to me and tried to get me it disappeared. 

Nobody knows because I don’t want to be schizophrenic. I feel like my other issues are relatively common and accepted. Schizophrenia is like cancer. People treat you differently. They’re afraid of you. I’ve researched it and watched hours of videos made by schizophrenics explaining their experiences and it seems awful. I’m also afraid of being put on some intense psych meds or something. 

I just don’t know what to do. Anyone have experience with schizophrenia? Or have advice? ",03Dec2018,1
6,"I made this account 2 years ago but I've never actually used reddit so no idea what I'm doing. Apologies.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my early 20s and am about to graduate university in half a year. I don't want a job in the field I've studied for 4 years but hey, life goes on. The point is, ever since I was 12 or 13 I've always had a partner and continue to have one to this day (4 different partners). I have plenty of friends and I'm not short of social activities to do. My question is I have all these people around me so why do I feel so lonely?

I've never really had much emotion. I cry maybe once a year if you're lucky and generally haven't been 'sad' until the last few months. Suddenly I've become this emotional wreck who can't sleep at night at the thought of, well everything and anything. It's like my whole life I've cared about nothing and suddenly it's all came at once. I generally don't have much more to be stressed about now than I have had before and nothing's really changed, except me. I just can't put my finger on why I feel like it's me against the world.

My partner and I have been together for just over 2 years and before that I had a few other long term relationships. Nothing's essentially wrong with the relationship and I know she loves me and would do anything for me but I don't feel the sense of companionship maybe? I don't really know, like I said this whole emotion thing is new for me. I love her and she ticks all the boxes, so why do I constantly feel like she's not the one for me deep down? Can someone you love and who is perfect in your eyes still not be the one for you? Sounds pretty wild to me.

Like I said, I don't know if people write stuff like this on reddit or if I've submitted to the right place. I don't think people will read it but hey, just venting my thoughts.

So currently I’m in a show and some of my friends are in it and my sister runs the sound for the show. So we’ve been in rehearsals for a few months and my sisters only been there for 2 weeks. My friends just seem to gravitate towards her and seem to avoid me completely when she’s around. Also whenever I talk to my friends they seem like they want to get out of the conversation as soon as possible. They also never want to hang out outside of the show.

It’s the same with friends at school (most of them are also my sisters friends) they seem like they don’t want to talk to me ever and I feel left out of everything.

Whenever anyone brings up anything about my family they only talk about my sister and never about me.

She’s also a great dancer and is considered better than me at everything. I just feel like a second rate version of her and feel useless and unlikeable.

18,"I've been thinking about the now almost irreversible global warming, pollution in the air, the ocean and even in space around Earth and the Kessler effect that theoretically could happen. It really saddens me to think that we might be one of the last generations that could have done something but just couldn't save us from ourselves. It will happen for sure. Why? Because even if there is still this small frame of time to do something, people are not going to do anything until it's undeniable and too late. 

The Earth is not going to end. It's sick. I think of it as going through a fever in the hopes that we gets erased so it can try again in another time. 

I've always been conscious of the impact you as a person could do to other people and your surroundings too. How can something you say or do could make, brake or change the path of others. I try to make the best I can on my own. But we all know that this is not a single person's duty. 

The reports say that industries are the biggest culprits and that many companies are the only ones that could make the big difference to turn things around. I say that they overestimate the power simple people are capable of. We can move the industries and help them to change if we ourselves change the way we consume. The problem is how does the entire planet is going to agree on participating and start doing something right away.

If there has been a ""challenge"" worth doing, worth following, worth spreading, is this one. Let's make a promise between you and me and everyone that touches this message to make things better, let's make a challenge to change Earth's faith. Let's see how far can we go as people working together like we have seen before for other mass worldwide movements. Challenge everyone to do something against climate change but not only for one or two days, we need this to actually make a durable impact. I would like to see everyone amazed of what we as people can achieve.

This is the most important challenge right now. If we don't do anything... well, then we might actually deserve what's coming for us.

19,"**Warning: Long Rant-Like Post** 

&amp;#x200B;

**A Rule Of Thumb: If you want to stay friends with your roommates, don't room with them**. 

\*It's the same kind of logic as, ""Never meet your heroes"". They are only people, and people can sometimes suck.  


      You know it'll happen one day but you're not prepared for the  magnitude of which it might happen or how you'd react. You would think  it would be about something as important or large like stealing your belongings, eating all your food, not paying back money owed, or never doing  the dishes, but it might be about how you phrased a certain sentence or  not communicating your intentions with what would seem like a small  favor. You're afraid of how it'll affect future interactions with each other. Not all roommates fight. I lived with someone for 3 months and we sat right next to each other at work, we on the same work teams, commuted together, ate together, and even slept in the same room together (separate beds). The only time we weren't together was to shit and  shower. There was almost never a problem and the small things, we just suck up to our own loss, do it, and forget about it. The fact that we each did that for each other balanced things out between the both of us. Today, a month into living with another roommate, I had my first fight with my roommate and it sucked (for me at least), especially as someone who is avoidant of  confrontation and conflict. I won't go into the details, but we did talk  it out and things seemed settled, at least on the surface.  


      Everyone likes to think they know each other well. We each have a general  idea of how a person is and what they are like, and in my case, I wanted to live with  them based off that general idea. The thing is, this is only one side of  them in which they are comfortable acting in to most people in most  situations. You don't know what else they've been through, how they felt  about it, or how they dealt with it. They might tell you stories about  it in a humorous way that makes you think that since you don't have  those kind of problems, and the fact that you can both laugh about it  now, means that anything you'll encounter with each other surely won't be  much of a problem. Few words need to be said, but when they are, it hits hard since you didn't know they would act like that, especially towards you. That demeanor, choice of words, and look, you might forgive, but you'll never forget. It sticks with you. For a normal friend you had a fight with, it's perfectly fine to not see them for a couple weeks or so and  wait it out until time does what it can to grind down what hate or distrust there has been built up.  


      When living with a person, it's guaranteed you'll be finding out their flaws, as much as they'll be finding yours out. Sometimes, you just find  these flaws in ways you wish you didn't. You wish you could go back in  time and if you had just avoided saying one word or taken one extra minute of  your time, things could have been as peachy as they've ever been.  Instead you start to discover how truly complex a person could be in a very personal manner. In a way this might be a good thing to grow and  bounce back from, but that'll be the last thing on your mind in the  midst of emotion and a mental re-evaluation of what you think you know  about your friend. A friend with whom you share your home.  


      Ideally, a home should be your haven. It might not need to be the place you live,  but where ever you can be without judgement. If you want to talk in  weird voices, sing a song, talk to yourself, whatever, it's done at home. For most people home is also where they live, however fighting with your roommate for the first time changes the air inside and its vibes around you. Questions pop up like when will this happen again? What will it be about? Will it be better or worse? How will I  deal with it? **How do I avoid it**? There's the question  that starts to change how you act. You know what one thing gets on their  nerves, but what else does? Every act is preceded with caution for the  time being, and so as you start to lose your behavior, you start to lose  your home. You start to lose the place where you can be as you as you can be. These thoughts don't have to be given voice or clarity to be  felt. Can it still be called home?  


      If we couldn't sympathize, adapt, and grow, then this would be a  nightmare for everyone. The wonderful thing about people is their  ability to overcome obstacles and eventually be able to laugh about their problems. I'm still waiting for that I guess. I am also way overthinking this and way too sensitive in general so despite my liberal usage of the word ""you"", don't take these thoughts as representative of you, the reader, or anyone else. While 99% of people may not feel this way when it happens, I hope someone can relate. Now that I've written this out I feel much better now. Of course the ""Rule of Thumb"" up top is pessimistic, people may end up better friends than ever living with each other too.",03Dec2018,1
20,"TL;DR I'm a trainwreck and I want to stop the trainwreck but don't know how to.

&amp;#x200B;

I came out of university with a masters degree and I've not been able to do anything with it. I've been working at the same place for the past two years and whenever I try to progress, they shut me down with it and give the promotion to somebody with less experience. I want to get into what I trained to do but can't seem to do it. Not only this I think I'm living with undiagnosed mental health conditions from my understanding of those around me who have it diagnosed I might have depression, anxiety, and anger issues. For the last few weeks, I've been trying to see this girl I've liked for a while but I'm getting mixed messages from her and don't know what to do with it. That coupled with a love for my ex from two years ago (Why I still love her I don't know, we've barely even spoken in those two years). I struggle to find a relationship or even a fling, the last person I seriously abused me mentally and emotionally making my life hell and the last person I had a fling with stopped it after a week.

&amp;#x200B;

My last ex I lied to saying that I loved (I know I shouldn't have done that) but she would break down crying and threaten to hurt herself if I didn't which really fucked me up, she would go through ALL of my social media and contacts in my phone and if there was a girl who she deemed prettier than her, she would argue with me and question why I was friends with them, then go off crying and threatening to hurt herself if I didn't unfriend them or unfollow them or delete them. I was finally able to leave her after nine months of constant belittling and arguments and trying to break up with her five times. The entire time I was with her, I wished I was back with my ex before her who I still loved. Whenever I closed my eyes at night or when we had sex I'd try to convince myself in my mind that I was with my ex rather than my girlfriend at the time just to escape the hell that was being with her.

&amp;#x200B;

The girl I'm trying to get with has been making me really anxious for the past week, for the most part since we've been chatting and getting to know each other it's been fine and no issues but the other night we went out with a few of her friends and her ex showed up, who aggressively grabbed her so in retaliation I put him on the floor apparently making him black out. Since then, I've been full of anxiety whenever I'm not being kept busy with work, for example. I wake up have a coffee, something to eat and a cigarette but before I can even have any of them I have to get over extreme nausea which puts me off my food through the rest of the day. Me and her still talk but I know she goes out on dates with other guys (it seemed like she very kindly said no to me but still kisses me on nights out, flirts with me etc) and I worry that after what I did to her ex she hates me for causing such massive problems between them, she says we're chill but I just don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of this, I have my biggest secret to my family and friends which is that I crossdress. This is typically seen as something perverted old men to dressing up as little girls etc. I can tell you now, that is not always the case. I'm 24 and have been crossdressing since I was about 17. Two of my ex's know about it and one of them attempted to blackmail me with it (the before mentioned abusive one). I don't feel like I can tell my friends about it, a few select friends know but they're friends who are far away enough from me and don't know my main friends to tell them. I worry about bringing any girl home, even though that's unlikely anyway in case they wake up and they find any of it. When the ex I love found out I went into full panic mode, I had no idea what to do. She thought I was cheating on her, but after discussing it she was accepting of it for a few months before she ultimately fell out of love with me because of it which absolutely ruined me and I haven't been able to let go of loving her for the last two years.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a clue what to do with my life, how to fix what is going wrong in it. I know I'm still only young but I don't want to be in debt, I don't want to have all this worry and pain feel. I sit in work and think about the most creative ways to kill myself (though I haven't acted upon any of those for a good 12 years). I don't know how to cope with that is going on and how my life is going. I'm trying to sort things out one at a time, I've been working on my anger issues for years as it terrified my ex (I was never abusive or angry at her, I loved her more than anything. Never have and never would hurt her) I'd get angry at things falling out of my cupboards just stupid small things that were my own doing and I'd scare her. I changed on that stuff too late and lost her. Man, I would have happily married her if we'd have been together a good few more years and if I wasn't such a fuck up. I regret losing her so much, I still feel pangs of regret and love for her.",03Dec2018,1
21,"Growing up, I was generally a happy kid. But I had a lot of learning to do, and whenever my parents would scold me, it was a terrifying experience. At 8 years old all you know how to do is cry when confronted with such a situation. I didn’t have a bad childhood; I was raised by the nicest parents and in a great household. Then when high school rolled around something happened. At 14, I developed depression and social anxiety, however, *I was becoming an adult*. I had my entire head organized. At 15, my depression got much worse, but I matured and got passed my impulsive ways/actions and truly can say that late 15/early 16 year old me was my prime; I felt like an adult, I acted like an adult, thought with logic and reasoning—I’ve never felt more like myself. I didn’t have a large self-esteem or ego, but I felt like if others looked at me, they would respect me. I was truly not afraid of anything and had a handle on any situation given to me, and every night I fell asleep and every day I woke up I felt content, at ease, satisfied...and I woke up every day like that thinking, no...*knowing* to myself that this is how I was going to be for the rest of my life and the thought of it just made me so happy. And just for some background during this time, I was deep in love with the girl of my dreams at the time as she was with me and I was *never* an active drug user having never done any drugs of any kind (except vyvanse and the antidepressants I was on). Everything was great.

Then one day, around late 16 years old, something terrible happened. That “grip” I had on life, all of the understanding, the mindset, etc. disappeared. To this day, as a first year college student (18 years old pushing 19) I don’t know why this happened to me. Keep in mind I’ve never abused any drugs in my life at that point, so no psychoactive/mind-altering substance was to blame. I literally woke up and **poof**, it was all gone. I started getting panic/anxiety attacks, I lost my sense of self, it’s like a demon entered my mind while I was asleep and just robbed my entire house (aka my mind) and left a mess everywhere.

To keep this as short as I can, I don’t know what God gave me during that time period of happiness. All I felt every single day was pure confidence, maybe not socially, but, a sense of bliss and enlightenment. Ever since the change from that stage occured however, I plummeted into a rut. I got involved with so many drugs, I didn’t care about my future, I became recklass, I honestly felt like I was losing my mind and had *for a fact* forgotten who I was. I went out partying a lot more, I’ve tripped on LSD about 8 times (most trips being horrible btw) and was generally doing things the old me would barely even consider. Then that girl I mentioned before came back into my life after we cut ties for a little bit during my prime, and all I can say about that is, she was not happy with who I’ve become. She still claims to love me to this day but, I truly miss my past. I will never forget sophomore year, the euphoria, maturity, bliss, sense of self and lack of ego I had during that time.

My bad LSD trips have definitely fucked me up a bit. The first time I ever tripped, it was the best trip of my life—I felt like my depression and anxiety had been cured and like myself again. So naturally I end up abusing this substance, getting berated with bad trip after bad trip and I am sitting here today with now worsened depression, MUCH worsened anxiety and what I’m assuming is some form of PTSD because anxiety and panic attacks are a lot more prevalent. In other words, I’m 18 now, and I feel like my handle on life is as good as it was when I was fucking 8.

I want to turn back time. I want to be 16 again. I want to relive just one day of sophomore year. I just want that grasp of life I once had back. But ever since I woke up that day and that demon raided my brain of all happiness, understanding and pride, it has truly never, never been the same, and I have tried, and I have tried, and I have tried and I don’t even feel like I’m close to getting back to where I was yet. I just don’t know what my mind wants anymore.

I don’t know what this “grasp of life” I refer to all the time *was* exactly or how I found it. I’m **not** superstitious in **any** way, but, perhaps it was a temporary gift from God, perhaps as I grew older and matured I just had the right tools to take initiative and say “I’m going to act my age” (I definitely think it was the ladder lol). I’ve seeked therapy, tried new meds, I’ve done everything. I don’t know what my mind wants from me in order to get back to where I was. People keep telling me to forget the past but that’s easy for them to say. Perhaps I never will get back to who I was. Perhaps it was only temporary. But after trying everything to get back there nothing works. I’ve held on, I’ve let go. But now, I give up. And in all honesty, despite the depression and suicial ideations that I have had and survived through since I was 14, they’re just as prevalent as they were if not worse today. And if I can never get back to who I was, I will only continue to compare every day moving forward to the bliss, understanding and grasp I had when I was 16. If I can’t get it back though, that’s okay. I think it’s time for me to go soon anyway. I don’t see a future for myself anymore. I’m not happy anymore. And if I haven’t fixed myself by now, I don’t think I ever will.

Thank you so much for reading. I love you all.",03Dec2018,1

So I asked my father to borrow some cash and got the standard ""You're a young man, you should have been saving for times like this. I didn't get any help when I was your age, if I give you money now you'll come to me everytime you need a bit of help""

What pisses me off is that my two sisters are unemployed, living in their big house that my father bought for them, taking constant holidays to various countries on his money (they've been to six different countries this year!), and chilling on rich dude's yachts taking selfies for their 50k Instagram followers. But if I ask to borrow a couple of hundred to get me through December I get told to go fuck myself. 

I don't really speak with him much because of this. He always had this weird attitude towards women, he thinks that men should work so that they don't have to. Sometimes I check my sister's Instagrams to see how they live and just get really depressed to think that all the anxiety that I have over money could be so easily fixed, I don't want a fancy rich lifestyle, I just want to afford to be able to keep the heat on for more than an hour a day :(

Just wanted to get this off my chest.",03Dec2018,1
23,"I've debated pretty hard against myself on whether I should put this post up or not, but here goes.

I'm a disabled Asian person currently in high school in America. I was born in the US and I have lived here for all my life. For most of my life, in Elementary school especially, I was ostracized from many of my peers and haven't made many friends in particular. Suffice to say, I haven't had a normal childhood of going to other people's houses and hanging around them. Around the summer of 2014, my father got a new job and my family moved to a new place. I made a new life for myself at my middle school. After 2 years of making friends there, I changed schools again, thus having to go through the whole process of making friends and connections again. This past year of 2018 has been one of the most eventful years as of now. After spending my freshman year as a loner and making slowly making new friends, I've finally joined a circle of new friends around mid-sophomore year. At the time, I thought I had made it. Around August this year, one of our members left the group, citing ""irreconcilable differences"" with another person. Ever since that time, our group had been wracked with infighting between it's members, and another person left the group chat of our friends. It looks like it's impossible to go back to the time before the schism.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, I feel like it is impossible to forge personal connections with anybody other than family. I try to connect with people, but my personality is not very approachable. It's like getting friendzoned by your friends.  I feel like an outsider in my friend group. I can count on one hand people, other than family, who have messaged me first other than messages wishing me a happy birthday or those regarding school. My chances of notching a relationship with a significant other is nonexistent.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately I've contemplated ending my life. Today marks the third day I've tried to kill myself this year, only to be stopped by my mother. As far as my future life goes, I can see myself getting a job, and being single for the rest of my life, eventually turning into some sort of lonely miser. My only life goal at this point is to at least travel the world by myself. After my parents die of old age or disease, I think that will be the time to kill myself, as I will have no other point of living for. Every day is just another step towards that endpoint.

28,"I posted earlier this week about how I’m struggling with heavy depression and that I was getting to the point of nothing to live for. I had come to the conclusion that my job was the only thing in my life that wasn’t failing and it was all I had left worth in my life. I tried very hard to keep it that way but earlier this week I lost it. I got into an argument with my manager and it got to the point where we were both screaming at each other in from of my fellow coworkers. I backed down and said “I wasn’t in the mood to deal with her” and she left me alone. I then continued to vent to one of my coworkers about how mad I was. I haven’t been in a state like this in years. I was losing my mind. I began to just blame things on completely irrelevant things and ended up bringing up a very personal subject into the equation. She heard what I was saying and demanded I get out of her restaurant. I refused at first but then gave up and just marched to my car. When I got to my car two of my coworkers (one is a close friend) chased me out and said they would figure it out for me. Once they left I lost it all. It got into my head that I just lost the only thing I was worth living for. I moved my car to a nearby kohl’s parking lot and just cried. For maybe 15 minutes. Contemplating my life.

I was one of those people who would think “how could it come to someone’s mind to end their lives over something.” But it was just I never understood it. When you’re depressed and realize that your parents can’t help you, your friends are drifting away, your grades are dropping, and you just lost your job, you hit rock bottom. I hit rock bottom earlier this week. There was no way out. I was there until I died and I couldn’t deal with it. I wanted to die. As soon as possible. So I had an idea. There was a big brick wall by dumpsters at the end of a street by my work. I wanted to drive full speed into that wall, and I left the kohl’s parking lot to do so. I had no hesitation, I wanted to die. There was nothing inside of me, just emptiness. 

On my way back I hear my phone go off. A text message. I ignored it at first because I didn’t want to get distracted on anything. But eventually I caved and checked my phone. It was my manager texting me to come back, and that she wanted to speak with me in the office. I was shook. 

If she didn’t send me this text I wouldn’t be here today. It’s hard to believe that when it’s your own life you’re talking about. I still don’t feel good thinking about it. I could be dead. 

So I went to my work, sobbing. Rang the doorbell to the back door. I communicated with nobody and went straight to the office. After sitting in the office for a few minutes my manager came in. 

She went over that she was sorry for yelling at me in front of the whole restaurant, but the fact that I brought up a very personal subject of her life, I was in the wrong. And I understood that, I wish I never said that. I apologized and said I couldn’t be anymore sorry for what I said. Then I told her everything. I told her I can’t lose this job because I will lose everything. I told her I had nothing to live for except this job. But I never told her the significance of her text message, or what I had been through in the past 30 minutes. So there I was, an 18 year old guy sobbing in my jobs office to my manager who was pissed at me. 

She told me she understands that Im having personal issues but she told me that everyone I work with has personal issues and everyone deals with it. She told me to go back to work, keep my head down, and get my job done. And so I did. I went back to 5 hours of work that I spent the first 2 still crying. 

I truly don’t know why, but i only told one person  that I was trying to kill myself which was my coworker (who was the close friend who stopped me when I left). I told him right when I came back. He helped me through the night and demanded I drove him home. On the ride home he talked to me about how he’s been there and I can’t think that. That he doesn’t want me to die and that I mattered to him. He told me about all the times I’ve helped him (he had a few drug issues and I helped him go clean). 

I was so shook. I couldn’t believe I had someone. Just one being that wanted me to live. Ik it may sound incredibly selfish to say that, but that’s what depression does to you. You demean yourself to the point where you’re so empty you can’t take it anymore. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should tell my manager that she saved my life or if I should keep it as an elephant on my shoulders. 

#TLDR:# Earlier this week I was kicked out of my job that I currently believed was all that I had to live for. I contemplated my life and decided I was gonna go drive into a brick wall full speed. On my way to the wall my manager texted me to come back, and I did. If I didn’t receive this text I could be dead now. Should I tell my manager that she saved my life or keep it as an elephant on my shoulders?",03Dec2018,1

We flip it over

Fight the fear

Horrors happen, terrors too

35,"The past three years of university have been very difficult for me. I have struggled with some serious self doubt and frequent depression. I had to add a semester on to my degree plan. I was never a straight A student, even though a lot of my colleagues are. As a nursing student I go to the hospital and basically work as an RN. This semester I worked in a psychiatric hospital which was honestly nerve wracking because of the state some of the patients were in. Some were unmedicated violent patients, psychotic or severely suicidal.  It made me depressed to be in that environment but I continued to do my best.

I was emailed by my professor that he had nominated me for a clinical nursing excellence award. He told me that I am highly organised and have everything it takes to be a great RN. I cant remember the last time someone gave me a compliment that meant something to me, and ho estly, just from this I feel like I am starting new.

I usually take a lot of deep breaths, which helps me cope with that feeling of “fear.” It’s frustrating because I’m unable to shake the feeling until it slowly fades away on its own.

This has been happening to me since I was young. I’m not diagnosed with anxiety and I’ve never had experience with panic attacks (that I know of) so I don’t know what to compare this feeling to. I’ve asked many people and they’ve all suggested a panic attack. I’m not denying it, but it doesn’t make sense to me that it only occurs after a nap in the car...never in my bed, on the couch, etc. My “symptoms” also do not seem severe enough to be a panic attack. Has anyone else experienced something similar? I’m convinced I can’t be the only one.

Right now i'm dealing with things in the relationship aspect. i alsohave 0 friends to speak of so luckily for me if i fuck up in the romance department than i'm left sad and alone. i know its not healthy to rely on your boyfriend to be your only friend and i don't try to, i just suck at making friends.

In August I moved to california, and within two weeks of me being gone she confessed that she loved me and wanted to try making long distance work. I obliged, as I’d liked her for a while and, (being in high school) am dumb. We would talk every day still and things were going great; In October she even came out and we met up and had a great time. Things were good.

But since about the end of October we’ve talked like 3 times, and it’s been weird. For a while I had just accepted her “I’m just busy” thing and didn’t worry about it. I don’t really mind, I know she’s probably telling the truth, and I like her quite a bit so it’s not much of an issue, I was willing to put up with it.

I’m a server so I work long hours and rely on tips and I’m as frugal with my spending as I can be, but a couple of years ago my life kind of got turned up on its head with a long string of major life changes which have left me in roughly $15-20k in debt, and having never been in debt before, really, I don’t know what to do. It seems that as much as I chip away at it, it doesn’t really go anywhere. I don’t really do much outside of working, but it’s been taking its toll on me, mentally and emotionally. I really hate serving. I haven’t been able to finish school because of this debt and school being an expense I can’t afford right now. I rarely go out because I know that that money could be better used toward paying off my debt. I’m feeling trapped in a cycle of working, making payments that seem to mostly go toward interest rather than actually denting the debt, and longing to finish school so I can finally get out of having to rely on tips for my livelihood.   I got into serving because it was a flexible source of income that fit into my school schedule, and I can work as much or as little as I want/need while still making decent money, but after 8 years, it has really started to eat away at my soul. I’ve been trying to find another occupation that doesn’t require a degree but for which I will earn a comparable amount, but that doesn’t seem to exist, hah.   Anyway, this is probably a ridiculous request, but I figured it can’t hurt anything more than my internet standing.

61,"  HI, this is Sudipto who has more than 3-year experience in Digital  marketing.During my carrier, I learn a lot of things in my domain. So, I  want to **share this knowledge** with the digital world **through a YouTube channel and my blog**.

  With this, I have also a hobby. I love to create new and useful things  from wastage material of my home. I am also eager to wait to share my  hobbies with others who love to create new things.  
 So, my question is the following...

* How many channels I should open to sharing my Digital marketing knowledge and hobby to others??
* Can I do both things in one channel?

Which  is better for me? 

  Every day, I am able to manage 1-2 hr for my YouTube  channel... It is really hard for me to posting video both of this  channels, **but it is not impossible** for me.  
  So, pleases suggest me with your best option...

I am eagerly waiting for your answer.  
Thanks              ",03Dec2018,1

63,"I spent so much of my life avoiding responsibilities and I'm ready to admit that. I realize how shitty I've spent my life, cooped up in my room and wasting my life on video games when i could have been doing something with my life. I've told myself I'm going to make a change and go through with it, starting with a simple confession to one of my very best friends. It was the most relief I've had off my chest in a while, and it wasn't anything spectacular I'd say but a good first step for me. I just had to tell my friend how much i appreciate him, and let him know I'm struggling with some things mentally and just his kindness to offer any help he can was enough to put me to tears. He said he was happy to be my friend and was down to earth with me in the moment i needed it. So I'm ready for this change in my life and I'm going to improve myself as i get through college and life's obstacles.",03Dec2018,1
64,"I've always enjoyed a good story, whether it be through a book, a movie, a video game, or whatever. I wouldn't say writing is a passion of mine, not yet at least, but in my free time, it's something that makes me feel relaxed and lets me vent out all of the anger I keep inside of me. 

I'm in a good program at my University, one of the best around. But I hate school, or at least the program itself. On numerous occasions the stress had me crying myself to sleep becuase I know I'm not good enough. It's full of hyper-competitive med-school hopefuls who just weren't good enough themselves for the coveted B.Sc in medical sciences at my school that everyone wants to get into. Now, I don't like painting everyone under one brush, and I'm absolutely not knocking medical school by any means. I'm sure there's some really good kids in my program that I feel like I'll never have the chance to meet or truly hang out with because of the painful commute to and from my school on a daily basis. If you're by some chance still reading this and wondering why I'm in this program if I hate it so much, well the answer is I don't really know.

I've come to realize recently what I think is my real problem, and it's that I'm trying to please everyone at the same time. You see, I'm like the golden child of my family. They see me as the smartest and most talented, and over the past few years have built up this glorified image of me that I just can't match. 

My dad was always rougher on me, and while I can appreciate the struggle he went through in his difficult life, he never really gave me a break. In all the sports I played throughout high school, and despite all of the MVP awards and the fact that I was captain of nearly every team I played for, he never once said he was proud. Despite my relatively high marks throughout high school, he still always thought I didn't try hard enough and that I could do more. He made me believe these things, especially when I saw how much he achieved with such little opportunity. To come to a new country, not knowing the language or culture and building a family from virtually nothing are achievements you can't help but respect. These are incredible shoes to fill, and I know that I certainly can't fill them, despite having way more opportunities than he ever could have dreamed of. 

My brother is a bit behind the curve to say the least. He isn't the brightest, and lags behind in school quite a lot. Because of this a lot of the attention in our house is put on him and trying to get him up to speed. The little time I have for myself I try and spend with him because I know how much it means to him. He doesn't have many friends, and so I try to be the one friend he can always lean on whenever he needs one. 

My friends see me in a bit of different light. Whenever I'm with any of them it's almost as if I put on an act. I become someone I can't get out of me. I'm outgoing, likeable, love to party, and as a result am the first to be invited when plans are made. In reality, I don't want them to see me as depressed as I am. I don't want to give off an impression that I feel like I have little control over my life. I hate who I become when I'm around them because I know it isn't the real me. 

So I write. I usually work on my own, original film scripts to be specific, with some help on the more technical aspects through Google. That's how I cope with everything, and I love it. I've been doing it for over a year now and I've gotten progressively better (I hope) to the point where I've started putting aside school a lot just to find more time to do it. I've never told anyone, and I keep it to myself because I'm scared of the reaction I'll get. Deep down inside of me I can see an artist. I can see myself working on the set of a movie or working on a video game with a group of people who share the same passions I have. I feel this sense of creativity growing, creating something that people may love and cherish, creating something that I myself can be proud of, not my friends, my brother, or my dad. 

I'm scared I'll never be able to do what I want, that I'll always be chained to what everyone else wants or needs from me, that I'm gonna be doing something that I don't care for or see myself enjoying. I love to write and create, but in reality, I just know it'll be nothing more than a hidden secret that'll never see the light of day.

65,"I am 18m and my GF is 18f. I’m a senior in high school and she has already graduated high school last year.

We have been dating for 4 months, but we hung out for a few times before we actually started dating. She’s perfect and she adds on more happiness to my life. We have a plant cactus, she took care of the plant before she left, and now I’m am taking care of our plant. Dating for only 4 months so far, I feel more for her than I did 3 years of dating my ex. I knew she wanted to go into the marines, I knew this before we started dating. 

We both talked about how do we want go with this relationship, as it is still relatively early for big commitment decisions. We both have different routes in life, and we both agreed on completely our own goals before we get serious about moving in together and becoming more connected as a couple. 

She would go to boot camp. She says she’ll likely be stationed across country. she plans on being in the marines for 10 years or until she can’t no longer. I knew she would want to be in the Marines for a while before we started dating.

I would graduate high school. I plan on going to college (community or public university, which ever would financially work best for me) and get a degree in computer science. While in college I plan on getting a barber license, because I like to cut hair as hobby, I might as well get a license for that if I ever need extra cash I could always rely on cutting hair. If I go to community college, it’ll only be for 2 years, but I go to a public university, it’ll be for 4 years. 

We have talked about different possibilities about what we could do with our relationship. We structured a plan. I would graduate and continue with my education into college, after I graduate from college, I could move in with her on the base wherever she is stationed. 

Now that she has left for boot camp, I fear of her changing her mindset. We will be sending letters to stay in contact, but I kept imagining she will come back from boot camp not wanting a relationship. I know I can’t stop her from doing what she wants. I keep imagining she will find someone else at boot camp, just because of the stressful environment, talking to someone else would relieve that stress. 

I want things to work out in the end, but I kept thinking of the worst to happen. I plan on keeping myself busy with work. I need to save money for a new car but also just in general.

TL;DR - My GF left for boot camp and this is just the start of her life in the marines. I still have to graduate high school, and finish college in order to move in with her. Although we have a structured plan on how we can continue our relationship, I keep imagining the worst things to happen.

68,"Hi, I just had to sort of get something off my chest. It’s fairly innocent but it’s weird so I don’t generally talk about it with real people. 

I love Brussels sprouts. They are fantastic, they’re good for me, and they taste real good. So, on Thanksgiving, I made Brussels sprouts to take to the family dinner. The smell was overwhelming, and naturally I decided to eat some of my Brussels sprouts while in the car. I placed the pan on my lap, and went to town. 

Unfortunately, I wasn’t paying attention and had to slam on my brakes at a red light. As such, the pan went flying and all of my Brussels sprouts and the juice fell right into my car’s floor and AC vents. 

This is where my awkwardness kicks in. I didn’t know how to tell me family that I spilled my Brussels sprouts in my car because I felt compelled to eat them all, so I lied and told them that my dog ate them. They all chuckled for about ten seconds, then my cousin asked me, “wait, don’t you have a cat?” Obviously, any normal person would have said, “yes, I was joking”, but I, being the idiot that i am, became flustered and started crying in front of the whole family, wailing about Brussels sprouts. I then proceeded to leave, after spending a sum total of probably fifteen minutes with my family. 

I got into my car, drove home, and played Red Dead Redemption for the rest of the weekend. When I got into my car to go to work on Monday, what did I smell? Brussels sprouts. So now I have Brussels sprouts in my car, probably forever, and shame to carry on my back for embarrassing myself in front of my family. I haven’t spoken to any of them except my mom since Thanksgiving. 

Anyway, I don’t know why I felt compelled to share it. It was an extremely stressful thanksgiving and it’s just been weighing on my mind a lot. Thanks for reading.",03Dec2018,1
69,"I have ADHD so I do tend to have anger issues if I feel like I am wrongly accused of something. I will usually scream and yell back at the other person.

I discovered the only way to control my anger is to ""dissociate"" from my personality and identity. I have become self-hating at some point and developed the odd obsession of learning how to act.

These days when someone wrongly accuse me of something, I will naturally ""dissociate"" from my personality. I will tell myself ""I will treat this as an opportunity to learn how to act and I must act like X character from a TV show or X public figure"". When I think like that, all my anger disappears. I see it as the other person wrongly blaming the persona I've created so I am less likely to feel angry as I feel like my ego isn't triggered.

70,"I think my idiopathic scoliosis was caused by my sheer terror of my abusive father from 3 years old. 

Before my spinal fusion 4yrs app, I had a complete disconnection from myself and my body. I had no body awareness and I’d suffer from migraines and such terrible pain and stiffness. 

After the spinal fusion surgery (severe curves at 20 years old) I had all these epiphanies that i’d been holding onto all this suffering without knowing it and I literally felt a heavy presence dissolve from my body aiding my body to begin to heal. It’s better than its ever been but I’m still seriously F’ed up. And I will be forever. This makes my heart cry. 

To this day I am still trying to rid the fear I’ve been carrying around for decades. Sometimes it gets triggered unconsciously by people who are no threat to me. When I’m stressed everything gets worse. And I get anxious because of all the uncomfortable unpleasant feelings in my body. 

There’s a lot of science about chi and prana which supports western studies of the spine and the nerves and juices and energy along with it make the body and brain function (chiropractor) and if these cells were so shaken, so seriously and so young for so long it’s plausible. 

This seems sort of logical to me that it’s possible, but such little information is available for this condition. 

I often wonder why God gave me this deformed body. Am I supposed to aid the research with these thoughts that planted in my head during meditation and self reflection and analysis? Or is it too mystical for science, and not measurable. I went from having no self awareness to too much self awareness.  Either way I’m grateful. It’s also intense. 
But this has been playing on my mind. 

What do you think?

I went on a date and I couldn’t finish the meal he paid for. The next day I had a stressful day of work and almost missed a family gathering for my sister because we got out late. 

My mom who had seen me on thanksgiving noticed right away that I had lost weight. I played it off and ate a sliver of a pizza because I wanted to interact with the people I haven’t seen in a while. That day I had only eaten that pizza and two bites of a sandwich at work.

Then the next day I had another long day of work but ate breakfast. Right after I left to see more friends who came to visit campus. I had sips of alcohol and had what amounted to be a handful of chips and that was all. 

I’m worried but I’m happy with the results. But I feel so stressed because I still have so much ahead of me. I don’t know who to talk to because despite having friends, I don’t talk to them often. Idk. I’m just lost right now.

i ofc have an social anxiety but only when i meeting new people, when im with my old friends i can be talktative and not shy. i felt that friends i made is only because of luck. most of them dont have a thing in common with me, so why do i feel so sure when i with them.

i didnt ever have a girlfriend or even female friend. i mean im not an incel but talking with females just come as much harded bcs they most of the time dont make the first move.

101,"I just broke up with my boyfriend because after almost 7 months I couldn't even stand looking at him. I don't even really have any reasons why, I just completely fell out of love as I always do. This is my second longest relationship, the first is 9 months. I've had a lot of relationships but have always broken up after a few months because I just don't care about the person after a few months, even if we share interested and they are objectively nice and everything.

Imagining a future where I'm in my 30' (currently mid 20) with a long term relationship feels cold, empty and grey.

I feel like something is broken because I can love or really like someone, have crushes and all but when a few months go by I just lose interest sometimes to the point of resentment. ",03Dec2018,1
102,"My Mom shit talked my Dad a lot and so us kids never thought he was a good guy. Until we got old enough to decide for ourselves. 
My soon to be ex wife just called my Mom to say that she is taking the kids away for Christmas, without me because they would be happier.
Ma called me to warn me that my kids Mom would try to turn them against me.

I know Ma that’s what happens it’s what you did to us kids when you got divorced

She didn’t enjoy that realization

It’s easy to turn on the ones that you’ve been with for decades, all you have to do is focus on their negative aspects and don’t appreciate the positive ones

Also focus on your own good qualities and it your bad ones it’s not a bad thing to love yourself ",03Dec2018,1
103,"I’m 17, just found out my sisters going to Florida. I’m in Kentucky. Also my mom and dad are headed straight to the Bahamas when she’s gone so I guess it’s just me. Kentucky sucks and Canada seems better so knowing nothing about it and just from hearing side conversations I’m absolutely sure I wanna. It seems like it would be way easier to even survive there, the healthcare alone makes it worth it for me. So are there any reasons I shouldn’t do this?

104,"I’m 19 and on my first semester of community college. I should be proud because I’m the only one in my group of friends who hasn’t dropped out of school (and I’m not planning on it anytime soon) and they often remind me that they’re proud of me for going out and getting an education.

But I’m also terribly broke. I’m having trouble finding work. I have a mood disorder (previously diagnosed as dysthymia&amp; seasonal depression but my therapist and I think it might be bipolar) as well as crippling social anxiety. I had a job as a waitress for a week, had a panic attack &amp; did a no-call/no-show, and just stopped showing up, which I keep beating myself up for. I feel like I’m not in the right place to be working right now, but I feel ashamed that I’m not.

All of my friends work. Some of them work a LOT of hours. So I compare myself to them; even after hours of classes/homework, at the end of the day I find myself lying in bed comparing myself to them, thinking that I’m a lazy piece of shit because I’m not going out and making money and busting my ass like my friends are.

I have barely any experience, so right now it seems that the only options for me are food service and retail. Which I feel like I couldn’t handle. Preferably I would work at home, but that just doesn’t seem realistic.

105,"I went WAY too far and fucked myself over and now it's too late to turn back.

It all began last year with me experimenting with letting my hair grow a little bit.

Now, a year later, I have shoulder length hair, an appointment to dye it next Friday, I only wear weird band tshirts, weird jeans, edgy rings and knee high goth boots oh my god I have no idea how I got here so fast I'm not even a goth, it all just escalated so quickly.

I have no idea how all of this happened. I just went one step further every few weeks and never stopped to take a look at myself. Now I'm here.

Last year during this December I was just a regular teen now I have no idea wtf happened. But I've gone too far to turn back now. I'll have to embrace the hair dye appointment next week and I fear it will only escalate more. I can't pussy put of this. I got myself in here without noticing and now I'll go with it. Old people stare at me on the street but I kinda like it.

110,"""There is no one here you care about""

""We hold no value to you""

""Lighten up. You're bitchy and mopey""

None of these are how I feel. She'll just say 'that's my opinion and I know you don't care about it'. I can't win. 

I'm depressed. I have been for years. I was medicated for a bit but it's too expensive without insurance. I moved back home from school to help take care of my grandmother. She recently died and I'm staying until her house sells because I have to help renovate it for sale. Once the house sells, I'm gone.

I've always been on the more reserved side. I don't yell. Ever. If there is an argument, I say my bit and then leave it alone. My mother will keep poking and poking and poking. She wants a reaction and that's just not what I do. The one time I stood my ground, she pushed me down the stairs. She wasn't always like this and I think that's what hurts. I was raised by her as a single mother and it was wonderful. Those ghost memories of her make it even worse when I see everything. I know she's stressed about a lot, but it still hurts. 

We're living in the same house (my grandmother's) with my little brother. Last night, I had to get in between them so they didn't get physical. My brother is getting too big for me to pick up with resistance, so I just have to hold him and stand between them. I just kept say 'let's leave, it won't get any better' and my mother would back off with the stinging words. But then they make up and I get blamed for being 'mopey'. I'm hurt by what I see. I watched for years as my step-father abused my mother and I couldn't do anything. Then I watched my step-father manipulate his kids against their mother and I couldn't do anything. I feel useless.

My mother has always told me I'm mopey and pissy and all that. She'll say I'm upset when I'm not. I don't understand why staying quiet is worse than screaming. Does she want me to scream and yell and hit? Why is staying in my room or leaving the house the bad choice?

I can't win. If she says I'm pissy and argue back, she'll get madder and madder until she destroys something. If I stay quiet and opt-out, she'll have the argument in her head for me and then start criticizing me for any little thing. 

I hate it here. I recently had to sell my car because I couldn't afford to fix it. I lost my only sense of freedom. I was planning on leaving and just sleeping in my car or something. But now I can't even do that. 

Even worse, I want to cut off all contact with my mother, but love my brother too much. 

I know I'm not the best person. I am withdrawn right now. I am depressed. I have no energy or motivation and my memory isn't very good right now. I feel like my brain is running in slow motion and it sucks. It's not like I enjoy it. But then it feels like my mother is proving herself right because I'm just a shell of a person. I still love them and care about them and that's why I moved home to help. But I don't even care about myself. I don't know what she wants me to be. ",03Dec2018,1
111,"I had had an on/off relationship with her for a couple months before I finally ended it for the good of both of us a week ago. Every time I would (temporarily) break up with her she would begin to emotionally blackmail me into getting back together with her. I would do so, and then only a few days later, I would break up with her again.

The most recent time I broke up with her she seemed to be relatively ok with it. But now I hear that she's becoming more and more upset. Suddenly I hear from a mutual friend she's talking to people about hurting herself. If she does something I don't know what I'd do. I feel so guilty and my instinct is to pretend I still want to be together just to make her feel better, continuing the cycle. 

What do I do?",03Dec2018,1
112,"I'm a quiet guy, who is always minding his own business. Never really used violence, insults, etc... I always keep things for myself and yeah. Lately I've been exploding in anger because people around me is constantly doing things that makes me want to break their face, and even my life is not going that well.

I'm really trying. As hard as I can. I have depression and its hard for me to get out of my bed every day. I am harsh enough with myself, but I do know I have positive qualities. One of them is that I have values. I know what's important (like family and friends) and I always keep my word, even in the worst cases.

But when someone tells me that I lack of that and that I'm a piece of shit, that I'm the worst human in the world... And I got no other way than listen to him, it just... Made me explode.


Now I just wanna be calm. I want to go back to what I was. Quiet, calm, etc.. but now, even the smallest thing makes me scream and kick stuff, punch stuff, break stuff, to the point that it's harming myself. Basically I've lost control...
I went to my friends and he told me that none of what I've been told is true, which helped but... Still, it seems like I'm not stopping this rampage anytime soon.

I'm very scared that I might hurt someone, or go to jail because someone looked at me wrong on the street (YES, it's that bad.......) And I decided to get into a fight. 


I'm sorry if this post isn't making too much sense. I'm trying so hard to be calm but it feels like my heart is gonna explode and my body is all sore, which adds to the anger.


I wanna stop before I break stuff or hurt people then I regret it.",03Dec2018,1

117,"Colour journal 3:

Bleu the French would say, as they munched on their blue cheese. I mean, why is it called blue cheese when half of the product is white. 

One of the world’s wonders I guess. 

“When I feel blue, I start breathing again.” - Frank L Baum 

Another reference of the colour blue being used. This time, for the symbolism of sorrow. I actually really like the land of Oz and the characters who roam its meadows, but I digress with the use of the shade blue in this quote.  

“I’m blue babadiedabudie…” - Eiffel 65

Ok, I’ve been stumped. 

As you could probably infer, blue will be our new subject for this elongated assessment on colours. Interesting enough, blue is the most liked colour, decided by the humans who roam this planet. I guess that means this one’s gonna be a tough shell to break. For starters, let’s quickly boil down the objects and scenarios that are associated with our prestigious shade of blue. 

When I picture the buildup of blue, I first think of water. After water, images of rainy days, vast oceans and a certain flavour of Mtn Dew revisit my memories. 

Then I move onto the more exaggerated view of blue. 

Over in that spectrum, there’s aliens, weird creatures, smurfs and  even a hedgehog with the speed of an F1 racer. Not to mention those creepy blobs of slime that hang on cave stalagmites in our extensive dreams. 

Last but not least, the juiciest dipping sauce of them all. 

The category related to emotions.

That’s right, emotions play a huge part in colours like blue. Knowing that blue is a primary colour, we can easily see the powerful presence of such tints. Blue, on the heat scale, would most likely be the coolest temperature. That means, anyone with a calm nature could be referred to as a blue person.  

In spite of that, when people are feeling “blue”, they’re classified as sad individuals. 

Sad, depressed and under the weather. 

All pointing fingers to the colour blue. 

Rather disappointing for such an amazing colour. 

However, this is only one segment of the word blue being used in a pathos-like environment. Works of art ranging from music, entertainment, paintings and food can easily disagree with the prior information. 

A good example of said opinion would be Blues Music. 

Quite literally the most calming music I know off. 

So why is blue such a sad slice of bread in some picnic baskets, but not others?

I’ll tell you why. 

For otherworldly purposes, I’ll give you a moment to just suck in everything I just said in the last few paragraphs and hold it firmly in your right hand. 

Yep, take your time. 

Don’t rush it or else you might miss something important. 

Something you’ll regret in the future. 

So use your seconds wisely. 

Were you angry at me for dragging out the intermission? Don’t be afraid of anger, I would be furious if this was a real conversation. Too bad, you could’ve just skipped ahead. Although if you did that, I would be distressed.

So many feelings, swirling around in a puddle of mist. Mixing into each other like paint on a palette. 

Have you realized yet? The correlation between almost all the items I’ve mentioned from top to bottom, every single word that burned into this electronic page. 

They all connect to the colour blue. 

Yes, this might seem like a joke, but I’m one hundred percent serious right now. 

Because to me. Blue isn’t anything special. It’s what you make it to be, what you imagine it to be. 

Anything and everything.

It’s creativity in the work, the foundation to something new. 

Just the like the water that grows your plants.

Or maybe the veins that construct your body. 

Don’t let the world definitions of blue drag you down. 

Remember, it can be whatever your mind desires. 

Blue isn’t just a colour.

118,"The past 2 years i've lived off of potatoes and sometimes meat, so you can get 20 frozen sausages for £1 or 4 chicken or fish breasts for £3, so the meat didnt come often. When I see pictures of sweets, cakes, pizzas, just meals that arent just potatoes in general I get so excited.


I just saw a christmas themed biscuit with icing on reddit and it killed me, as usual. It looks so nice. Mouth watering. 


I started a new job 3 weeks ago, when I get paid I cant go and blow it on nice food- but the 2nd time I get paid, which will be in january, I can.


I can just picture myself biting into that juicy cheeseburger with lettuce, buying that pot of £2 pick n mix gummy sweets from the shop, a fat piece of beef with cheese n chips... Yes, I cant wait to buy chips instead of potatoes. Potatoes have no taste; im sick of them.


Mark my words groceries, you shall be devoured. Workers of food stores be warned, I am coming. I am coming for your food - with my hard earned money.

122,"Every once in awhile it seems like my brain does its best to hurt me with my memories.

I cleaned to try to make it go away and focus on something else but it didnt work tonight. Nothing did. My thoughts kept circling around again and again. 

I'll never forget when I came home from the hospital and Tammie was at the kitchen table stuffing cannoli shells. She was in slippers and her house robe. There was no evidence that a few hours prior, a pot full of oil exploded on me and half of the house.

""This is the bastard that did it if you want it,"" she said, motioning to the cannoli shell that exploded. Somehow it didn't burn. 

That moment is frozen to me forever. I replay it when I'm like this and it strengthens the hurt. You could've been my mother, Tammie. And now we're nothing. 

Every day your house was open to me across the street and almost every day for a little while I was there. You told me about your mother, and modeling, and Uncle Roy, and thrifting, how to make cornbread and sausage gravy. We grew so close that even though deep down I suppose I knew I'd never marry your nephew, I never thought breaking up with him would mean breaking up with you too.

125,"I think my family is a lost cause.

&amp;#x200B;

My immediate family consists of my Mother(50's), Grandmother(70's), Myself(late 20's), younger brother(teenager) and younger sister(mid 20's). I live in a house with all of them except my sister who lives about 20 mins away from us. My younger brother is severely autistic and doesn't talk and can barely function. The responsibility of his daily care belonged to my Grandmother for a large portion of our lives as my mom was always working. As we got older I started to take more responsibility around the house and now I feel like my grandmother and I split his daily care in half for the most part. The major problems aren't around his autism or anything else you might imagine. It's this unbelievable hate between my mom and grandmother that has been brewing since before I was born. I don't know what to do, they talk to me about each other all the time and I never know what to say. They say horrible things about each other and try to get me to take sides and I never do. Nether of them are wrong in what they tell me but I love them both too much to take a side. They both do things on purpose to antagonize each other and then all hell breaks loose and I'm stuck in the middle. Today was one of the worse days. My mom is always complaining about how much money she has to spend on groceries and how many times she has to make trips to the store after work. My Grandma takes those complaints personally and always retorts back to her about well if we are so tight on money then how can you afford beer or something along those lines. Things progress and I'm stuck in a car with my mom because we take my brother out to get dinner every night after she gets home from work . She starts venting at me about things that happened before I was even born like how she was never loved and how her brother was always the favorite and how my grandma tore apart my mom and dads marriage. I wanted to tell her so bad that she needs a therapist. My sister has told her that and now they never talk to each other. I don't want to be stuck in a house where I can't even speak to the people I care about the most. I know they both need someone to help them talk out their issues with each other and about the issues that come from having to take care of a special needs person. They don't want the help though, neither of them will ever take a leap and get the help they need so I'm going to be stuck here. I don't have a job, I haven't had a job since I graduated highschool because I wanted to stay home and help with my brother (yes he is that much of a handful) and relieve some of the stress they have to deal with. But now I'm stuck in this house with no way out and no idea on how to fix what has been broken for apparently longer than I have been alive.
