I applied to jobs all over my area and went to a KFC and they ended up saying come back on monday with my birth certificate and ID(because im under age), i don't know whether i can get this job or not. But just right now a taco bell called me and said they can most likely hire me if i come in for an interview tomorrow. The thing is with taco bell they will make me shave my beard and i am totally against that but with kfc they let you have one but im not 100% sure they'll let me have the job.

2,"[This ended up being really long, because I found typing it out somewhat therapeutic. If you end up reading the whole thing, you have my sincerest thanks.]

A little background: I got married young, way too young as it turned out, though it seemed like the perfect life plan at the time. My first and only daughter, S, was born when I was 21 and my wife, V, was 20. That was nine years ago now, and in countless ways V and I matured into very different and incompatible people over that time. We've been divorced for 3 years, and even though it's been the most painful thing I've ever experienced, I know it would've been all the worse if we hadn't gone through with it. She got physical custody, and I have fortnightly visitation plus extra time (some summer and holidays time). V is back in a serious relationship now, and her new partner has a son, L, two years older than S.

It was very painful adjusting to not seeing S for weeks at a time, and the first few times I had to say goodbye after summer visitation I was filled with a kind of overwhelming emptiness that I'd never felt before (even during the divorce process), but at the very least I could always rely on the fact that the time I did get to spend with S was precious, and made everything else going on in my life seem worth it.

Nowadays V and I get on amicably so long as we don't have to spend too much time together, and it seems we're both in a place where we value S's happiness over any animosity we've held for each other in the past. So when I found out that there was going to be a church family camp on during my visitation this weekend (V is religious, I am not), I consented to bringing S to the camp for three reasons: (1) I know V would like S to be there, and I try not to do anything to upset her where possible for S's sake; (2) I have overdue work that I was going to have to get done at some point this weekend, and I'm happy to give S something to do during that time; (3) But far more importantly than either of those two reasons, S asked me herself if she was allowed to go, because there would be friends of hers there from interstate that she sees once a year at the most. On top of that, I knew that V's current partner was out of state for a week and wouldn't be there. I've met him, and he's nice, but I still prefer to avoid having to talk to him as much as I can, so it made things less complicated that he wasn't going to be there.

I messaged V about it and we arranged for me to meet them there on Friday morning. Then I would return home on Saturday (today) to get my work done, and come back to the camp on Sunday morning. This was an easy enough arrangement because the camp is only half an hour away from my house.

There's one more thing I have to mention before I get onto the actual camp. S and I have had a great relationship always. She's the light of my life, and the way she brightens up when she sees me fills my soul with warmth. Over the past few months though, I've noticed that the way she receives affection has started to change. Since she was old enough to speak S has always been very cuddly. She's known for just randomly giving out hugs for no reason, and I have many fond memories of her curled up with her head in my lap watching cartoons while I held her. More recently though, her hugs with me have turned superficial (one arm side on, loosely extended), and she has shied away from my putting a hand on her back or an arm around her shoulder. That hasn't bothered me much at all, it just came across to me as a part of her growing up and out of her cuddly phase of life, and I've just gotten used to showing her love in other ways.

Now on to yesterday. Of course I had expected S to want to spend a lot of time with her friends, so I wasn't expecting to be spending an entire day with her or anything, but I was at the very least expecting not to be basically completely ignored for the entire day. I caught her attention in the morning as I got there, and she did put on a bright smile as she walked up to me, and gave me one of her half-hugs, but as I started to ask her how she had been she yelled her reply back to me while she was running off in the other direction after some other kids. I just let her go thinking I'd talk to her later in the day. I didn't see her at all for the rest of the morning. I tried to just entertain myself for most of that time, though a few times I took a walk around the camp ground on the off-chance I might cross paths with her and could talk to her a bit. I didn't, and didn't end up seeing her until lunch. The cafeteria was filling up and I was sitting on my own when S walked in. I made eye contact and smiled at her, she smiled back but grabbed her food and went to the other side of the room with friends. I reminded myself that that was why she was there, and I was still fine.

In the afternoon I actually found something fun to do. I found a group of younger adults playing board games in a library building, and I'm a huge board game fan, so I joined in and played for several hours. At one point S actually came in to the room to run around pillars with one of the kids she was playing with. I kept glancing over at her with a smile, and didn't once see her look in my direction. Again I was a little disappointed just because I did really want to spend at least some time with her, but I had expected that she would be having fun with friends and so I just swallowed the disappointment and got on with the day.

The disappointment didn't become sadness until the evening. When it came time for dinner I was already in the cafeteria. The board games had finished up and I had headed up there to kill time. V was also there. We had spoken a little when I first got to the camp, but apart from that we had been doing our own things and hadn't run into each other. As I said earlier, we do get on fine for short bursts, so when I ran into her I approached her and we started catching up. In the middle of our conversation I saw S walk into the room for dinner. An idea flashed in my head to get a chance to talk to S, and I spoke before I had even processed it. As she walked by and looked at us I asked, ""Do you want to sit with mum and me for dinner?"" I immediately glanced at V to see her reaction, but she was just smiling. I looked back at S, who said kind of quietly, ""Mmm, probably not."" I was again crestfallen, but replied, ""That's okay, I hope you're having fun."" She walked off to the back of the room. After a couple more seconds I realised that I had now committed to sitting with V, even though S wasn't going to be there, but I was okay with that since we were getting along fine, and I was just going to eat alone otherwise anyway. V and I grabbed food and sat down across from each other at the end of a table.

A few seconds later L sat down next to V and stared at us while we spoke. I asked him a question to include him in the conversation. I haven't spoken to him much before, but he's a nice kid and apparently he gets on well with S (most of the time). V told L to go grab some dinner, so he got up to get a plate and dish himself out some food. A minute later S comes and sits down next to V, and I'm sure my face must have lit up like a Christmas tree. I immediately looked at her and said, ""Hey, how's your day been?"", but before she could even answer L gets back and says to S, ""I was sitting there."" I looked up at L, gave a small smile, then back to S and pulled out the empty chair next to me, ""Here, you can come sit next to me."" S stared at me for a second, then without speaking she sidestepped into the empty chair next to her own and let L sit down. My heart tore in two. In case you can't follow along with the description, [here's an image of the table at that point](https://i.imgur.com/Kb0ZZD2.png). She had chosen to move herself to where she was separated from the entire rest of the party rather than come and sit next to me. It hurt, but I swallowed it and tried not to show anything on my face. I continued to talk to V, and also a little to L. After a short while S, who was struggling to hear all of the conversation because of the throng of the crowd and the terrible acoustics of the room, had leaned in really close and asked about something I had just said to L. I took that as a chance to scoot one seat over to get a bit closer to S so she could hear me. I then proceeded to have a conversation with her about her day, most of which was one sided with short answers, but when I asked her about what plushies she had brought to camp with her I got her to talk for a bit longer. She went on to not only list for me which plushies she had brought, but also show me all the things she had brought with her in her new purse that V had gotten her for Christmas.

Immediately after dinner I was feeling a tad better after having been able to at least talk to her, though I was still hurting and confused over why she didn't want to sit next to me. Then came the last part of the night. Being a church camp, there was an evening service that would go for an hour after dinner. I had thought about just ending the night there and going home, which I might have done if I'd had more quality time with S, but I was still feeling terrible and was hoping that if she would come sit next to me through the service then I could sleep that night completely at ease. That turned out to be a huge mistake. I went in and sat down before S did, specifically so she had the choice whether she wanted to sit with me or not, and she walked straight past me to sit with V. I half wanted to just move up and sit next to her, but more than anything I want to respect her choice of who she wants to sit with, and given that she specifically chose not to sit next to me at dinner, I thought better of basically forcing her to sit next to me.

I then proceeded to sit through what turned into one of the most agonising hours of my life, as I, sitting further back than V and S, saw S cuddling up with V and going to sleep on her lap while V rubbed her back. In that moment I realised that I had only been okay with S becoming less cuddly because I thought she was just growing out of it in general, but to see that she no longer felt comfortable cuddling with *just me* in particular was gutwrenching. Maybe I should have excused myself and ducked out, then waited outside until the service finished, but it just felt like the damage was done and no matter where I went I wasn't going to feel any better about what I'd seen. At least if I sat in the service I'd be forced to keep my welling emotions in check so I could give S a hug goodbye at the end of the night without looking like a mess.

Eventually the service did end, and I hugged both V and S and said goodnight to them. I drove home in agony, with a dozen worst-case scenario thoughts running through my head, then listened to a full set from one of my favourite stand-ups so I could calm down enough to go to sleep. The problem with the worst-case scenarios that keep popping up is that I can't actually discredit any of them as pure paranoia, since they're all definitely possible, but they keep interweaving together in my mind and it's tearing me up inside. These are the things that I keep thinking:

(1) Up until now I've always thought that I was one of S's favourite people, and that she would relish any chance to spend time with me. I've thought that because we get along together really well when it's just the two of us, and she looks so happy during that time. I now think that she only feels happy to spend time with me when I'm her only option. I've just never noticed it because all the time we do spend together *is* time when I'm her only option.

(2) V was raised by a single mother, and had no brothers. I've always felt that it affected V in a way that causes her now to subconsciously distrust men. Although I've brought it up before in passing and she said that she didn't feel that it was true, I still pick it up in how she responds to situations involving S and older men. While I would never suspect V of actually telling S to distrust me at all, I feel like some of that subconscious tendency might be rubbing off on her, and she may be becoming more uncomfortable around me as a result.

(3) I've never considered it before yesterday, but now I'm starting to worry that S is beginning to pick up on the fact that she's the only thing that makes me happy. I would love to be happy enough with the rest of my life that it wouldn't phase me if she ignored me for a day, and when I don't see her for a couple of weeks I do tend to get focused enough on everything else that it all seems to make sense and I feel satisfied, but when I get to see her again it always comes flooding back to me how I haven't actually been happy while she's been gone, I've just been surviving. I never tell her that, but maybe it comes across in how I talk to her. Maybe she finds that too much pressure, or is starting to see me in a more pathetic light like she actually has to take care of me emotionally, and that makes her uncomfortable.

I almost made the decision this morning to forgo the overdue work and drive back to camp now, but I felt that would just make things worse unless she just had a complete turnaround overnight and is now wanting to spend the whole day with me, which I don't think is likely. I've been bombarding myself with negative self-talk all morning, and it's driving me insane, but when I try to turn it around into positive self-talk I just can't, so I end up ignoring the self-talk and distracting myself until the negative self-talk pops up again out of nowhere and the pain inside continues to build up. Why can I not just let this go? Why do I care so much that she still likes cuddling with her mum and not with me? I have no idea how to make this feeling go away.",27Jan2018,1

8,"My wife and I have been together for 11 years and married for 7 of those. We've had our ups and downs like all couples but it's all come to a head fairly recently.

Money has never been a 'problem' for us. I did well in the markets when I was younger (I'm 40 now) and this allowed me to put some money aside as well as completely pay for a condo that was our primary residence. This happened before I met her.

My wife was never really happy with the condo. She wanted a house and a garden etc. Well, about a year ago, I inherited a substantial amount of money and so I set about making her dreams come true.

We bought a house, I paid off her student loans, bought her a car, bought myself a car, furnished the house, went on a trip, etc. Despite this lavish spending, we still have a very large nest egg working for us in the market. 

However, my wife gets mad at me if I spend even the tiniest amount of money on myself. The most recent example happened the other night, I had some people over to watch movies and because I was feeling generous, I bought pizzas. These pizzas cost around $70. And, as I type this, my wife isn't speaking to me because of those fucking pizzas. 

A few weeks ago, I went a little crazy and bought about $200ish dollars of movies on Amazon. This lead to three days of the silent treatment.

I don't know what's going on. Money isn't a problem, we both have reasonable jobs AND have more money in the bank than we've ever had before. 

It isn't just the money, it seems like any time I want to do anything like hang out with my friends or go to the bar for a drink, it's a huge issue. We are too loud or she has to get up in the morning and my coming home wakes her up. I am not a huge drinking, when I say go out for a drink, it's usually two beers over the course of two hours, I'm more interested in the conversation.

I just don't know what to do. I've tried talking to her about my concerns but it just turns into a one sided argument where I'm the one completely responsible. 

I know that just because I did a bunch of fancy stuff doesn't give me free reign to act like an asshole, but I don't think that inviting people over to play video games in the basement should spark an epic argument. 

I'm looking into talking to a therapist but I just wanted to get this off my chest because I know it's going to be the whole weekend of feeling shitty and I won't be able to talk to a therapist until Monday at least. 

Anyway, that's all. Just needed to vent a bit. This is from a throwaway account because my wife knows my other reddit name.

11,"For the past few months, I've had a thought in the back of my head that I really want to visit Latvia - simply because it looked pretty on Google Images. The colourful and striking architecture in the capital of Riga (especially want to see the building of the Brotherhood of Blackheads), the simple and charming hills in the countryside, and the traditional clothes - which probably aren't really worn - all look wonderful to me. I know some general history of the country from a few books I have on European history, but only a few pages are given to Latvia; Netherlands easily had around a hundred. I don't know the language, the laws, customs, food, currency or anything, other than that I think it looks pretty, which is kinda funny now that I think about it. I told by friend about it, and she didn't even know Latvia was a real country.

17,"Hey I just sort of want to get this off my chest.  

A couple years ago in my freshmen year of Highschool I met this girl in my first period class and we immediately hit it off.  I always thought she was really cool but after some time in that year she started to date someone a grade older.  As time went on my feelings grew stronger and stronger, and one day I had to tell her how I felt.  She had told her best friend before she started dating this new guy that she had these little feelings for me.  She would always tell me how she's never been so comfortable talking with someone before she met me too. The guy she was with was really a jerk, and later I found out she forced feelings for him because she was, ""young and dumb and thought she needed his love"" and that ""there was so much pressure from her freshmen friends to date an OLDER guy."" Sounds lame right? lol

Freshmen year she declined me.  She was very depressed at the time because of some personal family things, and I really respected it.  She was also dating that other guy. I know it's messed up to move in on someone else's relationship but I really needed to.  It was this pressure feeling in my chest for her that I really needed to say something about. The feeling from that rejection really destroyed me though too.  I couldn't stand watching her be with someone she hated.  Her and I connected on every little level, and I never felt so comfortable and happy talking with someone in this way before.

After we stopped talking I felt sick.  To quote Jim from the office talking about Pam, I couldn't eat because food had no taste, and I couldn't sleep because it was always on my mind.  Her and I just couldn't be together as friends, there was a tension between us. We'd always be so close physically when near each other, like invade personal space close, and I loved every second of it. Her boyfriend did not. So tension started to rise between us and we just grew apart.

After a little more time those feelings of sickness went away because I hadn't talked to her.  But every relationship I've been in since has never been what I've been looking for. I never feel that love for them, and they always made me feel empty. I just put it down to bad luck.

Last week I texted her out of nowhere and asked her to coffee which got a full, ""yes!!!"" response.  I don't know what came over me, I went on a date with this girl from work when I texted her out of nowhere to go out.  She was very cool and cute but I started to think about the girl from freshmen year a lot after that and suddenly found myself sending the text. Yesterday we got coffee and we drove around our old neighborhoods.  So much has changed in our lives and I feel like we both matured a lot.  

What broke me yesterday, even though I went into that day thinking, ""I want my old friend back"" was how close she naturally is with me.  She's never been that touchy close to people, she's bubbly and fun but not as much with other people as she is with me.  When we were parked outside of my old house I was looking to the left of me and I realized she was leaned over with her head leaned up against my shoulder, kind of cuddling me. There were more subtle things that day that brought those strong feelings of pressure back.

We talked about so much. Our lives and relationships, how all the ones we've been in fall apart or the feeling really just isn't there, or they don't last.  She told me personal things that she said she never told anyone.  It was a day in a long time where I was so comfortable and happy to be so close with someone.

Here I am 6 AM on a Saturday, no reason to be up this early, and I can't not think about it.  For a moment yesterday everything was perfect, driving down the road laughing about stupid jokes and new inside jokes we were making.

When I dropped her off she promised me to hangout again and it won't be hard to get her out of the house like it is with other people, she's an introvert like me.

I want to text her this morning something like, ""Hey do you wanna grab some food or just hangout or something Wednesday before work?"" I'm not sure though, maybe I'm just overthinking it.",27Jan2018,1
19,"I'm 31 year old male. I am the product of a Mexican mother and a white American father. My mother was super religious, superstitious, volatile, abusive. My father was secular but also a typical man from the south. Stern. Emotionless. You better develop a good work ethic boy. My way or the highway type attitude. Quick to anger. He was always gone for work. 
For the first 7 years of my life I went to an all black school. I was the only ""white boy"". I grew up on a farm out in the middle of nowhere. My parents never wanted to take me over to people's houses and no one ever wanted to come all the way out to where I lived, so I didn't really have any friends. So I just read a lot and used my imagination to play out in the pasture.
I grew up going to a Catholic church, and then a Baptist church, and then a Jehovah's Witness church. Until I finally rebelled and stopped going. 
I took some time after high school to go travel to Europe, Mexico, and parts of the Middle East and Asia. 
I consider myself a moderate but I have liberal leanings. 
I have social anxiety. 
Among other things. 

All of this has resulted in me feeling like I don't fit in anywhere. I look white but I'm not. I don't have the same life experiences. I'm half Mexican, but they don't accept me because I didn't grow up fully immersed in the culture.
I'm a man but I don't like the toxic masculine culture of the US. Where even guys who present themselves as nice will speak in derogatory terms about women in the presence of other men. I try to be more emotional and feeling and compassionate, but then I'm viewed as ""feminine"".
I have liberal views but I'm not a militant liberal because I grew up in Mexico and in the south and had the opportunity to travel around and I believe that nuance is necessary when forming a view or opinion.
I just don't know where I belong. I don't have a culture, a people that I can feel comfortable with. I feel pulled in so many different directions. One group wants me to be or thinks I should be one way. Another group wants me to be or thinks I should be another way. And I try to be myself. But I feel like people think I'm wierd. I want to find a group I can belong to, but I feel like my social anxiety prevents me from social exploration. I also might have adhd. I'm realizing I might have had it all my life. I can't focus on things. It's hard for me to follow through with tasks. Because of the environment in which I grew up, I was made to feel like I wasn't good enough. I was made to feel like the mistakes I made and the difficulty I had in learning things was just because I wasn't concentrating or trying hard enough. As a result I just thought I was dumb.
I also might be a sex addict. I've put myself in some dangerous situations just to get that sexual fix. I keep trying to be conscious about it and control it, but I inevitably give in.

I just don't know who to be. I don't know how to make friends. I don't know how to join or create a social group I'm comfortable with. I don't know what to do with my life. I don't know who to be. I'm tired of struggling with my mind.

But I'm also lower middle class in the US. Which means I have a semi comfortable living, but I don't have enough money for the Healthcare that I need. I want to try to start seeing a therapist but I can't afford it. I want to ask about my potential adhd. I want to see if I can take medication to make it better. I know I'm smart I just can't focus on things. I want to see if I truly am a sex addict. I want to talk to a professional about it. Someone who knows what they're talking about. When I try to talk to most people about it they just say, ""you're a guy, of course all you think about is sex."" It's not like that. It's unhealthy. I can feel it.

Sometimes I wonder whether I should leave the US. Sometimes I wonder if I would be happier in a country that has a better social safety net. I'm angry that I pay so much for health insurance but it barely covers anything. But it's all I can afford. I just don't know what to do. I don't know how to be. I don't know where to go. And it's eating me up inside. I can't sleep. I'm not eating that well anymore because the thought of food makes me nauseous.

I also recently had a bad break up that made me question myself and made me question other people. It was the type of relationship where I made an effort to open myself up. I made an effort to express myself as much as possible because I trusted this person and they seemed to reciprocate what I was feeling and saying. We talked about a life together. We talked about marriage. And then she went home for the holidays and when she came back something had changed. And within a matter of days our relationship had deteriorated and she cut off communication with me. And I really have no idea what happened. It came out of nowhere. 

And I just don't know how to process all of this. I wish I could turn off my brain. I wish I knew how to make myself feel better. But I can't figure it out. I feel lost.",27Jan2018,106

We went to a school meeting yesterday about the racism and they have said that they will look into it and if we experience racism again, they will suspend those responsible for this. While I don't think much will be done, it is at least good that things are moving forward.

Although this was very good I found out later that she had a cut on her wrist and when I asked who had done this to her.  She said that she had done this herself as a way of coping with the bullying.

She does boxing as a way of managing her anger and she is a formidable boxer and currently undefeated. So she keeps very fit on the whole.

Ive been living with my friend and roommate for a year and some change now 7 hours away. She made the effort to take me out last weekend since I wouldn't me there this weekend. She tried.

I came home for this birthday, and I see how much effort my mom put in. She decorated the living room full of Pokémon because she remembers how much I loved the games as a kid. She even got a pokeball piñata and pikachu goodiebags. It's a bit embarrassing, but sweet. She got an Oreo cake for later because she remembers it was my favorite kind.

Family members are coming from different parts to say hello.

I anticipated a small family immediate family dinner, not all of this. Birthday's make me anxious, I feel as if no one wants to be there and they have every reason to not want to be there.

I overheard my parents talk in hushed tones, saying they're happy I'm home for the weekend. My dad joking he's glad *I'm still alive* while my mom gives him a look and whacks his arm. He has a morbid sense of humor I inherited.

I do not want to be here. 
I do not want to be alive. 
That will probably never change.
I experience crippling depression,  overwhelm, pinpricks in my eyes every birthday, cry myself to sleep or stare at the ceiling with such a heavy weight in my chest because *oh god another year*.

But not this year. I am not allowing myself to be ungrateful. I don't deserve everything they're doing, but fuck they are trying. I need to try. They deserve that much. I have to try... I'd like to. Maybe this year will be different.

I'll try therapy again.
 I'll try medication again.
 I'll try to practice gratitude because I know I have a lot to be grateful for. I need to appreciate things more.

I want to try, at least another year. I want to try for them. If they're trying this hard for such a stupid person... I don't know, maybe something is there. 

Maybe this year will be different.

They're disgusted by how little characters of the past value things we consider fundamental traits of a decent human being today. It seems so simple now. Now that I've had my eyes opened and mind woke.

People should aim their anger and disappointment directly at themselves instead of using fictitious characters as scapegoats to produce an immediate sense of justice. Then they should look at the world as it is now and critique it with a fine tooth comb to elicit those unsavoury or simply plain wrong elements that will most likely lie dormant or remain invisible until the next seismic shift in the nation's morality.",27Jan2018,0

Was out doing my daily walk, and I found this Iphone in the middle of the road.  I hadn't passed anyone, so I assume it was from earlier today.  Sirir doesn't work, so I can't ask it to call a family member or anything.  What's the best way to get it back to its owner?",27Jan2018,1

Some of you might remember me as that disabled girl in grad school who posted about her happiness for being able to make dinner for a date.


Well, I've continued to see him and we're in a romantically exclusive relationship. I'm so extraordinarily happy. Life with him around is like something straight from one of my high school daydreams! I could tell you about it, but every time I try to explain, I end up typing a small novel. Maybe I'll write it in the comments. That's not what this post is about, so let me get to the point:


I started talking to him online on November 22nd (it wasn't a dating site. Oops. But, hey, I sent the first message so I still get points.)


Our first date was on the 6th of December.


Our second date (where I cooked him dinner at my place) was about a week later.


I left the city to go back home for Christmas and we saw each other for the third time on the 28th. Our relationship became exclusive and public on the 7th.



Technically, we've only been ""in a relationship"" for a little over two weeks.


This is the first time in my life where I've been in a healthy relationship where the dude is not ashamed to be with a disabled chick. I'm not used to being allowed to celebrate holidays with my significant other (I know it's messed up. I went through a lot of therapy before I realized that dating men who are ashamed of me is wrong.)


My friends are ecstatic about him and today, somebody asked me what my plans for valentine's day are.


My mind went absolutely white and now I'm kind of scared. I'm bad at intimate gestures. I never know how much is too much. I tend to go overboard because I'm a very emotional, sentimental person. I'm not good at putting my feelings into words, but I am very expressive when it comes to my actions, like cooking.


I'm excited about my first opportunity to ever celebrate this holiday with a significant other. I know it's not for a little while yet, but I'm a big planner. I'm a rational thinker who needs information, deadlines, and step-by-step procedures. 


We've gotten to a point of intimacy where we're pretty relaxed. We check in on each other once every two days or so, see each other maybe once a week (he always stays over and then spends the majority of the next day with me so it's a good, long visit). 


Otherwise, we let each other do our own things. He's got part-time classes and a part-time job. I'm trying to prepare to write a thesis. It's not exactly lovey-dovey 24/7 (which I would hate--this is ideal for me) so maybe a big gesture isn't appropriate?


I already cook very nice foods for him and I do want to do something special. I don't think me dressing up nicely and cooking him dinner would be at all significant. I want the day to be special, but I don't know what else to do.


I've had some thoughts like maybe we could go back to the place where we had our first date. It's sentimental enough. I kind of want to do more, but since we haven't technically been in a relationship for very long, I don't want to go overboard and scare him.


I had this idea for a gift, but I think it might be too much. Should I even get him a gift or is it too soon?


I asked him how he feels about Valentine's day and how comfortable he is about celebrating it/how much of a celebration he wants. He says he's excited to celebrate it with me and that we can do anything I want.


I'm very happy, but I'm also stunned and worried. I have no experience with this and I want it to be a good day, but I'm so sentimental, I don't want to be too much for him. He's the opposite of me in this regard: he's great at verbalizing his feelings, but isn't very good at making and responding to gestures.",27Jan2018,6
31,"A toxic friend is someone who unintentionally slows your individual growth as a person.

So how do you know if a friend is toxic? You just do. You can tell. Like their presence weighs you down. You're constantly doubting yourself around them and you wish that they would just stop. Stop pointing out your flaws. Stop overshadowing you. Stop the negative comments targeted at you. Stop trying to control you. Stop making you feel guilty for not doing things their way.

33,"I'm almost 23. My dad died when I was 11. I'm watching my mom slowly die in front of me from a ""mystery illness"" because she has not yet gone to a hospital, due to having no insurance, and other fears.
I am more stressed than I ever have been in my life, and I do not know where to turn, or who to talk to, since most people around me do not become caretakers for sickly and dying people at my age, let alone for their last living parent.
I'm so lost.",27Jan2018,36
34,"I'm not complaining, life is really good. My parents live out of state and I don't have any friends that live nearby so I don't have anyone to really talk to or spend the day with. This isn't a milestone birthday, either. The only things that I have to look forward to today is visiting my 88 year old grandmother at her nursing home and getting a pedicure. I'm just lonely and don't feel like reaching out to my old friends because we're not at the same spot in life feels like. They are either parents (which I am not, yet) or married (I am single) or not financially stable. I love kids, but hanging out with parents, the focus is on the kids. Married couples look for other couples, I always feel like a third wheel. Financially, I just bought a car and a house here in California, so it's somewhat intimidating (I've been told) to have a friend who owns a house and they still live in a house of roommates. But no one has reached out to me today either. And I don't use any social media anymore, so today is just another day. 

By this age, I thought I'd be married with at least a kid by now. I'm okay without the kid, being single really is lonely sometimes though. Online dating makes finding someone that I can connect with easier and difficult at the same time. I can find people to talk to, however most conversations lead to sex-talk. My last relationship left my self-esteem and ego mangled. In the months since it ended, I've gone on a few dates with a few guys, but obviously things didn't work out. I miss companionship the most. Reading in bed next to another person reading as well is something I miss about being in a relationship. Finding someone who reads is tough, too.

Because of how I felt after the break-up and the failed dates, I've decided to just focus on myself this year. I could lose some weight and focus on toning up my muscle definition. I could also make the house my other project for the year. I'm really excited about the house, so thank you for reading this, as I get to share this news with you. Finally having a place to call home and being able to provide a home for my future family is a great feeling. And I see the purchase as an investment for my future husband and I. So it's just really awesome and a bit sad at the same time because it's still somewhat of an empty home, except for the cats and I. 

Again, not complaining, I just wanted to vent/share.

Thank you for reading this.

35,"Like the title says.   Went out hiking today like I do most days.   Saw this girl that I really wanted to talk to and hike with.  Couldn't summon up the courage to approach this girl at all.  I kept thinking maybe it'd seem creepy or she wanted to be alone.  Thought of every reason to not talk to her while kicking myself for not approaching her. 

I've been in a couple since I was 22.  I've forgotten how to talk to girls while single!

So, does anyone have any advice before the next time something like this happens?",27Jan2018,1
36,"It’s a nice day outside where I am. Warmer than usual. Sunny. I took a nice walk. I was productive today (university student). I had some nice conversations with a couple friends and my roommate. I had good food. I’m trying to focus right now. But I feel gloom clutching at my throat, trying to climb into my mouth and climb down into my throat. Like a black slug with red eyes. I’m in a class about Hegel and this Phenomenology reading for next class is actually pretty lucid and not that bad. I’m about to have dinner My life is pretty nice right now. I can say that objectively. But still the gloomy slug keeps trying to go down my throat and I keep having to shake it off. It appears out of nowhere. It’s disgusting. Nihilistic. Bitter. Resentful. Filled with rage and angst and hatred. I’m afraid to speak to those but the closest to me because of the misanthropic vitriol I might spew. I might explode into a fit of rage and tear down the dainty glass houses everyone seems to like so fucking much. Well, there it is. Rage and bitterness.

37,"Caffeine supposedly never affected me; I don’t feel a rush and I can fall asleep just fine after an energy drink. But I still drink energy drinks very often (a common social activity between me and my two best friends is going out for energy drinks and then going on a walk) and I just don’t see myself wanting to stop that. 

A few days ago I had two 500 ml energy drinks in the span of 6 hours and the next day I woke up with terrible muscle pain that went away over time. I’m no doctor and maybe I’m just paranoid, but if that can be attributed to the caffeine in any way then it’s certainly a reason to be concerned. 

I’m just afraid I’m making a horrible mistake and I would greatly appreciate some advice. ",27Jan2018,3
