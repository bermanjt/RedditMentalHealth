Then you click on their profile and they literally spend 12 hours a day doing that. comment after comment, going on tirades. non stop.

Another example is the paranormal subreddit. I went on there for some cool ghost stories.

I was active in these groups every day. I became an owner of one chat, threw all of my money into getting chat effects and custom emotes, and online dated some of the people active in my specific group in middle school. Some were four years older than me.

I was active in these groups for almost six years, but I suddenly disappeared in a bout of paranoia in early 8th grade.

7,"At 10 I was in a strange place in the world. I had been homeschooled since the age of 7. I had made multiple half hearted attempts at suicide, and had been self harming on and off. I had also had experience with drugs, huffing the laughing gas out of whipped cream containers and extracting LSA from morning glory seeds. One day I was binge watching TED talks, when one came on titled ""My son was a Columbine shooter. This is my story."" It was the mother of Dylan Klebold, one of them. Dylan Klebold? I had heard that name before. I knew what Columbine was vaguely, but I knew it well enough that I could recognize a picture of them. My mother walked into the room and asked what I was watching. I told her. Instead of stopping me, she sat down next to me and watched, entranced. Sometimes she would say things like ""Wow, what a brave woman to come out on TV and talk like this"", and look intensively at me. I started researching Dylan Klebold on the Internet. I found a copy of his diary online. I was entranced. I had never in my life related to someone as much as I did to this kid. I loved quotes like ""I'm full of love and no one wants it"". I started writing a diary an quoting him in it. I even dressed like Dylan and Eric. I started listening to Bauhaus and Joy Division because they were into industrial music and sometimes goth bands like Nosferatu. I smoked because they did. I started cutting again because Dylan did it. I was homeschooled at the time, but my parents had recently considered taking me back. I started planning a bombing. I gathered supplies, which were weak because this, too, was half hearted. I didn't know how to feel about it. I was suicidal and lonely. I had no friends because of being homeschooled. I looked forward to dying in the bombing. However, interjected between the planning, was a convention for homeschoolers. I reunited with a boy who at the time was 13 and I was just barely 11. I knew him when I was younger but hated him because he would start fights. But this time I saw a tall, slightly muscular guy who looked like Jesus wearing a Slayer shirt, black jeans, and vans. He walked up to me and said ""Hey, Jeff"", and it hit me that it was him. We talked, we both liked Rammstein, Marilyn Manson, Nirvana, and other bands, we were both bisexual, and we were both interested in school shooters. Part of this was us being edgy, lustful teenagers and part of it was actual, depressed, alienated kids. I still know him. I think we're falling in love. I know it's wrong.

10,"Been through the ringer, 5+ therapists, 4+ psychiatrists, a partial hospitalization, an intensive outpatient program (+2 failed attempts at joining others), countless medications, and a partridge in a pear tree.

No job, been interviewing for months after a year+ of under/unemployment. Graduated magna cum laude from a top 15 university, but it clearly isn't worth anything since my resume is such shit after having to abruptly leave multiple jobs due to mental issues. Gained 40+ lbs in the past year, some due to a medication but also just from binge eating (like I did tonight - purging has been increasing in frequency but not enough to compensate [as much as it actually does, I'm aware that it's not particularly effective]). 

What is there left? Honestly, feeling like there is no hope for a happy future for me. The only thing I've ever looked forward to is maybe having kids someday, but I can't responsibly do that until I'm secure financially and emotionally, and I'm quickly losing faith that I'll ever get to that point. I have a supportive boyfriend, but he's successful in everything he ever tries in life, so he doesn't quite get what it's like to constantly fail. 

Spent my 24th birthday 2 days ago passed out on the couch after spending a few hours debating hurting myself vs waking up my boyfriend and telling him to take me to the hospital so I don't do anything stupid. 

I don't know what there is left to try.

13,"So naturally, I wasn't sure where to post this, but here we go.

As I was driving back to work today from my lunch break, a young woman ran into the street and flagged me down. At first I thought she must know someone behind me, but after a quick glance in my rearview mirror it was obvious that I was the only person around. 

With it being around 20Â° out I stopped and rolled down my passenger window to see what was going on. She immediately begged for me to let her in and take her anywhere. This girl was clearly frazzled and freezing, so I immediately just started to drive to get her away from whatever it was that she was running from. After a minute or so I asked her what was going on and she said that basically her boyfriend had been hitting her off and on throughout the morning and had progressed to trying to bash her head in with a hammer. She told me that she had been hiding from him outside and waited for her opportunity to run when she saw me drive up. 

At this time I asked her if I could call the police which she didn't want to do. She didn't have her phone or anything for that matter so I let her use mine to call someone. Whoever she got a hold of, she was able to tell them what had happened and it seemed like they basically told her that they were busy and that this was her problem. Naturally, if she wasn't already feeling like garbage she probably was for sure now. 

I then asked her if there was anywhere that I could take her and she told me yes, so we headed to I assume a friend's house. At this time I was able to start processing what was going on and started to talk to her a bit as she began to calm down. I started to think that maybe her friends were not equipped to help her out of this trouble and once again encouraged her to let me call the police. Once again she declined so I continued towards her friend's house. Once we arrived there she found out that nobody was home and it was pretty obvious she didn't know what to do next. 

I offered to just drive her around for a bit to let her collect her thoughts. As we drove I was able to ask her a few more questions and was able to offer her some food. We talked about how things had happened recently and what partly lead to today happening. She finally admitted that she needed more help than either I or her friends could give and allowed me to call a police officer. 

While we waited I found out that she is 25 and has three children that were thankfully not in the same town at this time. We talked about her background a bit and she also seemed embarrassed about her current situation of basically not having her kids, being homeless, and not having her own transportation. I told her that nobody is perfect and that starting right now she can start making the right decisions and that she already had by stopping me, a total stranger for help and then letting the police officer help her next. 

Shortly after that the police arrived, I gave the officer my information and went back to work. I hope she is ok, and able to get things figured out and no matter what, she didn't deserve to be hit and scared for her life today.

Also, I asked her if we could call her parents which she didn't want to do either. 

TL;DR - Helped out a young woman who was scared for her life today.",02Feb2018,6

- Sag your pants
- Wear gold chains/gold watches
- Do anything illegal because youâre a âthugâ, and itâs cool to do illegal things
- Fight
- Make sure to be in several relationships at a time, and to be a dick to your SO on top of that
- Argue with anyone, especially teachers when you donât want to do any work theyâve assigned

No, not at all. I literally see 75% of my schoolâs population acting like this on a day to day basis. It bothers me so much that such problematic actions are being praised.

How can people be happy trying to act like a shitty human being?

Iâm sorry if this is offensive, and Iâm sure Iâm gonna get a lecture or theâBorn in the wrong generationâ shit, but I see so many problems with how this is something that is looked up to. It makes me sick to see teenagers and tweens acting like this.

16,"Sorry for the long read. I thought writing it out would help me make a decision, but it has not.

I graduated from college three years ago and I have found it difficult to stay in a job that is not low-level retail or food service. While I don't like the schedules and I can barely live off of the pay, I actually like the work. I like being busy and social, and I hate sitting down all day. 

The Tuesday after I graduated college in May 2015 I returned to my home state to live with my parents in a fairly small town, but not the same small town I grew up in. I worked at a couple of extremely gross restaurants and also had a part-time retail job. I was making little money and had no friends. After eight months I decided I wanted a social life again, so I cashed in my frequent flyer miles and bought a one way ticket back to the town where I went to college.

After crashing with friends for a month or so I landed a job at a technology company. It was the kind of place with happy hours, game rooms, a young, rapidly expanding employee pool, health insurance...and I hated it. I loved living in that town, and I could see my friends again, but my work life was miserable and I was barely scraping by. I couldn't take being trapped in that office for 40 hours a week while only having 4-8 hours of work to do and 15 hours of pointless meetings to attend. Whenever I asked for more client work, I was told I already had projects to work on. After the first month I asked every week for more work and always got the same answer, no matter how I tried to ask it or how much I demonstrated what I had already done. 

I tried to stretch out the day by taking longer lunches, playing ping pong, doing self-guided trainings on the company's software, but it was purgatory. I started putting together the furniture for the new employees (the company almost doubled in size during those six months) just to have something to do. I felt extremely unsatisfied and found myself unable to sleep for days at a time. I had been applying to other jobs since the first two weeks of working there but I was unable get anything full-time. I did not have a car and could not afford one while paying rent, so working more than one job was difficult as that town did not have a bus system that ran outside of normal business hours or on weekends and I had to bike everywhere. 

I tried for five months but could not find another job, or even two part-time jobs where the schedules worked that I could also ride my bike to. There was a two-day stretch where, the first night, I was unable to sleep. That morning, the girl I had been dating for the past few months broke up with me via text almost immediately after she walked out of my front door. Later that day, the chain on my ancient bicycle broke while I was making a turn. I still have scars on my palms and knees from that fall. That night I was unable to sleep again, as the friends that I was living with decided to each drink a case of beer and scream at the TV until five in the morning. I showed up to work at eight, where after several hours of twiddling my thumbs, trying desperately not to fall asleep at my desk, I sat in on a phone meeting where one of our client's project managers screamed at one of their employees who was working from home watching his sick children. I could hear the kids crying in the background. I decided that I was done. It was an extremely difficult decision, but I decided to go back to my home state to figure myself out.

I moved back in with my parents. Again. The first thing I did was buy a crappy used car since I no longer had to pay rent and could afford the car payments. I didn't want to face the same job situation again. I got my retail job back but at full time in a supervisory position, and although I was not making enough money to move out I enjoyed the job. I also started taking online college courses full-time, allowing me to defer my massive loan payments. I still wasn't making friends though. I stopped taking classes during the second semester because I hated the program and decided I would rather spend the money just paying back my student loans.

I was running into problems with the retail job (I caught my boss selling handguns to customers under the table, which was surprisingly legal in my state but it made me feel extremely unsafe--we were supposed to be selling clothes. I reported him to corporate and he was not disciplined in any way). I was afraid of retaliation. I first tried to transfer to another store in a large city a few hours away, but I found out they would pay me even less hourly and that I would not be able to afford the move, so I decided to stay at my current location, where at least I had a place to live if I was suddenly let go. 

For insurance, I took another job on top of it where I worked at a large warehouse-style store, mostly unloading shipments in the stockroom. I decided that job was pretty good, but it was a huge corporate chain with strict employee policies so I could only be there part time. I was not fired from the clothing store, but instead had to take on more responsibility. My gunrunning boss was promoted to regional manager and was spending lots of time at other locations so I had to take up the slack. I had a lot of trouble sleeping and had recurring nightmares where he would shoot me with a pistol while I was in the store. After a couple months of working seven days a week between a full-time and a part-time job and regularly pulling 11-12 hour days where I would open, run, and close the small clothing store, I quit that job. 

I had paid off the car that I had bought a year earlier and had a good amount of money saved up, and I was ready to drive back to where I went to college to try again. Then I went to get my car inspected and they found several severe mechanical problems, but the worst was that they found a large crack in the extremely rusted chassis. The mechanic said that he would pass the car this time, but there was no way it would pass next year if it even made it through the winter. I asked him if I could drive it across the country and he laughed. I decided to buy a decent car that could one day make that drive. It took most of my savings because I didn't want to have to make huge payments on it since I now only had a part-time job.

Today I work part-time at the large corporate retail chain...and I actually like it. I would like to spend more time with customers than I do, but I like the other people who work in the back and the physical nature of the job. The only problem is I don't make enough money to move out of my parent's house. They gave me forty-hour weeks through November and December, but now that the holiday season has ended I've been working part time only, trying to figure out something better to do. I think I've found it. I want to write science fiction. I've been writing a lot lately in my free time, and I'm really starting to enjoy it. It was always something I was decent at during school, but didn't like. Now that I can write whatever I want, though, it's kind of fun. 

I am right now making just enough money with the part-time job to pay my bills as long as I still live at home and my eating out and entertainment budget stays at $20 a month. The social life problem is still challenging, and I still miss my friends in the other state. I have been back a year and a half and I have no friends here. I still live with  my parents.

A few weeks ago my dad decided that he has been unhappy for the last ten years and wants to divorce my mom, get rid of the house, and move to another state where he has 'always wanted to live'. This was a shock to the rest of us. It is likely I will no have no place to live by May, but it could be earlier if my dad finds a job sooner rather than later. It's funny, because he was unemployed for a year and a half when I was in high school, and we were desperate for him to find something. Now, I hope no one hires him so that I have a place to live. Not that being at home has been fun for the past month. 

My friends in the town I went to college in have offered me a places to stay temporarily if I go back. I have a reliable car now and $4000, enough to make the trip and be okay as long as I get some kind of income going by the end of three months. I tried to defer my student loans so I would have more of a buffer as I currently make around $1000 a month, but was denied. I am already paying the minimum payment on my student loans, which is still a few hundred per month. No one in my family can give me financial assistance beyond letting me live in the house without paying rent.

So, what do I do? If I stay in my current state, I will be able to have more money to use as a buffer, and I will be able to work less as it is cheaper to live here and will still have some time to write. If I move back to the town where I went to college, it is on the other side of the country and the trip would cost a few hundred dollars in gas even if I sleep in my car along the way, plus I would prefer to save enough to make it somewhere warm in case it all goes horribly wrong. I would have friends nearby, but would probably end up working two or more part-time retail/food service jobs 50+ hours a week and would have little time or energy to see my friends or pursue writing. I would not like to keep making the same mistakes over and over again, but I am having trouble seeing other options.

When I ask my friends, they want me to come back. My parents tell me to suck it up and get a ""real job"" here, in my home state. My current job would like me to stay as long as I can, although they cannot offer me full time work unless one of the supervisors leaves. They have all been at the location 3-10 years, which is an eternity in retail, so I'm not holding my breath. Another option is to take up an offer from one my extended family members to maybe get a job at her office in a large, strange city which would be very similar to the work that I was doing that I hated so much. I don't feel like any choice is right, and I don't know what to do.

I miss my friends from college, who all still live in that same town, but I still haven't given up hope on making a social life here although I am getting more and more discouraged. There just aren't a ton of young people around, and the ones that I've met and liked have almost all moved away after a few months. One killed himself. My social life mostly consists of bad Tinder dates, which I've stopped bothering with lately. I always had a ton of friends growing up and in college and it has been really lonely now that I am out of school. 

The thing is--except for the financial and social situation, I'm happy. I'm not getting smashed 4+ nights a week like when I was in school or living back with my college friends. I eat right, I lift weights, I run a lot--I look good. I like my part time job, and I am more comfortable with myself than I have ever been. In the last year and a half I was able to visit some of my friends from high school who I hadn't seen in years. I got to see my favorite band perform on my birthday in an awesome small venue. I went to England, the Netherlands, and Germany for two weeks, thanks to accrued PTO from the clothing store and being able to stay with friends for free. I used to read 4-5 novels a month in middle and high school, and after several years of partying and mostly not reading, I've started again thanks to the library and LibGen and it is wonderful. I think that if I get better at writing and sell some stories I can eke out a living in combination with part-time retail work, but establishing a writing career will take more time than the three months I have right now. All the details feel right but when I look at the big picture I am utterly lost. I have until May, at best, to get out of the house before I am forced out. What should I do?

18,"I've never owned a dishwasher in my life. My parents owned one when I was growing up but never used it to keep the water bill down. One of my chores from the time I was eight until I moved out was to do the dishes, and it was my least favorite. I'd rather take out the trash or do laundry, but those tasks were given to my brothers. My first job consisted of washing dishes. My second job, the same, as well as various other jobs throughout. When I wasn't washing dishes at home, I was doing it at work. 

My wife and I have lived in numerous places over the five years that we've been together, escalating in value along the way. First it was an old, run down two bedroom house that was falling apart. Then an income based apartment. Then we bought a trailer. Then we sold it and bought another one that was newer and more spacious. None of these places had the luxury of a dishwasher. This past August, after years of struggling, we finally bought our first actual house. It's a wonderful four bedroom, three bathroom. It's everything I've ever wanted in a home. After six months of owning it, I am still amazed by it. It also has a dishwasher...

When we first moved in, I was so stoked that it came with it. Not only did it have one, but it was in a matching set with the refrigerator, stove, and microwave. The only problem was that the power cord wasn't hooked up. So, for six months, I hand washed the dishes, begrudgingly at that, each time eying the dishwasher with envy.

Today, I decided that it was going to the day that I finally installed the power cord. I pulled it out, and after going to the hardware store and buying a home electrical kit, I installed the cord, triple checking to make sure everything was done correctly. 

I decided I was going to try to run a rinse cycle to check for leaks before actually trying to wash a load. However, when I went to start it up, nothing happened. The lights on the display panel were on, but it refused to start. I almost gave up and accepted that I would either have to pay an exorbitant amount of money for a repairman to check it out, or continue washing them by hand for the rest of my days. I didn't do that, however. After taking off the front panel, I found that the locking mechanism was disconnected, so I simply plugged it back in. I can honestly say that the hardest part was getting the panel to line back up with the screw holes. 

I washed my first load of dishes in the dishwasher today. They came out just as clean as they would have if I had washed them by hand. I feel as though I have seen how the other half lives, and that I moved up an inch in the world. I didn't have to touch slimy pieces of food. I didn't have to dry them, because the dishwasher came equipped with a dryer. I'm not naive enough to think washing dishes is the worst thing in the world to do, but I have really come to dislike doing it. What a time to be alive.",02Feb2018,11
19,"Exaggeration, but I haven't had a boner in like...2 weeks?

I started this drug finasteride a while ago for my hairloss. If you guys have never heard of it, it often affects libido as part of the mechanism is lowering certain testosterone levels. It affected my libido, but definitely didn't kill it entirely. 

A few weeks ago I started Zoloft for my long under-treated anxiety/depression. It is working incredibly well and I really couldn't be happier with the results so far. I really haven't felt better in years. The only problem is, as I've already stated, I don't get erections anymore and am not really interested in sex (and to be honest, I'm generally kind of a horn-dog).

I'm going to visit my bf out of town this weekend, so we'll see how that goes. But honestly, if it's not working down there, it still feels worth it to me to continue both of my meds. I'm not really torn up about it, but it's not really something I can talk about with anybody I know so I felt like putting it out there, thanks for reading.

I have a great relationship with them and theyâre usually pretty cool and understanding about most things, but I just know that this is something they wouldnât approve of. I guess my question is, do you think itâs be worth the money to possible make my parents upset? Or would it be really awful if I hid it from my parents? I just have a friend who works there now and makes like $700 a night and I could really use that kind of money, especially to help with school. All opinions and any advice would be wonderful!!

25,"I've told this story quite a few times over the course of last 32 years about a woman I made eye contact with one day in 1985 while  working at Tower Records in Phoenix.
I'm posting my story so that it can live on in the internet universe forever.  Although shorter than your average short story I'm not gonna post it all at once because of my hatred for typing, so bear with me.
My first job was at Tower Records I was 17 and still in high school.  One day, as I was stocking shelves with merchandise, vinyl records, I happened to glance across the store to see the most gorgeous woman with the dreamiest eyes I'd ever seen, I was mesmerized.
I'm not sure how long I'd been staring at her before I realized she was looking at me.  Then she smiled and I melted.  She was with someone that day so I decided flirting with her may not be the best idea I'd ever had  so I kept to myself and went on with my day.  That image of her was burned into my memory.  That was 1985.  Fast forward a few years somewhere around 1989 or 90.
 As a gay female in y very early 20's I spent a lot of time, as I'm sure a lot of us did, in the girl bars drinking and dancing an just have a good time.  One night I was at my favorite hang out, called Incognito, I was on a date and shooting pool when I looked up and noticed at the far end of the bar little miss dreamy eyes !  We made eye contact..again then she smiled and I melted.  What are the odds ?!  Because I was on a date flirting with another woman would have been rude.  I always felt I'd missed a golden opportunity that night.
Fast forward a few more years around the mid 1990's....

28,"Hey, I posted this in r/relationships but the mods removed it, saying it would be better suited here.

I just got finished watching a certain TV series and this question that's actually come up in my mind before came back in full force. Why all this desire to be with a girl who, even if she is incredibly hot, wouldn't exactly be very nice to me or to others?

Now, I should probably describe exactly who a ""bad girl"" is here exactly so we're all on the same page. I don't mean a girl who manipulates others, (or at least not constantly at all) but a girl who is gruff. Someone who has an edge to her. Who would have no qualms about beating the **** out of someone. Even if that someone is her lover. A girl who has a devil-may-care attitude about things, generally speaking, and who isn't afraid at all to insult and berate you when she feels like it.

It seems crazy that that is a girl I'm very much attracted to. Why would I want someone who has no qualms about laying hands on me and telling me I look like **** with a sneer and a dark look in her eyes? I honestly can't believe myself, but it's true nonetheless, and I'd be blind to deny it.

I don't know. Maybe I'm just being melodramatic, but this is a pattern I'm really starting to notice here and it worries me. More specifically, it worries me that I might get exactly what I want. That I'll land myself into an abusive relationship that I won't want to break off because I'll be so enamored with her and turn a blind eye to everything that she does to me.

**I also replied to this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7upwcq/why_do_i_25m_feel_such_an_attraction_to_bad_girls/dtm9lsl/):** I think I got you. You are not saying that you want to be abused, just that you like a empowered girl that have the capacity to not the need. That is just a Masochist attraction. Doesn't mean you have a problem, but since the majority of men are Sadists it can be confusing.

**With this:** You may be right in that it is a type of Masochism, although the stereotypical image of a BDSM woman in tight leather and a whip really doesn't do anything at all for me. Discarding that though, the image of a hardened, beautiful, powerful woman does indeed attract me. Someone who, one day, I can be having a casual smooth conversation and a great night of sex with, and then the next, I might get slapped and beaten some because, I don't know, I had the nerve to interrupt her during a disagreement.

In my mind, she would tell me that this is simply the world as it is and that it was time I learned that. Again, words I know that aren't really true but I'm tempted to agree with them and her fully anyway, not just to make her happy but also because a part of me also does agree that perhaps I deserve this abuse she gives, and even if I didn't, that it would help me to learn and to harden myself against pain. To be able to brush it aside as she does and to accept anything that she gives me.",02Feb2018,1
29,"I've been called weird my whole life, even now as an adult. I was always the the quiet one, preferring to stay home over partying and acting out. I've been mislabeled as being antisocial and isolating, that I need help. If you've dealt and lived with abusive narcissists, you'd probably think differently too. I stay quiet because I have no filter and sometimes saying something may get me into more trouble. Most people do not understand this and I'm tired of repeating myself. I wasn't meant to fit it and if ya call me weird, thank you for the compliment. There's nothing wrong with being different, just as long as you're not hurting anyone.

They know I joke. I know they do. And I think it's genuinely funny.

But still. A little sincerity goes a long way. Lately I've started giving genuine compliments, and it's amazing! People are so happy! 

When people are stressing out about an essay, I don't just go ""you'll do fine"". I tell them what I honestly think, that they're genuinely some of the smartest and most talented people I've met, and that I'm certain they'll ace it. 

I've even started telling my friends I love them, because damn it, I do!

36,"I hope this is the right sub.

I just got out of a very unhealthy 5 year relationship. It was not a clean break when we broke up because we live together after that (financial reasons). About 2 weeks before he moved out, he found someone and they were in a relationship. I will admit, even though I broke up with him, it was hard to see him happy like that. 

He finally moved out and stopped by to pick up the last of his stuff. He had an argument over who was keeping the TV and he left angry.  He then blocked my number. 

He called me 2 hours later crying hysterically saying that his new gf used him and dumped him. He then told me that he was going to take some pills and go for a drive and he just wanted to tell me goodbye. I immediately texted a family member of his while staying on the phone with him. I got into my car and drove towards him. He hung up then blocked my number again. He called a second time angry because I told a family member and because I did that, he was going to take more pills. I stayed on the line with him while I drove towards him. 

The drive is about 45 mins and he refused to tell me where he was (he was no longer at his house). I was crying and begging him not to go through with it. I found him and he was a little out of it but he was conscious. I told him I had to leave because I didnât want to watch him die. So I left, drove around the corner and called 911. Cops and paramedics came and took him. 

Now heâs in a psychiatric hospital because of his attempt. He called me and texted me to tell me heâs going to make sure âI pay for what I did.â He also blames me for ruining his life. He is upset because he is locked in there and now his whole family knows. 

I do not regret calling 911 to save his life. Even though we are not together anymore, I still love and care for him. Now Iâm worried about his actions when he gets out, which should be today. I should probably get a restraining order but Iâm afraid of making him even angrier. 

Iâm struggling moving away from the roll of his caretaker. I feel like all he has to do is call/text and I feel obligated to do any favor for him. I know this is unhealthy and makes me an enabler but now with how angry he is, Iâm scared of what that phone call might cost me. 

UPDATE: He is out. He tried calling me while I was at work. His out of state brother is in town and getting the last of his stuff. I was told he would not come and the brother is coming alone. I have a family member here with me just in case. ",02Feb2018,20
38,"That's today.   Fuck today.  Fuck  love.  Screw her for making me love her like this.  No, I don't mean that.  I just want her to be happy and if that's not going to be with me then... I don't know.  I can see the sun shining and the blue sky today but it's nothing.  It's thin and empty and worthless.  

This coming year is going to be dark, and cold, and empty.  It's going to be going through the motions.  It's going to be a jelly donut with no filling.  It's going to be all the bitterness of love with none of the sweet.  It's going to be struggling financially and emotionally.  It's going to be a shitty fucking year.  And today I don't feel up to it.  I know I can get through it, but today I don't know how.  Those empty months behind today are scaring me.

There are some people I know that say there are some days where they just sit down, from the start of the day, and study all day for a test, to the end of the day. This is something that I cannot comprehend doing. Now I know this is probably giving off the impression that I donât study for any tests/quizzes/exams I have, but that is not true. Funnily enough, Iâm in the middle of a break from studying for my Natural sciences exam lol. But, for me, I canât study for 8-12 hours in a single day, I sit down for 2 hours, maximum 3 hours, and thatâs all.

41,"When I my wife and I went to bed last night, I fell asleep with a set of headphones on listening to music.

During the night I dreamed that I saw someone sneaking around in the house with us. I got up to investigate and even though I was sure I saw someone moving in the darkness, when I turned on the lights there was no one there. I began to search the whole house, but found no one.

Suddenly I realized that when I got up I had taken off my headphones, yet somehow I could still hear music loudly playing. I couldn't understand how I could still hear the music if I'd taken off the headphones. I reached up and felt my ears and sure enough the headphones were not there, yet the music was still loudly playing in my head. Suddenly I realized that I was still asleep and dreaming. I forced myself to wake up a second time. As I slowly woke up, I stumbled out of bed and took off the headphones. I had to go to the bathroom and headed in that direction. As I headed for the bathroom it suddenly occurred to me that could still hear the music.

I look down and I have the headphones in my hands. Why am I carrying the headphones to the bathroom with me? Better yet, why is the music is still so loudly playing in my head? I'm totally confused at this point. How can I have the headphones my hands yet still be hearing the music in my head?

I turn back toward the bedroom in the confusion and it suddenly occurs to me that I went to bed in a RV in Las Vegas, how in the world did I get in my grandmotherâs house in Tennessee?

Once again I realized that must still be asleep and began to freak out a little, after a long struggle I am finally able to force myself to wake up yet a second time. As I woke up I pulled the headphones off my head and dropped them on the stand beside the bed.

I turned over to talk to my wife but she wouldnât answer me. I shook her and she wouldnât wake up. Suddenly the song that was playing ended and another began. What??? How?? I had taken of the headphones. I felt beside the bed in the darkness and sure enough the headphones were laying there. I reached up and felt my ears and there was nothing there. At this point I began to really freak out. I have already woke up twice. Where is the music coming from? Why wonât my wife wake up? What is happening to me?

Slowly I realize that I am still asleep and I somehow begin to claw myself back to conciseness. For long moments I am paralyzed, it is as though I am climbing a mountain while buried in Jell-O, but eventually, after a long struggle, I am able to set up in the bed.

As I sat there covered with sweat, for long moments I hesitate to take of the headphones. Will the music still be there? Am I still asleep? But after a while I realized I had to know if I was really awake this time. I took off the headphones, and much to my relief the music finally went away.

I turned over and shook my wife awake, just to make sure. Her grumpiness at being awakened from a sound sleep at 2:30 in the morning convinced me that I was really awake this time.

I was in a dream in a dream in a dream. I had to wake up three times before I got all the way out.

That was one of the most disconcerting and unusual things I've ever experienced. So very bizarre that I had to write it down. That story is worthy of a horror movie. Can you imagine waking up again and again and again and realizing that you are asleep and never able to wake up for real? Scary.",02Feb2018,4

46,"In the US citizens pay far too much for drugs, therapies and pharmaceuticals.  I have long wanted to raise challenge to the idea that the Non-Profits that raise funding for finding these cures and treatments get literally nothing in return for all the money raised by citizens while the developers get to take the public for a financial ride. 

When I attempt to ask questions about this in various subreddits I am simply told ""research is expensive, and somebody has to put up the $$"".  I do not disagree with this, but I wanted to know who is putting up the money, how much comes from fundrasing vs corporations and if colleges, where students pay to go, get to sell their findings and patents to the Industrialized medicinal complex.  

What I found raises more questions.  

** After doing some Google-Fu I came up with [This](http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Disease/NCPF/Fund.pdf) reviewing 1999 to 1997.  While I learned a great deal from this write up, I found myself with so many more questions..

While Non-Profit agencies only accounted for 6% of funding in 1999 for Cancer research specifically, The NCI (Nat. Cancer Inst.) funded 47% of research into Cancer research. Other branches of the Federal government made up another 14% of the funding.  State funding account for 4% of the funding. Industry accounted for, then 31%.

So in one capacity or another, Citizens -- either by donation or taxes covered, roughly 69% of all research into Cancer.  

What I have not come to find yet is what happens to those findings.  I imagine, whomever the NCI gives a grant to gets to patent or protect their findings for their own financial gain (However, simply put. I do not know, yet.) 

After this, I looked at the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge Blog.  They seem to keep very good records of their spending and since 2014 have spent something along the lines of ~95million of their 155million raised.  That is not concerning, what I am curious about is why corporations like ""General Electric"" are co-funding these studies.  My assumption is that they are getting patents on the research.  

The one organization outlined in this report that I need to find out more information on, but seems like they might be in it for the true benefit of mankind (Maybe?) is HHMI (Howard Hughes Medical Institute).  From a brief overview in here, it sounds like they do things a little bit more differently and that they have developed and given to the medical community advances that have improved the medical world overall. 

I still do not know.  I understand (at least from 1999 standards) donations of the grassroots kinds do not make up for ""very much"" of the overall research dollars, yet our taxes do. 

While I do not actually disagree with tax dollars funding research (We should be interested in the advancement of health of all citizens of the world), I question the return we get on our investment.  Overpriced hospital visits, pharmaceuticals, surgeries, labor...  

Someone please help me understand what I am missing, or why my view on this is skewed.",02Feb2018,1
