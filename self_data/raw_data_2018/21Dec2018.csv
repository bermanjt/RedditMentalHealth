0,"I was in a car accident a few weeks ago. Things flew all over my car. My phone fell on the floor, my drink spilled everywhere, my lunch all over the place. When I was cleaning the mess, I found one of those stones you gave me. You gave me a handful of them after we got matching tarot decks. I have no idea where it came from, I swear I put them all in my watch box, but there was a piece of tiger's eye laying on the floor of the driver's side. It made me think of you.

I worked up the nerve to finally say hi again and found you deleted your Instagram account. That was the last way I had to get in touch with you. That's it. You're literally disconnected from my life forever now. That door is shut. As well it should be. We were on different pages, at different points in our lives. It couldn't work and honestly what we had was super short lived and I'm probably romanticizing everything in my head.

I just wanted to say hi and Merry Christmas. I hope St. Pete is treating you better than this small, boring ass town ever did. I hope that guy you're with now can be more emotionally available than I was and meet you where you need to be met and give you the attention and affection you deserve.

I genuinely just hope you're happy because you were such a cool person when we were together. You deserve so much more in life than you had then and I hope things are looking up for you.

Maybe I'll see you around, but probably not.",21Dec2018,1
1,"This just happened. I’m at the airport and a lady in front of me says, oh don’t check the other ticket, I bought it so nobody sits next to me in first class. Thought this was funny. Guess she has money to spend ",21Dec2018,1
2,"So basically I'm a freshman in university now, and today there was a drink going on at my local study club. I have a bunch of semi-friends and like 3 or 4 good friends from uni. 

So I went to the bar and shortly after, I found a bunch of my semi-friends standing there, talking to eachother and having a good time. They said hey to me and I joined the group. I stood there for a solid 10 minutes, just standing there and listening to the conversation like a weirdo, secretly on the verge of crying. I had no idea when and how to talk to them or even what to say in the first place. 

This is not the first time this happened. This description is every group conversation/activity I have ever had, except for family and really close friends (and even then only when there are less than 4 people). 

1 on 1 I can have great conversations with people. Even with people I don't know that well. And if I am already decent friends with both people, I also do fine in 3-people conversations. When in text/chat form, I can easily talk to bigger groups of people. Via chat I am actually quite charismatic and I am often even leading the conversation. I can always come up with entertaining/interesting things to say or good questions to ask this way. Even when I don't even know the people I chat with.

But real life group socializing is an absolute NIGHTMARE. It's like my brain cannot think at all whenever I'm in the situation. I turn into the lamest, most boring person you could possibly imagine. Someone that only stands there saying nothing. Even when I'm in a bigger group of good friends. 

How do you even do this shit??? It comes so naturally to all people. And over 95% of socializing ever is done this way, which means I virtually cannot socialize at all unless I am forced to be with 1 or 2 other people. 

They say I have to ""practice"" and ""get used to it"". But it's been like this for the past 5 years. I attend every social event I possibly can and ALWAYS make time for it when I'm asked. But it always ends up like this and there doesn't seem to be any improvement. I cannot ""practice"" socializing when I'm not socializing in the first place, but just standing/sitting there in the background.

If anyone could make a detailed explanation on how to so group conversations, specifically aimed at me and like, ridiculously easy, that would be amazing. Assume that I am an alien and literally know nothing about socializing at all.

Another big problem this causes is that there is absolutely no way I can get a girlfriend like this. I only talk to a girl like twice a month or so. When I stay with my group of (semi-) friends, I rarely ever meet girls. And my study has 40% of them. 

But I feel super awkward about joining other groups (and I don't just want this for the girls, some groups just appear to be more interesting to be with). How the fuck am I supposed to do this when I can barely even function in a group I'm familiar with?? 

Anyway I have no social life whatsoever like this. I do most of my things alone even though I take every opportunity I get to not do so. Yet most people are always having fun in groups and everyone seems to know eachother very well.

3,"this is the first year that I only had like 7 people tell me happy birthday and it was all family except two. which shouldn’t be a big deal but it made me kinda sad i guess? it reminds me that i’ve grown apart from so many friends in the past year because we’ve all taken different paths in life and it’s just weird to not have them around as much as they used to be. even on social media none of us interact anymore :(

sad birthday hours

4,"I heard the news today. He’s one of those parents that just becomes progressively passive aggressive and then proceeds to fucking go at you for the most minuscule things you do. I have spent my time trying to avoid him by taking extra hours of work and staying up late while they are asleep, I am literally sleep deprived because I try to be awake so most of the time I don’t have to deal with them. And I bet there’s going to be a commenter “oh you’re such a child. You should be happy you at least have parents.” Or “just ignore them” mtoher fucker, I have tried that. 20 fucking years. I’m at a tipping point. I can’t do this. I can’t do this. ",21Dec2018,1
5,"So yeah, as you’re all thinking, I am one stupid motherfucker. It was my first time at strip club ever and I was unaware of how it worked at all. 

To spare the details It was a mix of drunk, very nervous, horny, and peer pressure (I hate myself most for this factor) 

I went in the next day when they opened up and explained my story of how i was fucked up, felt taken advantage of cuz didn’t get what I paid for, was misled, and how I simply can’t afford this much of a charge and that it could set me back financially extremely bad. He understood but said I’d have to talk to the night manager that was there during my visit and explain to him and hopefully I get my money back. I’m leaving in a few hours with my younger brother to head there.(he is an amazing brother and far better than I will ever be and has been supporting me all day as I’ve cried and came to the club earlier in case i had Trouble standing up, defending myself, or stuttering. I’m a huge pussy)

I currently have 8000$ in the bank. Yesterday was my first day of a 2week vacation and 6/8 of that money was made from my new job that I’ve been only working 6 weeks at. This was supposed to be saved and spent on family and myself while I’m on vacay. 
Now it’s going towards this and I’ll have probably just under 2000$ and that just is Fucking shitty and I have no one to blame for but myself and I got an expensive lesson.

Can I bounce back from this ? 
Or I guess a better question is take the loss,  move on and accept that my current  short term plans and goals are set back by 7grand? 
Next 2k paycheck comes, not tomorrow, but next Friday.

I currently live at home rent free and food free which helps but what other cutbacks can I do to make up for this. (I’m guessing I’ll just be having less fun since I can’t spend)
I still really want to get my family gifts (this was my first job and first time I had thousands of dollars in my account and wanted to finally get good gifts for my family) normally we don’t get each other much 

EXTRA (sad) DETAILS ARE BELOW but I wanted to keep it short and related to this sub , in the above text if that’s okay.

What was supposed to be 100$ lap dance turned to an additional 1800$ (horniness) which included a more physical   Session (I was thinking Bj since it was this much money and it seemed implied by the girl but I was gullible) then it turned to additional 4200$(peer pressure, no backbone) a second girl was brought in before I paid the  4200 and I just somehow got pressured when I was saying “this is too expensive” and “I can’t afford this” but sex seemed implied at this point and “it’s your first time baby” 

I started to tremble as I was writing the total on the receipt, signing my name, doing the fingerprint but I felt like it was not possible to opt out at this point and I had already paid the 2000$ from earlier. I think it dawned on me how bad I am actually Fucking myself over. 

THEY EVEN BROUGHT IN A 3rd GIRL TO SELL ME AND I FINALLY SAID NO TO THAT but still I had already put myself 7k in the hole.

Keep in mind the 3 charged happened in 30 minutes and they used tactics that made me feel pushed  and seduced  and it happened so quickly I was confused and scared.

1230am: lap dance charge 
- this is supposed to be an hour and it only lasted 10 min while someone was ringing my card. 
So I got charged 100$ then 10 minutes at
1240am: she convinces me to upgrade to the 1500$ package (also supposed to be an hour)
20 minutes later second girl is seducing me and pressuring to pay for her so I do (4200$) 

3 times I signed, fingerprint, and photo to prove it was me. It could’ve been prevented.
I felt scammed and taken advantage of. I almost cried when credit company called me on the phone asking if this is me and I had to verify yes. The sales pitch lady bitch was looming over, I wanted to say on the phone it was fraud and wanted to just leave but they had too much evidence of me allowing this.

I freak out if I lose like 50$ at a casino. This was seven thousand fucking dollars and my stomach is gonna drop when look at my bank account after I pay this off.

Pls roast me so Fucking hard i hate myself so much letting my horniness and beta attitude lead to this life changing event.

All in Fucking 30 minutes man.",21Dec2018,1
6,"So I just had a minor debate over iOS vs Android security in a chat with some guy who doesn't use a smartphone. It's almost definitely me, but I couldn't help getting a snobbish ""No one can collect my data because I use a Linux computer and a dumbphone, so I'm better than you"" vibe, and I guess the frustration motivated me to look up stuff about young people who don't use smartphones. While the data thing is a valid concern I've made efforts to take into account, as for phones...well.

&amp;#x200B;

Hoo boy.

&amp;#x200B;

I got my first smartphone earlier this year and I love the thing. I held onto my old flip phone for financial reasons and habit, but I'd wanted a smartphone too. Hoenstly, I don't think much has changed in my habits: just the medium. I mean, I used to carry my laptop around my room while listening to music until I had an mp3 player...and after my mother confiscated it permanently. Then I got my own, and just downloaded stuff and played it. Still do, though I stream directly with my phone. And I guess that's my point.

&amp;#x200B;

Having a smartphone doesn't equal being the stereotypical obnoxious smartphone user. Though enough dumbphone users seem to think it does.

&amp;#x200B;

It's one thing if you don't like smartphones (that guy from chat said he didn't). It's another to be a self-righteous jerk about it. ""Oh, I don't have a high-res phone camera, so I have to look with my actual eyes!"" ""I actually use my brain instead of looking at a screen"" ""I have REAL friends and deep meaningful relationships, not people online"". Or just snobbery of thinking an adult playing a phone game is ""pathetic"", or other nonsense.

&amp;#x200B;

Using a smartphone isn't mutually exclusive with any of that. And people seem to forget that you can  have a dumbphone and still be disconnected and media addicted. I was. I spent hours in front of my laptop, had headphones in constantly either in the laptop or a separate mp3 player. It's still a problem, personally, but the only thing that's significantly changed is how I access it. And I adore the convenience of a smartphone, though I'm hesitant to do most things on it besides call, text, a little social media and internet browsing/reading/Youtube. Hell, even then most of it is through privacy platforms that at least mitigate any damage. And even then, I and lots of other people know not be rude or obnoxious with them (the idea of having a phone out during a social gathering, for example, baffles me, and I don't use it on public transport unless it's to check times).

&amp;#x200B;

Kind of a stupid rant, but it was getting to me, seeing people act like they're ever so in tune with life and are the few people who still have imagination, or whatever else because they don't have a phone. The convenience/personal liberation argument doesn't do anything for me either, since I wanted a smartphone exactly because I felt cut off and limited!",21Dec2018,1
7,"I'm a senior girl in college. I was at the same semi-boring party last week that I always go to, and I saw something a bit entertaining.

There was this freshman geek boy named Brent, bragging about his poker skills. He's won 11 straight tournaments with his friends he says. ""They don't even want me to play anymore with them"", he said, followed by obnoxious, snorting laughter.

After weeks of hearing this bragging, maybe my 2nd shot of tequila spoke up, but I had to get involved.

I walked up to him. I'm 5'11. And he's 5'7. So I looked down at him and made a move.

""Want a new challenge?"" I suggested.

""Are you joking? I'd send you home without even a penny in your wallet, sweet cheeks."" he said, thinking his nickname was cute.

I was enraged, but put on a ""poker face"", if you will.

""C'mon. Heads up. Put your money where your mouth is."" I couldn't help but smirk.

He took a seat. With my 4 friends, and his 8 friends all surrounding the table.

Within 40 minutes, I cleaned him out. He had $350 on him. I won every cent he had.

He whined, ""But...but that's my textbook money.""

I couldn't help myself. ""Well, you still have more to bet."" And I looked down at his wardrobe.

He gulped, but really, he felt he had no choice.

Only 25 minutes later, Brent was sitting there wearing only his little white boxers lol.

He put down 4-of-a-kind, Jacks. ""Well give me my t-shirt back, at least.""

I smiled like the cat who ate the canary.

""Actually, you can hand me your panties instead.""

I placed 4 Queens down, as his jaw literally dropped hahaha.

""Hand em over.""

As the entire table hooted and hollered, he stood up, hooked his thumbs in his waistband, and dropped his undies to the ground, handing them to me, cupping his little penis and balls with his hands, and blushing as red as a fire hydrant.

I spun them around on my finger high in the air and yelled ""WOOOOOOO! Nice UNDIES!"" Then did a little victory lap around my naked opponent haha. Twice around the table as my crowd cheered haha.

There he stood, wearing nothing but his glasses. In shock.

Only 5'7. Tan from the neck up, and lily-white from the neck down. Not fat, but a chubby, ""studies while munching Oreos"" belly. An obviously small dick and balls (I saw a glimpse when he stripped lol). And a surprisingly very cute, BUBBLE BUTT jiggling  behind him with every movement. Who knew? lol 

It was then that I went for the cherry on top.

He reached for his clothes, and I slapped his hand.

""What are you doing?!"", the naked boy cried.

""You lost. Would you get your money back too? No. Now go home, nature boy.""

He pleaded, but I knew that the campus police never arrest streakers (the frats have been doing it forever), and that 40 degrees outside is chilly, but won't kill him lol.

Finally resigned to his fate, as he tip-toed to the door in front of the giggling crowd, I spoke up.

""Next time, don't get so arrogant. Now run on home, SWEET CHEEKS!"" and I leaned back and SMACKED that naked, adorable white tushie as he yelped in pain and ran right out into the cold weather. Little penis flapping for the world to see.

A virgin exposed.

I taught him a lesson, and I do NOT regret it.",21Dec2018,1
8,"I don’t know where else to post this and I don’t know who else to tell so I might as well put it out there in the reddit verse.

So, like the title said, I’m being creative again after almost a decade.  I’ve decided two of my NYE resolutions are to write once a day and draw once a day.  Whichever one I like better I’ll keep doing (if not both).  

The reason I stopped being creative, I feel, is the same old story.  I had an art teacher who was realism or nothing.  “None of that anime or comic crap.  That’s not real art.”  I had an English teacher who said I would never be a great writer, so I should find another hobby.  That, mixed with the fact that I was hardcore depressed because of my home life, I stopped doing things I enjoyed.  All I did was go to school, work, and constantly babysit my youngest brother.  I became more and more depressed, almost to the point of suicide.  I enjoyed nothing anymore and school plus work plus raising someone else’s kid (my parents), while trying to maintain an actual social life just got to me.  

After my initial 72 hour psych lock up, I still wasn’t doing anything.  I just worked (I dropped out of school) and watched my brother.

A few years passed and I decided to go back to school.  My brother was more independent at that point so I was able to handle it better.  The 6 months before I graduated, I moved 800 miles away to do an internship with Disney.  The internship can be intense with hours so I still didn’t do anything creative but I was able to be more social.

Proceed to the next year and I became severely depressed again.  I liked my job, my friends, and most everything else but I just felt so shitty all the time.  I tried exercise, eating better, everything but therapy.  

Finally, this year, I’m on new medication and I feel much more alert and balanced than I have in years.  I still have rough days but I still try to do more.  So I thought I would try to pick up art again.

I have to remind myself that yea I’m horrible at it but it’s for me.  Not for a grade.  Not for a client.  It’s just me being creative so I have an outlet for anything I may be feeling.

This was more rambly than I meant it to be but wish me luck.  I hope I can keep it up.

TL:DR- being creative again because I don’t have to answer to bad teachers or parents who depend on me too much and I feel my depression is better.",21Dec2018,1
9,"I sometimes wonder how we can all be living on the same earth and be so different and lead different lives. How do people turn out differently. Most people on Reddit are more like me but people outside live a life completely foreign to me, with an abundance of some things I never have but probably some downsides too. I think, maybe there's a chance I'll come back as someone cooler after killing myself eventually, but really I just want to stay dead. I don't want to take the chance of coming back.",21Dec2018,1
10,"(i had this posted somewhere else but a mod suggested ""self"" so here I am)

So. My. ENTIRE. Life.

Not everyone, of course.

But ALWAYS someone. ALWAYS.

When I was a kid it was my uncle. He was verbally and emotionally abusive and no one really gave a damn enough to get me away from him. At 11 years old I was getting into arguments with a grown man in his twenties because of this or that. He would often purposely get me riled up by bothering me, then ridicule me. He would mock my weight, call me a bitch, call me trash. I didn't get away from that until I was 16 and that was only because my grandmother took him with her when they moved out the home we shared. She essentially chose him because it was either living with him (a complete bum) somewhere new or staying with my mom and me, helping us when we needed it (but it wasn't his abuse that prompted this, it was the rapidly rising rent in our area). My grandmother would join in the mocking sometimes, tbh.

In school (esp high school) it was the mean girls. The ones who spread gossip about me in my very first year of high school that turned a lot of the girls against me (i never found out who started it). I became hyper-vigilant, asking people if they disliked me because it seemed everywhere I turned a girl was gossiping about me or giving me a look. They were petty and this began for a reason I never understood. I had girls threaten to kick my ass, but i had never said anything about them. I was dumbfounded. An ex friend later told me it was because of this stupid throwaway comment I may or may not have made in private (or so i thought) that EVERYONE ELSE in the school was making. But I guess it was only offensive when I said it because I was an easy target. I tried desperately to get on their good side, but it seemed impossible and I became severely depressed and just stopped going. The next school I transferred to, I did absolutely nothing. Nothing. Was completely sweet to these strangers and yet this one girl had a problem with me and kept picking on me and being threatening. It was exhausting and I left in the middle of classes one day, unable to take it (and i was a rule follower, absolutely).

As an adult, it was my abusive ex. He was emotionally and verbally abusive. Called me ""cunt"" as much as my real name. Called me ""sp\*c"" (I'm Latina). Talked shit about me and everything I was and came from. Even though, especially at the beginning and middle, I did nothing but try to be loving and kind to him. In the last quarter of the relationship I was bitchy and mean, because I was tired of being stepped on.

After that, hell. Dating hell. Every guy I tried to date just was bad for me. The first guy led me on then told me he was still in love with his ex (hey, that rhymes! lmao). The second guy used me for sex (I reallllyyy believed his sweet talk, he seemed so sincere). The third guy absolutely threw me for a loop--I thought he'd be the ""good"" one. But he ended it conveniently after I gave him head and then proceeded to get back into dating after lying and saying he couldn't have a relationship because of his career.

But I just don't get it.

Yes, people have been kind to me. People have been charmed by me, old people seem to really love me. Kids like me. Animals love and trust me. People's first impression is always that I'm sweet and polite, because I really try to be. I'm a very timid person by nature. Even if someone deserves to be told off, it's hard for me to do it.

So what gives? Is it that I'm just so weak I'm easy prey? Is my desire to please automatically a turn-off? Is it these things and more?

This isn't a #pityparty post. I really want to know. Because it's FRUSTRATING. And I'm so heartbroken and over with it. I just wish I didn't exist, tbh. And I'm feeling all this old anger rise to the surface and I want to just curse everyone that ever hurt my feelings out and stick it to someone because I feel like such a stupid little speck of nothing and an absolute fool, and punk. I feel the weight of all this disrespect and it's making me bitter and angry and I don't want to spend my adult life lashing out at people who don't deserve it because of old hurts.

**TL;DR:** Always have problems with people no matter what age I am and the relationship type. I try to be polite and nice. I'm a timid person. What problems within me could be the cause?",21Dec2018,1
11,"Sorry for writing a book.  

In September of this year, a few days after my birthday, my wife told me that she didn’t want to be with me anymore. This was during a trip she took to visit me because it won’t be long before I’m out of the army and we’ll need a place to stay and start up our lives, so I had her go back home under the assumption that she would take care of things until I would be able to meet back up with her…and it sucks because my son and dog had to go with her because there’s no way I could take care of them both since I’d be gone for days at a time due to work. She was to visit me for a week for my birthday but I wasn’t expecting the “surprise” given to me at the end of her trip. I don’t see my son until I get to go home on leave outside of the very occasional video call.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to a few weeks ago – I’m told that I won’t be staying at her parents’ house (which is where she’s staying) and that I need to talk to my family. It hurts and now it feels like there’s nothing I can do to save our relationship, but that’s just the way life is. The bright side is that a friend of mine who moved to Missouri is also coming to town for a few days and she’ll be here the day after I arrive, which is perfect timing since I hadn’t seen her in over four years and she’s cool as hell.

&amp;#x200B;

My first night home was terrible because I got to see my wife and son for a little while and got to end the night by telling my parents that I’m getting a divorce and that I’ll need a place to stay. They were understanding and figured that something was up so that wasn’t an issue – but that doesn’t change how it hurts to be separated from the love of your life and your son. Still, I had to look forward to seeing a good friend and it would be great to catch up because we’re both awful at facebook messenging and she’s one of the few who knew of my divorce because I took my post down soon after it went up. She’d been a great help when we would talk.

&amp;#x200B;

I met her at the hotel she was staying at on Saturday and had a great time. We got drunk and talked about her family (the reason for her visit was her dying grandmother), my divorce, her relationship problems, and all the things that had been weighing me down as a result of my job. I was pretty lit and she said I could stay the night but I that had to sleep on the floor, which I was perfectly okay with. By the time 2AM rolled around I was getting up off the bed to lay on the floor when she offered that I could sleep on the bed on the condition that I slept on the opposite side, which I was again happy with because I move like an old man and my back isn’t what it used to be. Let me tell you, after sleeping next to your wife and having that taken away suddenly and going to bed alone for four months…well, it was great just having another person in the room and not being alone. I’d go days without really talking to people outside of work and it was refreshing to just have somebody there while I slept. You never realize how lonely you are until you stop being alone.

&amp;#x200B;

She had her days more or less planned out given how limited time she had here but it turned out that plans changed so I spent a lot of the day with her and it was good to just spend time with a person who was interested in being around you. We went out to a bar with a friend of hers and took a picture that, in the words of her and her friend, made us look like a pretty cute couple (if you PM me I might show you). After a few drinks we went back to her hotel to hang out and watch movies like we did the previous night, but frankly we were too busy talking to get through any show or movie. See, her relationship is also taking a nose-dive but she has a kid with the guy so there’s not much that she can do as far as leaving him and moving back home. We talked about how ridiculously compatible we were and how it sucked that we were never single at the same time and how it sucks that we were responsible.

&amp;#x200B;

You can probably see where this is going. It’s late at this point, or rather it’s early in the morning, and we ended up cuddling and talking about how cold it is. The long story short is that we end up kissing and neither of us can believe how great it was. Another hour or so passes and I end up talking about the deployment that my company missed this year and the kid who was killed in a training accident the year prior. On deployment, a guy was killed by an IED. The thought of him – some guy I didn’t even know – plus the kid (who I did know) who had been married less than six months and killed in a training accident had been troubling me for a while and I couldn’t get it out of my head. I guess she could tell the effect it was having on me and interrupted me with the sweetest kiss I ever had.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know how to describe how I felt. It was like a weight was lifted off my shoulders and that somebody wanted to alleviate the pain I felt. I told her something that I never told anybody else and it was just her instinct to make me feel better…I’ve felt like I’m not even human these past months. It was my wife who helped me push the negativity aside and forget my troubles, but then she suddenly left and took all that I wanted and worked for with her. To go from nothing but work, sleep, and depression to being \*\*chosen\*\* by another person was the best I had felt in a very long time.

&amp;#x200B;

We would end up having sex later that night and, without going into cringeworthy detail, it was great for the both of us. I’d done things for her that I didn’t normally do and she did the same for me. It didn’t even feel like a chore because she liked it, and I did it \*just because\* she liked it and that alone made me feel good. The point is that we are ridiculously compatible and neither of us regret anything we did; my relationship is over in every way except legally and she’s tired of trying in hers.

&amp;#x200B;

But all things come to an end. We have another amazing night the day before she had to leave, she does \*more\* things just to make me feel good, and we both try to ignore the fact that she would leave in just a few hours. We talk about how it sucks that whatever happened has to stay in the hotel room because real life is on the outside and we can’t pretend it’s not there. She asks me what I’d do if she stays with him and I tell her that I hope I find someone like her (seriously, she’s exactly my type) one day and that there’s no way I’d get back together with my wife – she opened my eyes to the possibility of love without her and that the best course of action is for me to carry on regardless of what my soon-to-be-ex wants. This must’ve struck her hard (I’m a pretty sappy person) because we hugged for a long time after that.

&amp;#x200B;

So the sun rises, we take a shower, and get everything ready to leave. I drive her to the airport and we just hold hands the entire time. She asks me about what we’d do on a fancy Friday night date and I go into great detail with her smiling the entire time as I’m talking. I can’t help but to think about how great it would be as I’m talking about it. It’s fun to talk about a hypothetical that sounds better than the harsh reality that we’ll both have to go back to in a matter of hours.

&amp;#x200B;

I park in the parking garage (spending time with her is more valuable than a few bucks) and we hold hands the entire way to the terminal and then to the security checkpoint. Giving her a kiss before sending her on her way was the hardest thing I’d done all year. It hurts to face the reality that we might never have a chance to at least properly date and it’s a fact that I knew I’d have to face, but like I’d told her about her relationship, the hardest things and the rightest things are usually the same.

&amp;#x200B;

She ended up talking to him about their relationship and how she didn’t love him anymore (a courtesy that my wife never gave me, which I was adamant about her telling him because communicating is better than a blindside). To some up the past few days and as of now, she’s going to stay with him because it wouldn’t be fair to him or their son to separate the pair of them by a third of the United States. That’s something that my wife didn’t even bother to do for me so I have to say that’s a credit to her character. I guess that this is the reason I’m writing this whole post – doing the right thing sucks. I hate it when you’re mature and make good decisions. I hate it when you be an adult and make hard choices. And, most of all, I hate it when it hurts and you know it’s the right answer for everybody involved. I don’t think I’m going to get drunk by myself for the rest of this trip. But you can bet good money that I really want to…talk about good decisions. I’m still going to get divorced from my wife because it’s super fucked up that she’d take our son and permanently leave without any real warning; I don’t think I could trust her ever again and I don’t think that I’d want to.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I’m just sitting in my dark room listening to music and thinking about my life. I’m sure it will get better and I’m sure it will work out. I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired. I don’t want to feel sad anymore and I’m supremely grateful that I spent three days with a person better than the one whom I considered the love of my life. She changed my perspective and made me okay with divorce. I just can’t help but to be sad just for a moment. And as I’m finishing this up, “Dear Agony” by Breaking Benjamin has to play. Damn it, shuffle…you’ve betrayed me again.",21Dec2018,1
13,"2018 has been a hectic year 
So crazy how times flies 
We are gonna die soon and we still do all this stupid dumb stuff that doesnt make us happy 
Why do we do it 
Why did we evolve to be like this 
Sometimes I feel like cutting to the chase and just dying 
I know that's selfish 
But its going to happen anyways 
Does it really matter how soon it happens 
Even we do make a difference in the world the world still sucks and its gonna be reversed by some pricks who are selfish and only want money for themselves 
2018 really fucked me up 
I'm so unmotivated to do anything 
People die 
My grandma doesnt exist anymore 
People say shes in a better place 
But the truth is that she doesnt exist 
Theres nothing after death 
We become nothing 
I am going to become nothing 
I miss you 

Right now we do things that hurt others the ones we love 
But if anything ever happened and we stopped breathing we would feel endless regret wishing we could reverse back time and be nicer and be kinder and make you happier while you were still here 
I wish we would just treat everyday as our last and not hurt the people we love 
I know we dont always agree with what they say and do but if it makes them happy who cares 
This is not going to matter in a couple years 
Be happy

17,"I’m an intern at my local fire department. I enjoy it a lot, but I don’t know everyone too well— I’m still learning names and faces as I go along. The department has 16 members per shift and 4 chiefs. There are three shifts. 

Last month, they were preparing an important shipment. They had 3 firefighters and the chief working on it. I walked into the bay (where the trucks stay) and saw one lone firefighter standing there, back against the wall. 

I remember him so well that it disturbs me— I normally don’t remember faces or bodies so vividly. 

He was 5’4-5’6, no taller; blonde hair, in a sort of buzz cut, but it looked really nice; slightly crooked bottom teeth, very kind eyes. Somewhat shy demeanor. Definitely appeared young— early to mid twenties, no later, but I’d say even closer to the 19-20 range. Slender to average build; his shirt was a bit loose in the front, like he had plenty of room left to fill it out with, but I could tell somehow that his waist was quite straight and almost wide... like a smallish tree trunk? His forearms were strong, but still quite slender. He was wearing the special FD shirt only the firefighters get— they very strictly monitor the usage of these, so there’s no way a random person got one or a volunteer got one. 

Anyway, I walked in to the bay, walked past him and kind of ignored him, and then said internally, “oh, that was rude— I should acknowledge him”— so I turned back around, and he was just staring right at me. I said, “Hi,” and he said, “Good mornin’, Miss,” in this very polite southern drawl type of way. His eyes and smile were so, so kind that I felt very overwhelmed in the moment— he almost seemed angelic in nature, of that makes sense. I asked him what shift it was, and he said, “It’s the second day of ‘C’, ma’am.” I smiled, said ok, thank you, and walked off. 

I distinctly remember walking back outside a short time later, maybe 15 min, and he was still standing there. I think he was on his phone texting, but when I sneaked a glance over at him he was staring right at me as he was before. He smiled again and I got a bit embarrassed for some reason and walked away. 

I left shortly after as there wasn’t any work to do. 

For a month now I have been looking for him and everyone is convinced that I’m crazy because there actually isn’t a blonde short firefighter at all that works there at all. There were only 3 firefighters there that day and they all confirmed no other guy was there helping them. They also gave me the personnel list and I went through it name by name with them and confirmed that this guy does not exist, according to their records. I also double checked all Facebook profiles I can find and nope, this guy just... isn’t anywhere. 

Everyone is treating me like I hallucinated the encounter but I remember it so vividly and physically that I don’t think I did. Someone else suggested that I might be dreaming but I don’t think I was. There are photos of my car sitting there at the station behind the firefighters who were helping on that day. 

One of my friends is convinced that he was the ghost of a former firefighter, lmao, so I’m basically giving up on outside help at this point. I just keep looking and looking for him and I’m so disheartened as I’ve never seen him there again, either, and everyone seriously doesn’t know who I’m talking about. Now they’re all upset and wanting to know who he is and I’m like, you guys work here, you tell me, lol. Mystery firefighter, if you see this somehow, please say something? Let me know that you exist? I’m giving up now, I think. :-( I’ve exhausted all my resources and I’m starting to become very upset over it when I shouldn’t be, but I feel like I got duped or tricked in a way. Like, who are you???",21Dec2018,1
18,"It is what it is. This is the year review everyone goes through a little bit in their head; only I’m just the right kind of narcissist to write it down in the hopes that someone out there just might want to read it. Only I have access to the metrics of this blog and can see that literally no one visits the site. So what does that mean? I post it out for anyone to see knowing that no one will see it. All I know is that it helps.

What really seems to help is the new SAD light I bought. 929 foot candles of light directly targeted to my face and chest for 30 min in the mornings while I drink my coffee. It may be just a big placebo that’s hurting my eyes long term. All I know is that it is much easier to go about the day putting on that classic Tom face to the world that they seem to like so much.

10k lux to start the day and I’m back on the floor by choice. The ex is the HUC. We talk and get along and it seems to be good for me at least. We’re both adults and knew this was a possibility. We’re professional beings who can maneuver these situations. I feel for her though. She has to over hear people fawn over me and way overstate my abilities and just how great I am to patients and coworkers. All while she sits there and knows the real me. She’s the only one there who can truly see the real me. I showed it to her. She decided it wasn’t for her.

This was a very bright year for me by every single metric there could be. Credit score way up. Income and earning potential way up. School loans and debt didn’t grow too much. One year of nursing school completed. Professionally got a promotion and raise above inflation. Lost 16 pounds through diet and determination. I set goals and stuck to them. I own season tickets to my favorite sports team.

Yet I go into the winter months dark cold and alone. The only brightness in my life is the 10000 lux I shine on myself in the morning. 2018 was a year of substantial growth for me. What also grew is the number of women I invited into my life who rejected me. I wasn’t ready for any of them. Each of them had their reasons and they were all valid. They’re still valid to this day.

How to be a brighter person? Does anyone know? How do you navigate a relationship? How do you know when to stick it out and fight or when to call it quits? This is all an experience thing right? I’m the one who is supposed to know this. I’m supposed to mansplain this to others like I do so many other things?

So now I travel. Props to 2018. I’m in a place where I can get the hell out for a weekend at least once a month to drink and eat somewhere else. It’s really easy to fill the void of sheer disappointment with my life to say I get to leave soon or just getting out. It makes me interesting right? Fly across the country and it makes me have something to say I did or are going to do. No one asks about the 3 weeks I sat in my dark room alone in between them.

I’m getting old. I feel it. My body being wrecked after concerts and being in the pit isn’t new. But the third and fourth day of recovery is. I do it anyway. What else can I do? Old habits die hard and old habits feel alive with VRs. 2018 was a year that shined a bright light on a lot of things in my life. Showed me I have room to grow in places I thought I had grown a lot. Showed me I should never stop growing.

2019 is shaping up to be even better somehow. Scheduled to travel more and to warmer places. Scheduled to dance and get in the pit even though I’ll be 29. Scheduled to be loved and appreciated by my friends and new family.  I still feel intense darkness with it all going so well. I hope that doesn’t follow me. I want it to be very bright. I want it to be as bright as the ten thousand lux I use every day.",21Dec2018,1

Now since he's with me i let him play video games and talk to his friends and do anything that he wasnt allowed to do before but i sometimes think that hes taking advantage of it. Like a lot. Maybe im just being controlling but i dont want to become just like his ex, controlling him and giving him rules.

26,"I don't know, man. I hate thinking about it but it's been on my mind nonstop lately. I let this asshole dictate and ruin my life for four years and even though it's been over for a long time but it still hurts. I feel like I never got to unpack any of this. Whenever I bring it up with my family, it feels like they don't really listen. It still hurts but they've heard all of it. It's bad enough that my heart skips a beat out of fear every time I get notifications on my phone even though I've blocked him on everything. He hasn't seen me since we graduated high school and we haven't talked in just over a year but I'm still afraid of him. I'm still afraid of seeing him.

I remember him demanding that I text or speak to him everyday, from as soon as I got home from school up until one of us had to go to bed every single day. He'd try to isolate me from my friends by lying to me about them, he threw a tantrum at my birthday because he wasn't the center of my attention, and he tried to keep me from cutting my cake so I'd stick around him instead. Eventually he tried isolating me from my family. One year when we went trick-or-treating together and he got angry because I was joking with my brother.

Every single time he got upset and I didn't know how to help him or I didn't tell him what he wanted to hear, he'd start talking about being suicidal and then when I couldn't ""comfort"" him he'd blow up on me like ""OKAY THEN! DON'T CARE ABOUT MY FEELINGS!"" and go silent on me until I started panicking. He'd always cut me off or change the subject anytime I wanted to talk about myself or my feelings. Our ""friendship"" was all give and absolutely no take.

I feel like when I write it out it doesn't sound like much but this happened for four years, everyday, sometimes literally every hours. It still hurts so much. Enough that I almost killed myself and when I showed up to school the next day, I confessed to my friends that I'd been feeling suicidal for ages. Guess who was the only one who didn't say anything to me, guess who was the only one who didn't show any support. 

Cutting him off and making it very clear that I no longer wanted anything to do with him anymore was probably one of the best decisions I made. Even though he's not around anymore, I still feel so scared, used, and stupid. I don't know how to deal with this old and useless anger. ",21Dec2018,1

The day’s dawn, the night’s sunset  
The blue’s sun, the black’s moon  
The brightness of clouds, the glowing of the stars

Predators of my mind  
Feasting on my heart  
Found me out of nowhere  
I knew not what to do  
Emails and unpleasant feelings  
Life sure is a double-take on here  
My questions go unanswered  
My feelings unfazed by my intruders

Ask me ridicule  
Give me insanity  
Your life can go on  
while I drift in your crazy song

Well, I refuse to play your game anymore  
You held me prisoner in my mind  
My emotions are stronger than you

Fear, I danced with  
Shape up and ship out  
Your prevalence is stale, lackluster in my demise  
This dancer is finally free from your choreographed routine

You didn’t make me  
You can’t break me  
I am a work in progress, my own whole  
You are a terrible athlete  
For you missed in me your goal  
Your chisel doesn’t work on me anymore  
I have true friends who helped put me back together

Their wings help me fly  
Their smiles help me see the sky  
Their strengths help me stay strong  
Their laughter is my concert all day long​

The night now sleeps and the day has now awakened  
The stars say good night and the clouds wrap around in comfort

The predator lost its prey  
as life comes to the rescue and has its way

So give me back my strings  
You don’t run my routine  
Give me back my song  
I don’t need you to help me sing  
Give me back my life  
You never had permission to enter my mind  
and cause me this strife",21Dec2018,1
31,"His name is Sparky. He’s a 10-year-old Basset hound.

I last saw him for sure around 6:45 when he was begging for grilled chicken scraps. I didn’t see him for a while after that and that’s pretty normal for him. He likes to hide in the bathroom, the front room behind the couch... he also likes to lay outside in the dirt.

At 10:45 or so, somebody rang our doorbell. We didn’t answer because it was so late. (I’ve seen so many episodes of crime shows that I was convinced that it was a setup for a robbery. I’m a dumbass.)

I’m in my room, trying to go back to sleep, but I can’t relax. I’m paranoid somebody was going to break in so I looked out my window. I can see the back gate from there and it was open. I immediately get my mom and she freaks out too. But then we both realize that Sparky isn’t anywhere in the house. And that the person at the door could’ve been somebody who had Sparky.

We circle the block and can’t find any sign of him (in case he was still out and the doorbell ring was a coincidence). We get home and my mom checks the information on my other dog’s ID. If somebody has our dog, that person would only have our phone number, and if the person ringing the doorbell was about Sparky, then that person is a neighbor.

But that’s a lot of ifs. My other dog has terminal lung cancer and doesn’t have much time left. We were already preparing to lose Bree and now we might’ve lost Sparky. All because some stupid landscaper left the gate open.

I had to distance myself. 

They weren’t true friends to me in the end anyways. I know that. They are more her friends and it makes sense why they’d feel more loyalty to her than me. 

It still hurts. Seeing a photo of them having a Xmas dinner together. Something I used to be a part of.

I was hurt by my best friend of over 10 years. She was not a good friend. Yet I am the one that lost everyone.

I have other friends now and most days I’m grateful and appreciative of my life. Today I’m reminded of what crap I’ve had to deal with over the last two years.

 I guess they didn't realize I can see what goes on their snapchat, and Instagram. That I can see them hanging out without me. Same day I asked them to hang out and they were supposed to have work.

37,"Just want to say I'm sorry if this is jumbled, it's currently five in the morning and I'm not the best with words.

So, I (19F) have been working with this lady (40something) for about 5 months now. I get along with her well, she's very funny and we like a lot of the same things. We work 12 hour shifts 4 days on, 4 days off, and we are usually in the same area, but it's a little hard to talk and hear because we work in a factory. But a few days ago, we were sat right next to each other and we got to talking about photography.

This lady, we'll call her Anna, tells me she's a photographer. I can't exactly remember the term she used for it, but basically she takes pictures of women in sexy poses and outfit for their SOs. She says its a hobby of hers, and she doesn't charge for it. I thought that was odd, but shrugged it off.

I have never modeled before, though it's something I think I would love to do, so I told her that I'd love to be a model for her. She is ecstatic. We spend the rest of the day talking about poses, outfits and locations.

Quick backstory, Anna had been in a toxic relationship with a pretty shitty guy on and off for 14 years. Recently, they broke up before he left to another country for a couple months. While he's gone, Anna is allowed to live at their house until she finds her own place. She tells me he is watching her though, that the neighbors are keeping tabs on when she leaves or has people over. The two also have and still do many drugs, Anna is very open about it. I have nothing against those who enjoy that stuff. To each their own, I guess.

Anyways, in the moment, I was pretty excited to do a little modelling for her. When I got home, though, I started to have a weird feeling. I realised that since I have no car, Anna will have to pick me up and take me to her house, where she does the shoot. And she lives around 20 minutes outside my town. I don't know her address, or how long we'll be. I'm starting to feel like maybe I shouldn't do this.

Any other time I would cancel right away, but she was VERY excited about this, she even picked up a new piece of furniture. She's been getting her house ready for me and everything too. But I haven't been able to get rid of this feeling in my stomach. I don't think its nervousness, I've felt that before. This is something else.

So basically what I'm saying is, I have a weird gut feeling, but there's no reason I should. I've known her 5 months now, and I'm not scared of nervous around her. She's really a friend. And I don't want to cancel because she is very excited about doing it and has already put so much effort. It's also very short notice, as its almost 6am now and she's coming into town at around 10ish and  picking me up at 2. She doesn't have a phone to contact so I have until 10am to cancel. But I've also never felt this way about something before. What do I do? Am I just overthinking or overreacting?

 The problem is that I live in a house with my Dad, my uncle and my grandfather where we are on a month to month basis. After the fire hit, people started to need to look for homes and so the housing market exploded. Long story short, the homeowner is selling the house we are living in and we have no solid plan on where to go. I am gonna have to go live on my Mom's couch 200 miles away.

 I lived on a couch for years because we just couldn't afford a place with my own room. I was fine with it. Now I have a room, and im finally getting my mental health taken care of, I have a low paying job and a supportive household and all that's being taken away from me. That's not to say that my moms house isn't supportive, it's just... less stable. I don't like to admit it but my mom has gotten kinda trashy over the last few years, to the point where living with her makes me feel really morally wrong and if I were to mention any of this I would probably either get in a big fight or lose my new place on the couch.

 It sucks because I really like my dad's home, I like being stable (at least, until recently) and I really was finally getting my life started. I feel like I just backslid on all the progress I've made over the last few years. The worst part is that I know I have it relatively good!

I had a midterm that I spent the last two nights studying for, I broke down everything and really felt I understood. On the test, it was the same. All of the formulas pooped into my head as soon as I saw a problem except on one. It was multiple choice, and almost ever time my answers lined up with the multiple choice, and made made since.

Even if I can crunch through a problem there's something wrong somehow, something that made since to me earlier. How can 4 hours of studying not pay off at all?

Everyone thinks youre the strong one who has everything under control and hence no one really cares about whats going on in your heart and mind.

I've just had bad luck with making friends lately. I'm 23 and not sure if its part of being an adult.

I cant even keep a fucking conversation going with a girl. I only get one word replies. Feel like a compelete empty minded loser. I feel inferior and cheap, i feel like i dont have personality.. 

I always chase, never anyone chases me. 

I feel inferior and manly, i think about what to do is manly or what to do isnt manly, i feel incapable, lazy, i dont know who am i. I feel like a childman, child-like, child-brain..

I have spent my energy mostly on fapping.. but im trying to escape it.

I think im doing the ultimate chasing approval and attention. 

I think its making me look worthless meaningless and abortive and moronic and cheap person as well.

In many social situations I feel like I could be more mature, a bit more level headed, balanced, not this flamboyant and exaggerated persona I come across as at times. And even if that's not how I am usually, I am still considered a very exuberant person. I don't think that's a bad thing, but I would like to tone it down a bit. 

Firstly, I am not sure how to do that exactly. And if you have any idea that'd be awesome. Secondly, how can you reinvent yourself and that reflection to be seen by the people who already know you?

53,"The scenario is so unlikely it'd probably never happen in front of me, and it'd be super weird to try and wait for it to happen (except maybe at a dedicated toy store?) but I think about this every Christmas.

I wear a giant Santa hat, very long down to my knees, all winter. Every year, I think about going to a store and seeing a kid who wants a toy or something, and buying it for them under the guise of ""Santa was bringing you this for Christmas but he wanted me to come make sure you didn't buy it first"". More specifically I imagine a kid spending their own money they saved or earned and I tell them ""do you know whose hat this is?"" and they confirm, and I say ""anyone you see wearing a hat like this... *is one of Santa's helpers*. Santa told me he was getting you this toy for Christmas, and he wanted to make sure you didn't spend your money on it!"" and then I'd pay with my red and white store credit card, calling it Santa's special credit card, and then they get the toy and to keep their money.

I don't know if I could even make it through that interaction in the first place because thinking about it is enough to make my lip start to tremble, lol. I'm barely not crying about it just writing it out 😭

I can't afford to throw money around at random kids to give them a magic little moment like that but just one would be enough. I want to do this every year but it's just a really obscure scenario and it'd be complicated to interject with a parent buying multiple things and only pay for one. I could hand over some cash but that's kind of lame. Plus what if the parent thinks it's weird :(

60,"I don't even know where to start, but I'll try to start somewhere and explain it the best I can. Warning this may be long winded (or maybe not) so please consider reading everything.

Around a year ago I made a ""friend"" online over call of duty on PS4. I thought we were pretty good buds, we played together pretty regularly for a while and everything seemed fine and dandy. We exchanged phone numbers to keep up with each other and followed each other social media because that just seemed like what you do. 

Well fast forward to a few months ago and I don't have any money and out of the goodness of his heart (or so I thought) I was able to convince him to gameshare the new call of duty with me. Meaning I was able to log into his PSN account on my PS4 and use and download any game he owns. We played with each other on that game fairly regularly and everything seemed fine. 

Well this is when things start to get strange. A few weeks ago something started to go wrong with the gamesharing process and he couldn't log into his account. I assured him that I haven't touched anything with his account and haven't even clicked on it since I used it to get the game. I unlinked his account from my playstation and did all I could to help him log back in to his on his PS4.

It's at this point that he decided to completely ghost me. Not responding to any of my texts or the one call I've made or the message I sent over PS4 to his account. I haven't heard from him since, at all, in any capacity. Fair enough I guess, I just assumed he was really pissed at me for some reason, blaming me for not being able to get into his account and just didn't want to talk to me at all.

Recently I had the idea to check his twitter and to my relief ( or so I thought) he was tweeting about being back online and posting gameplay from his PS4 so obviously he was able to log back in. This is where the paranoia and my anxiety really starts to kick in. I see a tweet from him saying ""December 29th #pokedthebear"" Now that could mean nothing, it could be a poker thing because he is an amateur poker player and after some research I did I found out there this is a big poker tournament in his home state on that day so I all but convinced myself that it refers to that. 

Well unrelated to this at all, last night I deleted my twitter account because reasons and ended up making a completely new one, with no followers, no tweets, and just followed a few accounts here and there and went to bed thinking nothing of it. I had to use my phone number to verify the account so I did; well I wake this morning to one new follower, him. How in the world would he know about that new account unless he somehow is spying on my phone number? There's no way that's a coincidence that he just happens to follow that totally random new account with activity because he wants to. He got alert somehow on his device and followed me to track my activity, just has to be it.

Now is when I'll say that this guy has criminal history of being a serious drug dealer and the reason he played so much video games is because he was on house arrest. He's also a very serious gambler and better. Every time I've talked to him it seems he was betting on something that day.

All my anxiety and stress over this situation would be relieved if he just responded to me just once on any platform but he has still yet to do that. I was getting over it and not stressing it at all until he followed that account this morning and all the fears and anxiety came rushing back.

I'm really considering changing my phone number as that's the only way I can think of him not being able to track me anymore. My brain has me somewhat convinced that on December 29th something bad is going to happen to me caused by him. That's ridiculous, right?

If you read all this I truly appreciate it, I hope it made sense enough and I hope anyone can calm my mind or offer me sage advice on what to do next or reassure me that nothing will happen. I eagerly await your responses.",21Dec2018,1

62,"I don't know where else to post this, but something has really been bothering me lately and was hoping to get some perspective. Some background first: my husband and I both work a ton and have a 15 month old, so we pay a housekeeper to come 2x/month. She is the nicest Honduran lady, who i have formed a relationship with as I often work from home when she comes. She is one of the hardest, honest workers I have ever met (usually works 6 hours straight without sitting down), and really has had a tough life, especially within the last year. When I asked her how she was doing a few weeks ago she initially said fine, but when I pressed more she broke down crying and told me how they were really struggling, and she recently lost her car so she has been having to Uber to my house, which costs about $50 round trip (she only charges me $100, but I usually give her a $20 tip because I am a mess). Her husband is also disabled and has been having trouble working lately, her daughter lost her house... my heart really just breaks for her. So for Christmas this year I gave her a $500 bonus to put towards a new car, which she was super appreciative about. I had to dig into savings to give her the money, but my husband and I both have good jobs with a lot of growth potential, so I figured the money would make a much bigger difference to her than it would to us. 

I initially felt really good about this; however, since I have started feeling guilty that the money would have gone even further if I had donated it to a good charity, given how many people are in even a worse spot than she. Like, I could have used that money to sponsor a child in Syria, or donated to a family with young children, or donated to foster children. Then I feel guilty because I could afford to dig more into savings and give more, but I also want to live comfortably and have money saved for my child/future children. 

I don't really know what I am wanting to accomplish with this post, but I just wanted to share with others to get some honest perspective. Was it wrong to give so much money to one person when others need it more? I'm not looking for people to tell me I'm a great person or anything, I am just wondering I guess if anyone else has these types of feelings, and how you deal with them.",21Dec2018,1

66,"# Why?

""Fake news"" is a real problem that is contributing, more than anything else, to a misinformed/ignorant population.  This occurs either when something false/misleading is presented as true or when something true is labeled as fake.  [This is extremely dangerous to our democracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/88ll08/this_is_what_happens_when_one_company_owns_dozens/) because forming an opinion based on false or misleading information isn't really forming an opinion at all.  It is simply accepting what someone else wants you to believe.  Now, more than ever, we have to fight against all forms of fake news and protect ethical journalism.  In order to do that, though, it is absolutely vital that a clear distinction be drawn between the various forms of news and which ones are unethical.

# Forms of News (Best to Worst)

**Objective, Factual News**

This type of news is ideal.  It contains only the facts of a story with almost no loaded language, omitted information, false facts, or exaggerations.  Sadly, this news is not very popular because it isn't entertaining to read.  Parsing through page after page of news articles that are entirely fact based is about as fun as reading the user manual before using your new phone.  In an ideal world, everyone would do it, but realistically, no one feels the effort is worth it.  As a result, it isn't worth it to a news outlet to even produce news in this category.  Furthermore, it is difficult for even the best journalist to write without even a stitch of their personal view creeping into an article.  So, even if there was a market for this type of news, it would be incredibly difficult to find journalists capable of writing completely objectively while still making the article interesting.

**Slightly Biased, Factual News**

I know, I know.  It's odd to see biased news at the near top of this list.  However, biased news isn't inherently bad *as long as it is factual*.  Bias can be as simple as occasional loaded language (i.e. ""Politician 1 stubbornly refused to sign Bill 1"" vs ""Politician 1 didn't sign Bill 1"").  The reason this is mostly acceptable is because you can still get the full picture even if the language is clearly biased.  In the above example, one would know exactly what Politician 1 did or didn't do by reading either article.

**Factual News with Bias by Omission**

The next level of bias is deliberate omission of details (i.e. ""Politician 1 didn't vote that cats and dogs are cute"" vs ""Politician 1 didn't vote that cats and dogs are cute because they were sick the day of the vote"").  This is another common form of bias that is more dangerous than simple loaded language.  By leaving out key details, news articles can make a situation seem much different than what it really is.  Obviously, the level and motive of omission is key.  It is 100% fine to leave out details that don't add anything to the story, but when it crosses over into omitting details that make a certain side look worse or better, that is an issue.  Leaving out small details that support a certain side is bad, but it is *not fake news*.  However, leaving out major details in order to support a side is definitely getting dangerously close.  This is a common form of bias used by many major news outlets.

**Exaggerated News**

This is about on par with bias by omission.  It is taking a true statement and making it sound worse or better than it really is (i.e. ""Politician 1 loses control and yells at interviewer"" vs ""Politician 1 raises voice to be heard over interviewer"").  This tactic is often used to snag clicks or views.  Again, the level of exaggeration is key.  Slight exaggeration is bad, but fairly common.  It is bad journalism, but *not fake news*.  Heavy exaggeration is much worse and can sometimes dip over into outright misinformation, which is the beginning of fake news.  Like bias by omission, exaggeration is commonly used.

**Accidental False Information**

Let me start this off with a clear distinction: this category is only for genuinely accidental false information, specifically, if a journalist unknowingly gets false information from a source or uses false information that was believed to be true at the time of writing.  This situation is unfortunate.  It is technically fake news, but it shouldn't really be thrown in that category since the misinformation was accidental (bonus points if the news outlet posts a correction soon after the error is discovered).  There is nothing really that can be done to prevent this entirely, and it shouldn't discredit the news outlet if the journalist did their due diligence.  Not in this category are situations where journalists use uncorroborated or shady sources without being reasonably confident they have the truth (this falls into the category of disinformation).

**""Clever"" Quotes and Phrasing**

Some news sources use ""clever"" tactics to avoid being labeled as fake news, but that doesn't mean they aren't harmful (i.e. ""^Random ^citizen ^claims the earth is flat"" or ""^Many ^think Politician 1 is actually a lizard person"").  These are deliberately misleading and are not in any way beneficial.  Just because they are technically true doesn't make them any less inappropriate for news.

**Negligent Disinformation**

Now we are in honest-to-goodness, 100% fake news territory.  This is made-up or baseless information presented as news.  People who make up statistics out of thin air, use statistics based on unscientific studies, rely on unreliable sources, and report what they *think* is true fall into this category.  They may not be knowingly lying, but they are also not making any effort to tell the truth.  This type of news is harmful and should be actively guarded against.

**Deliberate Disinformation**

And now we've reached the worst of the worst.  This category has ""Fake News"" tattooed on its forehead.  There is a plethora of news that is written by people who know the information is false.  Everything from trash tabloids to radical political news outlets qualify.  Sometimes, the news is so unbelievable that only the most gullible could believe it.  Other times, the news is crafted in such a way that it is easily believable if you aren't on guard.  This form of fake news has a serious side-effect: it discredits legitimate news.  That is what makes it so dangerous.  To allow it to do so is just as bad as reading it and believing it.  Either way, it is promoting ignorance.

# Not News

I know this should be obvious, but please don't get your news from these sources:

**Op-eds**

**Talk Shows**

**Comedy Shows**

**Social Media**

**Friends, Family, and Coworkers**

# Conclusion

It is vital that we all work together to protect good/ethical journalism and fight against fake/misleading news in its many forms.  An important part of that is being clear when discussing news sources and being careful to select only those that are high quality for our personal use.  As human beings, it is our responsibility to seek out and protect the truth even if it is difficult or disadvantageous.  Stay vigilant!",21Dec2018,1

1) Struggle awakes the animal within.

2) You have a spirit animal within you.

3) The eyes are the windows to the soul.

Got all three of those? Okay. So let’s get started. 

Dr. King once said that a true measure of a person is not where they stand in times of comfort but in times of controversy. It is easy to say we believe in something or stand for something but you never really know until those beliefs are challenged. But there are so few true challenges these days. There are no more wolves at the door. There are no barbarians at the gates. I hate competing against other people but I enjoy competing against myself so I do this in the gym. You don’t know how strong you are unless you truly test yourself. 

That brings us to your spirit animal. We all have an animal inside of us that is yearning to be loosed. Call it what you will. A lion, a tiger, a shark, a stag, a dragon but there is a primal beast within us longing to run. I can feel that animal inside me when I am pushing my limits on the weights and straining to get that last rep. It is within these moments where I really feel alive. (There is another way to trigger that primal beast and feel alive but Katy Perry still won’t slide into my DMs or return my calls.) That beast wants to live and it is living its best life when those limits are being tested. 

If you want to learn how to tap into that beast, this is one way to do it. 

First off, you are going to look psychotic so if you feel self-conscious, do this in private. There is a reason why gyms have mirrors. There is a reason why in every sports movie, the hero stares at himself in the mirror. The trick is you have to get nose to nose with yourself. Let your face and particularly your eyes be your sole focus. Stare deep into your own eyes. I mean really stare deep. You have to do that thousand-mile stare into your own pupils. Now, that beast may not emerge immediately depending upon how many mental barriers you have put up to keep them caged. However, I will say that the more you tap into this creature, the easier it is to summon. 

So why tap into this beast? Because he (or she) will fill you with confidence. They whisper to you that you can do it. They will help you slog through the blood and the mud that you have been trudging through. When someone tells you that you can’t do something, the beast disagrees. When no one believes in you, the beast will. But the beast will only emerge when the going gets tough. They emerge when they are needed. So, if you are having a tough time right now, celebrate the struggle. This is your chance to show your quality. It is your chance to show what you are really made of. If you need help getting over that hump, tap into the animal. Stare deep into your own eyes as closely as you can. You will hear that little voice whispering to you, “You can do this.”  

I know it sounds crazy but I am telling you… it works. ",21Dec2018,1

72,"I'm a senior girl in college. Back in October, I was at the same semi-boring party last week that I always go to, and I saw something that finally annoyed me to no end.

There was this freshman geek boy named Brent, bragging about his poker skills. AGAIN. He's won 11 straight tournaments with his friends he says. Brags that they don't even want to play with him anymore.

I offered to sit down for a game. Maybe start with $20?

He said ""Are you serious, I'd send you home without a penny to your name, sweet cheeks."" He and his geeky friends laughed at his nickname. I was fuming inside but pressed on, asking for a quick game.

20 minutes later, and I took $350 from him.

""B-b-but that's my textbook money."" I said ""Well, you still have something to bet with."" And my eyes went down to his wardrobe.

I think he felt he had no choice.

An hour later, and this 5'7, slightly chubby geek stood up from his chair, hooked his thumbs in his waistband, and dropped his boxers to his ankles. Stepping out of them, he sheepishly handed them to me.

""WOOOOO!!! Nice UNDIES!"" I triumphantly yelled and did a little victory lap around the table (and my naked opponent), whipping them in a circle like a victory flag.

There he stood. Wearing only his glasses. Tanned from the neck up, lily-white from the neck down.

A slightly rounded, chubby belly that he was hiding with his shirt. A small penis (of course). And his surprisingly cute, very plump bubble butt behind him.

Then I went for the cherry on top.

He reached for his clothes, and I smacked his hand.

""But...I don't have anything to wear!""

I said ""Would you get your money back too? You lost. Go home.""

I knew that our school never arrests frat boys for streaking. They've been doing it for years as tradition.

As he sheepishly shuffled to the door...buck naked...holding his balls for dear life. I towered over him (I'm about 5'11).

""Next time don't get so cocky, SWEET CHEEKS!!!"" and I spanked his naked ass and sent him running out 2 miles across the quad back to his dorm in 40 degree weather.

Virgin exposed to the world.

79,"I just graduated from college at a university on the west coast and now that I'm done, I guess I feel like reminiscing. 

I was unpopular in high school, and going into college, I was hoping to turn that around, to be more popular and make more friends. 

Freshman year, I made a couple friends at first, but we weren't close and by sophomore year they'd started drifting away. I wasn't being invited to parties, people were growing distant, and I started wondering what I'd done wrong. Why were many of the people I'd met drifting away from me?

I thought about it for a while, and tried to figure out what the people with more friends were doing differently than me. The main difference I noticed was that they were more positive - they didn't put people down, they didn't brag or be mean, they weren't unnecessarily aggressive, and they were generally nice and pleasant people. So I decided to be more positive. 

In a way, I was fortunate, because the people I was trying to be friends with were themselves good people. I suppose if the people around me were not so good, then my attempts to appeal to them probably would have made me a worse person. 

I started by being less aggressive about things that didn't warrant aggression. I also tried to be more genuinely interested in the people around me, and whenever something negative came to mind, a sarcastic comment or put-down, I kept my mouth shut and looked for something positive to say instead. 

I kept at it, and it slowly became a natural part of my personality. By the time senior year started, I didn't even notice it - being positive was just something I did naturally. But graduation approached, and a couple days ago was my last day there before leaving for good, moving across the country to start my career. And I noticed how much that change in me changed how people interacted with me. 

Freshman and sophomore year people were drifting away, so I tried being more positive. Years later, I had my final night in that city, and I had to decide between three different groups of friends who wanted to hang out with me before I left. The contrast was huge, and as someone who spent most of his formative years unpopular with few friends, I couldn't help but appreciate how much things had changed, that that many people appreciated me. 

I ended up getting dinner with one group, and after we were done, I met up with another group for drinks at a bar. And after it was all done, I couldn't help but think, it worked. I tried being more positive, and it worked.",21Dec2018,1

81,"Lately I have been having trouble with word formation. Like I have the sentence I want to say in my head, but at the end it comes out like one words or a totally fucked up word. My professor asked my what I will be doing on new years even, and I wanted to say: I will be in my bed sleeping, but all came out of my mouth was “sleeping”. Sometimes I want to say a word and I say it but I add like a random letter somewhere in that world. I am tired of this and frequently misunderstood and I hate that!!",21Dec2018,1
82,"Me: I feel so useless and my creativity feels pointless.

My brain: That's because you're not creative. What you make is plain and deriviative and not good on any level.

Me:  \*sells a bunch of my creations and also gets commissions\*  Oh!

My brain:  It's only because they pity you.  You radiate doubt.  They would even bother with their pity if you didn't sell them for cheap.  You make crap.  Die.",21Dec2018,1
84,"I'm a senior girl in college. Back in October, I was at the same semi-boring party last week that I always go to, and I saw something that finally annoyed me to no end.

There was this freshman geek boy named Brent, bragging about his poker skills. AGAIN. He's won 11 straight tournaments with his friends he says. Brags that they don't even want to play with him anymore.

I offered to sit down for a game. Maybe start with $20?

He said ""Are you serious, I'd send you home without a penny to your name, sweet cheeks."" He and his geeky friends laughed at his nickname. I was fuming inside but pressed on, asking for a quick game.

20 minutes later, and I took $350 from him.

""B-b-but that's my textbook money."" I said ""Well, you still have something to bet with."" And my eyes went down to his wardrobe.

I think he felt he had no choice.

An hour later, and this 5'7, slightly chubby geek stood up from his chair, hooked his thumbs in his waistband, and dropped his boxers to his ankles. Stepping out of them, he sheepishly handed them to me.

""WOOOOO!!! Nice UNDIES!"" I triumphantly yelled and did a little victory lap around the table (and my naked opponent), whipping them in a circle like a victory flag.

There he stood. Wearing only his glasses. Tanned from the neck up, lily-white from the neck down.

A slightly rounded, chubby belly that he was hiding with his shirt. A small penis (of course). And his surprisingly cute, very plump bubble butt behind him.

Then I went for the cherry on top.

He reached for his clothes, and I smacked his hand.

""But...I don't have anything to wear!""

I said ""Would you get your money back too? You lost. Go home.""

I knew that our school never arrests frat boys for streaking. They've been doing it for years as tradition.

As he sheepishly shuffled to the door...buck naked...holding his balls for dear life. I towered over him (I'm about 5'11).

""Next time don't get so cocky, SWEET CHEEKS!!!"" and I spanked his naked ass and sent him running out 2 miles across the quad back to his dorm in 40 degree weather.

Virgin exposed to the world.

Ladies, did I go too far, or is this just some good solid revenge??",21Dec2018,1
85,"Ok so I got a tooth extracted yesterday and for some reason my right lower jaw (tooth that was pulled was on right upper jaw) directly under the tooth that was pulled kept getting a sharp pain even before I left the dental office. 

I had asked the nurse if it was normal to have a shooting sharp pain like that and she told me it was normal to have pain but not that type of pain. I shrugged it off and thought it was just my teeth adjusting to the tooth being gone or the way I was moving my jaw with the gauze. 

The dentist did put sutures over the hole to prevent dry socket as he knew I am a smoker (yay for awesome dentist!) When I got home I told my boyfriend about this weird pain I kept getting in my lower jaw and he told me it was phantom tooth pain and he had the same issue when he had a couple of his pulled and it would go away after a few days. 

I still get the weird pain every now and then but it pretty much stopped once I changed the gauze the nurse put in. Now that I don't have to have gauze in it only hurts when I open my mouth too wide like when I yawn. 

Anyone else have a weird experience like this after getting their tooth pulled?

86,"I’m referring to talking to girls. So basically there’s this girl I had a thing with last year but messed things up because of my social anxiety. Now these past few months of my freshman year of college have been pretty life changing. I’ve grown so much as a person through meeting new and amazing friends and therapy. 

Now recently I asked this girl to hang out again and she agreed. I feel better and slightly more capable of doing this even while still having social anxiety, however my small relationship/sexual experience makes me feel like I’m not worthy, that she could be fucking with any other confident and regular guy as opposed to me. 

Anyone have advice on how to deal with this? Because I get it, girls are human just like us, and it’s silly to put them on a pedestal, but when I think about my lack of experience and the disorder(s) I have I feel like an alien sometimes underneath my normal looking surface.",21Dec2018,1
