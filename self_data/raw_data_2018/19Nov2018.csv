1,"Today I got off my second connecting flight from New Zealand in Boston (~20 hours travel time) and I was looking for my connecting flight and I walked past a TSA agent in a small corridor and read a sign on the other end that said “no returning beyond this point”. I turned around (didn’t even step towards him) to ask him if I was going in the right direction and he told me rudely to back up, that I could not cross the line he drew on the floor. I then asked about my flight and he said it was inside where he was and to go around and get rechecked through security. I suggested to him he should put the sign at the front of the corridor so you can read it before you actually cross the line. His reaction was “Do you want to find out? Do you want to find out? Sir, do you want to find out? Get out of here.” He was obviously threatening to detain me or something. Anyway, fuck that guy.",19Nov2018,3

5,"So my nephew and I are 2 years apart and I really can’t stand him. He puts me down all the time and makes me feel small. He calls me ignorant, tells me that I am better off dead, and gets under my skin all the time. When he comes over to eat dinner with his mom, dad, and other brother I just stay upstairs until dinner. He always tries to prove me wrong and does not let me have an opinion. Today his mom called me to help him with his math homework because I am 2 grade above him and know how to do it. I explained it in the way my teacher had explained it when I was his age. I have horrible ADHD and have the worst patients in the world. I did not take my Adderall because it is the weekend and I had no school. I helped him and went home. Later that night my dad got a call from his mom and said that he had another page of homework to do and I NEEDED to help him. We were about to eat dinner with my moms friend who had surgery a little bit ago and just got out of the hospital and wanted some really food. He came over right when we sat down to eat. My parents asked if he wanted anything and he said that all he wanted was for me to help him. My parents asked if he was sure that he did not want a bite to eat and he got kinda pissed and freaked out just like his mom does and start yelling. He said that I did not explain the math at all to him that I was stupid and that his mom was mad at me because I gave him the answer and that he did not care about me. Usually I don’t get emotional when he yells at me but I think that I just broke. I wanted to scream at him and tell him to go fuck himself but I started to cry instead. My parents haven’t seen me cry in a long time. I asked to go upstairs and my mom told me to take my food with me. I have been thinking it over for the past hour and he is still here getting help with math homework from my mom. A part of me want to go down stairs and beat the shit out of him and the other part of me wants to cry. I don’t think that it is a phase that he is going through because it’s been like this for like 2 years. Every time I see him I want to beat him up when he talks to me like that. I try to get away from all of my sisters family but it’s like a hole and I’m stuck. My mom wants me to start going to a counselor for him and other thing but I keep saying no because the last counselor I went was not really good. I just don’t know want to do I don’t even want to go to school anymore because I known that he is there. I know it sounds bad but I really really hate him a lot. I want a break from him but he is always over. My blood starts to boil when I think of him. I try to tell my mom that I don’t like him and she tells me that I need to lighten up a bit. I think the incident tonight kinda proved to my parents how much of a dick that he really is. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just really don’t want to go to a counselor like my mom wants.",19Nov2018,1

Anyways I  \\asked this pretty blonde chick in front of me if she knew when the bus  was coming, and I was really expecting just a 2 word answer, just out of  politeness, but she seemed really eager to talk and urged on an entire  conversation, in this shitty depressing weather where everyone was  covering their faces with their hats and hoods. It flowed really easily  too, was not expecting that. We left without exchanging numbers because I  thought she was just being polite,  but it didn't occur to me until I  got home that night that I probably  could have asked for her number and  set up a date right then and there.

Same   shit happened a few months ago when me and another girl were standing   in front of a professor's office (completely unromantic setting), just   the two of us waiting there, and she was smiling directly at me for  like forever, with her mouth slightly open.

Over the past few months, i've seen that during conversations I am unable to recall words and properly articulate what I mean and I resort to using simpler words. I feel that over the past few months I've also had a foggy brain with most activities I do. Making decisions has also become more challenging, something I never used to struggle with. I've cut down on my alcohol consumption and smoking weed because of this. I still do smoke cigarettes though. Any advice would be appreciated, any tips on how to get back my edge and sharpness.

34,"/emotional rant

Gonna put this here bc I don't have anyone to talk to about it:

I didn't realize it before, but when my emotions flair out of control and I hit something I don't do it because I want to break that thing, I do it because I want to hurt myself.

I realized it when I punched my wall last night. The shock that went through my arm and the cuts I got on my knuckles was what got my pain out, not putting a hole in the wall. Now I want to skip the middle man and not ruin my room, I just want to hurt myself quietly. My motivation of ""I haven't self harmed yet what's the point in starting now"" is invalid because I have been self harming all along.

35,"Writing this as a form of therapy, I think I just need my to get my thoughts out into words to help me with the process of moving on.

&amp;#x200B;

I broke up with a girlfriend of a year and half about a month and a half ago. We're both 23 and met together during a meetup that both our respective organizations held. We kicked it off and started dating soon after meeting.

In retrospect, she was amazing. No issues at all personality wise, we had a lot of the same interests, same sense of humor, and she was always down for anything. We've only had 4 arguments in our entire relationship. The first year of the relationship was great, I felt like I had found ""the one"". Unfortunately, it was after that period where I started to have serious doubts about staying in the relationship.

She never did anything wrong in particular, the issues stemmed from myself. I felt it was a mix of factors. One being that I started feeling like I was tied down in sense, like I started to just want to be free to go where I want and do what I want without worrying about the feelings of a significant other. I was always an independent person and enjoyed being single, I felt that I had gone into a relationship because it ""felt right"" and I think those feelings of wanting my independence back started coming back after a year. I'm graduating college soon and I just couldn't get out of my head how I just want to enjoy my 20s single.

Another factor was that I felt I couldn't give the same love she could give me, she came from a far more well off family, and she did give me plenty of gifts. But she also showed her love and affection through being kind and supportive of me emotionally. And it sounds so wrong, and I don't know why but when these feelings started surfacing of wanting to be single again I felt like I didn't reciprocate her affection much as I could have been. She wanted to hang out and I just wanted to go off and do my own thing. She felt giving small and thoughtful gifts here and there was cute, and when I did give gifts it almost felt like a chore to do so. I know I sound like a dick, but I'm just trying to be honest. I started feeling really bad that she was being so kind and all I did was play along and act like everything was ok.

I also felt like I was losing attraction to her. Like I started feeling like I wasn't as sexually into her as I use to be. And I am aware that this is superficial thinking, but again I wanted to be honest in this post. And finally, I was just tired of being in a relationship in general. The expectations, responsibilities, having your significant other's problems becoming your problems. It just made me miss being single even more.

I waited six months before I actually ended it. There were some moments where I was with her and genuinely happy, and think maybe I'm stupid to be thinking these thoughts. Then there were a lot more times when I was just thinking how much better it would be to just be single again.

Eventually I did end it. I felt like she deserved better, a guy who could love her the same way she gives her love. She was understandably devastated. We didn't talk after for about a month until she asked if we could meet for proper closure. We did, and she told me she wanted to end on good terms. It hurts right now to think that despite the fact that I just blindsighted her like this, she still cared enough to make sure we ended things well. I answered her questions as gently and respectfully as I could. She understood and said that in the end, it's better we part ways and not keep in contact. I asked if that meant we couldn't be friends in the future (which is what I hoped for). She said it was probably best we didn't, I was close to crying right there but I nodded my head and told her I respect her decision.

Since then I've had ups and downs. Some days are ok, and I can function decently well without thinking too much about her. Other times I times I think back to the relationship and feel a great deal of sadness. At the end though, I don't think I regret my decision. When I think about things logically, the thoughts I have that involve considering getting back don't really involve the relationship in general, but feeling very bad for her and getting back mostly through pity. Which wouldn't be a good reason because I feel those feelings I had would just come back if I didn't get into a relationship because I genuinely wanted to again. I understand time heals all wounds, but the bad days really suck. It's not like I didn't care, I cared deeply. But came to the realization that I'm not in the right place in my life yet for a relationship, and that I didn't want to stay and just lead her on.

Another reason I wrote this is because I fell into another sad state after one of her friends told me that she originally wanted to meet after the breakup to try to see if she could get me back. And my heart really started to ache when I realized how I had told her during the meeting that I didn't see myself getting into a relationship for a while, and that I had seen her eyes get a little wet after saying that. It's now that I realize that she probably realized herself that she wouldn't be able to do that, so she probably didn't bother trying to get me back after that statement. A lot of the pain I've felt from the breakup really stems from thinking about how bad I hurt her, because she genuinely is someone with a golden heart and I really ended up screwing her over. 

I hope that she can eventually be happy again, and I hope that I can move on as well. I don't know if anyone will actually take the time to read all of this because it looks like I wrote an essay. It did feel a little relaxing though being able to write this all down. 

TLDR: broke up with an amazing girl who did nothing wrong. A lot of the reasons why stemmed from me just wanting to be independent and single again. Dealing with emotions after a breakup fucking sucks.

38,"In the past year, I've been really stressed over my university studies to the point where I sort of feel burned out and have a hard time motivating myself to get out of bed in the morning, much less study.  In order to cope with this (I think), I've sort of started convincing myself that things will work out fine in the end since they almost always have.  And therein lies my problem.  Even though I want to do well and hate myself for being a lazy ass, even though I mentally beat myself up for not doing as well as I know and have proven I can do, I can't seem to get or motivate myself to change.  As the term is coming to a close, stuff is piling on for a group project for which my group is far behind, and even though I'm generally skating along just fine in most of my classes at my current level of effort, I'm not doing anywhere near as well as I know I could do if I actually got myself to kick my bad habits and change.  I'm afraid that at this current rate, I'll end up having a nervous breakdown if I can't adjust my behavior as things pile on and drop out.  I want to avoid that at all costs and just thinking about it makes me uncomfortably anxious.

39,"I cannot ever tell this to anyone. Not to my wife. Not to my friends, my relatives, least of all to my children. But I was a lonely and broken and somewhat socially awkward teenager. High school was weird. I just went through the motions. Had few friends. Not a lot of successful romantic encounters, although I did decently. Couldn't really keep anyone around. Couldn't keep them interested for me for the long haul. 

At twenty I met a girl who was crazy about me. I thought she was... okay? But I started writing these long romantic letters to her. Because writing was and is my only talent. If you saw them you would probably call them sappy and overly emotional but it worked like a charm. She fell for me. Hard. She was a creative person too. She was sweet. Interested. Pretty horny. And she was kinda cute too, I guess, although the cuteness quickly wore off in my eyes once I 'got' her. 

At age twenty one I was terrified she'd see me as a fraud. See right through me. I was terrified of losing her and somehow had an irrational fear of never finding someone new ever again. So I suggested we got engaged. She agree, enthusiastically. Asked her to marry me on a windy beach watching the sunset it was so movie-like but even though I was supposed to feel overwhelmed I somehow... didn't?

Also at age twenty-one (she was 19) I got her pregnant. She freaked out but within a week, embraced impending motherhood with almost religious zeal. I was overwhelmed for a while too. Finally some real emotion! We got married. Shotgun wedding. I was glad. At least now I had someone. Somehow. The baby was born shortly after our wedding. And I was genuinely happy for a while, I think, but again it quickly wore off. Fatherhood was nice, I liked the thought of having ""a kid out there"" but beyond that, I felt empty. I didn't get that rush of sudden, all-powerful love.

My job took me far away for sometimes months at a time. I would miss the kid. Miss my wife. Sometimes, I would cry. But usually this was also somewhat forced. I couldn't really cry unless I played a sad song. Or stared intently for a long time at my baby's pictue. I was just glad to be able to say ""I am a father"" or ""I have a wife"". It made me feel less broken somehow, as if I now was someone who, at least in the eyes of wider society, lived a more complete example of the human experience. 

Years passed and we had another child. And another. And I cannot help but feeling like a fraud. Like someone desperate to portray a role that doesn't feel natural to me. I'm a decent husband. I am a decent father. But it all seems so boring to me. I often look at my single friends traveling the world and wish I hadn't gotten married and had kids so damn young. I wish I had waited until I was 42 or something and financially well-off, and married some cute hottie two decades my junior to have a later-in-life family with. I would have been more well-rounded as a person. Would have had more experiences in life, more freedom for a long time and less regrets. 

If I married later in life I wouldn't have dreaded what my wife would become, in later years. I wouldn't be in my late twenties and looking in the mirror, asking who the fuck I even was. I wouldn't look at my wife and resent her for letting herself go, while simultaneously resenting myself for doing the same. I wouldn't always be tired and haggard. I wouldn't struggle to get and stay hard when I fuck my wife. I wouldn't always fantasize about other women. And I still wouldn't have died alone, had I married at an older age. I still would have had something, someone. But I rushed into it. I rushed into it for reasons that now seem so silly and useless and pointless and damnit, I regret that.

If I had a time machine, I am not sure if I would even do things differently. My children are beautiful. They are amazing tiny little human beings and to erase my past would be to erase them, something I am not prepared to do. But honestly there are times when I wish the world's most tiny and random meteor would hit my house, go straight through the roof and save everyone but me, killing me as I leave the shower. So that I would be dead and some good man could wife up my lady and take care of those kids better than I could.

Yes I'm depressed but I don't even know of a point in my life where my state of mind was any better. Life has turned out to be a disappointment overall. I resent my choices. I regret rushing. I didn't have to. There was no need. But I did it anyway. And now I lie in the bed I made with no one to blame but myself.",19Nov2018,1

46,"I went to undergrad at a fairly well known state school and spent almost all of my time studying, neglecting many other things like my social life and my health. I worked very hard and did four different internships before graduating in only 7 semesters. I definitely felt satisfaction about what I was studying but I also acknowledged what I was doing was a means to an end at the time, that being getting a fulfilling job in my field. I really didn't do much else other than schoolwork to be honest. Didn't really engage in that many extracurriculars, didn't date at all, didn't get too involved with friends. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from my institution and I got accepted to every grad school I applied to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rather than going to the one that was the most well known in my field (Civil Engineering), I went to an Ivy League School as it was something I had dreamed of doing when I was in high school. I ended up doing a rather pricy one year accelerated program rather than staying at a renowned-within-the-field state school that would have given me a funded research position but a longer and more fruitful period of study. While my decision actually wasn't that financially devastating (due to me being able to make money this year rather than live on a stipend for two) I ended up not getting a lot out of my grad school experience (I was also fairly depressed an un-engaged that year). I have gone from being in the top of my class to being fairly mediocre in what I studied compared to my peers who have additional study in structural engineering. I was never sure whether I wanted to focus on transportation/traffic engineering or structural, but I followed my adviser's advice and went with the one that was more versatile, which was structures.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a job now at a big company that required me to move to a different state across the country. I don't know a single soul here. I went into a very specific subset of structural engineering, which is bridge engineering. I did not take a lot of seismic coursework nor did I take anything on bridges, and even the most fundamental structural classes are only intermediate level. I tell this to people who get concerned, but truthfully there is nothing unsafe about this - you have to thoroughly prove each and every thing in your bridge works with equations and models, which is rigorously checked both internally and externally. However, it does make my job very challenging for me. I am not familiar with much of the code or the procedure. I spend hours a day reading manuals only to get no useful information out of them. There was no orientation period, they assigned me to a project day 1, and I am the sole designer of my project. It is expected that I will ask for help if and or when I need it. I ask questions to some of the senior engineers, some of which have casually berated me for not understanding a simple concept, particularly since I came from an ""elite university"". Often times too, the senior engineers offer contradictory advice on how to do things, which makes my interpretation of my job that much more challenging. We don't have too much work to do, I've never felt pressured by time. But in a way, that has made things worse. I have a blank template, a sandbox, and I am expected to know how to get from Point A to Point B in a matter of months with very little help or support.

&amp;#x200B;

The few times I get a simpler albeit mundane task, like updating an excel spreadsheet, answering emails, or going to a meeting, I breathe a sigh of relief as it is one of the few times I don't have to endure hours of mental torment and struggle. Worst yet is most of my colleagues are workaholics, including the new hires I came in with. They are all married. As far as I am aware, none of them drink or go out or really do much outside of the office to be honest (one of my Chinese coworkers had never tried Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, OR Mexican food and we live in California). I know for a fact many of them are in for 10+ hours a day. I just long for 5 PM every day, and I don't take a lunch break because it means I get to leave that much sooner. However, every day, I go home and have nothing to do. I hang out every night with on Discord with a bunch of underachieving more-than-casually-racist people who I don't even like. I don't know anyone here and I never have any energy to do anything because I stay up late every night. I suspect the reason I stay up late is because I am subconsciously procrastinating going to work; even though I can't change the time I go in, I can change the conscious time I have before I have to go in. However, this creates a cruel cycle of hating work that much more due to being fatigued. I am afraid what I am doing is completely unsustainable and I will be utterly burned out or lost within the next one to two months. I just don't know what to do. A car speeding through a red light almost hit me the other day and I thought for a split second about how great it would be to spend a month in the hospital rather than going into the office.",19Nov2018,1

Her coworker basically trash talked me to her, saying “Why doesn’t he pay for you all the time?” “If he doesn’t get you anything for Christmas, you shouldn’t get him anything,” “Why are you paying for his gas?” Etc.  and I got offended for about a day but now I’m over it.  Yes, I occasionally pay for my gf, and try my hardest to pay for her when I can because of the wage difference, but I prioritize putting the bulk of my money towards car payments to help my dad out. Even if I earn more per hour than them, I only work 16 hours every 2 weeks (equivalent to 1 day per week). Since I get paid biweekly, each payment to my dad is equivalent to one paycheck. I work so little because I’m usually assigned graveyard shifts on the weekends, and I’ve been prioritizing school and aiming for straight A’s until I graduate because i fucked up a semester last year. 

Also this girl broke up with her bf, but he bought her an iPhone and still pays the monthly bills for her. And she has the audacity to suggest relationship advice to my gf when we have an extremely healthy relationship and havent fought in the past 4 months of dating, or past year as friends.

56,"There was a point sometime, in the last ten years, when the man I thought I was, the man I thought I'd be, disappeared. There must've been a moment when my brain closed and reopened. The normality of my own soul was disassociated and torn out, thrown into the universe like an existential scavenger hunt. The only thing is, nobody has the clues. Nobody is giving this celestial search any pointers or direction. So where does that leave the definition of me? Suddenly it feels strange saying ""I"" or ""Me"". Like there's an unknown, and very confused pilot who's taken flight of my body, my mind, my choices, my life, and my heart. This mind, this body, is incomplete. It's to the point emotion, is felt as somewhat of an antagonistic force egging me far from the one true connection to my lost soul: peace. As this is written, there is an overwhelming sensation of craving that concept, peace. Peace of mind, peace in this world, peace. Perhaps the cosmos understand what we never will. Perhaps there is nothing to understand and this sensation is truly unexplainable. The real question is, if that man I've lost returns, will he be happy? How do I forge a new path when I'm not there to enjoy it? Is this peace I crave even real? If I find it, will there be room for that man I've lost to enjoy it?

57,"(Sorry about shitty formatting. Doing this on my phone) I am in college and have been living with two girls for about four months now. I’ve gone through some pretty tough times due to a fairly recent breakup that happened over the summer. This boyfriend, who broke up with me because he didn’t want to be “tied down”, is now my neighbor and lives with two other guys, one of which is my roommate’s soon-to-be fiancé. Basically, my ex banned me from ever coming over there because it was too hard for him or some shit so I was isolated for a couple months because everybody hung out at his place and never at mine. I got into a deep depression and got drunk every night for two months and only stopped because I ran out of money to pay for my habit. 

I’ve been going to a therapist and feel much better. One of my roommates was really there for me and we talked a ton and grew really close. The other roommate has never been here and is always next door with her boyfriend. She takes our pots and pans to his place to use and we get stuck with nothing. Then, she complains about how I never tell her anything when she’s never there for me to talk to even if I wanted to. She also loves being around my ex and even sticks up for him when I talk shit (as you’re supposed to do and have the right to do when someone you thought you were going to marry shits on your whole life).

I’m alright when hanging out with close friends, but because the whole school is going to be there, it’s stressing me out. I have an irrational fear of judgment and that I’m going to make a fool out of myself.

62,"it's very hard. I decided to date on Nightmare Mode by getting married to a man (no regrets) and then trying to date women as a couple. which I understand is very hard and may be impossible, however I'm very patient and open-minded.


I'm okay if we end up not being able to date someone together. it's a cliche but the journey is worth so much more than the destination. but I'm not gonna lie- I want attention from women! and it seems only my husband gets the attention! the women we've met like the sexual/complimentary attention I give but when conversation rolls around they're most engaged with my husband. I also haven't received any attention from these women, which I figured was because it's hard for women to do that... yet they have no trouble flirting with my husband!


it kinda leaves me feeling undesirable and a little used, you know? I feel like we're meeting a lot of people who want to test/indulge in bicuriosity and we're a safe bet for a lot of people :/ my husband hasn't done anything wrong but I'm jealous that people want him but not me...

Now that I finally got comfortable enough to show affection as well -to show you that despite not having shown it until now, I've always very much cared about you-, you stopped caring.

You invited yourself into my life, spent all this time trying to make me like you, and now that I do, you're acting cold, uninterested and are treating me like a damn stranger.

You used to hug me all the time, smile whenever you spoke to me, ask me to spend time with you whenever possible, give me cute little handmade gifts, and I'll never be able to forget that look of genuine happiness and comfort in your eyes when looking at me.
Now you give me a half arsed ""hello"" once a day, barely look me in the eye, and we haven't spent time together in weeks.
There were two things you used to LOVE doing together with me, and now you don't care about them.

You don't hate me. I just stopped being your priority. That's what's eating me. I'd like to believe I've done something wrong, something which I can fix. But there isn't anything to fix.

67," Pigs in a Pen 
I was awoken by the ear-piercing screams of missiles soaring over my head. It was an alarm clock for me as a barrage of missiles flew by every morning at 7:30 am. Even though it was still pitch black outside due to the smoke covering the sun, I could tell that it was morning. I sluggishly shuffled down the stairs; there is nothing in this barren city to care about.
Finding another human being in this devastated excuse of a town is as likely as seeing pigs fly. Daily, via television, the government briefly informs us that it is illegal to go out of our homes due to the danger the war poses. The houses all over the country are resistant to most forms of weapons, or so the government says. I open my computer and start trying to contact my friends since the only sources of entertainment nowadays are shows on the television coming from countries not involved in our affairs, and the other source of entertainment clearly being computers as I can access the Internet and contact others in the same situation as me, as I previously stated.
Anyways, you are most likely somewhat confused about the current situation I am in, and I have not introduced myself yet either. My name is Samuel Haft and I am 54 years old, I lack friends in the sense that I do not have any friends in real life. My hobbies are eating and spending time on the Internet. Every home has a food generator that takes pictures of food from the Internet and produces it. I am not sure how it works since none of us are well educated due to the constant occurrence of wars. Within the 54 years, I have been alive, there has not been any excitement whatsoever. Every single foolish day I am on this planet I wake up, and by noon, the level of boredom I reach begins to hinder my ability to perform everyday tasks.
I walk around my home every day contemplating my life decisions and simultaneously, I decide my next meal. After ages of mindlessly walking like a baby sheep following its herd, I found my desired meal; Eggs and bacon. I did not wish for a complicated meal; something as simple as eggs and bacon seemed fitting. I dragged my feet along the floor until I reached the food generator in the kitchen. I hooked my computer up to the generator and searched for “eggs and bacon”, I anticipated the arrival of my food and focused my gaze on the food generator until I hear the familiar “ding” come from the food generator signifying that the food was ready.
By the time my meal was ready, I had already planned what I was going to eat for my next meal. I am never truly hungry and most of the time, I am just yearning for something to satisfy my taste buds. I always eat my meals before I am hungry, therefore, I never get hungry unless I eat too little in my previous meal. Food these days taste different from how they tasted when I was in my childhood, or at least that is what I recall. One of the reasons I like tasting different foods from all sorts of cultures is because about 20 years ago, when the war that is going on currently started, the food generators were introduced, and that is when my hobby of tasting foods from across the world started. Similar to the present, I had nothing to do at the time and I was still not accustomed to the boredom of staying home 24/7. Over the years, It slowly occurred to me that the food was starting to taste unusually similar and more and more tasteless. Earlier this year, I actually looked further into the predicament by conferencing with my online companions. It was not only me who found the food peculiar, one of my friends who claims to have aided in the creation of the food generators revealed that artificial flavours, colours, nutrients, and another ingredient he refused to disclose were mixed together in the machine and in a few short minutes, the food would be printed out onto the plate. I had no other information on the food, thus I had to trust this stranger who is technically my friend.

2 years later

 I continued my daily routine of waking up, eating, surfing the web, eating again, watching some television, eating on more time, and sleeping. It has been a whole 2 years since the last time I came upon interesting news, and for the past 2 years, it has felt like I was hypnotised by and was zoned out for all this time. I had stopped contemplating life and began to mindlessly entertain myself with whatever content was on the Internet; just like how the government wants us to do. Only now have I started to wonder if the government was lying to us the whole time and there was no war. What if all of the sounds coming from the outside were fake and the thick, reinforced windows were modified television screens? I seem to have broken out of the trance that I was put in for 2 whole years. Could it be that the government found out about the conversations I had with my online companions? I hoarded all my current knowledge and all my conspiracy theories I formulated, found the connection between them and thought about it. I layed there thinking about what all this could mean and in the end, I concluded that I should try going outside. I browsed the web for hours on end trying to locate others who had the same train of thought as me. Eventually, after searching for people, I found one person who wanted to explore the outside with me. He said that his webcam was shattered so I did not know of his appearance. We both had the same ideology on what we thought the government was doing and settled on roaming around the town until we met since we did not have any knowledge of our towns geography. This anonymous figure who I still barely knew told me that if I gouged the floorboard in front of my sink out of the ground, there would be a full body hazmat suit in a grey box. He then advised me to put it on when I headed out tomorrow in case the government was not deceiving us, it was simply a precaution.
The very next morning, I woke up with a grin on my face for the first time in 22 years. I was going to set myself free from this accursed building that I was locked up in for 22 years. I bolted around my house searching for something to use to smash through the walls. Finally, I settled on a sledgehammer that rested behind the hazmat suit under the floorboards; I guess the man I spoke to yesterday forgot to inform me about the sledgehammer lock away in the ground. I pulled back and swung with all my strength; the force was enough to tear a jagged hole straight across the wall. After what I saw what I could do with the hammer, I proceeded to shred through my wall like a trigger-happy gunman in a swarm of people. A look of ecstasy flushed over my face as I looked outside through the now absent wall; The outdoors almost identical how I thought it would look like. I felt like I was reliving the faint memories of the outdoors from I was but a child.
For the first time in all these years, I did not walk by dragging my feet across the ground, I did not feel any boredom on the inside, and I finally had something to do in life. I wandered around the town trying to remember the roads so I could return home when I needed to. The ground looked like not a single soul had set foot on it before, I continued my expedition to find this other man who had also found the darkest secret of our government. I continued my stroll till I noticed a sound, the sound was the missiles! I about to panic, but then I realised it wasn’t real and the government probably had speakers on the houses creating the sound. Slowly but surely, the sound of missiles was getting louder and my ears started to hurt. I plugged my ears with my hands and I collapsed and leaned against the wall of a house trying to prevent my ears from exploding. As the sound got louder, I noticed blue robot hovering towards me, that idiotic robot was generating all the commotion. The robot identified me as a human and turned off the sound and came over to me, stood there for about a minute or so, and out of nowhere it shot something through my chest, unbearable pain erupted throughout my body, my chest was burning and all my strength started fading away. I could not move a muscle; I felt paralyzed. But, for some reason, I did not feel any emotions, only pain. I accepted my fate and as soon as I thought I was about to die, the
blade-like object inside me spun like a weed wacker and started moving. My flesh was being eaten by this robot, yet I no longer felt pain, I stopped paying attention to the robot and soon after my arm fell to the ground. A realization that the robot was cutting me up into pieces hit me strong, I was being cut into pieces like I was a pig at a slaughterhouse except I was still alive to witness myself be cut up starting with my limbs. I am now certain that the object that impaled me was laced with a painkiller and that the anonymous person who I spoke with was lying about shattering their webcam. That person was probably the government luring me out of my house to have me killed, and there are 3 reasons that the government would want to kill me for. Those reasons are either that I am now old and the government wants to kill me off, the government wants to kill me off due to my knowledge of what is actually going on, or because we are all like pigs being raised in a farm and I am now ready for consumption. That might explain why my online friend refused to disclose a certain ingredient that food generator uses to create food; it was most likely human remains.
As I lay against the wall with a robot slowly dissecting me and removing my organs, I begin to lose consciousness, and due to the severe blood loss I suffered and am still suffering, I died the very next minute. At the age of 56, I died a pointless death, locked up in a house with no windows or doors my entire life like a pig in a pen raised, only to be eaten.

So my team were hired together and are all relatively new. Boss has had a few weeks off here and there, and this week asked me to cover his responsibilities which is pretty insane but I had asked for more responsibility.

Mr X, another new guy in my team that I have an okay relationship with, was apparently promised by the manager to cover him this week but this never happened. 

Mr Y, another new guy in the team and a good work friend, had been work-messaging Mr X and showed me tgw messages (I wish he didn't ffs) and Mr X had been saying he defo get promoted before me etc.

I don't care he was saying this, but I spoke with Mr X to find out if he was super pissed at me, and exactly what boss had said to him prior to his holiday.

He asked if Mr Y had showed me their chat, and I just said yeah, for transparencies sake.

X is now pissed at Y for showing me the messages (understandable) and Y is pissed at me for telling X that happened.

This probably sounds like stupid nonsense but my anxiety is obviously telling me I've ruined the world, and I'm just looking for impartial discussion help me deal with it. I don't need comfort just opinions on th2 situation.

I can’t even find people with similar interest as mine. I can’t even comprehend what I want, what I love, where’s my passion? I almost float with the wind, have zero personality strength, always directed arbitrarily by others. I have no social life. Everything seems joyless. Oh I can’t even talk with a single person. I need to run to home and get fucked by my laptop and phone every single day like it is a routine. All my days are same, very regular, no joy. I fucking dress like a clown and go to varsity every day and come back home watch memes and repeat. See, there’s no human contact in between. Fuck what and why is this happening to me.

I believe I started off pretty good. I mean the environment was very unhealthy for me. Filled with NDC nutmegs and people with previous friendships. Like they already have shit tons of friends. After a week or two I started talking with girls and formed a 4 people group. I don’t know why I set off people. Fuck I hate mine so much. Nobody needs me. I have no special attribute to offer to people.",19Nov2018,1
88,"Weird title I know but I was thinking about this when the trailer for Once upon a Deadpool got released. I used to be a huge deadpool fan back when he was only in comics and the obscure video game, since he's gotten more popular I've shied away from him because I feel like his character and humor lost what I originally liked about him. I'm fine with this and have gotten over it years ago, but it made me think about how should someone deal with something they like getting ""watered down"" for mass consumption?

I've realized that most entertainment media(books, comics, games, tv shows, etc) does get simplified and generalized for bigger audience consumption over time. But what do you do when you've made that media a part of your schedule that you look forward to, or even the culture of that media a part of your identity? I see three options.

* **Option 1:** Do you just walk away from it disappointed and look for something else? Then you look lose a part of your interest/routine/identity and look like a hipster to everyone else when you talk about your former interest. 

* **Option 2:** Do you just keep chugging along with it even though you don't like the direction they are going because of nostalgia or w/e? Then you're doing something you don't enjoy and when you express your concern you're gatekeeping (i.e. 1st Gen pokemon are the best, etc...)

* **Option 3:** Do you get upset and try to express concern? I feel like this one is what happens the most and gets the most push back. Getting upset over something like this usually isn't worth the effort and gets you labelled ""entitled"" and ""gatekeeping"" as well. (Practically any video game or comic book character, most recently the whole Diablo:Immortal drama) 

I'm not going to argue the reasons why media producers choose to simplify things or expand in various directions, usually money. But what do you think is the correct way a fan should handle something like this?

EXTRA ANALOGY:
For those who don't understand/empathize with what I'm talking about, how about this coffee analogy. You stop by this small coffee shop every day before work, you like their coffee because it's on your route and it has a specific taste you like. As the shop gets popular their beverages keep getting sweeter and the coffee no longer taste how you like it. What would you do?",19Nov2018,1
89,"I don't if this is gonna be long or not but here it goes:
At 20 years old I am in the most miserable place in my life and I don't see anyway to get out of it. I used to be suicidal but now I'm not anymore and I fucking hate it. I wake up everyday knowing that I am trying my best and I'm still stuck in my hometown living with my mother who is just the apotheosis of selfishness and narcissism.She sits at her mothers all day and comes home only to check if I in like she still has to be in controll.I can barely old my rage against her.I don't want hear her voice.I wish she could just disappear.She managed to put all her side of the family against me like I am the abusive one.Like I have to get all the responsability for everything.And I am doing just that but all I get are complaints.I don't have the money to move out and I have no one who would be willing to let me in.
My friends all moved out and are currently in college and I can feel theme drifting apart. I am desperatly  trying too keep them close and it's making me even more miserable.
A few months ago I also fell in love for the first time in my life but it ended with the girl remaining in my friends group and leaving me with little to no self esteem and hurting all this time.I of course blame nothing on her.
This summer I had found a good way of coping in cycling but I had a bad accident in september and really couldn't cycle that much from afterwards.
I'm still attending high school with 2 years to go while also having to work 4 days a week and getting little to no sleep.
My father has been assisting me financially but he's now going through a  tough time and can't really help me anymore.
I am trying to make new connection but I feel a burden everywhere I go. My classmates used to look up to me;now my grades have plummeted and now one comes even close to me.

I swear I am trying everything I can to hold myself together  and keep going but I only see me and my mental health fading away. I don't have values anymore. From the cheerful guy I became bitter and Bitter.I doubt my every thought.

I am still here.I'll keep going but I am scared that I won't be the same anymore.

So I’m in college and people keep saying how being a virgin is so unhealthy and whatever. Personally, I’ve never had sex (or even been in a relationship or kissed anyone or anything like that) but that doesn’t bother me at all. I know plenty of people just don’t have a sex drive, but I have literally never been attracted to anybody sexually or romantically. That and my inability to make facial expressions as well as a history of homocidal tendencies worries me. Generally, do you think I’m normal?

94,"Last year I taught this student in an intro class. Her abilities shocked me, especially considering she was a freshman. Not only did she possess amazing talent, she was also one of those students that you could tell was actually passionate about what she was doing; for her, it wasn't just about the grade. She frequently came to chat with me in office hours about our craft. During that time, I was able to relay some advice to her, and I got to know her pretty well on a personal level.

This semester she's taking my advanced class. While she's still performing up to her usual standard on a purely technical level, there is a noticeable change in her attitude. She does what she needs to do to make the grade, but not much else. She acts disinterested in class, rarely participating, yawning, and often looking as though she can barely keep her eyes open (keep in mind, this is an afternoon class). Last week, she practically had a meltdown over the most insignificant thing–I've never seen her act that way, and frankly, it scared me. She's only come to see me once in office hours, and that was after weeks of my persistent begging. During this meeting, she broke down and confessed to me that she started playing Fortnite at the end of the summer and has been hooked ever since. The student tells me she wants to stop playing, but can't bring herself to. She says it's the only source of excitement in her life right now and that she often stays up until 2 or 3 in the morning to play. Last semester, she produced several short stories. This semester, she's admitted to only one.

I don't know what to make of her predicament. This is a student that, as far as I could tell from what I'd gotten to know of her over the last year, hasn't really been into gaming in the past. I don't want to see her lose her passion for creative writing, but at the same time, I can't force her to be interested in something she's not. I know she's capable of making it in the world of writing if she would put forth the effort. Normally, I wouldn't become so personally invested, but this is one of those students that comes along maybe once or twice in your career. Her writing ability is something I haven't seen in years. I don't want to see her throw away her gift over some game. How can I get her to see reason without sounding like some domineering mother figure who's trying to ""ruin her life?""",19Nov2018,1

98,"I never really let out my problems to people just because I'm more introverted and like keeping things to myself. For a couple weeks I have been having bad thoughts about school over the weekends of bad memories I have.  It's been effecting the way I feel with me feeling down and shitty in the weekends. But I really need to let out all my problems and can't just let this be in my head any longer. Right now I'm a sophomore in high school and as of now in my sophomore year, it's been not great. What really sucks is how some people think of me as. I see that some people think of me as stupid and weird. In the title, I said that I had autism and I had it ever since I was born. I don't have it as bad as others but I do have my problems with me having autism. With me not being very smart, having not very good grade in school, lacking some common sense, and having trouble paying attention. This is why people think I'm stupid and it really sucks for me. It doesn't happen all the time but I do have times of me being laughed at from my stupidity, not paying attention and being called on not knowing what I'm supposed to do. People also thinking I'm weird too, I can understand why people think this. At school I don't really feel like my own self and this is probably because of my anxiety. Which makes me feel not right in social places. Lastly I want to talk about friends, ever since middle school I have had problems with friends. With me having friends but not feeling like I have a real group of friends and I still feel like this right now. I never really get invited to do things with people so I'm normally always at my house feeling lonely. When I see other people doing things while I'm here doing nothing. Overall, High School sucks for me. Although I didn't say anything positive in this post, I do have some good times at school but those times don't happen as much as I would want them too. Lately I have been trying to be more social and its been working but after talking to more people I start to feel exhausted. I feel a lot better letting out my problems in this post, I'm happy I was able to let out most of my problems of school for me.",19Nov2018,1
99,"I’m 22female. I live with my parents. I desperately want out. I have had a rough past 5 years. Bad stuff happened, alcohol, drugs, and whatever. I’m clean n sober now for over a year. 
Anyways, I’ve been trying to get on my feet and be independent. I want to move across the country and have my own apartment. I have no effing clue what to do.  I have pretty much nothing to my name. I’ve got no credit, no clue on how to live as an adult, and about $1,000 to my name. My parents are so controlling. I need to get out from under their thumb. 

I’ve had so many different jobs over the years which all of them I hated. The only thing I’ve found that I loved is working on cars.  The thing is I wrecked my shoulder doing that and I’ve had to have a second surgery on it a month ago.  I’ve been told that I may not be able to be a mechanic because of my shoulder. It’s breaking my heart. That’s the only thing that I truly had confidence and passion in doing. And that fucking stupid place took that away from me. I hurt it at work, it was their fault for not fixing broken equipment. It was broken FOR 3 MONTHS and we just had to work with it. Oh but as soon as I got hurt, they fixed that shit right away. Fucking assholes. I’m pissed off. 

It just seems that no matter how hard I try to get ahead, life just knocks me right back down. Wtf am I supposed to do. I consider myself a “free spirit” or whatever. So right now I’m feeling real trapped, and I don’t know how to get out.

100,"English isn't my first language and I am writing this on my phone, so sorry for any spelling/grammar/formatting mistakes.

Little background info: We are both students, therefore a 'small fortune' is not that much for working adults I guess. 

So, my boyfriend's sister currently lives in a country on another continent, he would love to visit her and wants me to accompany him. A few months ago I wanted to come with him, but now I'm not so sure anymore. However, since I told him about half a year ago, that I'd come he told his parents (who are also planning to visit his sister) to not book a flight for him.
Well, half a year later I realize, that it's all becoming a bit too much for me. Uni is very difficult, since my degree requires me to constantly study, so I just can't get in the right mindset to plan a whole vacation right now. It has been like that for all our vacations so far, I plan the whole trip and he is thankful, but I wish he would at least help a little bit. Especially when we are visiting HIS sister. I don't see why I have to look up flights and book them and basically plan everything. Then another thing is, that the country that we are planning to visit has very strict visa regulations, so I am very afraid of buying plane tickets, since I might not get a visa and then, which brings me to the main problem, I would have spent about 600€ for my tickets for nothing. Of course I could get an insurance, but who knows if it covers the costs when you don't get a visa... And it is just 600€ for the flight, who knows how much the trip will be in the end. I'm a student, I can't just spend that much money right now. Especially because I am planning to get my driver's license (which costs about 2000€, so I could really use the money that I would spend on the trip). Lastly, we go to two different unis and have different holiday times, there are exactly 2 weeks where we are both free and could fly, but my last exam of the semester is two days before that time span, and I don't know if I will pass all of them or if I get sick and might have to retake an exam. Oh, and guess who found out when his holidays are? Yup, me! 
I don't know if I want to go on the trip... I mean it would be nice to go to another continent for two weeks, but I don't know if it's worth all the troubles, especially since I have been there before. But if I were to not go, then how should I tell my bf? I mean it would probably be a huge disappointment to him, since he doesn't seem to want to go alone, which I completely understand.

107,"Since receiving the call last week that they want me to come in for an interview, I've been very nervous about it. I have anxieties and avoidance issues, and any time a big thing like this comes up, it takes over my life until I get it over with. To avoid it, I tend to procrastinate my preparation until the last minute and it can get quite stressful.

There are certain things that I am nervous about besides trying to ""ace"" the interview. First, I'm walking there because it is in walking distance (I don't have a car, anyway). I'm afraid I'll be out of breath when I reach there, and sweat and fog up my glasses (heh). I want to go extra early and hang around the area outside the view of the building until it's time to come in. Second, my printer ran out of ink cartridges, and I don't have a copy of my new resume. In every job interviews I've gone so far since I was 19, I haven't been asked for my resume during the interview after submitting them online so I'm hoping this place won't ask either. Third, I'm afraid of being ""in the way"" if I will even get the job. I don't want to be a confused fool. I doubt my abilities a lot.

I researched online to see how I can calm my nerves before the interview.

And I read a simple advice/philosophy.

Simply put: so what if things don't go smoothly? I've experienced many let downs and embarrassing moments. Life moves on.

I guess this is what's called stoicism.

**TL;DR:** Be (more) indifferent to life experiences, whether it be positive or negative. Life will be easier that way when you tame your own emotions.",19Nov2018,1
