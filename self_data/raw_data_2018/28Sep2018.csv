1,"I believe the worst part about losing my Mom so young is the profound and arcane anguish. The hurt that came before her death, after she left this world and during her cancer.  
I watched my Mother painfully deteriorate right before my eyes. I was 17 going on 18 and was so annoyed and angry at her for being sick. I was at a chiefly selfish stage where all I wanted to do was have fun and be with my friends. The woman whose stare would make me stop in my tracks in fear of being in trouble was now asking for my help just to go to the bathroom, to just sip water and it completely sucked. The sassy lady who was always dancing and in the kitchen masterfully cooking something undoubtedly delicious could no longer hold food down or walk.  How did she become so helpless? I wanted to yell at her, ""Mom, why didn't you go to the doctor in time, why are you dying?""  
I needed her to be Mom.  She died before my senior prom and graduation, two of many missed pivotal milestones in my life. She did not get to see me accept my college scholarship or help me move in my dorm. She was dead and no one can prepare your self-centered and precarious teenage mind for such loss. Present day, this still burns me and it breaks my heart on so many levels. “Hello Mom, you missed the birth of my son?!” The hurt and anger always masked with my defense mechanism of optimism. The battle of, I am sad but I have to be happy.

It is very hard to mentally go back to 1988 when I am in her bedroom looking at her moan in pain. She had a copy of the book ""Love, Medicine and Miracles"" by, Bernie S. Siegel next to the bed. I thought, no, it's too late, that book is all lies. Miracles, they do not exist!  I wanted to throw that stupid book against the wall. I wanted to call that fraud Bernie and say, ""Do you know you sold your book of bullshit to my dying Mother, refund please."" These old wounds are detrimental to our current being, but nonetheless buried they stayed. I can't fully articulate why I pulled off the proverbial band-aid, maybe it was just time. 

So there I was Mother’s Day, 2017 an adult, a Mom myself, crying in my bed because I'm still furious at my Mother for leaving me, my sister and brothers. She should be here to see my son Luca, watch him play football, spoil and love him, he too was robbed. We were all robbed! With the mental anguish comes the dichotomy of also feeling thankful and sorry for my Mother. Thankful for the simple fundamental lessons my Mother taught me and love she gave. I still hear her voice; ""Christine, respect the elderly, always say please and thank you, never wear out your welcome (and my favorite), make the best of every situation."" Yes, this is what I like to call a total mind fuck. Mad, sad, guilt, love and gratitude abodes. After all, I have been told that I am just like my Mother, so I owe her gratitude for my wit, my rhythm, my love of writing and of course, my very own life. This is the part that has helped me survive, I call it ""the good stuff"".

To really heal, I decided I had to let go of the coveted pain.  I had to forgive my Mom for getting sick, dying before my teenage eyes and leaving a gaping hole that I never thought would dissipate. I am also forgiving myself for emoting such thoughts and for ever inadvertently blaming her for getting sick.  She didn't want to get cancer, she didn't want to die, she loved us more than she loved herself.  She was only 42-years old, she was so young.  She did not ever have it easy and I wish that were different. However, I cannot change any of what has happened, nor the feelings I harbored.  I can only learn. Valuable lessons rising from the ashes of such trauma are, I am strong and life does have to go on.  It is okay to emote, it is okay cry sometimes and it certainly acceptable to be angry. It will never be totally ok to go back to 1988 to her sick bedside. The biggest lesson here is, sometimes you need to feel that hurt like a wave in the ocean coming over your head, a moment of drowning only to survive. You have to feel the awful empty pain in order to heal. It is integral to your soul. 

Her last conversation with me was Motherly advice before she was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital to die on December 14, 1988. She asked to see me.  I wanted to relent, but I am so glad I went for what I knew was ""goodbye"". It was not a two-way conversation.  I can still see her like she is in front of me right now. My Mother found some last bits of strength for her fourth child, her baby, me.  She was lucid and focused. She held my hand and told me these words with the might of the Mom I once knew. ""Please do not marry too young or have kids too soon, go to school and travel, be young and have fun. Be a good girl and always know I did my best and I love you.""  She didn’t even cry, how brave she was.  There was more, but that is what my mind allowed me to remember. I did heed her beautiful advice and for that I thank her. I love you too Momma and I know now you did do your best.  I know.

The band-aid is off, here exposed in my words, cathartic I suppose. There is no end to this story, life goes on just with lighter shoulders, much happiness and self-allowing timeouts for sad, mad and confused feelings. 

My purpose for putting my story and my memories to print was more than to help myself.  I sincerely hope I helped whomever is reading this in some small way.  My story of loss may not be yours, it’s not supposed to be.  Last, I now happen to think Bernie Siegel's ""Love, Medicine and Miracles"" is an excellent book, miracles absolutely exist and no refund required.

3,"- I have a chronic back issue.  I get sick of the pain increasing and am desperate for relief, so decide to try chiro again.

- It's a Saturday and it's only him and I in the office.  Before we head back to the adjusting room, he locks the front door.

- When in the adjusting room he asks me some more questions, including the name of my family doctor.  When I give it to him, he asks if he's black.  I say yeah he's African.

- Words ensue.

- A fight ensues.

- I have a chronic pain issue, he is built like an aging highschool football player.  Odds were in his favor.

- When I sit back up he asks if I ever saw the movie ""Concussion"".  I say no.  He goes ""Will Smith is in it, he's an African actor.  He plays an African doctor, they're a stubborn breed, he takes on the NFL, trying to stop people with chronic health issues from killing themselves.  I guess he thought that was a bad thing...""

- Then he puts his foot on the adjusting table (he had moved it to block the door during the fight) and goes into one of those bullcharge stances, looks at me and goes ""Concussions...""

- I sit there for a while.

- He slowly takes his foot off the table and moves it enough so I can leave.

- I go up front and pay then leave.

- I go to the doctor and tell him all this, he offers me fentanyl.

- I take something else.

- I'm in ER right now, days later, from a mixture of the beating and an allergic reaction to the painkiller med I took.

- Unfortunately I didn't have my phone mic recording during the session, I had it on with many previous ones due to something that happened a couple years ago and I had recently stopped recording because I was starting to trust again.",28Sep2018,1

5,"I certainly still have my share of sucky days. There have been nights where I stayed up way too late attempting to sort through an endless sea of thoughts and emotions. 

But overall I am happy with where I am at right now in my life, something I couldn’t have imagined in recent years.

6,"A while back, I made a post about my ex-best friend, R. Long story short, R and I were inseparable, aaaaand he randomly ghosted me and stopped all contact with me in the span of a few days. 

R still has his main group of friends, the two of which that I know the best (but still not that well) are J and N. N isn’t really a part of the story, but I thought that I should introduce him anyways in case there’s another update I guess. So J and I work on this thing at our school every year for this enrichment program. It’s not just us, but we’re the only two people in our grade that do this specific enrichment thing, so we end up talking a lot during that time. 

At some point, J and I were texting, and R came up. So J says to me something along the lines of, “Oh, and by the way, don’t send R messages if he doesn’t respond. He just looks at them and laughs. That one time that he texted you ‘yo’ was me. I took his phone for a minute.” So I said, “Thanks for telling me; I’m sorry about that,” because I had occasionally texted R just to see if he wanted to say hello. I know it sounds stalkerish, and I’m pretty sure that it is, but all I want is some closure. I want to hear the reason that he left me from his lips. From him directly. Ever since then I haven’t tried to make any contact with him. 

Any advice? I really want to confront him, but now that I know he laughs at my texts when I’m just trying to communicate with someone who cut me off, I don’t feel like I could ever do it. I know the common advice of, “Oh, R was never a real friend,” and that may be true. But what matters is that it felt real to me. I thought that we were friends. We gave each other gifts, we hung out all the time, we knew each and every corner of each other’s houses. He just...stopped being friends with me. 

Thanks for reading all of this mess. For more info I’ll comment a link to my original post.",28Sep2018,3
7,"Watching Christine Ford’s testimony was like an out of body experience because our experiences are so similar. When I was 19 I had a kegger at my house for a popular guy in our group. He invited a bunch of his friends and there were a lot more guys there than girls.  He asked me if it was okay for him to invite a guy who was a lot older than us, I think he was like 26. I didn’t really want to invite some “old guy” but my friend said he sold Kirby vacuums and if we let him come he’d clean the carpets the next day. The night started out normal enough. We all played drinking games and talked/laughed. Eventually most of my friends left and there were only two of us girls, plus probably 10 or so guys and the older guy. It was at my house so I partied up and got pretty drunk. When it started to become apparent I was drunk, Older Guy started to try to kiss me. I kept pushing him off and telling him no but he just kept trying. He acted like it was cute. I played it off with sarcasm but after a bunch of times I was like NO OLD DUDE, GO AWAY.  He got a little peeved but went on partying and laughing just like before.  I proceeded to get pretty drunk.  At some point everybody went into a back room to smoke and I went to the bathroom.  As I was coming out of the bathroom, which was right next to my bedroom, Old Dude suddenly and forcefully pushed me from the hallway into my bedroom and onto my bed.  It seemed like one motion—one moment I was walking out of the bathroom, the next I was already tackled on my bed, super confused.  He jumped up and quickly shut the door, then was right back on me as I was trying to scoot up. As he started fumbling with my legs and trying to get my pants undone I realized this guy is trying to rape me.  So I started to yell at him, but he immediately put his big hand around my neck and squeezed hard and I just kind of went into shock. It was way harder for him to hold me down with one hand around my throat so I started to majorly squirm and push my knees together and kick, but then he squeezed harder...and I squirmed again and he squeezed even harder.  I couldn’t breathe and it hurt so bad I realized I needed to go limp and let him do whatever he was going to do or I was going to die.  And then I just felt so sad. I remember thinking this is so unfair—to die this way, this young.  I haven’t even gotten the chance to experience my life.  And I thought how sad my mom would be when she found out. It was just so sad.  When Christine Ford said the part that messed her up the most in her life was thinking he was going to accidentally kill her when he was covering her mouth, that’s when I knew for absolute certain she was telling the truth because that’s what happened to me too—thinking you’re about to die in such a shitty unfair way, that’s the moment you stare at for the rest of your life.  The rest is nothing compared to that.  

He didn’t get very far. My lone female friend still at the party realized I’d been gone too long and came looking for me.  She realized immediately what was happening and started yelling, calling him a rapist and telling him to get out.  He jumped up and ran outside to his truck, and we ran to the room with all the guys to tell them what happened.  These were boys I knew my whole life. My “friends.”  I told the popular leader of our group what happened, fully expecting the torches to come out and my honor to be defended.  But you know what he said?  He said, “what—you think you’re too good to give my boy some love?”  In that moment my female friend and I realized we were very stupid, and very, very vulnerable.  None of the other young men in the room would even look me in the eye.  I suppose they might have felt shame, but they did nothing.  They just sat there.  

With my adult mind I know we should have called the police. But we didn’t want to get in trouble. I was drunk. And so ashamed. And it was my party. My keg. So we just huddled together in the living room and waited for morning so the boys would go.  Old Dude even came back in when he realized the coast was clear.  It was the longest, most humiliating night of my life.  

The combination of moments—the one when I thought I was going to die by strangulation, and the one when the boys didn’t care—those two moments contributed to a lifetime of maladjustment.  I spent 10 years staring at those moments.  I suffered a lot through my 20’s, in total silence.  Nobody knew. Then I learned to take control of my thoughts and emotions and I found a better headspace.  I told a few close friends. I never told my family. And I never turned him in.  I still have pictures from that night. Pictures of him. I don’t look at them, but I don’t throw them away.  

There’s probably a lot of me out there.  Our culture needs fixing.  Things are better but they’re not good enough.  ",28Sep2018,109
8,"Absolutely true. Look at me, I find myself writing a self post on Reddit, and I've titled the post with one of the facts that'll be evident by the time you've finished reading the content of the post.  
  
I'm both too arrogant and too hard on myself at the same time. I have moments of infallibility and moments of absolute cringe and disgust at myself, what I say, what I do, what I've done, what I want to do. For example today, I got into a political discussion with some people and it got heated for a moment, and I let slip more information about my political stance than I would've liked. So so so stupid of me. I'm so fucking dumb. But when I started the conversation, I felt like I was smart as hell, and I was ready to go.  
  
I should just shut the fuck up. When in doubt, shut the fuck up and just listen. I should get that tattooed somewhere. But I won't, cause I'll regret that too.

18,"I haven't dated anyone in 5 years. And it's mostly because I avoid it, I've dated girls back in high school and as soon as thing got even a little serious I lost all interest in the relationship. They were wonderful girls but something in me just shuts down after she tells me she loves me.

Now here I am, in a completely different life. After several calls to suicide hotlines and finally having the courage to face a counselor, and saying to someone else what I'm going through. It's official, I have depression. It's not caused by my lack of romantic relationships or I hope it isn't. It felt comforting, worrying, and disappointing when I was told I'm depressed. But hey, I want to get over it.

I've adopted a dog, planned a diet (which I'm killing btw), exercise 3-5 times a week (trying to get a steady 5), quit my part time job to just focus on school, and apparently the internet is full of shit because I'm still at the same exact place but 10 pounds of muscle heavier.

I haven't even thought of dating another girl in the last few years now I'm afraid that the moment I open mu mouth a harsh rejection would just shut me down, I'm afraid that even if I get a date that I won't have anything to be interesting enough, I'm afraid that I'd leave the next girl that loves me again, and most of all I'm afraid that I would be using somebody as a tool to cope because I can't deal with being sad.

19,"I had a bloody near-death experience at 4. Before that, I was actually extremely outgoing, enjoying playtime, wasn't afraid to go my own way, and really just had a great time being interactive. 

For 10 years after that, I was always the quiet kid. I got comments like ""You don't talk very much do you"" from everyone, and even my parents couldn't get anything out of me. My life from there has been an uphill battle.

My mentality has always been to observe carefully. If I make a certain type of joke and I feel awkward because it gets no laughter, I will never use it again. This applied to questions and advice/help. 

This was fine for the most part, but when depression kicked it, I realized that I never really enjoy anything in life. I haven't texted my old friends in years and I'm only a teenager. I don't make the first move or make plans. 
I'm basically stuck in a ""spoke when spoken to"" mindset and it's horrible. I'm only now observing this fully.",28Sep2018,2

22,"I’m quite the jovial individual though in this past week it’s been rough. My grandmother more than likely has pancreatic cancer, however it is not entirely certain. My uncle died of two years ago. Pancreatic cancer is rare, and even less likely among women. It is nearly 100% fatal

My grandmother is the kindest person I’ve ever met. Her intentions are always the best. She is the glue that holds my extended family together. She cares so much for everyone.

Her health has never been good so over time I’ve been preparing myself for when she dies and I thought I was getting near being able to accept it.

When I heard about the diagnosis I reaffirmed that I was ready to cope with losing her. But in the coming days when the scope of the situation sunk it I realized I’m not ready. I am devastated and yet she’s still kickin’! Myself and my family members are going to be a complete wreck.  I’ve been sobbing the entire duration of writing this. I am not one to cry, the previous time was the death of my uncle, and prior to that it had been many years.

Because my uncle died of pancreatic cancer I know the hardships that cancer forces it’s victim to endure. The pain and suffering is tremendous. I don’t want my Oma to face that. I always thought she would be taken by a heart attack as she has high blood pressure.

Currently she is able to continue daily life however she is in much pain, she has yet to start treatment. Once she begins far more pain will be forced upon her.

When you’re naive, or even intentionally clueless, I feel you’re happier. No ones failed at accomplishing this more than me. I care about you too much. 

It’s when you begin to care, stress and worry due to exposure and experience that you become miserable. So I am miserable. Not because I often feel this way because of you.

24,"A little background: Yesterday, I (22/F) got an IUD. If you don’t know, an IUD is a form of birth control that goes into the uterus, and having it inserted is a really painful experience for almost everyone. I, personally, had a seriously bad experience with it, but I won’t go into the details here. If you’re really curious, I posted about it in r/birthcontrol so you can look at my post history. 

Anyway, I’ve been feeling really bad for the last day and a half since it was inserted. The cramps were better today, but I’m still in a lot of pain. I’m in college, dorming, and my friends are well aware of this. 

So anyway, tonight, my roommate got a call from our friend Diane, and she invited him to come hang out with her and all of our other friends (we have the same friends) but I didn’t get an invite. Also, I was doing laundry at the time, so I couldn’t leave. So, my roommate left, and I called my other friend and asked her if she wanted to hang out. She told me she was with Diane and the rest of our friends and they were going to smoke. I immediately got angry and hung up the phone. Then I called my boyfriend and ranted to him about how upset I was that all of my friends decided not to invite me to hang out with them. I thought they didn’t care about me, or that they didn’t appreciate me. I vowed to stop doing things for them just to be nice. My boyfriend felt so bad and tried to make me feel better but I was really upset about it. 

About 20 minutes later, all 4 of my friends showed up with a pan of freshly made brownies. It turned out they secretly got together and baked them to surprise me and make me feel a little better, knowing how hard it’s been for me the last few days.

Right now, life isn't so good. We're both terribly sad and broke and out of step with life. Even after a great trip to Utah, finding out you're not getting the money you deserved and a fucking stupid speeding ticket getting in the way, I just wanted to say that you're going to be fine.

In short I'm worried sick about an ex of mine with a history of depression, who I think could have killed herself. 

My last text to her was asking how she was doing and she left me on read. So there's two ways to interpret that...

A) She doesn't want to talk to me

B) She's not okay and doesn't want to tell me (Which wouldn't be out of character for her. A huge reason we never worked is because she can't be open/honest about how she feels) 

But there's more. I sent another text after she left me on read the first time. I said ""if you don't want to talk to me, that's cool, just say so."" And she didn't open that text for a few days and I got tired of looking at it so I deleted the conversation. Now I'll never know if she didn't get the text(which is also possible because she uses Kik and we've had several issues with it before) or if she left me on read again. She still hasn't responded. 

I woke up at 5:30, panicking that she could be dead. 

First I panicked. Then I went numb. Then I was sad, and now I'm just fucking tired of this. Why can't I just let go

What I just wrote was bullshit. I don't think I'm in the wrong for being worried... I'm scared to death of being the obsessive ex boyfriend, and I think on some level I've been telling myself that I'm not allowed to worry because we broke up. 

That's bullshit too on some level. I need to let go somehow. I'm worried sick but I was delt a shit hand and now I run the risk of being creepy if I seek out the answer to if she's okay or not. I need to accept that and, for her sake, move on. 

So yeah that's my thought process right now. I kind of feel like that meme of the dog in the burning building that says ""this is fine"" but minus the whole saying this is fine part. I'm just sitting there in my burning brain, unsure of what to do or what to feel or who I am. Does she hate me or is she not okay? Who knows

38,"I'm unexpectedly going through a bout of heartbreak. Having gone through a good handful of these in my life, it's pretty amazing how strong it hits every time. 

I'll always open to love because it's the fucking best, and yeah heartache is probably the fucking worst. I've seen time and time again though how the growth offered both by love, and heartbreak, is immense. Being supported and loved, and being allowed to support and love someone is one of the most potent character elevators I've encountered. And while right now, in the thick of coming to terms with letting go, I feel unworthy, grieved, and even in physical discomfort, I also know from experience that this very process is bringing me into a new level of being that I don't know about yet. 

So I go see friends, I show up, vulnerable, as myself, I bail on plans, I make new plans, I practice playing my music, I go to gigs, I bail on gigs, I share, I listen, I hide, and I just generally follow and honour the process as my emotional needs dictate, while keeping apathy and nihilism at bay. Life will bring me to the next stage in due course.

All love!!!! Life is beautiful and incredible.",28Sep2018,1

I'm trying out the new format in Chrome. I do like it very much because it has most of the Reddit Enhancement Suit features I used before and loved. I'm having a problem with my inbox though. The envelope icon changes to Orangered, it will indicate the number of messages, but when I click: It says ""there's nothing here"" in Unread. For most of a week I thought everyone was deleting their replies, then I thought that was just too random. I checked the ""All"" section, and there are the comments! I can reply from there, but if I reply to one, I have to refresh the browser to see the rest again. I've checked the help section, r/help, done a google search to see if it's a known issue and put in a message to support, but it's still broken. Does anyone have experience getting a bug fixed?

44,"Don't know if this is the right place for this, but I have to get this off my chest. Its gonna be a long story, but I ask that anybody willing to listen read the whole thing.

Let me start by saying that I'm not suicidal or anything like that, I'm religious and suicide has never actually crossed my mind. As depressed as I may sound through this story, I'm not that depressed. This may seem like a disjointed wall of text, but I'm writing my thoughts as they come. Also I'm an 18 yr old guy, that'll be relevant later.

I always used to think I was good at social interaction. I like keeping to myself pretty often, be it playing video games, watching netflix, doing some work at home. But at the same time I crave being a part of something, and I had that in high school. I had friends everywhere, and hung out with them whenever I felt like going out. Now I started university and none of my old friends are around. Starting out, I felt like I was going to meet people as easily as I always had, I wasn't afraid to approach and meet people. Life was looking good.

Now I'm not so sure. I'm a month in, and I've only hung out with one person. She's been a great bud, but I feel empty. We had a really deep chat yesterday while on the subway to get somewhere (it was a really long ride so there was plenty of time to talk). I've been single all my life, never kissed anybody, never been on a date. I've asked people out, but nothing ever happened and I've taken solace in blaming that on bad luck or it not being ""meant to be"".

This one friend of mine has now set me up with a date coming up in a few days. I've texted this girl and we seem to be off to a good start. We chatted a bit and set up the date. I've always wanted a girlfriend, someone to confide in, and was looking forward to it. To prep me for this date, my friend started asking me some questions and giving me pointers. Then she asked me ""describe yourself"". Thats where this started. I realized I have absolutely no idea how to answer that question. I don't know what I've accomplished, what I do in my free time, nothing.

Then she decided to test me by letting me lead our conversation. That made me realize that I'm really not good at social interaction at all because I didn't know what to talk about, and we ended up being silent for a really long time, she jumps in to say something, I respond, then silence again. I was looking forward to the date but now I'm starting to dread it, feeling like its gonna end up being an awkward mess.

When I got home I spent last night staying up reading advice on conversations and now I'm just heavily confused. I know the best date advice is to be yourself, but I don't know who I am anymore. I feel weak for being destroyed by such just one simple conversation. I've never been one to cry, but it feels like thats all I want to do now.

To make things worse, I saw this friend of mine this morning and she seemed distant from me. I directly asked her a while ago whether or not she genuinely enjoyed my company, and she said yes. Feels like when she saw me become weak during yesterday's conversation, she lost interest in being my friend. I'm probably imagining it, but I'm self conscious about what people think of me.

What do I do? How do I recover from this? Please don't worry about offending me, I want to hear straight truth.

TL;DR: I used to be confident, now I've lost myself after a close friend began preparing me for my first ever date, which she set up to with one of her old friends. It also feels like this friend saw my weakness after the conversation, and now she feels distant, though that may be my imagination.",28Sep2018,8

48,"I just need to get this off my chest, because I’m fed up and need to vent but don’t have anyone to vent to. 

My “friends” repeatedly take advantage of me, often only speaking to me when they themselves have problems or need something. More than half of my messages go unanswered between them all, I guess because unless it explicitly affects them then they just don’t care. 

I get walked on a lot, even by my own family. I’ve always had issues setting boundaries. It’s been worse recently likely because I haven’t had good luck with friends and I try really really hard nowadays to get people to like me, but honestly I feel like I end up botching every single social interaction I have. I replay every detail of the conversations I have and always come up with a reason as to why what I said was weird, awkward, whatever and how they’ll probably never talk to me again. 

Even now with completely new people, I’ve tried to set some boundaries and they go completely, 100% ignored. I thought it would be a good time to start over, but anything I say always gets pushed to the wayside in favor of their ideas. 

I told myself that this was my chance to for once have some healthy relationships, but it seems that’s already screwed up too. They’re a bit manipulative and I know they make me feel bad on purpose, but even so I still end up feeling genuinely bad and caving in to what they want. 

I absolutely hate confrontation and get uncomfortable at the idea of trying to be more firm because everyone around me is incredibly sensitive, defensive, and unwilling to accept even the smallest criticism. I don’t know what to do.

* Have not been eating too well. I've been having around a meal a day, and snacking on chocolate/nougat and tea.

My skin around my left eye is sore and I don't know why.

55," 

This  was years ago when I was 19 years old and working at a phone store. I  was closing up for the night alone when a man walked in before I could  lock up. He then turned around, locked the door himself, and switched  the sign to, ""closed""

I knew right then  and there that I was being robbed. He looks at me with a hand in his  jacket and says, ""I want a phone and I don't want to pay."" I give this  dude the biggest grin and say, ""whatever you want boss"" and I  immediately walk to get him the newest Iphone (because he came off as an Iphone guy to me)

Though,  I do remember being really annoyed that he dragged in a bunch of mud  and water throughout the store (the dude was soaking wet because it was  raining off and on all day). I was livid that I'd have to mop the floors  again. You think of strange things in these situations.

He  then starts talking about how he has a gun (which was unneeded, I got  the hint already) and also starts talking about how he wants the  phone  hooked up with service. I found this to be an extremely odd request  coming from the guy robbing me. I mean, you think he'd just tell me to  give him all the money and phones in the store, but then I realized why  he made this request.

He starts screaming  at the alarm on the wall and I mean god damn screaming. I realize  immediately that this man was on drugs and I might just die in this  store tonight.

I  get this man an account, hook everything up, I just wanted to give him  what he wanted and get him out of my store. As I'm doing this, he's  walking around curiously and grabs a ball, crumples a paper over it,  unlocks the door, and buries it. he then comes back inside and say,  ""don't worry, it'll grow into something much better."" (I could see all  of it because the entire front of the store was glass)

I  just gave him a weak chuckle and went with it, but then someone else  pulls up to the store. It was my mom. She was picking me up because that  very morning, I had gotten into an accident and totaled my car, so she  was going to drive me back to my place until I got my rental.

After  a little bit, she called the police because she knew something was  wrong and correctly assumed I was being robbed. (by the way, this whole  process took forever. My god damn life was on the line and I can't hook  up phones any faster than I'd like to! So stop bitching to me that I'm  being slow! I CANT DO SHIT ABOUT IT!)

Finally,  I got his phone hooked up, he walked out the store and let his dog out  the car and started driving crazy like around the parking lot until the  cops showed up.

&amp;#x200B;

**For Suicide**

I hooked up with a girl that my best friend liked in high school at a party where he was at. He later killed himself and I'm certain my actions were a part of it.

I was incredibly controlling with my high school girlfriend, cheating on her and just having a very messy codependent relationship where I said horrible things to her (i.e. I'm glad your family member died)

I was emotionally abusive to my ex - never anything physical but I would insult her appearance (framing it as a joke), told her to kill herself twice, and twice threw her things/punched holes in her wall. I took her clothes and didn't return them. I never tried to keep her in the relationship (and in fact begged her multiple times to break up with me) and I always encouraged her to see her friends and do things on her own but I would sometimes guilt her if she didn't see me enough. I knew she had been previously emotionally abused by her mom - actually same for my first ex, I guess I never saw the pattern of victims being drawn to me cause I was a piece of shit.

I have caused my parents an immense amount of stress with my addiction issues, with them needing to bail me out after an drug-induced psychotic episode resulted in expensive property damage.

I'm a spoiled shit whose parents have paid for school (though I did get scholarships, I do work and I don't otherwise take advantage of their income).

I have been a shitty thoughtless friend to people around me (i.e. I Don't remember my ""close"" friends birthdays, I've only recently started bothering to put any effort into talking to them, I've gossiped and talked shit about people who think I like them)

I haven't been good to my sister and been while not quite emotionally abusive, I was just mean and would say mean things as the guise of a joke while disregarding her feelings/requests (I suppose I do this to everyone who gets close enough to me)

**Against**

I got both of the exes I emotionally abused into therapy.

I never intended to  do harm and from my perspective I thought my actions were justified. I know this isn't an excuse to absolve me of responsibility but I have the tiniest sliver of redemption that at least I wasn't consciously doing it.

I have been hospitalized for psychotic episodes, suicide attempts and likely have some undiagnosed mental disorder.

I am an addict - Not an excuse but an acknowledgement that addiction is my responsibility and I have allowed it to contribute to the harm i've done

I've started to realize how much of a worthless person I am so there's at least some self-awareness now.

I am transgender and have been harassed, called a faggot, followed down the street and kicked out of my parent's home for a bit, so I have somewhat of a basis for my self hate.

My parents were physically and emotionally abusive towards me. 

I feel like I might have some repressed sexual abuse due to certain signs (i.e. feelings of emptiness/worthlessness, lack of empathy, inability to trust, weird discomfort/fear of some places, body image issues, rape nightmares after the first time I slept with a guy) but I also think that this my mind trying to to protect me from the realization that I'm a shitty human. After all repressed memories are exceedingly rare and the symptoms above could be any number of mental issues - especially considering how drugs might influence these things. Or maybe it's just that I'm a selfish piece of shit who will use any justification to not acknowledge how bad I am.

65,"""Everyone says that cigarettes are disgusting. There's no way I'll get addicted, so I might as well try one""

Nonsmokers think that cigarettes taste disgusting and smokers only smoke because they're addicted. They believe that smokers are torturing themselves with a burning plant that will definitely kill you, and smokers are generally dumb, weak willed people. I'm here to tell you a different story.

The cigarette is a magic wand that solves everything for you. A stick filled with a holy nectar made of the forbidden fruit. A delight full of aromas no nonsmoker has ever tasted. A stabilizer that calms you down when you are anxious and makes you more blissful when you're in a nihilistic mood. An excuse for getting away from the crowds and calmly introspecting.  

It's basically an object that should've never been invented to begin with. Not because it tastes disgusting and smells terrible but because it's actually *too good* of a drug and makes *everything* much better.

Have you ever smoked a Marlboro Red with a cup of black coffee? It's like eating a Brownie instead of dark chocolate. Coffee is great on its own, but when you drink it with the magic stick in your hand that tastes like honey and dark chocolate and hits your throat like a whiskey... If there's a thing called taste bud orgasm, this is how you hit the g-spot. 

I sound like an edgelord stuck in the 80's, no? I'm telling you about these because I believe that anti smoking campaigns target the wrong part of the human mind. They tell you that you'll regret smoking because there's no way you'll ever enjoy it. They lie to you, folks. Cigarettes are one of the most enjoyable, accessible and easy to use drugs in the world. Why do you think smokers always try to justify their habit? Do you seriously believe that they totally regret smoking and only keep doing it because of the nicotine? That's the biggest horse shit I've ever heard.

The reason people try so hard and mostly fail to quit is that smoking is *too good* of a habit that makes you ignore all of the short- and long term side effects such as the odor, yellow teeth and cancer. If cigarettes tasted like air, you'd see much less people smoking. Smokers are not just trying to get their nicotine hits, they actually delight everything about it.

That's why I have to warn you if you're the guy scanning the cigarettes in the grocery store with your eyes, trying to figure out which one you should try. Smoking will totally absorb you, it will bind to your brain, your fingers, your feet, your everything. You won't just be someone who smokes, you'll be a *smoker.* It will be a part of your personality. It will define who you are. It will change your opinions about life and death.

I hate making my parents sad. I hate the fact that I'm the only one that likes the smell of my hand after a smoke. I hate people that think smokers are the parasites of the earth. I hate it when the government introduces a new ban on smoking. Nevertheless I keep doing it. Because I love smoking so much. I love it so much that I regret trying it.

So don't fucking do it. You'll be happier vaping a nicotine free MegaMonkey Blueberry &amp; Yeti's ass flavored e-liquid.

Ironically my pickup line was something along the lines of ""Looking for a partner in crime for the biggest museum heist of the century."" 

I feel like there's no hope for me, and this was just explicit neon sign reading ""Empty Feeling Sex and Loneliness Here""... It's like an arrow sign pointing and it's pointing to me. It made better sense in my head. 

This is all on the heels of going out with two different women who just wanted to fuck me and that was it. All in the span of a week. Just got that feeling like I'm drowning. I keep trying to swim up for air and something keeps pushing me down. I'm an engineer, but I hate my job. I'm a bartender but no one wants to hangout with me after work. I go on dates and the women I like don't stick around... and now it seems that's a good outcome. I'm becoming an island of misery and I hate it.

Hell I'd settle to just sit down play Monopoly with someone and go bankrupt after crossing GO once. At least I'd get to spend some company with someone other than myself.

Anyway that's it. I don't know if this helped me or not, but I did know I couldn't just bottle this up. So I guess I went positive in that regard... Like a +0.5 smiley-faces on the ""Feeling Good"" Chart. Ok now I'm done. Going to go get a drink or go to the gym and bury my feelings! Toodles!

67,"I slept for nearly 19 hours straight one time. That was in college during finals week. That finals week was so stressful that I only got a total of 15 hours of sleep in four days. When I got home from school I was so tired that I dosed off. The next day I slept for close to 16 hours with some naps in between. It took me a week to get back to my normal sleep schedule. 

I’ve had many times where I slept that long. During my first busy season at my job I was working 70, sometimes 80 hours a week. On weekends I would sleep 12+ hours just to catch up on sleep. 

Has anyone slept for more than 12 hours?",28Sep2018,3
68,"I’ve been a big drinker for a long time, binging a few nights a week. I’m a student in the UK so it’s pretty “normal” here. I also had a phase of social smoking and doing a fair bit of nitrous oxide balloons, weed and magic mushrooms too, all of which I have now stopped. 

However, I still continue to drink too much (which is a very easy mistake to make, since our limit of what we should drink is pretty low). Last night I went out for a steady, low key night and ended up drinking far too much, yet again. I woke up today with a monster of a hangover of course. A few months ago I could handle any type of hangover (I get REALLY bad hangovers, always have done) and still drink the next day. 

However now when I’ve been drinking I just feel awful, not just hungover but haggard and wrecked on a deeper level. I know how damaging alcohol is and thinking about the toll I’m taking on my body makes me cringe. 

I’ve decided to (go against the grain of my peers) go straight edge, at least for a week and then a month and so on. One day at a time. I don’t want to drink like I do anymore because I know that once I start I can’t stop. So from now on I’m not going to even start. I don’t smoke or so drugs anymore so now that I’m officially teetotal I guess I can declare myself straight edge! Hopefully I can be a lot healthier and happier with this new lifestyle. ",28Sep2018,5

72,"I'm 25 and very happily engaged. I've been with my fiance for 3+ years.   

In the past I was in a couple of shit relationships, and in between I always had the independent, ""I don't need a man"" mentality.

I regret never getting on dating apps in college so much. I guess mostly for the entertainment, witty banter, ego boost, compliments and facetious conversations I could've had. and the random hookups, ;P 

if my fiance would let me I would love to get on tinder. I would never meet up with anyone and I would never cheat on him. I just really love the idea of it.
