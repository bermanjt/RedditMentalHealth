1,"Hello!

I feel like I don't really have anyone to brag to so here I am haha. I'm a recovering opiate addict. I got kicked out of university (I'm a psychology major, ironically) 4 years ago due to low GPA due to me being in active addiction. I thought I was gunna die and honestly, death sounded peaceful to me during that time. I remember being in and out of consciousness, thinking ""will I wake up next time?""

Addiction is very lonely. I believe addicts are addicts because they are yearning for connection, yearning for something real, and that's exactly what I was doing. Pain killers did just that, killed the pain, made me not think, made me not worry about the future. Until they didn't work anymore, until they ruined my life and drove me into the ground and made me into something I wasn't. 

I went on drug replacements, suboxone specifically, as a last attempt to stay alive. I was on suboxone for 3 years and may 11th will be officially one month off of suboxone. Suboxone gave me a chance to get out of the underworld, come back into the light and figure out my life. I got a good job, an apartment, an amazing boyfriend, fixed my relationships with my family, and got a lovely kitty who I love. I was able to start back to university to finish my degree!

One main thing that really helped me get clean was learning about space. I have watched space Documentaries basically every night before bed for the last 3 years. Learning about space really put my life in perspective for me. It made me feel like things that I thought were a big deal actually aren't. My life, my problems, drugs, are tiny insignificant blips in the vastness that is space. It just gave me comfort.

Now I've been taking a lot of my electives to get me back in the game of university and u just started an astronomy course called Stars and Planets. Just sitting in that classroom, listening to the prof (who greated us in Klingon, I might add), made me emotional. In that classroom, for the first time in my life, I felt connected, I felt like I was finally exactly where I was supposed to be, among people I'm supposed to be among, doing what I am supposed to be doing and enjoying it. I'm alive, I'm here, I'm learning, I'm moving forward, and I'm happy. ",09May2018,4
2,"Not that he would've given a fuck, but it still feels bad to miss the funeral. He was 98 (and a half), was a Navy vet, and was a lifelong Yankee's fan.

He mowed his own lawn with a dinky little push mower well into his mid-90's. He ended each day the same way he started them: with a cup of coffee with whiskey.

Maybe now I'll be able to stand a chance against him in a card game.

3,"I don't know what I expect, but I'm just going to put some stuff out here. Anything anyone has to say will help.

Me and my girlfriend have been together close to a year. This time. We were together a few years ago, then she got pregnant and left me. She completely blocked me out, then reemerges a few years later. We work things out, and I get to see my kid. Then things started working toward a new relationship. Older and wiser I guess.

I have another kid who lives with me who's a lot to handle. She kinda drives me a little crazy. Things are always going wrong at school, and things at home aren't much better. She's been grounded more so far this year then ungrounded. I just don't know what else to do.

I'm taking her to get a recommendation for a specialist. But, I think it's too late.

She's been so mean to my youngest daughter that she doesn't like to be around her. She's afraid of how she acts. Well, her mom is completely invested in her, understandably, and so it's kind of working out that my older daughters relationship with my youngest is driving a wedge between me and her mom.

I've never loved anyone like this before. Even when we were separated I was constantly thinking about living up to her expectations. Wondering where I went wrong and not repeating those mistakes. Now that we're together I try to be a light in her life. Any time I can provide her help or relief I give it. Her happiness is mine.

In the mean time, I moved out of town. Now I'm making plans to go back. Already told my work I'm leaving. Not much turning back.

But I'm starting to feel like everything is falling apart. She basically told me that if my daughter can't behave then she can't be there.

I don't think it matters what I do now.

I don't know how to take this. She tells me she loves me. I know she knows I love her. But, my daughter is just too much I think. I'm so worried right now. There's so much happening at once. I might even be being paranoid. I have no idea. I'm always worried anyway, so maybe it's not what I say.

So, here I am venting. Please help me. I'm getting overwhelmed.",09May2018,1

Been saving and slaving at manual labor jobs for years and for what? To fall short of what the lenders need in the bank when we finally find a house that can work for us. Our offer was accepted, we are under contract and can afford the down payment and closing. But we don’t have the 3 months extra mortgage payments the lenders need. The housing market fucking blows.

7,"A few months ago, my half sister from my mothers side reached out to me through a family member on Facebook. We have met twice since (she lives over 100 miles away), and it’s unbelievable how quickly my feelings have changed. I’ve never cared this much for a person. I hadn’t seen or spoken to her for 17 years, reason being that my moms side is a whole lot of trouble. My dad and others hid me from them, and my sisters earlier attempts at meeting me again were blocked off out of fear that she would’ve done the same thing my mom did to me (which caused them and me to think the same of my sister). Long story short, she has become a beautiful, independent, loving woman and soon to be mother.

She has to move to another state for four years after she has her baby near the end of August. Her partner is being stationed (he’s military) and attending university in that state. She said she’ll be back 4 months out of each year but it still hurts. She came back into my life but has to leave so soon. Every time I’ve left her apartment after visiting I’ve balled my eyes out on the drive home, it feels like there isn’t enough time for us to spend now that we’re in our 20s. I just came back from her baby shower on Sunday, and my heart has been hurting ever since I left.

I do want to express my feelings to her, but I’m not good at doing that with people. Whenever I talk about my feelings with her I turn into a whiny, crying mess. The first time we met irl I had a breakdown because I couldn’t believe it was her. I’m not good at expressing myself, and I don’t think she’s aware of how much I absolutely adore her. I also feel guilty because I never went searching for her myself, but she came searching for me.

We have 2 beautiful children together and she has been a mother to my first child from my ex wife since we were dating. 2 years and 3 months ago I had an accident at work and need back surgery. I've been in pain since and am in a battle between my attorney and the workers comp representation for a long time and no end appears to be in sight. My wife told me last year that she didn't think she loved me anymore and we deemed to work things out and I got more depressed and became an asshole. I sat around all day and slept or watched TV while she worked with constant migraines and fibromyalgia and was sick. I've been depressed most of my life and have only recently started figuring it out. I went to a counselor but had to stop because of financial trouble and poor money management. She says I have been horrible for years but I didn't realize it and she doesn't know if we can get past it. I am devastated, I don't know if I will be able to go on if she can't be with me anymore. I've had suicidal thoughts and sometimes have to fight to not carry them out. I can't tell her because she will think I am manipulating her into staying out of guilt and I don't want her to feel like it would be her fault. I have nobody. My family believes that mental issues and marriage problems are for weak and gullible people.  Her family has been my only real family for years. Workers comp doesn't pay enough to be able to take care of myself much less anything else I'm losing it more by the second. Please help.

10,"Little background: worked part time in sales at a local computer shop. Mainly hired to work weekends and afternoons on weekdays.

5 PM today, an hour left till closing. My boss asks to talk to me when I get the chance.

He told me due to not enough business within the past year, they would no longer be open on weekends, my main position. Because of this, they would have to eliminate my part time position as well. I have until the end of the month to find another job. 

I feel gutted. I was lucky to be able to land this job straight out of high school 3 years ago in the field that I wanted to study in.

17,"I feel like I shouldn’t have said “I got into,” because he started it. We’re all 20-21 years old. 

This started because I was upset that they didn’t let me know when they were going to out and do stuff as I had said multiple times that whole previous week and that day that I wanted to go out. 

The argument started because I didn’t meet up with them sooner. I didn’t do this because all they were doing was playing Fortnite in a basement doing nothing else. I didn’t want to just sit inside and not do anything. So, I said tell me when/if you go out because I still want to do stuff. They ended up going out and not telling me. 

The “friend” that started the argument is a very immature, ignorant and spiteful person. Throughout the entire argument,
almost everything he said to me included him swearing at me or insulting me. Meanwhile, I had not and did not say a single thing like that to him. At one point, I asked why he had to keep doing that, and he *literally* said, and I am not exaggerating, “Because I can! Cause this isn’t facebook* and my family can’t see this so I can!” *(he gets in facebook argument all the damn time) 

This was so hurtful to me. Now, the rest of the group is not talking to me. However, let me preface this by saying that these people aren’t exactly courteous, and when everything was fine none of us really went out of the way to talk when we didn’t have plans or weren’t together. But I’m still being not invited to things. 

I don’t feel like there should be a rift and them pushing me out for what he did to me. It’s so shitty and unfair. I am not trying to say that I am free of any guilt in this, but what happened and what he did was just so uncalled for so I don’t understand why this results in none of them talking to me anymore. 

Edit: The argument was long. Like two hours long. I kept arguing so much because him and I butt heads a lot and I always end up dropping it and letting him think he won just to end it because it’s not worth it. I couldn’t do that this time because he was just being such an asshole to me. I couldn’t just step down and take it and let him think he was right. He’s 20 years old and he honestly acts like he’s 13. 
I just don’t know what to do.

The day after I returned from the hospital, I was shopping in the local Walmart when I saw a crow at the end of an aisle. The crow started crowing loudly and moving towards me. I ran away to the nearest employee and told him about the crow. But when she followed me back, there was nothing in sight.

I was legimately freaked out. But dismissed it as some random crow which must have snuck in. However, the crow has been appearing every now and then. Sometimes when I am driving car, sometimes when I am sitting in the park.

A week ago, I saw a crow again inside the coffin of my aunt. When I went forward to pay my respects to aunt, the crow was sitting on her chest and just staring at me.

I wonder how do people make friends nowadays?

There are some problems that I noticed: •Events for expats are usually shallow and you can meet there a lot of people but none of them will become your friends. •Meeting people in some communities or clubs is also quite hard, because people just go there, do their thing and leave. •Also it's a little complicated to make friends as a woman, because men are usually interested in me until I say I have a boyfriend and women are quite closed and many of them are quite shallow, which doesn't fit to my personality.

So are there any strategies to make real friends or does it happen naturally with time?",09May2018,1

Arguments started happened. A few weeks later, our Amazon account was restricted. That took away our main source of income. Almost 7,000/a week. Things got tougher, but I was remaining positive.

42,"This has been bothering me because I am normally rather expressive of my feelings and emotions. But when it comes to him, I seem to always  either “lag” (like my brain seems to malfunction) or my actions end up different from how I feel.

A good example is whenever I see him. I am always, always excited to see him even though I see him everyday since we live in the same house. When I see him, though, I end up opressing these happy and excited feelings and act nonchalantly as if seeing him didn’t make me happy. But when he leaves the room, that’s when the happiness sinks in and I feel so giddy and thankful for seeing and spending time with him. 

I’ve been trying to be more expressive because I want him to know that his presence makes me happy. 


I also end up dishonest when I do something for him. Like yesterday, when I prepared snacks for everyone in the house. He was in his room but I prepared some for him as well and left the snacks on the counter where he could take it later. His mom saw the snacks and asked if I prepared that for him. Even though I specially prepared it for him, I answered something like “yeah, he can have it but anyone can eat it” although really prepared it for him. Thankfully his mom knows how I feel for her son and how shy I could be and she went to his room to give the snacks to him. The thing is, if it was another person, I wouldn’t have been so nervous or shy and would have delivered the snacks to them by myself.

I want to cure myself of how nervous I could be around him. There would be moments when I am comfortable around him but most often that not, my heart beats so fast whenever he is around and I cannot seem to process correctly. Sometimes I cannot understand what he’s saying not because he’s speaking a different language, but because my heartbeat is so noisy.

I’ll keep trying to express how I really feel around him.

43,"Hi guys so I'm in a bit of a dilemma and figured I'd ask around here since no one else in my life seems helpful. So basically I do digital marketing at a local car dealership. Very basic stuff and we're just a three man team that reports to the head of marketing. I have a direct supervisor that oversees the department and, you know, manages us.  He has been out sick (heavy smoker) since march 16 and Was suppose to be back yesterday until the doctors told him he is still to be in the hospital until June 20. That'll be around three months of missed work. 

Since he's been gone, I have continued doing my normal duties and keeping the department running smoothly. They started asking me to do some of the sales reports and other marketing stuff he does since I'm capable and have a degree and what not. I have not received any extra compensation as I am not like that and just wanna do my job well, however I did not expect him to be out another month and a half. 

My dilemma is that I am in massive student debt and work a part time job just to keep up. I don't wanna seem greedy, but I feel like I deserve a raise or maybe even my supervisors position as it seems like he may never come back. I have been doing a lot for them, but also don't wanna push my boss out for unfortunate circumstances. 

It's not like I'm doing crazy amounts of more work, but I have picked up the slack and proven myself, while also managing another employee and giving him tasks each day. I need to get paid more, and was planning on looking for a job that fulfills that (been here a year, entry level), but if they are willing to give me a promotion I'll take it.

46,"When I was in my first semester of college, one of my teachers (call him James) started pursuing me: telling me that I was the most brilliant and creative student ever during coffee meetings he said were to discuss my work (that I later found out no other students were having), once asking me to his room at midnight during the semester (I didn’t go, though I would have if I didn't have an exam as I somehow thought his motives were pure mentor/mentee stuff). 

Being insecure and naïve, I was so excited to have a teacher in college think that I was smart and to have someone that took an interest in my academic future. At the end of the semester, James asked me to his room to watch a movie (his reply to the email where I turned in my final paper), and this time I went. He admitted that he’d been interested in me over the semester (a colleague had even confronted him about it). 

Once again being insecure and naïve, I entered into a relationship with him – one that had to be secret because he told me he might be fired if people found out (something I somehow didn’t take to be a warning sign). After a few months, we stopped dating. However, he was a faculty member of my department, and so when I was offered the best possible job within that department, I took it. During the next year, when he was one of my bosses, things weren’t great. He called a lot, always late at night while drunk (something that, while inappropriate, I expected while taking the job and knowing that he was a part of the department). But then, when all the student workers were talking about the job (no one knowing about my past relationship), others brought up stories of James pursuing students just as he had pursued me. The other student workers felt deeply uncomfortable with his “favoritism” – he would talk about how certain female students were brilliant and give them higher grades, while also asking them to get coffee and spending a lot of time with them (just as he did with me). The students he pursued were also the same “type” as me: long brown hair, relatively fit, very thin. It’s now been two years that I’ve watched him pursue students of this type. I don’t know if he’s slept with any of these students, though I think there’s a pretty good chance with one of them. I don’t think anyone would sleep with him unless they’re pretty vulnerable, and he seems to go for a certain type of look rather than just after vulnerable girls. 

I’m not sure how “bad” his actions were (or are). In one sense, they seem bad. In my case, I lost most of my confidence in my intellectual abilities (all of the praise he gave me and my grade in the class seem better attributed to his wanting to have sex with me), and I can’t send an email to a male supervisor without having at least two friends read through to check if it sounds “flirty” (James said that the casual tone in my emails made him think I wanted to be with him). In a broader sense, lecturers and professors like him make my field less accessible to young women, and take advantage of vulnerable people. However, I don’t know if this is a “badness” over the level of cheating on a partner, and most of the steps I could take to make sure he doesn’t go after more of his students could result in him losing his career, which seems extreme. 

I just want some help on what to think. I feel like I’ve been brainwashed on all sides, friends yelling that “he’s evil!” and others that “I’m making too much out of this.” Either side could be right, but I’m no longer at a place where I can evaluate this objectively.

47,"I just wanted to record some thoughts on current events. Feel free to comment, but I wanted something to refer to in a few months after things play out. 

First, welcome home to the Americans recently released by North Korea. We should all be ecstatic that this happened, and ultimately give credit to the Trump Administration, although I think with a caveat (which is the “most likely” scenario below).

Back when I used to analyze such things, we always had to develop 2-3 courses of action in light of developing situations: most likely and worst case scenarios. Sometimes we added a best case scenario. So I wanted to throw this down here for future reference. I hope my most likely COA is wrong. 

Most likely: North Korea is attempting to play Trump. They know he desperately wants a deal at this point. Trump can almost taste the Nobel peace prize. North Korea giving up captured Americans loses them nothing and gains them some high ground. They’re ultimately going to present the same old demands (massive economic aid, US troop withdrawal, compensation for lost energy capability that they claim comes from nuclear research, lifting of sanctions, etc.) tempered somewhat by economic reality. To dress up some of the old, they may propose a formal end to the war in exchange to a framework for the withdrawal of US troops rather than some kind of immediate withdrawal. Any offer to halt their nuke program will be as verifiable as the previous agreement that they cheated on. They may allow some kind of limited inspections, knowing that their country has plenty of capability to hide military development projects. Military readiness will remain high, but in the short term (6-12 months), provocations will be minimized. If Trump and his people demand more invasive verification, they’ll walk and blame the Americans for passing on peace. But in a way that leaves the level of tensions a few notches below the overheated rhetoric from late last year/early this year. 

Best case: Nuke deal, with some kind of acceptable verification process. A formal end to the war, though the DMZ won’t change much. Even if the peace were real, the North Koreans don’t want to create a situation where a mass exodus of their people flee to the south.  Kim Jong Un will not step down, and his human rights abuses to his people will continue, but his military posturing could abate for a few years.

Worst case: Trump might be willing to sign up for something that completely undercuts American and South Korean security, but more likely will just leave behind a wreckage of dashed hope and international goodwill. American prestige will take a hit, as the competence of US diplomacy and complete lack of clarity will further erode credibility. This will ultimately serve North Korean’s most important goal outside of unification: driving a wedge between America and South Korea. And of course, under this scenario, the egos of two unstable leaders will be bruised, so overall stability will take a hit. 

If peace breaks out, does Trump deserve the Nobel Prize for peace? I don’t think so. At best, he’d deserve split credit. But if only one person could be honored, I think it’d be South Korean President Moon Jae In. He’s the one who walked the tightrope between two hot head narcissists and talked them down from the ledge.

One of them stopped chatting to ask ""are you ok in there?"".

52,"I'm so annoyed and upset. On Sunday, I went to the gym and locked my stuff up as normal. On Monday, I went to the gym and my lock wasn't in my bag. I figured I left it at the gym but staff said it hadn't been turned in. Tuesday, I went to the gym and figured since people did it all the time without trouble, I'd leave my backpack and shoes in the locker without a lock and it'd be fine. I didn't really feel like working out so it'd be a short session anyway.

Got on the elliptical at 5.05pm and finished all that I was willing to do by around 5.50. Went to the changeroom and opened the locker. There my shoes were but no bag. I had a moment of ""I could have sworn I put it here"" followed by a quick search of surrounding unlocked lockers (some with belongings in them) before reporting it to gym staff and getting my details taken by them.

Every moment I think about it, I realise something else that was in the bag that makes it all the more inconvenient.

To start, my bank and credit cards and driver's license was in there. One Credit card was expired, one is a prepaid card and my license isn't valid. I'm Canadian but living in the UK, so most of my stuff is expired or Canadian. Spent the evening reporting everything.

My clothes from the day were in there as well and me missing them is the most infuriating. I want to apply for a new visa so I'm saving the absurd amount I need and can't afford to buy new clothes. I had 2 pairs of work pants and now I have one. I had 3 good work shirts, now I have 2. I had 2 good bras, and now I have 1. And they got my good undershirt too! It was the first day of the week due to bank holiday Monday and I tend to dress with the most care at the beginning of the week, deteriorating closer to Friday. So that's gone. Plus a food container, so I can't have as many leftovers. Or have to put them in ziploc bags.

They got my new deodorant and my lip balm. Luckily, I have my old deodorant and a gross cherry flavoured lip balm I bought once out of desperation.

They have my oyster card and library cards and Boots advantage card.

They have my high school grad ring and the bracelets from Lanzarote that I bought for my nieces.

I'll probably remember other things as I try not to wallow but fail.

I mostly want my backpack, clothes and ring back. Backpack and clothes because I'm broke and ring because of sentimentality.

55,"I'm 25, not completely ancient yet, but I've never used them in my day to day messaging and no one I know really does unless the whole message is a single emoji. When someone posts like 3-5 emojis as a supplement to regular text, I gloss over it immediately because I don't see it as a part of the message. 

I'm not trying to say ""get off my lawn"" here, I'm actually asking for someone to explain it so I can start interpreting it as the concept of emojis doesn't seem to be going anywhere any time soon.

Like, I'm sure you know the old meme of interpreting 'hey' based on how many y's are at the end (hey VS heyy VS heyyy VS heyyyy). Is there something like that as a general rule of how to interpret certain emojis?

Also, having been a member of reddit for the past 6 or 7 years, it's crazy to think there was a time not long ago before emojis were even able to be used in reddit syntax. Now they're all over the place. Communication and language are fascinating.",09May2018,1
56,"He's the only boyfriend I've ever had. We only dated for 3 months but I was totally head over heels. We were best friends, spent every lunch &amp; most evenings together during this time.

58,"Please tell me if there is a better place to post this. I am 18M and drank weekly and smoked weed monthly for the last 2 or 3 years of my life. I never had much of a problem with any of i.t until a few months back. I stopped smoking and drinking entirely. Part of the reason was my gf was severely addicted/dependent on weed and i.t was beginning to impede on her life and happiness. She stopped along with me and hasn’t smoked at all since then. Since I stopped I’ve become more and more uncomfortable around people smoking and drinking. Now even the mention of alcohol or weed makes my body tense up. I know it’s irrational and I hold a daily argument in my head about i.t. I believe that as long as i.t is done in moderation and safely done then it’s not a problem. However my body still severely tenses up about i.t. Today my gf and I talked about the possibility of her smoking again. I.t made really uncomfortable, but I can’t really explain why. How do I work to stop tensing up around these things? Thanks.  ",09May2018,1

66,"I’m still disturbed about this. My mother had to fill me in on the details the next morning - I had called her after it happened and she picked me up and brought me home. Firstly, there is no way my ex boyfriend had anything to do with the memory loss. He was and still is a very decent person.  I also had had no alcohol that night and I’ve never done drugs.

My one clear memory of the event is sitting on the pavement bawling my eyes out looking up at him. He was crying too. I can still see his face really clearly. It keeps me up at night thinking of how upset he looked.

 I don’t remember sitting down. I don’t remember how I got to that part of town. I don’t remember getting home. I just know I woke up the next morning with what felt like a hangover and no recollection of the events of the night before other than one thing: my relationship was over. 

Before the breakup I had been struggling with my mental health and subsequently I sought treatment. The final diagnosis was that I had had had a bad reaction to a prescription drug I’d been on and it had caused all the anxiety/delusions I’d been suffering with. However there were no other instances of memory loss, not in the throes of my anxiety or in the two grueling months it took for me to completely get off this drug. This was a single, puzzling incident. 

Apparently I tried to run away from him that night and hurt myself  because I was so upset (again, I was on a drug that completely changed my personality at points so attempts to hurt myself were not abnormal). However, I had never done it with someone else there. I’ve almost dealt with the guilt of behaving like that in front of him, although I will never fully rid myself of it. The only thing is: I don’t remember doing it. That scares me more than the fact I attempted it at all. I’m terrified because I don’t know what else I said to him that night. 

I’ve accepted that the relationship is over for good and feel much lighter and happier now that I’m off the aforementioned drug. However I am still mystified as to how I lost my recollection of almost an entire evening. The question of how it happened still plagues me. I don’t want it to ever happen again. Has anyone else experienced memory loss like this, with no explanation?",09May2018,1

68," There is a backstory here, but I will make it brief so you can understand I am not so much super into fitness, as super into feeling better and more active. I was chronically ill after the birth of my daughter for 3 plus years, it has mostly been resolved. Getting my steps and exercise today helps me cope and stay sane. Here endeth the backstory.

It all began when my treadmill started acting wonky.  By wonky, I mean it variated speed out of the blue and caused me to trip and exclaim expletives many, many times. I thought I would follow the old adage that ostriches use, and was sure it would magically fix itself if I proverbially buried my head.  It did not

I spent an extraordinarily long time learning the intricate bullshit phone systems of Sears’ Warranty Department \(and memorizing voices of outsourced operators\- “Marie” is fine by the way\) . Three hours of real time later, I get the parts ordered and have a scheduled time of 3 weeks from now for treadmill fixin’. I hang up and put the toddler to bed that had been screaming through the entirety of all these fun phone endeavors.

The treadmill is still technically running \(sometimes\) and it smells a little bit like burning plastic but I need to get my exercise somehow, and as I currently reside on the surface of the sun,  going outside is not an option.  I repeat this fun bucking bronco activity over the next few days, until Hubband brings a fire extinguisher and sets it on my desk while looking at me sternly.   I smile sheepishly and keep striding.

The next day he takes our daughter to Fry’s to get groceries and comes home. He opens the door downstairs \(my treadmill is upstairs\) and runs upstairs yelling at me that the whole house smells and this is ridiculous and I am going to electrocute myself or burn the house down. I tried to focus on him but my whole head was spinning and he looked sort of shimmery through the burning plastic fog in my office. Just as he was about to physically remove me, the treadmill made a weird popping noise and shut down for good.

When the technician arrived on the special day he asked me how often we lubricated the belt. I looked at him in surprise and told him no one had ever mentioned that and I had no idea. He looked at me and his eyes widened larger than I have ever seen and he said, “not even once?” Apparently, you are supposed to do it four times a year and we hadn’t done it in 2 plus years of owning it. Whoops.

TL; DR I broke my treadmill completely, almost asphyxiated, and our entire house smelled like burning plastic for what will be \(I assume\) days.",09May2018,1
