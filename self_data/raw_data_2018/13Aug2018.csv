3,"What is Depression?  
Depression is being trapped. 

Depression is knowing the grass is not greener on the other side, because there is no grass to begin with. You may work a shitty job, live a shitty life, depression is knowing no matter what changes you make, you will feel the same. 

Depression is knowing no matter how many friends you have, you have no one. You may be the most sociable person in the world, but you're still alone. You want to share how you feel, but you can't.

What do you feel? 
Depression is an emotion as much as a physical feeling. 

As an emotion you feel sad, sad about your life, yourself, and your surroundings. The choices you've made, you constantly regret. The way you look, the way you act, the way you talk, you constantly hate. The people around you, you know who love you, you know who think about you, yet you convince yourself you've let them all down. But this sadness doesn't result in crying. This sadness turns itself into a physical feeling.

As a physical feeling, its the feeling of entrapment. It's the feeling you're in a tight space surrounded by walls constantly coming towards you. It's a tingly feeling in your head, that hurts without pain, and that won't go away.   

You can't to cry, but you can't.   
Because your body won't let you.

You want to scream for help, but you can't.   
Because you have no one.

Here's the thing. Stop self diagnosing. Get some help. Get some professional help. Don't mistake your sad lonely feelings for depression. If your depression is not real and you are just sad, do something, get help. If you're lonely, do something about it. If you're a victim of shit, do something about it. Raise a charity for your cause or something. If your depression is from drug side effects, do something. If it's your diet, do something. Talk to people. If your depression is from feeling inadequate, DO SOMETHING!!!!

Now if your depression is real. Clinically diagnosed. And you know it's something you can't change. Stop bringing it up to everyone because nothing can be done. It's completely pointless to moan about it. I'm sorry. My life is shit and when I vent to people I just know I'm ruining their time.

Of course that's not to say just keep it inside you at all times. Go to a therapist. Family and friends can be back stabbers. Point is..

13,"I guess I’ll start from the beginning.

Last year I dated this amazing girl. after having an injury that effectively took me out of sports, finding her really cheered me up in a way that i really needed. it was as if two people who were broken by life a little found eachother. i lost my virginity to her, and i honestly felt like i was the luckiest guy in the world. about a month later i found out she had hid a sexual assault from me, along with suicide attempts and self harm. I was scared, angry, and didn’t really know how to handle this. i felt my affection for her grow after she told me this and it led me to eventually smother her with emotion to the point where she broke up with me. i was truly heartbroken, and it really hit me bad. in the aftermath i got some really bad ideas in my (TRP, etc) and honestly still can.

i left home a few months later to pursue a career in the military at university. my last year has been great, with lots of friends, and lots of experiences that keep me excited for the years to come.

but honestly i still find myself thinking about her quite often. while she wasn’t the first girl i ever dated i can say that she was probably the first person i really felt a lot of compassion and emotion for.

In the aftermath I also got some really toxic ideas in my head, (TRP, etc) and it’s honestly changed the way I’ve viewed relationships and girls, albeit not in too radical of a way.

The reason why I know this is a problem is because the relationship was only three months long. It’s been over a year and i just can’t seem to get truly

i’ve still kinda been feeling frustrated, especially now as I type in the middle of a long, unproductive summer. Sometimes I still feel lonely, wanting to feel how I did with her.

Probably a lot more I could speak on this, but please, try to help me out, and thanks for reading.",13Aug2018,3
14,"The Universe happened because, in order for our current universe to have happened, gravity would have to exist. This is the premise of the Universe and us. We are the Universe. 

That sounds crazy, but let me explain. The moment two Somethings that existed decided that working together was better than existing alone, those two Somethings came together and spun about in The Nothing around them.

But as they spin in The Nothing, other Somethings see and become curious about joining. Maybe some decided against it and leave. This creates the reality we are in of Joiners vs. Leavers.

The thing about Nothing is that it's infinite. Since Nothing is infinite, there will eventually be another Joiner that will eventually come along and join them.

All these Joiners create an intense conglomerate of Joiners. As Joiners group up and collide and bump, they created ""Light"". Ever wonder why Light is always perceived as ""good"" and Darkness ""bad""?

Light is a collision of Joiners. Our reality exists as Joiners collide directly head-on, they stop. When Joiners stop, we percieve them as no longer existing. So we have a reality built around never colliding, but constantly orbiting. Sounds a lot like a nucleus, right?

What happens when they collide head-on? They stop and start magnetizing all other nearby Joiners. Since they are no longer colliding and only magnetizing, they are creating a never-ending growth of black mass. The blackest mass you'll ever see. From outside, these masses look like blackness itself. They are Black Holes. They will continue growing and swallow as many particles as they can for all of eternity. 

But why hasn't this happened yet? Will it happen? Are us Joiner conglomerates going to just die in a black hole? The answer is No.

Why? Because the growth of the amount of Somethings in our universe will always be more than the amount of Nothing. It's the one constant in our universe. Nothing will always grow at a slower rate than Something. 

Black Holes will gobble everything up as fast as they can, but there's too many Somethings popping into existence and colliding with other Somethings to create Other Things than there are head-on collisions creating Light before becoming Black Holes and gobbling up the universe. 

So what are we? We are the produce of collided particles. 

The reason why the speed of light can never be achieved is because of the law of ""For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction"". The speed limit in our universe is half of speed of the initial collision of our universe.

The Big Bang is the result of an enormous collision of two Somethings that then began attracting other Somethings. 

Those Joiner Things then kept having smaller collisions and creating Energy/Light eventually creating Stars and exploding into denser Somethings that Orbited each other well. 

When Somethings collide, but not head-on, they create vasts amount of energy. Every single something that collided has a memory of that collision because the after-collision effect called ""Vibrating"". They are resonating the song of the previous collision. Sort of like a wave...

So Existence is a bunch Somethings that come into existence at all different types of speeds and directions and knock into other somethings and create Light. The light is pure energy, and pushes other particles that come into existence into each other more often.

Energy causes movement, and when you're in Nothing, you can move very fast when your momentum is a result of an infinite amount of Somethings colliding and hitting you. 

Every single flash bit of light we see is another Something coming into our existence of Somethings and colliding with another something, creating more light and creating more waves and more energy. 

Life is Memory. We are a collection of our memories. What's a memory? A memory is collection of Somethings that came together and read the patterns of waves. If you could read a wave's behavior history, you could know what came next and prevent a collision that would cause an end to your group of particles. 

We began reading the tune of the other Somethings and vibrating at their frequency because we were sure that their frequency is what has kept them alive all this time.  The frequency is the frequency of life. 

All of our very being is vibrating and imitating that initial bang. That bang's tune attracted so many Things that it kept expanding and expanding.

So what is our universe? Our universe is a tune. A popular tune that we all have. That tune was the recipe of life and we keep singing it to exist.

That vibration of that tune created humanity.  We are birds of a feather and that tune keeps us working together. It isn't until we fall out of tune and aren't in harmony that we will finally die.

So how do we keep our reality going? Spread the tune.  Make a reality that sings that tune loud and clear, because it's what happiness is. Happiness is chasing that tune. 

The best tune is our DNA, which is a dense Helix of vibrating Somethings that are following the tune and replicating itself to the tune. 

We need to find a way to keep that tune going. The tune is colliding (socializing) as close as possible without creating a collision (group thought). Chasing that tune the best way we know how... By existing. And trying to exists. And finding way to not not exist. To find ways for us all to exist. The ones that aren't singing the tune are ringing their own tone. 

Don't let others' tunes drown your own version of the tune. Don't stop trying to find that tune of happiness. Don't let your tune drown out others' tunes. Find a way to keep that tune ringing for eternity. Work with others to find the right tune. Only by ringing closely together can we keep that tone strong.

Much like a chord. A single tone sounds dead, but different chords in unison and slight changes to it sound more enjoyable to the ear. 

Just make sure you pick a tune that will ring the loudest, longest, and has the sound that the most amount of people will enjoy and will allow them to continue enjoying. Pick a sustainable ring. Pick one that's catchy and happy. Then others won't be able to help but ring with you. ",13Aug2018,3
15,"    Recently I just lost an amazing friend. She didn't pass away but she won't talk to me. Let's start from the beginning.

    She was amazing. Any problem I had she would support me and have my back. If I wasn't feeling the best or I needed something solved she was always there for me.

    About 5 days ago we both got very drunk and started talking. One thing led to another and some picture where exchanged. The day after she didn't respond to my ""hi"" or ""are you ok?""

    She then blocked me on every platform and also changed her usernames. I'm fucking torn. Every day I think about the warm, compassionate friend I used to have. I am also worried for her. How does she feel? Is she mentally ok? She had some problems in the past and the last thing I would want would be to send her into depression or anything worst.

Let me know what you think =)

The Universe happened because, in order for our current universe to have happened, gravity would have to exist. This is the premise of the Universe and us. We are the Universe.

So what is our universe? Our universe is a tune. A popular tune that we all have. That tune was the recipe of life and we keep singing it to exist.

That vibration of that tune created humanity. We are birds of a feather and that tune keeps us working together. It isn't until we fall out of tune and aren't in harmony that we will finally die.

So how do we keep our reality going? Spread the tune. Make a reality that sings that tune loud and clear, because it's what happiness is. Happiness is chasing that tune.

The best tune is our DNA, which is a dense Helix of vibrating Somethings that are following the tune and replicating itself to the tune.

We need to find a way to keep that tune going. The tune is colliding (socializing) as close as possible without creating a collision (group thought). Chasing that tune the best way we know how... By existing. And trying to exists. And finding way to not not exist. To find ways for us all to exist. The ones that aren't singing the tune are ringing their own tone.

Don't let others' tunes drown your own version of the tune. Don't stop trying to find that tune of happiness. Don't let your tune drown out others' tunes. Find a way to keep that tune ringing for eternity. Work with others to find the right tune. Only by ringing closely together can we keep that tone strong.

Much like a chord. A single tone sounds dead, but different chords in unison and slight changes to it sound more enjoyable to the ear.

Just make sure you pick a tune that will ring the loudest, longest, and has the sound that the most amount of people will enjoy and will allow them to continue enjoying. Pick a sustainable ring. Pick one that's catchy and happy. Then others won't be able to help but ring with you. ",13Aug2018,1
37,"I have a pretty negative way of thinking and low self confidence. I was addicted to Instagram and it was affecting me in a negative way and brought my self confidence way down. I compared myself to everyone's lives thinking ""They are so lucky they work there and always have free food/happy hours!"" ""I'm so jealous that they got to open their own business"" ""How come they can travel so often and I cant?""

My boyfriend, bless his heart, always keeps me in check by reminding me that I have a wonderful life and that I should not be using instagram if all it gives me are negative thoughts about myself.

So, it's been one week. I haven't even touched it. My thoughts are so much more clear with no distractions from thinking about other people's lives.

I'm just going to focus on myself and my goals.

38," *In advance I'd like to apologize for the writing style as English is not my native language.*  


I know that this story won't reach to everybody and most of you won't relate or even bother to think about it ever again after reading it, but I just had to share it.  


My story started off great. I had a nice childhood with awesome mother and grandparents. I was doing well in school, did sports and was just a happy kid. Life was going as it should - learning, educating myself, figuring out my future and just being a functioning member of society. By the time I was 3rd year in University, everything started to go downhill. An old friend introduced me to sports betting which I found quite interesting. At first it was all fun and games for the first year. The bets were getting bigger and the need for that rush grew. By the time I finished my 5 years master program in 2016 spring, I was totally hooked. My dept had grown to ca 50 000 EUR and it kept growing to reach almost 100 000 EUR by the end of 2017. Luckily, I was able to get a decent job, which I hoped will help me solve my problems. Now, almost one and a half year later I am still in the same place financially, mostly because I am paying the financial institutions the interest rates to postpone the regular paying dates. I just don't make enough money to even meet my monthly payments (considering the total sum is due to be payed in ca 5 years). So for one and a half years I have just stood still. Today I had to face that I will never ever get to pay off these debts.  


For the last 4 years I have almost never felt any happiness inside me. Watching myself from mirror, I see a used to be a happy and positive kid that now has a dead depression look in his eyes - probably for the last 4 years already. It has reached the point where I can't get up in the morning to go to work, because I know that no matter what I do, at the end of the month I don't have a single euro in my account and my loans are still the same.This road has dragged me so deep into depression that for the first time today I just felt this is enough, I do not want to do this anymore and should just get it over with by any means. Then, for a few seconds I totally broke down in tears which was actually relieving, because I hadn't felt this or any other feeling (beside constant sadness) for years. I realized that I wasn't emotional because of the pain of the thought of suicide or even the pain the real act of it might cause, but I was thinking of my family and what it might do to them. Years worth of emotions went through me whilst thinking - how have I ever reached this situation, how have I been such an idiot, is this a bad dream?  


Hopefully you, that read this, will cherish your life and everyone and -thing you have. I sincerely hope that none of you will ever have to stand in front of a mirror and think where have you made a horrible mistake that have lead you to some unescapable situation.  


I feel a lot better to get that off of my chest and that someone else knows my story beside me. A few family members have a broad idea of my situation, but I could never tell them the full story - It would break them.  


Thank you for reading and have a nice day! ",13Aug2018,1
39,"*We've been living together since May of this year, but we've been together about three years total. We're both in our late twenties and we currently rent a one-bedroom apartment.*

He's complained that most of his stuff is still over at his mom's house. So I told him to make me a list of what he wants to bring home and I'll come up with some storage solutions so he can bring it home. He shot that idea down. Then he told me he doesn't like sharing space. So I suggested we look for a two bedroom after our current lease is up so we each have our own rooms in the house. He shot that idea down. He told me he feels like a guest here because ""nothing is his"". So I encouraged him to get some things he likes to put in the house to make it feel more like home for him. (Most of our current furniture is mine because I lived on my own before we moved in together and he didn't. Admittedly, I have decorated *a little*, like a few pictures, but nothing major.) He shot that idea down.

On top of that, he frequently says that our apartment is ""small"" and ""confined"", which is bullshit. The front room is bigger than the studio I was renting AND our bedroom is considerably bigger than one he had at his mom's house. It's got lots of natural light, so we never need lights during the day. It's even got four closets, which is practically unheard of for a one-bedroom. It's less than 10 minutes away from where we both work. We have off-street parking. What more could you want? 

I mean, I really don't know what the fuck he wants or what his problem is. It's fucking frustrating. We talked about living together and made the plans and everything before we signed this lease. Now that we've actually done it, it's suddenly horrible for him. I don't get it.",13Aug2018,3

The average is pretty high and only 30% of students made it through this year. I’ve been stressed and I’ve been studying over the summer, but I still feel like I’ll fail because there are so many people smarter than me. This makes me really worried because I don’t know what to do if I fail, and I don’t want to waste my parents’ money. It really sucks that university is making me stressed before it even started.

45,"I'm 25 years old and have purposely stepped on bugs my whole life. Occasionally - rarely, a friend, acquaintance, or stranger will comment that what I'm doing is wrong or a sign of bad character or someone (usually a girl) will say I need to grow up. I've even heard people say that you can extrapolate how someone would act toward others based on their purposely squashing bugs for no reason. For the life of me, I cannot figure out how people can draw such conclusions based on such a singular minimal act.

Once at a picnic I got up to throw something in the garbage, noticed a horde of ants bustling around a little ant mound, was sort of bored, so I lifted my foot over them and stamped it down. I sat back down and my buddy and I sort of snickered because I noticed my running shoes were full of mud and a ton of ants were now pressed deep into the maze-like treads and squirming about in their new rubber prison. Then out of nowhere some guy with another group who had seen me stepping on the ants called me a bully and ""inhumane"" because I step on ants. I replied to him by telling him to kiss my stinking feet, and which I know is not nice, heh.

But at the same time, I believe I'm actually a pretty good natured guy to others. I volunteered as an EMT in college, treat others respectfully, believe in fair play when I run or swim competitively, I'm against scams, violence, etc. Most people I know consider me to be a pretty damn good guy.

I recognize some people believe in reincarnation, but I'm not one of them. So I don't see how stepping on bugs can be a sign of character for those who also do not subscribe to reincarnation, which I believe is most Americans. And if I really were stepping on someone's granny jane or their uncle bob, I guess my thoughts would be eh, better luck next time. There was probably a reason why her new home is a patch of mud on the bottom of my size 12 running shoe.

What is the general rationale behind the thinking that purposely stepping on bugs is wrong, immoral, sign of poor character, etc?",13Aug2018,0

I've been friend with a guy for 3 years, I considered him to be my best friend for a long time, and sometimes I really like hanging out and talking with him. But sometimes I really hate it. 

He's a good friend most of the time, but at times he can be really judgmental, like I don't care what he says but are friends really supposed to be judgmental over each other? I have my personal choices, or have my own way of thinking sometimes. But he judges me for it and sometimes pulls out his ass a set of insults.

A month ago I started a new job. There also works this guy I know since uni. I wouldn't've recognized him if he hadn't told me. I was very very shy at uni and I didn't talk with him then.

And now I'm crushing on him hard. I know about 'you don't shirt where you eat'. I don't work closely with him but we're in the same open office space :( Also I'm 99% sure he's not single (I guessed from his fb posts because I don't know how to ask. Btw he friended me on fb)

I really need a boyfriend to take my mind off my coworker. I mean I don't want just any guy who fills a checklist. There has got to be something else, I can't explain... Not knowing how to approach a guy, nor how to be approachable is not helping.

Also recently the following happened: I've taken down most of my pics off Facebook because there was that creepy guy that hit on me.

And the other day I posted a photo and took it down a couple of hours later. My coworker messaged me 'Hi! I've noticed that you deleted that photo. Is it because I liked it?'. I messaged him back 'chill, dude. I just don't like having public photos on my fb'

wtf? I guess he's thinking I'm too sensitive? Why does he even care? I think he might pity me because some people do because of my extreme shyness in the past. Otherwise he's not 'out of my league'. 

I guess I need some advice but I don't really know what to ask :/ I'm afraid it will all end in tears. I'm not going to hit on him but I don't think I am able to just get over it. I'm not good at handling emotions. ",13Aug2018,1

63,"I know the title of this post is odd but it was the only title that came to my head on how to explain my situation. So, for as long as i can remember i've had regular down periods and by this i mean periods in my life wherein i feel extremely sad, this is the only way i could describe it. I would feel so tired and sleepy all the time and i felt like i couldn't be bothered to do the daily tasks i would regularly do, such as cleaning, eating or i know this is gross but even showering. In my head, i thought this was a normal thing that all teenagers go through, It would feel like it was the end of the world but i would think that I'm just being dramatic as per usual. If there is one word which my family would use to describe me is dramatic, this is due to my random anger outbursts. At this point i thought that I probably had anger issues but I didn't know how these feelings came to be. What in my life had made me become so easily irritable to the point i would have anger outbursts at the smallest situations and if it wasn't anger then i would cry out of both sadness and anger. I didn't and honestly? I still don't understand why. My family do not talk about mental health at all, in all my 19 years in this world with my family, mental health has never been a topic discussed in my family. I also have an irrational fear of talking to people on the phone a lot of the times, i begin to tremble A LOT when i have to speak to crowds, my voice trembles as well and at times I really want to cry when i have to make public presentations, whether in class or not. I will go out and the loudest thought in my head will be ""Those people are talking about me, there's something on me"" or ""Those people are looking at me, I knew I looked ugly"". However, growing up I always thought this was a norm. I thought that this is something temporary that all teenagers go through and that soon enough, I would become a confident woman and nothing people said would get to me and If people stared at me, then i wouldn't mind as much and that being sad regularly would eventually go away and not having the will to get up and do anything would transform into me gaining the will to want to live my life and that sometimes not caring to look both ways when crossing the road was just something that teenagers do and as an adult I would stop being childish and care about my life. But here I am, I'm 19 years old and I still feel the same, the exact same way. Turns out it wasn't a teenage phase as they say on Tv- shows and Movies but I think it might be Depression and I don't know if i'm ready to face the fact that my mental health is broken. I'm used to being the ""Happy"" girl that is there for her friends which are depressed or are facing suicidal thoughts. Im used to being the girl that has become her friends and families diary. Im used to being the Happy girl that when people would explain their sad thoughts to me, in my head i would think ""I feel the exact same way"" but i would never say it out-loud because its not me time, its my friends and family's time. It never was my turn to explain how I felt because somehow every time I would try and explain that I've been feeling sad and how I've been feeling like my life is worthless, the situation would end being switched and the other person would ignore what i said and begin to talk about there own emotions. And so this is story of how i discovered that i suffer from both Depression and Anxiety but no one will ever know and that's okay because I've been dealing with it all my life without being aware of what it acc was and I will continue to do so because at the end of the day, in a friendship or a relationship between family members only one person can talk about their hardships and be depressed. Everyone else has to be sunshine and rainbows and happy. It's okay, I know that as a 19 year old I haven't experienced all of life's hardships and I have no reason to feel the way I feel.

I'm upset that my girl ended things with me yesterday.

But we weren't ultra serious. True, I liked her a lot, and I tried my very, very best to show that, but unfortunately I had very little time to devote to her. I'm a full-time college student, I work 30-35 hours per week, and soon I'll have a senior position in an on-campus club and will be gearing up to travel to Belize for an archaeological expedition. And the garbage flavored icing to top this 7-layer shit cake is the college town I live in should not, by any normal societal standard, exist; all the relationships, activities, and general fuckery that happens here does not emulate real life at all, so who knows how a relationship created within it would fair outside the town.

So, it's not too surprising it ended, and the fact that it ended isn't what upsets me. Her reason for ending it, however, is making me feel like a garbage fire on Trash Island.

We may not have been engagement-level serious, but it was definitely clear that, over the course of 4 months, we were exclusive. Romantic dates, incessant talking to each other, we fit together really well, the ""I miss you""s and relationship level flirting, the crying when she had to go back home for the summer while I stayed for classes, the whole works. And I most certainly am a fundamentally flawed person, but I hold no doubt that, with her, I did everything right; I was a good person to her.

Soooo, I think it's not too crazy that I feel a wee bit undervalued, because while I was here at school, she became ""involved"" with someone she knew from her high school years. And now my self-esteem and self-respect packed their bags for an extended vacation.

I feel stupid. I was so excited that she was coming back into town. I sprinted to hug her the moment I saw her. I made a dinner that would've sent Guy to Flavortown. I even set up a spot for us to watch the perseids rain down, where she consequently Catherine The Great'd my ass and left me quite dazed and confused.

I need to vent. My childhood and mental illness has left me quite emotionally stunted, so I'm struggling to talk to even my closest friends about this. I just wanted someone to acknowledge that I did everything right but still lost (shout out Capt. Picard), because I feel worthless right now. To be brutally honest I want attention and praise, because ignoring this event, life still has been a tonne of bricks that keeps reloading. I don't know
