0,"It may not sound like much, but I am pretty insecure about my weight. Somedays I cannot go outside without wearing a hoodie or sweater, just so it covers up my stomach and man boobs when in reality it probably makes me look bigger. I'm pretty sure I have moderate generalized anxiety and social anxiety so that also doesn't help but I'm not diagnosed so who knows whats up with me

But this week where it's been so hot in the UK, I have managed to go outside everyday and be around people, without one. It sounds silly typing it out but I'm pretty proud of myself

What has helped is that I've lost over a stone, and even though it's not a lot of weight I already feel slightly slimmer",24Jul2018,179

The doctor thinks it‚Äôs an extremely bad sunburn with heat rash all over my hands and arms. 

Wear sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat if you‚Äôre going to be in the sun for long periods of time. I do not burn and have bragged about not burning since I can remember. Life decided to fuck me real good.

2,"I was in my old house in Piscataway, NJ. The year was 2001, the year the first LOTR movie came out. I was 9. I was sitting on my bed, it was just before the sun started to set. I was alone. I wanted to be alone because I was hysterically pleading to God to come and save me.

I‚Äôm crying with my hands clasped tightly together, staring out of my window into the sky, crying uncontrollably. Desperately pleading with my Heavenly Father to hear me.

‚ÄúDear God, please take me away. Please take me away. Please take me away. I don‚Äôt want to be here. I need to go far, far, far away from here. Please make me older so I can be with Orlando Bloom, so we can live happily ever after. Please let me wake up tomorrow and not be here. Please help me escape.‚Äù

I was 9 years old and I was pretty certain that I loved Orlando Bloom. He was my prince charming who was one day going to come and rescue me in the highest room in the tallest tower. He was going to help me escape.

The day I was crying and pleading to a God I thought would hear me, I was desperate. There was a deep sadness in me that day. This day is my earliest memory of feeling absolutely helpless and alone for the first time. I was so desperate to escape into my fantasies. I was afraid of the reality of my life continuing. 

This is something people don‚Äôt ever want to talk about because of how horrific these tragedies tend to be. It‚Äôs something you are aware of, but it‚Äôs not something you ever think about. Why would you? It‚Äôs horrible, depressing, and heartbreaking. However, it‚Äôs more common than people realize.

Sexual child abuse happens to 1 in 4 little girls. That was me. That was my life. That was my reality. That‚Äôs why I was shaking, crying, and pleading hysterically to a God to save me. I didn‚Äôt want be alive anymore. ",24Jul2018,2
3,"This might seem like a weird way to start my recovery but I really needed to find a way to release everything inside of me in way that wasn‚Äôt harmful. I haven‚Äôt started therapy and I know if you‚Äôre reading this you will probably strongly suggest I do that. The thing is ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready for that yet.

When terrible things happen to you it‚Äôs hard to put that into words. Where do you even begin? Should you even talk about it? What if someone just doesn‚Äôt believe you? Why would anyone care? What if you‚Äôre actually crazy? These are questions I ask myself a lot when contemplating telling anyone about anything. It‚Äôs hard.

Living with trauma inside of you is hard. It eats away at your soul and keeps you from living your best life. If you‚Äôre going through this as well ‚Äì I‚Äôm here and want you to know that you are not alone. If you need someone to talk to about this ‚Äì I‚Äôm here. I really am ‚Äì I‚Äôve been through a lot and I‚Äôve managed to survive somehow.  So whatever you are going through and if you feel like you have no one to talk to, feel free to shoot me a message.

4,"I‚Äôm in second year uni, and have a fairly busy lifestyle. Managing 2 jobs, classes in September and still have me time is very stressful.

But out of the blue she started ignoring me and leaving me on read for no reason. 

This other girl who I was flirting with kept saying she wants to hangout but whenever I asked her she always canceled or wouldn‚Äôt reply until the next day saying she was tired and had a headache, which I can understand but really every time I asked you you had a headache? I feel like maybe I was being a bit too clingy and that may have drove her away.

I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs weird, all but a few of my high school friends who I‚Äôve known for 5+ years have dropped all contact with me

I tried to turn off notifications on Snapchat, removed people who I wasn‚Äôt close with, started working out a lot more (not big but I‚Äôm a bit skinny). Basically just trying to do stuff to keep my occupied but it‚Äôs hard because I keep feeling like it‚Äôs always something I did. I wish that one girl wouldn‚Äôt ignore me anymore and the one I was flirting with would be honest, but I may just cut all times with them and try to move on.

Any suggestions?

6,"Hello everyone. I have been subscribed to this subreddit for quite some time, mainly because I have been interested in self-improvement for as long as I can remember and enjoy reading stories about decent things happening in this world for a change. Anyway, I am 23 years old and am currently going to school to be an OT (just because I need to find something that will help me pay the bills that I also somewhat enjoy). But my ultimate goal is to eventually teach English and travel abroad with the hopes of one day becoming a published author. I have been working on this goal for quite some time and despite actually finishing a short story and a few poems, I just can't get myself to write everyday like I know I should.

Sometimes it's a matter of fitting it into my schedule, and other times its a matter of simply being dumbfounded by the whole process.  I will get on my computer and attempt to write something, but will just stare blankly at the screen, as if a deer caught in the headlights. I am attempting another short story at the moment called the Nightmare Pit based off of a dream I had. It involves a creature of sorts imprisoned in some clock tower that comes out at the stroke of midnight and devours everything. The creature has no form, but acts more like an intelligent mist. I try to write something everyday, but most of the time I come away feeling unsatisfied and just give up entirely.

Any ideas for how to help me out? I would greatly appreciate it.",24Jul2018,1

I made the decision to quit altogether before  and I can easily say it was one of the worst times of my life. I felt like a soulless robot, I wasn't doing what I enjoy at all but I was only doing what I was supposed to do. So please don't tell me that I should quit gaming, for some periods like finals yes, but I won't quit it forever just because I'm lacking self control and find it easier to quit than to manage my time.

So I need your help to find balance between work and play, I would appreciate any tips that can help me nail my first year while gaming. Especially that I have an addictive personality. Also I am a computer science student, I know that makes it harder because it isn't particularly known to be an easy major.

10,"Incoming long post. I just need to get this out of my head, feel free to chime in (please? üò≠ idfk I just need SOMEONE to tell me their opinion on this) 

Okay so this is going to sound like trolling but trust me it isn‚Äôt. (Every time I post something even close to this people always thing I‚Äôm trolling -.-) 

I‚Äôve had a tough childhood. I‚Äôm sure that affects this in a huge way. I have lived with depression and social anxiety for 11-14 years. Something very traumatic happened to me when I was in 3rd grade. Ever since that day I wasn‚Äôt the same person. When I was little I was outgoing, fun, just so full of energy. I freakin loved playing pranks on my classmates lmao. I was the class clown and it often got me in trouble. After this event happened I just wanted to be in bed all day long. I stopped caring about anything and everything. Everyone noticed but no one bothered to do anything about it. Those people who were supposed to protect me stood there and watched this go on and ignored it. 

I shut down emotionally, physically, and mentally for several years. (Until 8th grade) when I tried to come out of my zombie state I couldn‚Äôt lol.. I found out I had developed selective mutism. I literally didn‚Äôt talk to  anyone at all. I was isolated from society for so many years. 

Now here‚Äôs where my problem comes in. Throughout all of this, like I mentioned, I shut down. I really mean it. I didn‚Äôt shower for weeks at times. No deodorant, didn‚Äôt brush my teeth. I didn‚Äôt take care of myself in general. I didn‚Äôt care about anything. What I‚Äôm trying to say is, I see myself as really unattractive. 

Over time, I managed to not see myself as unattractive. In my opinion, I‚Äôm average.. not ugly not attractive. There‚Äôs just one problem with that though. People constantly tell me otherwise. Let‚Äôs get one thing clear before I continue. I have NEVER been one of those people that does around telling everyone how ‚ÄúI‚Äôm shit, I‚Äôm no good at anything, I‚Äôm so fucking ugly, I wish I were just dead, I‚Äôm a burden‚Äù so it‚Äôs not like people are telling me ‚Äúoh no you‚Äôre not ugly you‚Äôre hot‚Äù because I say I‚Äôm ugly. No. 

I really mean it when I say I haven‚Äôt spoken a word in years. My confidence level is nonexistent. I have been told my actions don‚Äôt back up the no confidence thing though. 

I regularly (in winter) wear leather jackets, i wear slim fit jeans, motorcycle, stand up straight, etc stuff like that. 

Anyway, so I regularly get compliments on my appearance. They‚Äôre not like subtle compliments though. On one occasion I was walking up the stairs on my college building and this girl and I almost ran into each other. She looked up and said ‚Äúsorr‚Äù and before she could finish saying it ‚Äúohhhhh or not.. , damn you‚Äôre hot!‚Äù 

On multiple other occasions I have also been told similar things. When I go to the gym I often find people staring at me. I‚Äôm so puzzled by what the fuck they‚Äôre seeing or idfk because I‚Äôm like what the fuck? (I‚Äôm not talking about occasional glancing. I‚Äôm taking about the creepy old guy type of staring) I‚Äôm no where near that attractive. There‚Äôs a ton of more attractive people here wtf u looking here for? 

A few hours ago today someone came up to me and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre hella hot‚Äù um? Thanks? 

I honestly do not feel anywhere near this attractive. Like I mentioned, I‚Äôm average (to me) I honestly don‚Äôt meet my own definition of attractive lol.. 
 
Let‚Äôs make a list of everything unattractive with me. 
- for most of my life I‚Äôve had ‚Äúman boobs‚Äù I still do somewhat have them but not as visible as before 
- my skin is shit 
- I have depression (who the fuck has time to look like a zombie all day?) 
- I have those lines under my eyes
- my lips are too big, in my opinion 
- I have a ton of medical conditions 

I have a lot more but those are the most prominent ones I guess. 

Honestly, when I‚Äôm in the bathroom I can‚Äôt even look at myself in the mirror. 

Idk.. it‚Äôs like people have too low standards compared to mine. By the way, like these standards I have are only for myself ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Idk how that works.

18,"I‚Äôve been thinking back on one of the saddest stories I‚Äôve ever heard. 

It was early in my career and I‚Äôd grown close with an employee in the back office. Their responsibilities consisted largely of bookkeeping. 

One day we were talking about a story we‚Äôd seen on the news, and they remarked how it‚Äôs not fair criminals get to go to prison. 

I thought they meant they didn‚Äôt want to pay to house and feed criminals, but it was much more morose. 

They said they‚Äôd always wished they‚Äôd had the guts to commit a (non-violent) crime so they could spend their life in prison and not have to work all day. Their whole life was working, commuting, sleeping, and doing household errand and upkeep. They didn‚Äôt have any family. They just wanted time to pursue their passion, which was physical fitness and poetry. 

In prison they‚Äôd have three square meals and all the time to exercise they‚Äôd want. 

If I‚Äôd been older and more mature or less taken aback by this sudden outpouring of emotion I‚Äôd have handled it better, but they were so genuine in their desire to be in prison, and the description of their daily life was so hopeless and sad, I didn‚Äôt know what to say. 

A few months later they were transferred to a different district and never heard what ultimately became of them, but another coworker who ended up at that district said they were still there three years later. 

I wish to God I‚Äôd had the life experience and presence of mind to tell them they could get a personal trainers certification, go to publish poetry in local journals, go to night school and pick a new career with more flexibility to work from home. I wish so badly I had.

22,"I'll do my best make this short as I can.

I matched with a woman on tinder, and we hit it off immediately. We went on a few dates, and by the third date, we ended up hooking up. She was, at the time, in nursing school, and worked at a clinic, so she wanted me to get STD tested afterwards. Not a big deal, as I've been tested before, and knew I was clean. After I get tested, she then goes later that day. We both got the immediate results back, testing negative for HIV, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, etc. However, for other tests, we weren't going to find out until the following week. 

In the meantime, we continue to hook up and hang out, and begin to get a little more serious. The following week comes around, my tests come back all negative, but she tests positive for trichomoniasis. This is a common STD, doesn't seem to really affect men other than an irritation while urinating, but can still be carriers. Trichomoniasis also a little harder to test for, since it can show up negative even when you have it. I was a bit unsure of things at this point, but I went back to the clinic with her to receive the necessary medication. I showed no symptoms, but she did. Since I actually liked this girl, I figured this was just a small bump in the road we could move past and forget about. I take her out the following weekend on a really nice date, and remain in touch with her the following couple of days.

I don't know what happened at this point, but for some reason, a few days later she would begin not texting/calling/trying to stay in touch with me, and would turn down invitations to hang out. I ultimately didn't hear from her for a good week and a half. I ended going on a planned short vacation with a friend from college the following weekend. Once I got back, I called her up asking if we were still a thing, and what was going on with her that she was acting a bit shady. She then proceeds to tell me she is going on a date with another guy, and tried to spin it off as I didn't seem like I serious with her. This wasn't true, and I explained to her I tried numerous times to spend time with her. She tried to make it seem that I only cared about hooking up and hanging out on weekends, and tells me she expects the man to do most of the work in the relationship. I guess she expected more of me? After some back and forth yelling over the phone I hang up, and immediately delete her from my phone, and social media. I have not tried reaching out to her since.

Weeks later, curiosity got the best of me, and after peeking at her social media, she's now in a more serious relationship with her current dude, and it got me pretty upset seeing them together.  I now have her blocked on everything social media related, hoping that I can forget everything that happened between us. It's been a month now, and it drives me crazy that I just can't seem to put my finger on what went wrong, and if I could have avoided any of this. ",24Jul2018,31

There is this electricity in the air that something is happening here and I'm not sure what. Nobody tells me, I don't ask. 

I look up to the mountains and see what everyone was stopped for. Like a creature barreling across the earth, thousands of rocks, pebbles to boulders, are careening towards us. I do not panic, I casually walk to my car and get in. I urge others around to get in my car but they don't. We endure the hail-like storm and it calms. 

I see no injuries. What should be a time of chaos and despair seems to be a shared experience in something beautiful and powerful. We all have fear but we are all okay. 

The cycle repeats as I walk around. The setting turns into a pathway around an enormous lake with very deep blue water. 

Eventually the scale gets enormous. There are shadows of the colossus level boulders hammering the lake, inspiring enormous spouts of water to shoot up after them. 

I am experiencing these cycles in tunnels, on a playground that's been flooded so you have to use the equipment like monkey bars to cross.

34,"I know, it might sound really fucking stupid. Heres why though:

One day me and 4 friends go to this hidden area in the outskirts of our city. It‚Äôs by the beach and is pretty clean and scenic. Clear ocean waters, colourful coral and schools of fish, perfect for a Saturday afternoon out with a few drinks.

3 blokes (including me) and 2 girls in total. One of my friends has got a huge crush on this girl that went along with us. We‚Äôd been hanging out with that girl for quite some time now, it‚Äôs only the day we went to the beach that I got closer with her as a friend and not just seeing her as my best friend‚Äôs friend. 

Later that day, the sun had already set. Me and the other the other girl talk away from the 3 for no apparent reason it just happened to be like that. While we were away, he‚Äôd told her that he liked her for quite some time now(2 years to be exact). Prior to this happening, we had a drinking game(spin the bottle) and who ever the bottle landed on first was the questioner and the second land would be the one to answer. Me being a cunt friend, I ask in front of the whole group if this friend of mine has a chance with the girl who was sitting opposite of me. She nodded no. Awkward silence, but I decide to break it by rushing to spin the bottle to get the game moving. Turned out well.

So then he told her everything he felt. We already had too much to drink by then.  I wasn‚Äôt close enough to hear how it turned out or what she said.

Some time after, me and that girl have a talk. She said that that night was one of the best nights she‚Äôs had and she‚Äôd 100% relive that moment if she could. Me being the guy that planned it started to get big headed about it. Then I go to the guy friend and he said it was also a really good night.

Not long after that, the two have an awkward tension between each other. Then they stopped talking to each other.

I asked both why, and they both replied with a ‚Äúwell he/she started it so I did it too.‚Äù kind of reply. I try to bring it all back together with no effect. They end up becoming close friends again not long after that, closer than ever. The girl tells me that she sometimes gets awkward with people that tell her they like her, and that she doesn‚Äôt choose for it to happen, it just happens.

We all start hanging out again quite regularly. We all get closer each time we hang out as you‚Äôd expect. Me and this girl in particular get closer the most. We start talking a lot too now, in person and over the phone. Corny story short, we both end up telling each other that we like each other.

So now we start to hang out alot, just the two of us. It would always end up being around the middle of the afternoon ‚Äòtil late night. We‚Äôd go to the beach and sit on the sand, I‚Äôd bring my laptop and a movie and we‚Äôd watch it on the beach. We would always reach the sunset. She started to care for me. She saw how much of an alcoholic I was and did everything she could to stop me. We‚Äôd make deals that I wasn‚Äôt allowed any alcohol for a period of time that she‚Äôd mention. She would always ask if I would have anything to ride back home, even though it was more likely that she would run out of transportation. In return, I cared for her as well. We would do these deals together because she also drinks a bit. I would always worry about her running out of transport. One time we had to wait ‚Äòtil midnight for a ride. We sat by the sidewalk waiting and talking. All of this we never did before, and it made me feel special. We wouldn‚Äôt be all lovey dovey to each other because fuck that. We would be caring for each other but still mess around and fuck about with each other.

After days and nights of hanging out together, I always think about her. I genuinely feel something for her. She brings me so much happiness, we both like the same music, the same movies, the same food, mostly everything she liked I liked too. I genuinely see a future with her. 

Then the thought of my best friend liking the same girl came to mind. Which made me feel extremely guilty that I‚Äôm even doing any of this with her. ‚ÄòTil this day, he doesn‚Äôt know I like her. 

A few days later I go hang out with her and she wanted to tell me something. We were walking in the rain and she tells me she‚Äôs starting to have feelings for this other dude that she had a crush on (not my friend that likes her, someone else). I obviously take this easy and don‚Äôt mind that much because we weren‚Äôt anything serious. 

The talking starts to slow down, we hardly see each other anymore. Last time I hung out with her was about 2 months ago. It started to slowly turn into what they had with my friend, awkward tension. I think ahead and try my best to keep it going and I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm doing well. 

Then it starts to kick in.

I start thinking about her 24/7. I keep asking myself what I could‚Äôve done wrong, wondering if I can fix it. The pain in my chest starts happening more often and I constantly imagine what life could have been with her.

This goes on for weeks of me trying to talk to her, trying to start a conversation, it‚Äôs gotten to the point where a normal person wouldn‚Äôt bother talking to her anymore but I still am.

All of a sudden she asks me if we could talk in person.

I say yes.

It‚Äôs been a month now and we haven‚Äôt met up yet to talk in person. She could be blowing it off for a reason but its most likely that she‚Äôs lazy.

During the wait she went out with my friend that likes her. To my understanding of his story telling, it was the best day of his life. So I kinda got what happened.

So you‚Äôre probably asking where the smoking comes in. Right about now.

As a kid I grew up in a rough neighbourhood, full of gangs and druggies thus having effect on me. I got into ciggies at a young age and weed a bit later. I was brought up right and I stopped doing both after a month of trying it, but I definitely remember what they feel like and they did feel quite good.

I tried drinking again but it just reminded me of her even more. Now I‚Äôm thinking about smoking again because it helped me through a tough life. I stopped mainly because it was bad for me, but I also stopped because my life turned to the good side, and I didn‚Äôt need it anymore.

I think I need it this time.

TL;DR: I fall in love with my friend‚Äôs massive crush who liked me back then decided that she likes someone else and now smoking is probably what I need.",24Jul2018,1
35,"For the past half a year I‚Äôve felt off per say, my relationship with everyone; in my mind at least has soured and isn‚Äôt at all as fulfilling as they used to be. Existing itself has become some kind of chore, where everything feels meaningless or that it‚Äôs not leading anywhere, the same for my life really.

I‚Äôm 17, almost turning 18 and have been told multiple times it‚Äôs probably just hormones and that ‚Äúit happens to everyone‚Äù. As I‚Äôm off for the summer I‚Äôve been working full time, getting stoned often to alleviate my mind and ignore these problems that weigh on my mind. The things that once brought me happiness and relaxed me like video games and hanging out with friends anywhere are no where near as appealing as they once were.

It‚Äôs very hard to articulate and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm doing a very good job at explaining it here. My anxiety has been through the roof and has randomly affected me at the most peaceful and impractical times. I feel like I‚Äôm not really living like I once was. Recently during all this I thought I found the one but it hasn‚Äôt worked out, ever since we stopped talking I haven‚Äôt really had anything ‚Äúhuge‚Äù weighing on my mind so I should be alright? It hasn‚Äôt exactly worked out that way.

Unless I‚Äôm in the depths of one of my many existential crises I can‚Äôt really explain it, just that as far as I know I think I lack purpose; like I‚Äôm living in purgatory until I find out if I‚Äôve gotten into uni in 2 months. I don‚Äôt like to drink because I get very emotional and aggressive and lonely moments feel like torture. Ive realised many of the people around me cope with the 9-5 way of living and it doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. 

I started smoking rollies as a thing to do but I‚Äôm not addicted funnily enough, it‚Äôs literally just a past time. The lack of movement in my life really stresses me out and honestly I hate the summer. Ever since my last exam at college when I realised I had 3 months off I‚Äôve just crashed. I know I should probably see a doctor of some kind but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll rely on pills to achieve nirvana instead of the power I once held within.

I have creative outlets like photography but even committing to this feels empty and a waste of my seemingly infinite time. The training wheels have come off my life and I‚Äôve realised something. All these years (I know I‚Äôm only 17 but I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm extremely mature for my age) everything has been planned and set for me. I feel like an even younger kid in a planet wide sandbox whose parents just said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre on your own bud‚Äù. Basically the happiness and fulfilment I once held has vanished and now I just... exist? I work, I see friends, I‚Äôm getting over my ex, I smoke and I masturbate. I‚Äôm literally the same as everyone else my age and yet I feel empty and that I‚Äôm wasting my time.

If I quit my job then what would I do? If I stopped smoking tobacco, wacky or otherwise then what? I‚Äôm just here drifting along in a never ending waiting period as I transition into an adult very slowly. I used to live with passion but I suppose adulthood isn‚Äôt always easy. I wish I felt different because my peers, some of which are working full time, others are young parents all cope a lot better than me. I had my first suicidal thought when she told me she didn‚Äôt like me that way anymore and that feeling of life I had around her hasn‚Äôt come back as I try to live without a close relationship anymore.

No matter who I surround myself with or how many stories I hear of similar experiences I still feel alone. I don‚Äôt like it one bit.

I‚Äôd include a tl;dr but I need to get to work and to really understand how I feel it‚Äôs probably easier if you just read the whole thing. Have s great day everyone!",24Jul2018,1

40,"I made a party this saturday at my house, I invited my closest friends, my brother and a girl I was dating. My relation with that woman wasn't anything serious, we just dated 2 times and I only kissed her once. The plan was to hang out at my place 2 or 3 hours and then we would go to a bar. There is this guy that has been my friend since forever. He is sometimes a weird fellow, he does shitty things all the time. Lets just call him ""K"". The others usually forgive him. I never had any beef with him because he never did his shit to me until this saturday.

The night started smooth, nothing really happened. The only thing shitty that happened is that K got drunk and puked in my living room. I can forgive that because that was beyond his control, he was drunk after all. He asked me to forgive him and I did. Honestly I wasnt angry about that.

We went to the bar to meet with some other friends, which I didn't invite to my house because they aren't close to me. We decided to buy some whiskey in a group of 5, including K, my brother and the girl I was dating. K took the lead and divided the money we would pay each.   I'm going to use the national coin of my country, because in dollars it doesn't seem like a lot of money. We bought the whiskey, which costed 120 soles (around 40 dollars). I was a little drunk so it took me a couple of mins to realize K was trying to rob us. He told us we had to pay 12 soles each to pay for the bottle, which is obviously a lie, it should be 24 soles each. The idea was to give our 12 soles to my brother, because he had 100 soles and no way of dividing it. K started collecting the money. I gave him 20 soles and he gave me my change. Another friend gave my brother directly the 12 soles. K never gave my part to my brother and he also took my date's money. My brother was very drunk so he didn't notice there was a lot of money missing until I pointed it out. He only remembered only one giving the money because he never received my part, K's part and my date's part. K started playing dumb, like he had no idea what was going on. K tried to turn my brother against me, he told him I didnt give my share. My brother started yelling me, I explained that I did pay and that I gave it to K, and that I would pay the other 12 soles paying for the taxi. He didn't believe me and kept saying I had to pay. After an intense argument I just got tired. I turned around and told K to cut the bullshit or else I will require to a violent solution. He gave my share to my brother after that threat. There was still 34 soles missing after a long argument, and K offered to pay my brother tomorrow because he didnt have any money left.

So, we kept drinking and tried to have fun after that problematic situation. After some minutes I went to the bathroom and I found an old friend so I got distracted talking with him. When I came back K was kissing my date. I was  more sad than angry so I left the bar and went for a cigarette to clear my mind before taking action. I wanted to go home so bad but my brother was really drunk and I had to take care of him. I went back to the bar and luckily my brother wanted to leave. I left with my brother and another friend. I didnt even look back at K nor the girl. K left the bar and tried to talk to me before taking the taxi. I just ignored him and left. The day after he messaged me asking me to foegive him, I didnt respond. It is funny, he feels sorry about how the night ended yet he is going to pay the remaining 34 soles in alcohol the next meeting we have. My brother can be soft and naive sometimes, K took advantage of that and convinced my brother to pay his debt in those terms. 

 I'm writing this to get all my feelings towards the situation out. I couldn't care less about that woman at this point, what is pissing me off is the lack of respect he has for me, trying to rob me (and succeeded in robbing my brother), and kissing that girl. As a very proud individual, I felt very humilliated with his action and as someone with a deep appreciation for friendship it hit me really hard. I'm convinced in ending my friendship with him. The only advice I would ask for is if I should step in and make him pay my brother or convince my brother to take action.

Since that night scenes from the movie have played in my head everyday. Some days it is worse than others. I don‚Äôt usually think about it long but it is the volume of the thoughts that bothers me. This has gone on for a month but almost completely stopped when I have been on various trips throughout the summer. The previous summer I had a similar problem to this except it was I was thinking about a time I was bullied. When that happened I stopped it by moving on and looking at things differently. This time that isn‚Äôt working because the source of my problem is something that isn‚Äôt even fucking real, it is a work of fiction. This makes me feel worse about it because it was only 90 minutes of my life. I want this to end now so I can fully enjoy my experiences throughout the rest of this summer.

So last week my best friend's girlfriend broke up with him after 3 years. He was devastated and rang me straight after. Since then I've contacted him everyday and we've been hanging out a lot to keep his mind off it (tonight we're going to the cinema).

Anyways, yesterday was his first time to meet and talk with his ex since the split. And from my personal experience I knew this was a really vulnerable time. People make the mistake of giving the relationship another go when it is clear it should and has ended, or they say it is only a temporary break because their emotions are running high.

I let my friend know my thoughts  and just told him to be resolute in what he wanted the outcome to be.

He called me right after their 2 hour conversation and told me that although he cried more than he ever had in his life that their conversation went the best it possibly could have. Him and his ex are adamant to still be friends but will never be in a relationship again.

After hearing this and the way he spoke about it just made me feel really proud of him. I think he'll be alright. Thanks for listening Reddit.",24Jul2018,3
48,"I‚Äôm sick.
I have a terminal illness that I can push away and keep pushing away but one day, it could be today it could be 40 years down the road this illness will eat me from the inside and I will die.
Some days i barely notice it but other days its so painful and intense that is makes me want to curl up on the ground and just scream.
This sickness is like a rot, slowly taking over all the areas of my life until everything I experience is bland and dull, until everything is void of anything, until a mural is colourless and grey, until all the lines blur and fade together into nothingness.

53,"Let me open this by saying I never intended to get my brother back. This story is all a part of my pursuit for happiness. He was a complete asshole that made my childhood awful but I was content; we were friends past 16 and he was pretty cool and respectful to me after that.

So, I need to go back about a year to tell this story

Means by brother go to the same college. Last year, he used Tinder A LOT. I go to small house party at his place one night and he's got a girl I haven't seen before, but that was pretty typical for him.

They ended up dating for all of 2 weeks. After they broke up, me and her hung out a few times, pretty much just smoking weed. She made it very clear that she wasn't romantically interested in me in any way and I was fine with that; she was cool so I figured can't hurt to have another friend.

So I'm at a frat party one night and I am very drunk, not blackout but I was probably getting close. We ended up talking, getting very flirty. Ended up going back to her place that night and having sex. We ended up hanging out a lot, mostly weed, sex and Netflix, in that order. We weren't official, but we did agree to be exclusive. 

I get a text from my brother one night, and he also sent one to her because he saw me on her snapstory at a party. Apparently he wants her back.

We shit talk my brother (I love him, but he can be a piece of shit. Cheated on a few girlfriends, pretty much didn't respect women at all. That kind of thing) and she says there's no way she'd go back.

Fast forward a week, she comes over to my place to ""talk"". Apparently she's going back to him... I was confused and sad but oh well.

We eventually told him what happened. Me and her think it's hilarious. It bothers him but he wasn't angry.

And now they're engaged. And that's my favorite story from college",24Jul2018,4

Ive just graduated and completed my internship which was a great experience, now im currently job searching which is going quite interesting.

Went through 3 interview stages, including 50+ others, to find out I was mislead with the job description.

Anyhow, my long-term goal is to permanently (Acquire a PR) live in Australia, this is not just a random dream, my entire family lives there and I have been visiting annually since I was a child.

Now the most important part.. I hate the corporate life and never want to work in the field long-term my ONLY motivation is because its a ""reputable job"" which I can possible use to assist me in acquiring a PR in Australia. 

And the biggest factor with that is experience and learning, which is why I am not settling with a job for its wage, but rather the type of work I will be performing. I want to learn as much as possible in the next 2 years so that I can be confident with my skills, enough to apply for jobs Australia as a Marketer.

They found me another school to go to in 2016 that was a great school but I was still having some difficulty focusing and my mother wanted me to be on adderall for my attention issues my father was totally opposed to so they went to court and spent tons of money arguing about it, they also went to court about visitation times, that‚Äôs because I dislike my father very much (99% of the people he is around dislike him, he‚Äôs a typical narcissist) and I told my mother I didn‚Äôt want to
Go with him anymore. but skip ahead to 17-18 the worst thing could have ever happened to me happened to me, my parents after 6 years of divorce decide to give it another try, I couldn‚Äôt imagine this happening to me in 1,000 years and my mother knows I dislike this, I would give anything for this to go away.

And what makes this all worst is that my mother will stop talking to my dad for maybe 1 week or so at a time and then she says stuff like ‚Äúoh he won‚Äôt ever be back here‚Äù and he always comes back, it‚Äôs a nightmare because he sleeps in my bed with his kid (my half brother) and I have to sleep on the couch even though my dad has his own apartment right up the street he can go to but chooses to stay here. idk what to do I‚Äôm 17 and I can‚Äôt move until I‚Äôm 18 I‚Äôve thought about getting a job and trying to get emancipated but my dads rich and he has tons of money for lawyers which he can use against me, and plus they keep me from getting A job on purpose so they can keep control over me. This is the worst year of my life literally and I‚Äôve had some bad fucking years nothing will ever top this.

60,"I‚Äôm M19 and I‚Äôve always had some body image issues. But my biggest insecurity has been my not so perfect teeth. They aren‚Äôt that bad, just lots of spacing. Now, at 19, I can finally afford braces. But I found out I have a disorder in which the last 2 of my baby teeth, second to back, are fused to the bone of my jaw, and must be removed. I was given a choice, use the braces to push forward my back teeth to close the gap, or get implants. The push forward method will mean I‚Äôll have my braces on for 2 and 1/2 years, whereas implants will mean keeping them on for  only 1 and 1/2. This feels like the worst outcome. I spent my entire life insecure about this one thing, and now it‚Äôs going to stay that way until I‚Äôm nearly 22. I just keep thinking ‚Äúwhat girl is gonna give the 21 year old with braces a chance?‚Äù This feels like a mess.",24Jul2018,2

Hyena: Absolutely disgusting, one of the worst things he said he's ever tasted.

Baboon: Terrible, and when you eat baboon meat it has some weird juice that comes out that is slimy and not good. He doesn't speak the best English so I'm not sure if he said he ate it's brain or if the juice was like the juice that comes out when you're eating animal brains, either one of those two.

Turtle: One of his favourite meats of all times, says it tastes like fish. Wishes he could try it again.

Snake: Said it was decent and tasted like fish too.

Badger: Tough and hard to eat.

All that I remember about the gifs is that it was in a room when all of the sudden the ceiling collapses due to a bug nest above it flooding the room with thousands of insects.

64,When we broke up I had a hard time getting over her. Used to think about her everyday for almost a year but then I just sort of stopped. I‚Äôve seriously dated 2 people since. One who I was in love with. But even so I never put in the same sort of effort with this girl than I did with my ex. I can‚Äôt figure out if I‚Äôm actually over her or not.

65,"It‚Äôs not even a bad trait or a negative quality imo. Trust me I hate myself for a lot of reasons but not because I‚Äôm short. 

Tall men usually assume I have trouble getting women. These are the men who usually don‚Äôt know how to talk to women and have trouble getting laid themselves. I do fine in that department; don‚Äôt inflict your insecurities upon me just because you think my height is inferior.

Pretty much the only downside to being short is that I can‚Äôt reach the top shelf in most places, and sometimes at Walmart i have to embarrassingly ask an employee to reach something for me.

68,"I've started seeing a therapist that I don't think is going to turn out to be too helpful, but I'm giving it a shot. Today she suggested that the reason why I don't try harder at things is because I'm afraid. 

Well, maybe I am. Not of failure, but of success. My friend's recent job change is the perfect example of this:

She wanted to leave her job and get a job as something else. She applied for that one job and within a month, she got it.

It's the worst job she ever had. 

So this is what I'm afraid of. That whatever it is that I really want I'm going to get, and it's going to be a disaster. The way my life has gone, I see no reason to believe that it will ever be different. So I think being afraid makes perfect sense. 

You say, well, next time, be more careful about noticing red flags. Except if you've never been in that situation before you might not recognize what the red flags are before they happen. Or maybe they don't seem so bad, you think you can handle it. 

This is why I can't be motivated by the hopes of change or happiness, I can only be motivated by anger. Anger is so irrational that it overwhelms my brain telling me that it's not going to work out well - just stick with what you know. ",24Jul2018,1
69,"(Some background information before I get started...I am 18 years old, male and from Austria.)

I feel like my life has been a waste up until this point. I have missed so many things. I never had many friends. I never went on vacation. I never had a girlfriend. I never kissed a girl. I am a virgin.

I come from a poor family, but I don't blame my life circumstances, surroundings and parents for everything in my life. It plays part in it, but I think most of what went wrong in my life is my fault.

I have missed a lot of days in school. I even missed most of kindergarten. I am not exactly a very social person. I was always the kid who was absent. I always felt like I didn't belong anywhere, that I was unwanted and that I'd be better off staying at home doing things that would be more fun than being in school with people who didn't like me and learning stuff that I would never use in my life. I think I should have sucked it up and went to school. I have talked about this with one of my teachers. He said I probably missed more bad stuff than good stuff. I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not. Who knows?

After I dropped out of highschool I stayed at home for a year and by the end of it I wanted to kill myself. I have had suicidal thoughts since I was a child. After I decided against it, I consulted a therapist (for free because of my financial situation) and then I visited a course for young people who are unemployed and looking for a job or apprenticeship. I got an apprenticeship within the first 2 weeks of being there in December of 2017, when things weren't looking great on the job front. I am a warehouse logistician apprentice at a company that specializes in furniture and household appliances.

To be honest, things have been looking up for me since I got the apprenticeship. More money to support my family and hobbies (I even bought myself equipment for a homegym in our basement). I went to my first party during vocational school and I had a great time. I also did fairly well in vocational school...which some of my colleagues were surprised about because they think I'm stupid. I guess I can't blame them though.

I don't know how to move forward in my life and how to catch up on the experiences I have missed. I very rarely took the initiative and did things on my own. Up until this point I have always kind of let stuff happen. I am afraid of many things. The future, people, money.

Now that I have this off my chest...thank you for reading. I tend to keep things like this to myself. I don't even post it or talk to people on the internet about it.",24Jul2018,1

71,"Agree / disagree? 

Anyway, I just watched this one hour film (sure felt like it was longer) about a coming of age gay couple (it's called Doukyuusei) and I'm female. I've also sort of loved watching two guys fall in love. Is that because of the fact that I find guys attractive so seeing two guys fall for each other be even more attractive? But what does that mean when say I start to _want_ to be a guy just so I can flirt and date other guys... As a guy. Not as a girl. 

I've been a pretty girly girl from childhood but somewhere around adolescence I've started wanting to be a guy just because there seems to be a lot less prejudice (?) or at least from my view which is probably false but it just seems like a far more comfortable gender to _be_ than the current female gender I'm occupied as. Or maybe it's because most same genders assume you're not attracted to them because duh you're the same gender and general familiarity of being of the same sex but also being able to just surprise people that you're gay seems/sounds fun. ... Also sort of the reason why I'm conflicted to my own gender. It's daunting, I guess. Most of my guy friends tend to somehow dissolve into thinking I had a crush on them and when it's discovered that I don't they sort of aren't my friends anymore? 

Am I gender fluid lmao because I don't mind being girly but sometimes I wish I was male just for those nuances or maybe it's because I find the male body attractive I'd like to be male but if I did become male I'd find the female body attractive (but I already do find the female body attractive, I think I just want to have  the option of slipping into a guy body or something) and vice versa and it's confusing and fuck labels why am I trying to label myself fuck I feel like I'm just being silly and getting hung up on this but like 

I think it'd be fun to be the opposite gender which means I'm just fucking around and this isn't that big of an issue but fuck it this is r/self I can sound narcissistic and not get murdered but I'm an asshole by default so whatdoidowithmyself 

I should probably sleep but I slept at 8pm and woke up at 12.30am and woke up in between because fuck housemates shut up and cat, you're like a heater stop that. I woke up in a cold sweat and life, leave me alone for a moment please. ",24Jul2018,3
72,"Recently, I've found a deep love for myself. Through self exploration, I've uncovered what I like to call: sexy independence. No longer am I doubting my physical appearance or feeling ashamed for how I look.

So, what exactly does it mean? Basically, I've identified it as someone who carries an abundance of confidence and assuredness of their self. Everyone can own their sexy independence.

I want to spread the word of sexy independence around the globe. We'll call ourselves 'Sexy Independent Individuals"". How's that sound? If you stand for confidence, honesty, courage and determination, then you're already there! Together, we'll show the media and all the haters that we're sexy. No matter our size, appearance or personality, we deserve to feel sexy in our own skin.

It's time to share what makes us #sexyindependent

I'd love to hear your feedback on this!
