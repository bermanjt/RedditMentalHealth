1,"It kind of made me forget all the stressful stuff in my life right now, and also made me realize how funny and weird kids are. The stuff I said in online forums just 10 years ago are so innocent and random.  Sometimes I think we tend to forget that when we go online. I do it all the time with Reddit. For some reason it always escapes me that there's a good chance I'm talking to a 15 year old kid half the time. Some of my old ""spots"" were the game maker forums, old school runescape forums, the places where I wrote my fanfiction...

2,I’m a pretty shy person who keeps to herself. I just want to stop being a passive person and start speaking up for myself. I’m afraid of people rejecting my opinions. I try not to care but I can’t help it. How can I be more assertive?,18Sep2018,2
3,"So, I’m 22 and so hopefully I have many healthy years ahead of me. However, for no reason in particular, last night I was lying in bed and suddenly had a crisis over my mortality. Obviously, we all know we’re going to die one day, but in that moment it really hit me like “holy shit. I’m going to die some day. One of these days, I’m going to die and all the cool stuff I take for granted is going to end.” I suffer from anxiety and depressive episodes, and in my darkest times I’ve definitely experienced the feeling of wishing I could just go to sleep and never wake up, but I’ve never seriously thought about the actual act of killing myself. I suppose when it comes down to it, I’d still much rather manage to make a success of this whole life thing than just throw in the towel. One thing I feel I can say for certain is that I want this time when I can still do the things I want to do to span as much time as possible and honestly, the idea of that time ending scares me.

So, then, I go on Facebook this evening, and I see that this guy I knew when we were teenagers who was a year or two younger than me was killed in an accident. I was never amazing friends with him and we didn’t stay in touch, but it seems so fucking crazy to me. The fact that these two things have fallen in this tiny timeframe has kinda thrown me for a loop. The idea of life and mortality just seems so tangible at the moment and yet at the same time, incomprehensible. I don’t know what to think.",18Sep2018,2

6,"It's scary shit. Talking about ""this is my future"" and she rejected a guy just today because ""I already have a man.""

So this man .. she probably hung out with him in the summer like once a week. He kept flirting with her and eventually a month later she told him she likes him. His response? That he's not sure whether he likes her or not. She got mad at him for playing with her feelings and told him not to flirt with her if he doesn't like her. I advised her to be dry with him a while, maybe give him some time to figure things out, and she did - for 2 days. Then back to normal, back to usual flirting.

I remember telling her that she's an idiot for giving in too fast, to which she told me ""but this is my future!"" I told her that _he_ doesn't have to be her future, that her future can be someone who actually knows they like her. She said ""but I like him .. I wanna get married to him."" And I told her again, she will like other people in life, and she cant be saying she wants to marry someone when she's only been talking to him for a couple months. But I told her it's ultimately her choice and she can do what she feels is right, but to just think about it more deeply. 

Oh and before anyone says I'm too involved on her affairs, she's the one who made it that way lol. I.e. she tells me everything and goes to me for help/advice a lot.

Today someone asked her out and she rejected him. I asked her why, and she said ""because I already have a man."" I told her that she's not in a committed relationship and that she doesn't have to close her doors. She says in a joking way: ""shhhh... yes I am.""

Here she is waiting for a guy, ruining her chances of possibly being with other guys, for someone that isn't even sure he likes her. 

It just pisses me off so much that she's doing this.",18Sep2018,2

8,"So let’s get this out of the way, I focus on school a lot and I never go out due to a fairly strict parent, living far from friends, and I’m sort of anti social in general. I’m sure if I tried more I could go out more but I never see the point. 

Especially on “school nights” I never really leave my house once I get home after school and have to sit in the basement for the rest of the day/night due to no other room having available office or workroom space. I’m not really complaining about that, but it can get depressing and people have literally said things like “isnt it depressing being stuck down there” and honestly it kinda is. 

Anyways today I especially haven’t been feeling all that good due to an issue I haven’t really let out to anyone for a couple weeks now and on top of that school stress as I’m sure most people know. I didn’t expect anything to be any different to happen until my dad asked me to go to the library after dinner.

Something as simple as going to the library. I did work there for two hours but just that public setting and seeing random people with a wide open space; I don’t want to say it was a new experience but a refreshing one. After that we drove around the area with the windows down and I could just relax and think about nothing. I still haven’t forgot about everything bothering me before but after the fact it feels like this was something I really needed. 

I feel like I sound so dumb (idk another word) saying this but it really surprises me that this happened on a “school night” of all things too. I was raised to never do anything during the week because there was/is “school the next day” and this just is an odd yet pleasant experience. 

I hope maybe some of you can relate or something, I don’t know why exactly I felt the need to share but I just did. Thanks for listening.

9,"Dont know if anyone can relate to this but I always compare myself to my freinds. Especially my best friend. I envy his life. All my friends (3 main freinds) have girl friends, they all have cars, they all get invited to things, they all have lost their virginity. And I'm the odd one out. I dont have any of those things, other than my virginity, I have that.

My best friend has a really hot gf that I've been crushing on for the 3 years they've been dating. That's why I envy him so much. They look so happy together. I want to be happy like them but I have nobody. I have to rely on my 3 main friends to hang out with because I have nobody else when they have multiple people they can go to other than me. 

I get so God damn jealous whenever my best friend says hes going over to his GF's instead of playing xbox with me. I'm not that much of a nerd. I have a part time job and play xbox once in awhile. I didnt have time to play at all this week. My best freind literally told me to go online and I was waiting for him and asked where he was and said that his gf invited him over.

He always tells me how his gf sucks him off whenever he goes over so when I heard he didnt go online becuase of that I felt really jealous and sad at the same time. I always think to myself how pathetic I am, I've never had my first kiss, never lost my virigintiy, never been loved and have to mastrubate myself while my friends don't have to. Fucking pisses me off. Why is my life so pathetic. 
My friend literally just snapchated me of him playing basketball at a park with someone when I didn't get an invite. Every one of my friends lives seem so much more interesting then mine. 

I've had depression before. It gets really bad late December early January and usually lasts until February. I've told my best friend before and he just jokes about it. I can't blame him becuase I used to joke about it until I got it and knew what it was like. Him making fun of it just proves hes never had it before becuase hes happy. 

I know I shouldn't compare myself to others but damm, when everybody you know around you has the same thing, it's hard not to. Fuck. Anyway. Theres my rant. Feel free to respond in my dm's has that can stay between us.",18Sep2018,1
10,"I was born to my mother in high school. My real father left me when I was just a year old, and I've only seen him since 2 times, once when i was 6 and once when i was 16, and im now 18. I just recently started my first year of university, and life is going good. 

However, my mother just called me earlier today to inform me he died in a shootout with the police. Apparently the reason he left me when I was younger was not because he didnt want me, like ive somewhat thought my whole life, but because he had heavy drug, crime, and addiction issues he didnt want to involve me with. 

My mom told me how he called her a few times every year to ask what was new with my life, and how I was doing. The last time she spoke to him she had told him how i was accepted into university, and am planning on going into law and he was super proud of me. 

But now hes dead and i never got the chance to meet him, or even have a chance at a relationship with him. And i have no clue how to feel right now. Anyone ever had a similar situation that would be willing to help?",18Sep2018,1
11,"I was driving home and got a message on my phone. I looked down at it for just a couple seconds, looked back up, and the cars in the lane to my left had slowed near to a stop. The car in front of me had slowed a bit but I had a ton of distance between us and I didn't come close to crashing.

But I immediately imagined what would have happened had the car in front of me stopped completely too. If I had looked at my phone for just a big longer, and they had slowed down just a bit more, I would have slammed into the back of it going 70 miles per hour. I keep imaging what that feeling would be. It'd be so sudden. I'd be in instant pain if not killed immediately. At the least my life would be forever changed. And the thought was just so vivid and realistic in my head. I could just imagine exactly what it would feel like.

It damn near gave me an anxiety attack going home. I got off the highway and took backroads the rest of the way home. And since being home the thought keeps popping in my head and it keeps just scaring the hell out of me.

I've never experienced something like this. Such a vivid and scary memory that I feel like is affecting me this much. It's given me such an uneasy uncomfortable feeling all night.

It's probably a really good thing. I don't think I'm ever going to look at my phone again while driving. It was ridiculously dumb in the first place. ",18Sep2018,4

I live with my disabled mother, my disabled dog, and my aunts. I've lived with them my whole life and they (save for the dog of course) have been emotionally and at times physically abusive to me. When I turned 18, however I didn't move out. I went to college (far, far away). But I had some bad experiences that sent me into deep depression and very suicidal. I returned home and fought my hardest out of that depression. In the last year or so I've saved enough money to move out and cover rent for a very cheap place for about a year. I've also just got my first stable job that my family doesn't know about. I'm ready to move out and I plan to take my dog with me.

I worry about finding a dog-friendly place that's within my budget and accommodating for me and my 12 year old dog with hip dysplasia. My family also never cared for him so his general health is very poor (fleas, skin rashes, etc). I also plan to take him to the vet regularly.

16,"So last year, I was talking to a girl on PlayStation. I was on FaceTime with her one night, and my parents came in and took my phone (I was supposed to be in bed). A couple days later, she wanted to masturbate with me on skype and I said mean things because she gets around. Nobody ever said no to her so it hurt her to hear me say it in the way I did. My parents are kind of like conspiracy theorist types; if I got into trouble with my phone and they found out about what happened then they would look through my phone and never trust me on my PlayStation again (they already don’t very much). Tonight, I was talking with my parents about grades and stuff, we talked for a while and then we got into that call from last year. Some how all of my brain cells evacuated and I told the entire story. My parents were saying “oh my god” and stuff while laughing in a shocked kind of way. I did explain that it was the first and only time that has happened in my 10 years of being on PlayStation and video game platforms in general.

17,"I'm a guy in my early 30s.  I've been in therapy a decent amount.  I hadn't been in a while, felt the need and went.  Was hoping to get a guy but they don't let you choose, which is fine.  Got a therapist probably in her late 30s, really attractive.  She was wearing those sockless black shoe things (I always forget the name but it exposes the top of the foot and then with her jeans she had a decent amount of ankle showing), I was trying not to look but every now and then I did and then I'd look away as soon as I caught myself, I only looked four or five times though.  By the end of the session I was feeling pretty aroused (I was wearing sweat pants and I knew a bit of an erection would have been showing), and caught myself just looking into her throat a few times while she was making eye contact with me and talking (I had lost most focus at this point) so she definitely noticed.  At the end when we walked out she went in front of me, the way the hall is situated there was no window or anything who could see it was just me behind here.  As she's slow walking in front of me (that thing women do to really make their hips work the jeans), she ends up reaching around back with one hand to slightly pull up the back of her shirt, and then she uses her other to reach in and adjust the strap of her underwear a bit.  Green lace.  When we got to the front (in front of two other people in the waiting room and the receptionist), she starts doing the wrapup ""Good to see if you need to come back..."" thing, I'm not even looking at her face anymore I'm just hard staring at her tonsils.  She shakes my hand and then slowly slides her middle and ring finger against my palm as she's drawing her hand out.  Then when she's turning to head back to her office she slowly goes from looking into my eyes to looking down at my crotch, she does a FLINCH of a smile, and walks away (not doing the slowwalk anymore).

I know she probably does it all the time, but good lord.

19,"This is going to be a long post and probably won’t be well-written. I feel like i need to share this. This is solely my experience with a harmful substance. 

I’m going to clarify what i mean by drugs before i continue this post. I don’t mean weed- i mean any drug that adds a risk to your life every time you take it. I do believe that weed enables laziness in a lot of individuals, but plenty of people know how to use it responsibly. And i’m sure it’s obvious that i’m not talking about prescribed drugs. 

I won’t get into too much detail, but about 4 nights ago I took two illegal drugs in the same night. One was weed- i’ve done weed multiple times. No big deal. This other drug however was something i’ve never done before and i’ll never do it again. It is called a “Popper” and i’m pretty sure it’s a “sex” drug. At the time, i thought it was a gas and that it would just give me a trip like acid does or whatever. Well, within a few seconds of inhaling the “popper”, I feinted for a few seconds. Apparently i was also shaking as i passed out. I woke back up. I wanted to leave this next detail out but i feel like it would contribute to this description. I was having sex while doing these drugs; the reason this is important is because when i have sex, it usually lasts 30-50 mins at the most for me. Never abnormally long. However, this drug had my sexual endurance boosted absurdly long. I think i started having sex around 2am and i remember we stopped somewhere around 8am. How is that even possible? It still boggles my mind. The drug was like i was moving swiftly thru time. 

I tried to sleep for about 4 hours. I couldn’t sleep. I maybe got about an hour of sleep at the most while laying there with my eyes closed. My body wasn’t hyper, my soul was. My mind was racing. My conscious was springing everywhere. I got up, had a quickie, and as i got dressed to leave this persons house i noticed i felt very dizzy and light headed. It was hard to stand. It felt very weird to be alive- it was like i didn’t follow the rules of being confined to time. 

Luckily, my house was only six minutes away and i only had to drive on neighborhood roads. I drove home. I was two minutes away from home and my arms began going numb and started to tingle. i pulled over, tried to get my shit together, and got home. I rushed into my house and went into my dark room and just say on the bed. My whole body was going numb, i was shaking, light-headed, my heart felt like it could’ve exploded at any moment. I really didn’t want to call 911, but i thought about people dying from drugs and thought about how that could be me if i didn’t get help. My mom was asleep, siblings were at school, and dad was at work (i’m a 19M btw) so i was able to call the ambulance and have them pick me up without anyone finding out. i didn’t want my parents to know i did drugs because they always look at me as their most responsible child. 

I remember being in the ambulance and one of the medics flashed a light in my eye. He said “Ah, i see.” I asked him what was wrong with my eyes and he said they were dilated. I also remember him having a normal conversation with me but i had so much trouble understanding what he was talking about and formulating coherent responses to his statements. It felt difficult just to carry a normal conversation with someone. 

I got to the hospital, got lectured by so many staff members, etc. Got diagnosed with drug overdose. I still remember the doctor saying “Don’t do drugs. Because handsome young men like you always take a drug and then end up dead or taken advantage of. You’re very lucky.” It kindve struck me that what i did was worse than i thought. She really just told me i could’ve died. My heart beat was beating very fast and they basically had to lower it to avoid me from having a heart attack. Luckily, i got to go home after about 4-5 hours. I was still light headed but i called uber with 11% battery and i got home. 

Shortly after i got home, i felt as if it was hard to breathe. It was about 5 and i just started to panick more and more because it felt like my tongue or my throat was swelling up. Dad was at work, siblings were with my mom. Called the ambulance and they basically told me that i am probably just experiencing symptoms of the amphetamine i took. i said fuck it, i’ll take their word for it because i don’t want to get a huge medical bill. 

As i got out of the ambulance my mom saw me and i came up with a lie on the spot. I said “i thought my tongue was swelling but they said i just had a fever and basically told me to drink lots of water.” My mom seemed sketchy but she had me take dayquil and set up a fan in my room. Shortly after, it was getting extra hard to breathe again. This time, it was worse. I told my mom the truth, she wasn’t mad at all, she took me to the hospital. This time, i got more lectures about why i should stay away from drugs, they diagnosed me as having an allergic reaction to the amphetamine and gave me prescriptions l. Got them the next day and besides having a little trouble breathing, everything was fine that whole day. I had a little trouble sleeping prior, but i ended up falling asleep and woke up the next day. the next day, i felt fine. However, it began getting hard to breathe again. It was so annoying. My family weren’t home so i called 911 again because i felt like my throat was swelling up really fast. 

They sent me to the hospital, said my medication was dehydrating me, gave me more lectures, diagnosed me with anxiety, called poison control, found out the popper was laced, and i got sent home. Felt like it was a little hard to breathe for the rest of the night but as i drank more water and flushed all the medication out of my system, i felt back to normal. 

Now, here i am today. No medications. No trouble breathing. No dizziness. No symptoms. I just really regret doing that drug. Because all that drug did for me was put me behind in school, disappoint my parents, make me feel like shit, probably give me a huge medical bill, and risk my life. This post is mostly just venting, but hear me out on one thing. Drugs aren’t for everyone. If you don’t need them, don’t take them. I promise you do not want to go down that road; i damn sure don’t.

25,"Keep thinking about posting then typing and not posting so might as well post the dumb pointless thing and get it over with.

Had to get a mouthpiece made.  I went in for this (if it matters I'm a 32M) and the dentist (looks early 40s) that did it for me was the one that ran the practice, she did the moldings fittings etc.  When she first walked in I had been kind of daydreaming/unfocused and I ended up giving her one of those quick (&lt;1 sec) eye scans, I had been looking at the floor so it was this quick drag from her ankle to eye contact.  Very attractive.

I go in for second visit to pick up.  The office was pretty quiet, in the room for the fitting, it was just me and her. 
She comments on how tall I am a few times and says how fit I am (I'm not really, it's the tall + metabolism thing). 
 Near the end of this appointment she leaves for maybe half a minute, then comes back with her hair pulled back (it had been down before she briefly left), her pant legs had been folded up a good amount to show off her ankles (prior to her brief exit they were covered), and she had undone the top two buttons on her shirt (which I didn't stare or glance but prior it was obviously buttoned, easy to still notice while making eye contact). She does a bit more checking the fit of my mouthpiece, tells me since she did the fitting and ""knows the piece"" if I ever need alterations to the fit (which she said is common during initial usage), I would need to see her.  Then her tone changed a bit (had a bit of music to it) and she looks at me and goes ""So... are you working, not working?""  We had just been hit with a hard unemployement wave and I know why she was asking, but I was confused, because on my sheet (the first thing she sees when booting up my profile) it says I'm on disability (I had recently been homeless BECAUSE of my disability, then came out of it BECAUSE I got accepted onto disability) and what for, very obvious so there aren't accidental chemical interactions PLUS so they know for insurance.  So I said I wasn't working, which was more than a little painful (again she is very attractive).  I genuinely saw her deflate a bit at this (mostly in her eyes), but after that it was a bit more of the routine professional chatter and I was on my way.

I had to make a third appointment less than a week later to get an alteration, it was fine at first but then I couldn't wear it without a lot of discomfort.  So I go back in for that, I see her there as a frontend staffmember is walking me to the chair, says the dentist will be right with me.  I end up waiting almost 45 minutes despite being on time, other staff members come in several times asking me if the dentist has popped in yet, I hear them chattering to each other about how they're looking for her and can't find her.  When she shows up she sits down and just sits there staring at me for a few moments.  Then she starts talking and at first it's fine but she starts getting really tense.  When she did the alteration I requested she had to turn her back to me to use the machine, and as soon as her back turns she is just shaking like CRAZY!  Then when she turned back around she gave me the mouthpiece to pop it and try (during the molding and fitting she was doing all of it).  At the end after I was raised back to sitting, she got up and she looked at my foot, like a solid stare at my right shoe, then her eyes traced up my leg and to my groin area.  And then she traced back down to my foot, gave me one of those dentist goodie bags and sent me on my way.",18Sep2018,0

Last week was my all time low - I spent a day sitting in the closet ready to hang myself while contemplating if I was ready or not. I haven't told anyone about this just because I'm embarrassed and don't want to cause any more worry than I already have.

That day was very odd... I woke up late with missed calls from my so, mother, and mother in law. They were all worried about me. It brought me back into reality and I don't think it was just a coincidence that they happened to all be worried and been trying to contact me on the day I had wanted to do it. I am not very religious but I believe there is a greater good, and maybe she was looking out for me.

Anywho, a series of events happened and all of the stress I had been dealing with alone had been shared. I don't enjoy sharing struggles and worries with people because it feels like a burden. But oh what a relief that was. I feel like such a heavy weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Everything is looking up and I am glad I was able to hit rock bottom since it could only get better. :)

I am getting help and I will be seeing a doctor later this week. I am visiting my mother and sister who live across the country later this week as well, and I am so so excited. I'm blessed enough to be in a financial situation where I can quit my job and focus on bettering my mental state. 

Obviously I will continue to have hard days, but this is the first time in a while I have motivation to do better. I've been feeling so much better, and I can't wait to see how counseling helps or even medication. It's only been a couple days but I am so happy. I hope this lasts. ",18Sep2018,42
30,"You cannot travel through time because time does not exist. It is merely a human construct designed to measure the physical state of the universe, and specifically our solar system. Time is not some extra dimension that we can't percieve yet.

&amp;#x200B;

It is, theoretically, possible to revert the planet back to a previous physical state, but any human constructs such as currency, stocks, buildings, businesses, etc. would still exist as they do presently. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, forward time travel is somewhat within the realm of possibility, as we have ways of calculating the future physical state of the earth rather accurately, but we certainly wouldn't see sudden leaps in technology or experience the apocalypse (unless we force the earth into the state it will be in shortly before its inevitable death, anyway). 

&amp;#x200B;

What you should take away from this, is not disappointment in the fact that we will never see sci-fi come to life in this way; but instead you should use this as an excuse to start living in the present. Don't dwell in the past, because it no longer exists in any capacity outside your memory, and don't dwell too hard on the future, because there's no set linear path anyone will take, and the only way to change the future, or even the present, is to act **now**.

31,"So back when I was in middle school (this was like a little less than 10 years ago), I remember that my parents fought pretty badly for some unknown reason. They didn't really tell me why, but it eventually got ""resolved."" Or at least that's what I thought. Well, yesterday I found out why.

Ever since I got dumped by my girlfriend a few years ago, I've been watching anime. As a weeb, I've been to a couple of anime conventions. Cosplaying was never my thing, but like 2 years ago, some friends of mine were able to convince me to cosplay as a revealing female character. (I am a guy) Since I'm kinda skinny so umm... even in my eyes the crossdress, well, kinda looked legit with the help of their makeup skills. And... I had to admit that it was a crazy experience that I'd never forget. But this experience was 100% out of curiousity and I know I am straight.

Things seemed like it was going back to normal.
Like a few months ago, I asked my Dad some files I needed. He gave me his USB and told me he put them in it.
Well guess what? While trying to find my files, I saw pictures of my Dad dressed as a woman. Well, it was... unusual since I never knew he did this ever before. But hey, everyone has their own kinky side so I just closed it and forgot about it. It is the 21st century after all and hell I even crossdressed before for fun. (But dang I am never gonna do that again cuz it was so embarrassing)

Two days ago, my mom some how figured out about my Dad's recent crossdressing. Turns out the reason why they fought so badly back when I was in my middle school was cuz of this. Back then, my Dad promised to not crossdress anymore, but he recently started again.

My mom is extremely conservative culture-wise. Even when all the rest of our family is cool with the LGBT community, she always insisted otherwise. She thought my Dad's crossdressing interests were all gone and now she found out it wasn't. I love both my parents. Yes, when I was a teen I fought a lot with my parents, but that all are good memories of mine now.

After knowing the truth, my mom didn't leave bed the whole day. She didn't eat or drink and just kept crying. My god damn older brother is busy playing World of Warcraft and my mom won't talk to my Dad. I had to come back from college.

So we're 1st generation immigrants. My mom had to quit her job to follow my Dad all the way to the US. She continuously wept that she's been used by my Dad and that she had been told lies for almost 10 years. If they get a divorce, my mom would be completely homeless in this, still, foreign country. I mean, yeah, probably my Dad would have to financially support her and stuff, but my Mom would be completely alone. She can't even get a job back in our home country.

As soon as I got back from college, I cooked her some porridge and insisted her to come eat with me. I talked with her about my recent crush and asked for advices (I would've never talked about this since I never share my love life. But hey my family is on the line.) Since its something I never told her before, despite being so depressed, she gave me advices: the advices I wanted to give her regarding Mom living with someone she can't trust. Turns out those advices could work both ways. I hope she understood why I talked about my personal life.

She still did stay in her room and cry for the rest of the day, but I think things are slightly getting better.
I honestly don't know how this is going to end. Only if my ""older"" brother can actually act like one and be the mediator since now I'm back in college...

But, honestly I'm in a position where I can't really be on a side. I don't want to be on a side. I get why both my Mom and Dad are sad. My Dad can't resist from crossdressing and my Mom wanted to marry a guy at the first place and now she's been cheated for 10 years.

Seriously though, Fuck I don't want a divorce. Suck it up and act like adults and live with it. Fuck you both. Every single human being are going through things in their lives and are trying to overcome it. Even all the redditors here have their own stories. All the kids in Africa go through tremendous things in life. And even I want to cut myself every single day. And you two, who were all lovey dovey, who lived together for almost 30 years, can't even come to a solution together? Not even for your two poor little kids? (I guess just for me cuz my brother is trash)

Honestly, I fucking hate you both. You guys are such a faker.

But yeah, for even anyone read the whole thing, thanks for staying. I just really wanted to let it out.",18Sep2018,1
32,"23, Female. 

Procrastination has been an issue of mine for as long as I can remember. The earliest memory is me not finishing my summer homework in elementary school. Looking back it was a fun assignment, a journal of my days in text and in drawing. I remember I scribbled up two days worth of entry into it a right before it was due. 

In school I rarely got any assignments in on time, if any made it in. I didn’t graduate HS and had to get a GED but went to CC and did really well. But I even procrastinated on my college applications. I did my essays last minute, but somehow got into all of the universities I applied to. I went to an accredit university but same problem again. I failed a lot of classes but eventually got a degree out of it.

The cycle is the same: I continue to put things off until time runs out and there is nothing I can do about it. Sometimes I start on it, then get distracted and never return. Other times I don’t even start.

Now I am job searching and even though a great opportunity comes my way, I let it go to waste due to my lack of motivation and procrastination. For example, I got a second interview with a great company and though I had 4 days to prepare for it, I didn’t do anything at all. I know it’s important, yet I can’t get my mind to truly grasp that and get it to work.

It’s strange, because I can have a day where I can focus and get a lot done, but those days are rare. I struggle with attention for sure, but procrastination/lack of motivation is a big thing that keeps me from even starting the work. How can I fix this? Has anyone overcome it?

I feel like I’ve been this way for so many years of my life and don’t know how I can overcome it. Please advice. I am tired of being this way and feeling disappointed in myself countless times only to repeat it again. 

Thanks for reading. ",18Sep2018,2
33,"I'm 30 and my sister who's 3 yrs older than passed away about three weeks ago. It's still very fresh and it hurts a lot. Nothing can make it go away it seems and it leads to a feeling of helplessness. I'm not thinking self harm at all, but it does make me want to just move on from the life I have and begin roaming, biking, and hiking the world with no formal home. The possessions I'm working for, the job I have, the isolation I live in just all feels wrong in ways that I feel I've pushed down as I've gotten older with responsibilities. But with my sister's passing it's the biggest reminder to simply live life. She didn't deserve to go, she was a genuinely great person and I had been so happy to have been slowly mending our relationship the last 8 years after a family drama filled falling out. About 2 years ago it started to finally feel like we were brother and sister again to be encapsulated in March at a basketball game she happened to be in town for and we just got to joke as brother and sister. Her husband wasn't there, her kids weren't there, it was just me and my sis for the first time in 15 years and I was genuinely so happy. I'm rambling and I don't know what I'm really going for.

34,"My parents (55, 56) and I (26) got to talking about how Nike sponsored Colin Kaepernick, despite his non-affiliation with a team in the NFL. Naturally, this conversation turned into whether a major televised event like an NFL game was an “appropriate” place to stage a political position.

I took the position that it might not have been appropriate per se, but what kind of protest is? To do it off the field would not have gotten the same level of exposure to these issues as another “appropriate” avenue, and that had so many prejudiced viewers not been so outraged—and the media so galvanizing and sensational—we might have had some decent discussions about systemized oppression and overly-militarized police force. It’s not like he knew that the football-watching US was gonna implode, and that millions of veterans would boycott the NFL. Obviously, he should feel responsible for the heavy monetary losses as a result, but not being signed after that seems like unnecessarily cruel, indirect punishment for speaking out. I kept my cool; in fact, I laid it as concise as what I just said here, pretty much word for word.

They came back like I’d just killed someone, elevated voices, exaggerated hand motions, pointing, eyeballs wide and flaming. I’m listening, nodding, arms by my side, like the way you’d listen to an angry customer. They had some fairly decent points actually, that teams already have their own social activist agendas and don’t have the bandwidth to take on another one, (and the most compelling of all: that had he been a better performing quarterback, he probably would have been picked up, but no one wants the trouble without the stats). But the way they said it, bile-spitting and all, I didn’t want to listen to them. It was so outrageous, I couldn’t take them seriously. I say, “You made some good points.” They just throw their hands up and walk away, “I give up, this is a stupid argument.” I mean, they’re the one that thinks it’s an argument. I was just talking.

Looking back, I can recall my own impulsion sometimes to become agitated like this during civil disagreements, and I’m certain that a history of this kind of “debate” (heated argument) in the home has conditioned me to behave this way. Or to just secluded myself from disagreements entirely, because of how I feel talking about anything that might incite controversy.

I feel like it has a lot to do with me rejecting their religious beliefs: they’re Mormon, I’m very not. I mean, obviously we have differing opinions, but, like, can’t we just have banter like civil people, without popping a blood vessel, or dismissing conversation because they get too excited by it?

TL;DR: I kept my cool in a fairly innocuous conversation about BLM, and my parents pounced down my throat. I didn’t object with their arguments, except that they were badgering me.

There were some I had to delete because the memories they brought were unwanted. But most others sent me straight down memory lane.

&amp;#x200B;

Just a few dozen icons with hastily-written filenames and probably even worse camera angles brought me back to the time I made cocktails for my family smiling to my ears, dug into a birthday cake with former friends I'd cut off, made churros in high school Spanish club, learned how to make a good fried rice, ate waffles with another friend I'd drifted from, had lunch with a parent before bigger, more serious fights happened, opened the chocolate cupcakes from the grandmother of a classmate who changed for the worse, compulsively bought tasty lunches and snacks when I worked an unfulfilling job, ordered sushi just to have an excuse to leave the house.

39,"I'm a 20 year old guy, and I think I might be slightly addicted to the internet, mainly the two sites I use most, YouTube and Reddit. 

I culled my subscriptions on YouTube recently to only quality content that I watch often, removing bloat, and using an adblocker (uBlock Origin for those wondering) to block the recommended feeds, and the entire homepage to just the search bar, account stuff, and the side bar. 

I culled the subreddits I'm subscribed to, down to just educational content, hobbies, interests, and news. However, I still feel so bloated for some reason, and I think it's the news. I feel stressed every time I come here, I never feel I have the whole picture, so overwhelmed that I end up not even reading the articles and sometimes just the comments and the title--how uninformed could I be? They say don't get your news from social media like Facebook or Twitter, well I don't really use those so I thought I was in the clear until I realized, I do exactly that with Reddit comments.

Fuck it, I don't want anymore half baked articles released 10 minutes after an event occurs, shit commentary from people without any expertise, and the possibility of those people not even being who they say they are. I'd rather get an article the next day from credible sources, without the bullshit commentary. 

I'm Canadian. I stress so much about American politics, I know more about what's happening in the US than I do my own country. I want to become more informed about what's happening in my own country and not through the now right-wing leaning /r/canada.

I don't want to close my eyes and ears to the news. If I want to hear about Trump, I don't want it to be though the lens of the average American. I want to be informed, especially on my own country's issues, to have my own opinions instead of repeating what others say in comment threads, and to be a better citizen.

41,"To those who don't know, Yom Kippur is Judaism's holiest day of the year. It's a 25 hour fast where Jews pray and beg God for forgiveness for the past year and for a beneficial judgment for the coming year. Even most secular Jews will fast on Yom Kippur, even if they do it while watching TV and playing Xbox. 

About myself, I came from a religious family, but left it nearly 15 years ago when I realized that I had too many questions and not enough answers. Since then I went to one extreme of eating a cheeseburger on Yom Kippur (eating on YK, cheeseburger isn't kosher, etc.) to mellowing out and slowly getting back in touch with Judaism, not as a religion, but more as a system of morals and a common tradition I and my wife and kids can share with the rest of my family, all who are still religious. My wife is Jewish (not religious) and mainly puts up with the things I do, but even she said that she doesn't think she wants to fast anymore.

And the thing is, I'm beginning to see her point of view. It's not as if throughout the rest of the year, I'm this amazing Jew that I can feel it's cool to hit up God with requests that he give me a good year and ignore everything I did in the past year. On the other hand, this is something I grew up with, and it's something I want to pass down to my kids as part of the tradition which I mentioned before.

I work 10x harder than all of these other naturally skinny girls in the gym. I don't even bother wearing nice gym outfits anymore because I'm literally drenched in sweat by the time I leave. 

I hate it so fucking much. I weightlift including powerlifting 3-4x/week, I do cardio (usually jogging) 3-4x/week and that adds up to at least 3hrs a week, I do aerial training 2-3x/week which is like functional calisthenics suspended in the air. For months on end I've been made fun of at work for eating only a vegan protein shake and one vegan meal a day. Every single day I eat 1500-1700 *vegan* calories in a 40c-30p-30f macro range. I even watch my added sugar and fiber intake. I supplement with BCAAs and HMB and take a multivitamin. I feel like I'm being textbook athlete here and yet I literally have only gained weight in the past year that I've gotten serious about my weight.

But then some skinny white girl can come in, use the assisted pull up to work her glutes, go at a leisurely pace on the stationary bike for like 20 min and she gets to have the body that *everyone* chooses over mine.

People don't even recognize that I do work out as much as I do. I can squat 410lbs x 2. And yet I've had people say ""you could work out yknow?"".

Like what the fuck! Even after all this hard work, all the leg days where I left barely able to walk, all of the turning down food that didn't fit in my macros, people still just see me as fat!! 

I don't even understand why I'm so fucking fat still. I know some of it has to be genetics, because even when my brother lost 80lbs, ate extremely clean, was on the football team and was regularly powerlifting, he still had lovehandles. He'd complain to me all the time that he'd go for runs for hours and hours and the fat just wouldn't come off. 

And I'm in a similar boat. Throughout the entire year I only dropped 2 inches from my waist, bringing my measurements from 39-36-42 to 39-34-46.

So I figured okay maybe I have some type of medical issue, so I went and got my thyroid checked. My doctor told me my blood work was the most perfect she'd ever seen, which is nice, but why the fuck am I not losing weight.

I'm so tired of feeling like shit about my body. I'm so tired of putting in all this effort to never see any physical results beyond strength. I'm so tired of men that I sleep with commenting on my weight. I'm tired of waking up and feeling like a fat piece of shit every day.

48,"Hi

Honestly, not even sure on where to start. Well...like annoying people always say, ''Start from the beginning''.  I guess it all started when I have had my car accident. As I was going back home from work a car got the back of my bicycle and I fell down a hill. That fall broke the back of my skull. Second by the doctors, it is a miracle itself that I am alive, since I wasn't supposed to have survived. Apparently, when I got to the hospital, the surgeons weren't even sure if there was a way to help me...if it was even worth trying. But they did. They took out half of my skull to let my brain swell and then put it back a month later. Fast forwarding a little, after rehabilitation and all, I left the hospital.

I went back to my old job and started getting used to it little by little. But..you see, after this accident, I have got a terrible case of epilepsy: If I have one attack, I will die. At first I accepted it. Drink your meds, don't stress yourself and you are ready to go. I tried keeping myself positive, I tried, but..you see, I used to be someone who would go to another city in a country whose language she doesn't speak fluently (I am better now), get lost and then go back home the next day. She already slept on the beach by accident. So, you see.. very carefree and healthy. Or so I used to be.

Now, I am off of work for who-knows-how-long because my body can't endure standing up anymore. It feels as if there is pressure inside my head, crushing my brain. I am not able to drive a car anymore because I might end up getting dizzy (common after the accident) and have a car crash. I am not able to go to parties (Not like I liked them..but I did like dinner parties..) because the light and sound makes my head feel bad. This is not even the beginning. And as of late..I have been having almost epilepsy attack.

Honestly...for those who have already being in a situation similar to mine or close to someone with a situation similar to this, what is your advice?

I few days I learned that my mother only had me with a white man in order to ensure shed get her citizenship in the USA. When I finally was told I wasn't surprised. I always knew there was something wrong with me or something wrong with why she had me. My entire life has always had a big question. “Why doesn't my mom treat me the way she treats my brother?” my brother is much older and from a previous marriage. My mother has always treated him with so much love and caring. Always had his back and bought him a house. My mom was never someone I could run to with my problems. I could go on with the things she's done. honestly, it’s made it so hard to trust anyone. That’s why I’m on reddit haha. I've never been able to open myself up to anyone. All my relationships tarnish because I’m just so emotionally unavailable and have been hurt so much by people that were there to support me not drag me down. For many years my mom has told people that I am an alcoholic and drug addict because she never takes me to any family outings, so they all just assume I’m messed up on something somewhere. It just hurts me so much because I’m just sitting in my room studying and trying to get a PhD in psychology. I just don't understand how she can buy my brother a house for his family and I’ve always had to work for anything I’ve needed. I would go to school all day and then change for my overnight shift at McDonalds. I know this might sound like I’m whining about my life, but I swear I just needed someone to understand or just to read this. I know for a fact I will be a better mother one day. I love my mom and hope one day I can have a beautiful relationship with her. I’ll always be there when she's sick. I never turn my back on family when they've all turned theirs on me. ",18Sep2018,1
62,"I hate that every ERP vendor lied during their demos. 

I hate that now that we've bought one and i'm knee deep in implementation, it can't handle something simple like Minimum-Multiple-Maximum order size like anyone with an 8th grade math education could, requiring me to enter the minimum, then every possible conceivable multiple up to the max, in my inventory units of measure and not purchasing units.  So i'm sitting here with something bought in Gallons but used in KG, and putting in multiples of 3.47 (one gallon of this material at its stated density), because the purchaser outright rejects the idea of fixing the POs that MRP makes by rounding up to the next gallon.

I hate that the vendor showed us a great demo that never revealed any of these flaws by being carefully constructed around them.

I hate that the help files in the system are so piss poor and minimal as to require us to beg them for help with every little thing.

I hate that the company is purposely headquartered in the USA but all of the programming and support is done in India and that the programmers don't understand manufacturing enough to either provide best practices for their customers or even program the system to behave as it should.

I hate that the paperless system they have developed is so poor that i have to develop other paper systems in order to get around their limitations and in fact increase the amount of paper.

I'm just so fucking angry at this thing.  They gave us a discount if we'd provide a good reference for them but right now I can only think of passive aggressive backhanded compliments for the system to put in any blurb.",18Sep2018,8
64,"This happened a couple of years ago but I still feel extremely ashamed about it. Understandably, she and I no longer speak but all I can wish is that she’s completely over it and happy. 

It was the beginning of our junior year of university. This isn’t an excuse, but I was at quite a low during this time. The low self esteem that I’ve always had as a result of being a social outcast (and badly bullied) reached its peak. I had a firm belief that everyone hated me and that my life as a whole was pointless. I realize now that I was being dramatic but at the time, my feelings were real. 

I felt my friend beginning to distance herself from me. We’d known each other for a little less than a year but we had gotten really close. To the point where we decided to dorm together. We’d slept over each other’s places and I met her entire family. She didn’t mind my weirdness and I didn’t mind hers. We called each other soul sisters. 

She was deeply embedded in the hook-up culture. She would meet guys off of anywhere (dating apps, craigslist, online forums, porn sites) and was the kind of girl who couldn’t be without a guy (she never got attention from her father). She always had a boyfriend but could never stay faithful to them. Now that I think about it, she might have had a sex addiction. The thing is, she didn’t like this. She developed feelings for every single guy she was with. It was never just physical. 

When she felt like she was being ignored by her new boyfriend, she started seeing this guy. He was the definition of an asshole. It was almost comical how terrible he was. He was very attractive but very mentally fucked up. Clearly been through a lot of stuff. Like I said, by this time, she had become very distant from me. This was confirmed  when I overheard her saying some not-so-good things about me to him (I later found out why). 

I ran into him while he was working and he basically started hitting on me. He asked for my number and, stupidly, I gave it to him. This is where it gets fucked up. He apparently told her about it and she asked me to talk. When I saw her, she looked visibly upset, like she’d been crying. She told me that the thought of him and me together really, really upset her and that she would really appreciate it if I stayed away. She said that she didn’t have any feelings for him but that she really didn’t want me to have him. I found out a little later that she had been distant because she grew very jealous of me. 

A good friend would have understood. A good friend would have respected her wishes. Unfortunately, I was not a good friend. I was so deep in my own issues and up my own ass that I had the nerve to believe that she hated me. I literally made myself believe that if the roles were reversed, she wouldn’t care. I reminded myself of the fact that she was cheating on her boyfriend (even though I knew she was an addict who needed help). So, I kept his number and kept talking with him. Talking led to hanging out and hanging out led to sex. I basically threw our entire friendship away right then and there. 

When she found out (I didn’t even have the tact to attempt to hide it), she quite literally lost her mind. She wrecked havoc on everything she could and eventually had an ambulance come get her because she was a danger to herself (she confessed to me a year later that she cut her arms up). I have  to face the fact that I completely DESTROYED someone I called my friend. For a disgusting reason like that. ",18Sep2018,3

They're very understanding of personal issues and needing time off and they compensate us well and give us amazing benefits.

But... I'm burnt out. I just don't feel that spark I used to. I'm tired all the time. I never want to work on anything. I thought it was just due to my anxiety and depression, but even know that I'm getting treatment and feeling better, I still feel this way about my job. 

I just don't know what else to do. I've gotten an education for this line of work and am still in a massive amount of student debt. I don't really want to go back to school and take on even more debt to get into a new career field. But I feel like unless I do that, I won't be able to find the pay I do now. It's great pay.

I learned the salaries of some of my coworkers. I feel undervalued. And, though I lack 5-15 years worth of ""related experience"" compared to my peers, we do the same work and I don't think that is deserving of missing out on 15-20k a year.

&amp;#x200B;

I like my job-- the work I do. I love my very short commute. I love many of the people I work with.  

I got a promotion at the start of the year, so I suppose they value me in some way. But even though I got a raise with this promotion, I'm paid less that I think I should.

I also am very uncomfortable with the idea of asking for more money (which is were the company wants me). And though I consider myself liberal, I am afraid of being seen as some crazy extremist-- because I'm reaaaalllly feeling this wage gap. (there's a coworker 1 salary grade below me who makes 150$ a year less than me dispite is significatly smaller workload)

Just looking for a few level headed people to talk out these feelings I’m having, as my peers would probably be upset at me for thinking these things. 

I am a fairly liberal fairly feminist young woman. I support women coming forward about bad behavior from men in power. But I don’t know why I’m struggling so much to support to ever growing tide of accusations against politicians, especially those on “the other side of the aisle.” I feel like these thoughts are a betrayal in some way. Am I wrong to think that maybe almost every man in power from the generations above me committed some form of sexual misconduct, simply because it was a different time? Not saying that excuses it at all, but everyone makes mistakes and if that sort of behavior is accepted in your environment is it fair to look in retrospect and expect young men in that time to break from the status quo? Part of me even thinks these accusations are strategically timed which makes me feel even worse about myself. Of course no woman asks to be mistreated or abused and they can tell their story in any way they see fit. But I also think the timing of these reports makes it really easy to disregard these women’s stories as lies, and that discredits legitimately fucked up things other men have been accused of. Almost like I’m getting media fatigue from trying to empathize with so many woman and since as a woman I’ve always been of the mindset to support support support I’m having some cognitive dissonance. Real people in my life have experienced this sort of harassment and of course I believe and support them so to turn around and cherry pick whos stories to believe is really hard. Also my struggle secondary to believing is feeling like there is no graduated response to these accusations, one side wants the story to totally discredit a person and the other wants to totally dismiss it. How do I reconcile all these mismatched thoughts? Please don’t internet shout at me I’m just feeling really confused

71,"It's a cloudy day and I was just walking out and she walked the same path in front of me for about 6 minutes, in that time the clouds cleared, the sun peeked and her pants flipped from opaque to very very translucent, everything was revealed.

You can't judge a person by their appearance. Sure, sometimes particular types of people have distinct appearances, like (for lack of better words) club girls and girls who wear things to attract people, but she didn't look like she's that type.

For the first time in my life I felt like ""I'm going against all the norms, going to go out of my way and tell this stranger about something very private"".

It was like jumping from a high board into a swimming pool for the first time, I was hesitating. Taking a quick step forward, then thinking ""no no no"" and walking back every few seconds. It's been going for maybe 3 minutes until she turned left and I continued straight.

I just kept thinking of her reaction, what would've been worse, her finding out after returning home that she's been like that all day, or that a stranger told her that?

I'm the type that likes to help people, and if I've learned anything it's that if you could help or fix something, you should. I've been in a fair share of shitty situations, and I look up to the people who have straightened out some of my quirks in those very embarrassing moments. It's those small things, handing tissue to someone who's nose is leaking bad, telling someone their fly is open or there's something on their face.

Ultimately I shouldn't care, and it's not about the girl at all, it's just that part of me is pissed how these things could be hit or miss and how the general take on them is clouded. On one hand you should never talk to someone you don't know about something personal, the other hand, that person might be eternally grateful for someone having telling them and vise versa, they'd be bummed that no one told them.

I stare at the darkness of my bedroom and feel the need to be hugged by someone I love. But then, something came to my mind. ""Girl, you're not in love with anyone.""
It's been a while since I fell in love with anyone. Last time I was in love, I was hurt, bad. Whenever I love, I love hard. Which makes the pain really bad when my heart broke. He chose someone else, the prettier one. Which is okay. I know I'm not in the pretty part of the society and I accept that. And it makes me realize, when someone love me someday, it won't be because I'm pretty. But I'll be beautiful in his eyes because he loves me. (Damn, sorry for this cliche part). So... I accept the fact that my heart was broken because he chose someone else. But it's hard for me to start to be in love again, because I'm not sure if anyone will ever be worth it for the pain that I've been and if I'm ready to accept the possibility of feeling that pain again if I decide to be in love.

""But hey, you can't choose to be or not to be in love, right?""

I used to think like that. But as I learn about life, you can always choose to stop yourself from falling in love, especially when your heart been broken to pieces. It's easier to think, 

""He won't fall in love with me. I'm better off alone enjoying my life instead of worrying about any love possibilities""

Instead of..

""Will he love me?""

There has been a few crushes here and there, but my heart always draw the line.

77,"I’m not sure if it is obsession, if I love her, or if it’s some other fucked up human emotion. 

When I was a sophomore going into summer, I started talking to this one girl that I had met in middle school but we never got really close. Over the summer, we talked everyday, I soon grew to develop some feelings and even my friends brother noticed but not my friends. We would flirt a bit, but not too much to actually do something about it. Summer was ending and it was back to school as a junior now. I’d walk her to class, we’d talk a lot and everything was fine. We had also become pretty close really soon (I have a thing with calling people on the phone, so over the summer it was pretty much every night talking on the phone.) Anyway, this all came to a halt when I found out that my childhood best friend and her were “talking.” 

My childhood friends (we were a group of 7) didn’t know I liked her so they were happy for the two. I at the time was sorta hurt but I soon learned to accept it because what was I to do? The day he asked her to be his girlfriend, me and her were talking on the phone and she said she didn’t know what to do. I think she knew I liked her and felt something too as she said “We want things we can’t have,” and I was confused as to what it meant for a second but then I thought, “She’s in this situation with my friend but we talk everyday, we flirt, could she mean she wants me but can’t because of what’s going on?” I don’t know to this day what she meant by that. It was a weird night. A couple days passed and now they were dating, she had made her decision. 

Me and her stopped talking as much as we used to of course but I still walked her to class sometimes and in my 6th period, she would even sneak out of hers (she had track) to come see me and we would walk around the school to talk. This went on for about a year or so (how long they lasted) and in that time, my friend felt a sort of dislike towards me because I would talk to her too much and he had asked her to stop but she wouldn’t listen. My relationship with him was never the same even until to this day. We grew apart over a girl. My childhood best friend. It sucked. 

Okay so a year passed and they broke up. Now I was relieved because if I’m being honest, my friend treated her like shit, even tased her at one point. They weren’t the best couple and I feel like she deserved better; not saying I was better but it could’ve been some other guy that treated her the way she deserved to be treated.  

After that, me and her stopped talking for a while because I wanted to get over her. It was now our senior year but eventually after a couple months break, we started talking again. 

At this point, I’ve realized that I’ve given specific details and I’m not sure if reading this is boring or not but bear with me as I don’t know what to do in this point of my life. It’s a lot. 

Anyway, it was now our senior year like I said and this time she started talking to this guy but sorta had this Lowkey relationship. See, he was embarrassed to be seen with her so he kept the relationship a secret. What a dick. The whole year was like that and I found out at the end about it but I wanted to let you guys know what was happening with that. With that in mind, when me and her started talking again, lots of things happened (Keep in mind that relationship with the guy was happening.) That year we hung out more, she was even my first kiss. We were playing a dare game with our friends and we had to kiss but if she was talking to that guy, why would she agree to continue with it? When I think about it, she led me on a lot. 

(This is sort of getting messy because I’m losing my train of thought and it’s easier to say this than to be written out. Rip.)

Umm the year passed by pretty quick, prom came up and I wanted to go with her but knowing the situation I couldn’t really. I actually ended up not going to prom altogether.. people said I would regret it but 3 years later, still don’t regret it. Maybe it’ll hit me when I’m much older. I heard the prom was lame anyway but it’s still a once in your life type of thing.

To sum up the rest, my relationship with her has always been weird. There’s a tension and even my friends have said to go out with her.  

Me and her once went to our friends friends kickback and she was supposed to pretend to be my friends girlfriend because of some reason but she instead ending up doing it with me. She had gotten drunk and I didn’t really drink because I knew that if I did, I would want to make a move and I didn’t want that. The night was still cool, even though she was giving me signs to make a move but she was drunk and I didn’t want to because of that same reason. 

It’s now been 2 1/2 years since we graduated but the situation is still the same. We’re very close, we even act as a couple sometimes but there’s always a guy and I can’t step it up because of some reasons: 1. Out of respect for my childhood friend. 2. She talks to a lot of guys, that I can’t trust what she wants. 3. It’s been 4 years since the start, this is insane, can I not get over you?? Lol. 

By the way, what I feel is that even if she fucks up, if she did something to me or something happened, I can forgive her and I’ll always be there. Whenever she’s down, I’m there and always will be because of an emotion I have yet to understand. 

But because of all this, I can’t seem to 100% move on. A part of me feels like I should ask her out, like as if I have a chance and should wait to find out but the other half is saying to move the fuck on lol. In better words, (not trying to sound corny) my head is telling me to move on while my heart is telling me to continue. 

I’m sure there’s some parts I missed out or I left things unclear but if you have any questions, please ask. Also, tell me what I should do. I’m tired of living these emotions. It’s been 4 years FFS. ",18Sep2018,3

My family addressed this issue with me and it significantly lessened to the point of never happening again.

However, when I am still woken up without being told prior to sleeping I can feel myself stress, I can feel my heart *squeeze* over how angry I am. I am between crying to breaking down my own door and beating whoever woke me with it.

I’m not an aggressive person irl, however I am short tempered.

Fuck all of you pieces of shit Chad douchebags. I hate you. And to top it off I'm expected to move and be happy for these and people feel I don't have a chpice but to only try and date unattractive obese women cause i have to ""know my place"" 


24 never a girlfriend or been kissed still a virgin never a date No attractive women like me only unattractive obese women like me and that's who people tell me to learn to settle for i hate my life cause of it

5 dating sites and never has an attractive or decent looking woman matched or message me only unattractive obese women or unattractive women do. 

When I go to bars and clubs I get rejected and ignored every time I cant win. 

The women i try for and who i want to attract are Ria Ciuffo from Barstool Sports attractive. 

I get told to aim for girls as unattractive and fat as the girl from youtube Christine Syldelko. 

Big difference in what i try for and what people tell me to get used to aiming for instead of offering advice that would help me attract women as good looking as Ria. 

And if any of my friends saw me dating a fat ugly girl they'd either laugh at me or worse think we're a good match saying I'm as bad looking and as much a loser as her. And if any of the women who rejected me saw me with a fat ugly girl I'd be looking for a bus to hit me. 

To give more context into what people read

 NO I do not hate women.  who I hate are the guys who women choose because the guys who women choose are always the type who have always picked on me and bullied me and then they rub it in my face on how they were able to get the girl I try for

Here's a list of all my experiences
1st Friendzone/Rejection ""**SARA**""

The girl i tried for in high school (24) but who friendzoned me is getting married to a scumbag piece of shit. (21) who cheated on her with a teacher She started dating him when me and her were seniors and he was a freshman he was caught sexting a teacher caught on the news and now the girl I want is marrying him and A TEACHER HERSELF 

and now everybody is happy that they're getting married it's like I'm living in the Twilight Zone that people forget that he cheated on her with the teacher and got caught on the news. And the only type of women who like me or unattractive and obese so when it rains it pours. i hate my life and i hate her fiance. 


AND THEN 2nd Friendzone/Rejection "" **ASHLEY** ""

**TL;DR**

Girl i love has a boyfriend and she's in love with him and it depresses me beyond comprehension that she loves him and she will never love me. I'm absolutely fucking depressed. 

Everybody else wants them to get married except me, i fucking hate her boyfriend he ruined my life. I asked girls on here if he's better looking than me and they all said yes he was and theyd rather date him than me. Can anybody give me advice thats beneficial for me? Not advice that only benefits her boyfriend, cause reality is if you say ""If you really love her youd be happy for her"" or ""move on"", that has no benefits for me it only benefits her bitchboy punkass boyfriend.


And again to recap she doesn't love me she loves him nobody feels bad for me because everybody else wants these two to be married already and the only type of girls who like me or unattractive obese girls so I don't get a bright side or a silver lining or happy ending that benefits me all of those is a losing situation for me or I end up with either nothing or what doesn't make up for what I lost out on. 


I told her I love her she rejected me then a week later she had me meet with her only so she can set me up with her fat ugly friend

3rd Friendzone/Rejection **ALEX**

Suddenly this woman approached me. She had glasses, blonde hair and looked to be in her thirties. She sat next to me and stared. It was awkward, so I asked her for her name. She said her name was Heidi Falconer or Faulkner. For no damn reason she started to try and take my water bottle.

I grabbed it but she was desperately trying to pull it away from me, I yelled ''what the f is your problem lady?'' she then started to go on a bizzare series of rants about how she's allergic to the water molecule and I was conspiring to force feed her this bottle of water so she could go into anaphylactic shock. She also told me that seeing a bottle of water was ''triggering'' and yelled ''GIVE IT TO ME'' over and over while yelling explicitives.

She hit and slapped me several times and I still have a gash on my cheek, I ended up getting my bottle of water back and I threw my fish and chips at her telling her to fuck off and that she's a deluded basket case. I also told her that her body is 70% water and she gave me the most disgusted look after that (like she was about to cry or have a panic attack) I kind of laughed it off but I was still weirded out by this woman.

Anyhow I searched her name to see if anyone else had encounters with her and it turns out she's a mentally ill woman living in Birmingham who believes that she's allergic to water and is desperately trying to sell a book about her 'life struggles'. https://kiwifarms.net/threads/heidi-falconer-woman-allergic-to-water-who-constantly-advertises-a-book-about-herself.47349/#post-3728627

I wasn't surprised to be honest and it also turns out Heidi Falconer isn't even her real name and she constantly harasses doctors when they don't believe her. She (and her equally mad family) have been doing this since she was 8 years old, and she's 31 now. Let that sink in a little..",18Sep2018,1

I'm a 24 year old male so fairly new to the work place still (graduated uni at 22 and only started working in an office after that).

My company is fairly small and a really friendly great team. My boss is really nice too, friendly, relaxed etc. He's also the joint owner of the company (that shows how small the company is).

I've been going through a pretty difficult break up and last night topped the lot. I ended up staying up until about 2am and was in a light sleep due to being so angry. I won't go into the details but I've not been that stressed in years.

I managed to get into work heavy eyed. But couldn't really focus due to A) still being very angry and stressed and B) being so tired.

My boss gave me a fairly simple task and I did it quickly and to a poor standard. I emailed it back to him and he politely said could I do a better job as it was kinda rushed. I said sure and started working on it.

A few minutes later her said ""could I have a word"" and we went into a meeting room 1 to 1. He basically said he shouldn't need to prompt me for something as simple as that. He'd like to see me go above and beyond if he sets me work rather than the bare minimum. I said sure I agree.

He told me off in a polite respectful way rather than shouting and I do actually agree with what he said. On the whole I'm a hard worker but recently (last 2 weeks and partucalry today) I've been a bit slack, poor productivity and poor quality control/care because my mind has been elsewhere. I never told him my personal problems but came very close to.

I can take criticism but I think because I was having an absolutely awful day as it was this just added salt into the wounds.

Should I have told him about what's happening outside of work which has distracted me? I didn't want to sound so weak and sound like I'm making an excuse.

I think my boss felt a bit bad afterwards as I went the rest of the day without saying a word. I think he could tell it affected me,

Usually it wouldn't as I'm strong willed and do agree with him but it just came on the wrong day.

Should I go into the office tomorrow and explain and say I'm wanting to show him how good I am with my work?",18Sep2018,9
91,"Let me start this off by saying that I've never hurt anyone ever in my life and I never will.

I suffer from pedophilia. I find children attractive and I HATE myself because of it. There's nothing I can do about it, it seems. I hate being around kids because all I have are bad thoughts about them. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS! I'm too afraid to tell ANYONE about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was molested by my father many times as a child. Which is one of the many reasons why I would never hurt a child. It screwed my up so bad. I was diagnosed with DID, and apparently I have alters? I don't know. All I do know is that I do things without remembering them and I'm TERRIFIED that I could hurt a child in one of those altered states (if my diagnosis of DID is true).

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to tell anyone about this because I'm so afraid that person might tell someone else - and being known as a pedophile is not something I EVER want to be known as. 

&amp;#x200B;

I struggle with this so much that I can't even go out in public. I can't stand being around children because my thoughts about this are so bad.

&amp;#x200B;

I check through every website I know is posting jobs, scroll through and find a bunch of jobs I hate. Eventually find one job I might like, apply to it. Great! Now that's another job added to my ever-growing list of applications without a reply. Go to bed after applying to a handful of jobs I can at least tolerate. Wake-up the next day, see that no company has contacted me. Repeat. For weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't think it would be this hard, you know? I'm not trying to be picky, I just don't want to get stuck with a job I hate either. Honestly this isn't what I was expecting life to be like after I graduated. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no debt which is nice, but I also have no sense of direction and am slowly resenting applying to places. It just makes me feel bad for myself and I hate it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've just been scrolling through job postings and positions for hours after looking at a seemingly endless list of jobs I either can't do due to insufficient work experience or other qualification reasons, or jobs I just know I'm going to hate based on reading the description.

94,"Hi reddit, this post may be a bit of a rollercoaster as i am just going to type what questions about my mentality towards myself and life come to mind so sorry in advance if this is a bit of a mess

First off, i am a 15 year old boy and i am very confused about my brain and its thoughts. In the next couple points i am going to ask a few questions which i would really appreciate if someone out there could answer as i am truly lost.

For awhile now i have become very unmotivated to do things in life, not to the extreme of not eating or showering but productive things like study for school or exercise i now dread to do, unlike in the past where i was able to do these things and feel fine. So what is my problem here?

I also become overly stressed about many things regarding school, socializing etc. These thoughts about tests or going out or exercise pop into my brain and i begin to feel very stressed and annoyed at myself for not doing these things and worried about the outcome of not completing the task. This worry changes to upset and sadness about these situations which causes me to feel even more unmotivated. I do not know what is wrong here or what i am going through and i am scared it is some illness or something, please help.

Sometimes i have negative thoughts about myself and put myself down about how i act, things i feel and do etc. How do i stop having this negativity affect my life?

I also care WAY too much about what people think of me, this stops me from not putting myself out there and doing things i want to do ( eg ask someone out as i am scared what everyone would think of her or me or our relationship if it worked out). I am unsure if this is social anxiety or something else and i do not know how to deal with these feelings.

Nowadays i also do not look forward to as much in life as i used to, i do not enjoy half the things i used to enjoy and this has made me sad and bored with life sometimes. What is wrong with me here?

Finally is there even anything wrong with me? Or is it just puberty messing with my head, if this is the case i HOPE all these feelings go away as i want to enjoy life and be happy about myself, others and life itself

Also this is the first time i have ever typed my thoughts out and it has made me realize maybe something is wrong and has also now made me tear up for the first time in a long time. 
However if there is or is not is my problem, i am scared that there is something wrong so this causes me to bottle up these feelings which i feel has only made them worse. On the other hand for some reason i am deathly afraid to talk to my parents about this and i do not know why as they have done nothing to make me feel this way and have been loving and supportive of me my entire life. 

Then sometimes i wonder if i am a psychopath and worry that i feel nothing and never will. 

Ok now my rant is done, sorry if it is all over the place, unreadable or too long. I spoke straight from my brain and heart at 11:45 at night when i have school the next morning so now i am finished.

Thank you to anyone for taking their time to read this or even acknowledge the title. And if anyone has answers to these problems i would highly appreciate them as i am truly scared they will not go away

Thanks again and sorry for any grammar spelling mistakes as i am on mobile

You, foolishly, thought you would grab what you thought was a package left at your backdoor, fresh out of the shower. No towel available, but whatever, you'll just open the door, grab it and head right back inside.

As you see there was, in fact, NO package left at all anyway, you underestimated your clumsiness. You trip and stumble right out the door.

The door slams shut, making contact with your very white, very untanned, bare butt.

Your eyes go wide in panic.

You turn, futilely pounding the door.

You hear ""Oh baby, nice ASS!"" and HOWLS of laughter.

You turn your neck back towards them, naked as a jaybird, body forward-facing your backdoor, blushing red, and say or do what?

Also how old are you, are you male or female, and how much are you blushing on a scale of 1-10 and why?",18Sep2018,0

Because my comments got deleted, I decided to make an actual post to r/Parenting I titled it 'My children' so that maybe the mods would overlook I was trying to cause trouble. The description of my post was 'Restore my comments'. That post was instantly deleted by automod. I then messaged every mod of r/Parenting to restore my comments. They banned me. That is what happened you knobs. I can edit the text of my post, but not the title.
