0,"I've posted this on r/confession and r/offmychest but I'm posting it here too to see what you guys think. I just physically and mentally cannot wrap my head around this and I just want as many opinions as possible. I don't know how to move forward. Anyways, here we go.

So I don't know how to feel about this...For some reason I can't wrap my head around this being sexual abuse. 7 years ago when I was 13, my 21 year old cousin made out with me in the darkness of his bedroom he shared with his 20 year old sister. We were talking in the dark when suddenly he kissed me. I didn't know how to feel about it. I kissed him back. I didn't feel any attraction to him but I also didn't feel forced. I feel like if I had said stop that he would've. For some reason it didn't cross my mind. He slipped me tongue and everything all while his 20 year old sister was asleep in the other half of the room. I left the room and went to go splash water on my face. 

""What the fuck just happened?! This is wrong and disgusting why did I do it back?! I don't like him like that anyways."" All those thoughts were flooding around my head.

I guess in a way I felt like it was what I was supposed to be doing. I had a very low self esteem before this and in a way it kind of made me feel wanted and liked. I have been battling with feelings of self disgust for years after this. Anyways, he came after me and that time I initiated. Again, I think I felt like it was what I was supposed to be doing. He took me to a closet where he proceeded to grab and squeeze my butt and breasts. Everyone was asleep. I was letting him do all of this and I remember him saying ""We can get caught at any moment you know, you like danger don't you? I love that about you."" Thinking back to it fucka me up a good bit. He kept doing all of the shit he was doing for about an hour and then we went to bed. I hardly slept my mind was going a mile a minute and I felt so dirty sleeping next to my mom. (We were on vacation visiting her sister).

The next day things were weird obviously. He told me we couldn't do that anymore and I didn't respond. That same night he did it again. He never did any hand stuff to me however, I don't think I would've let him. I guess that was his limit. I eventually had to ask him ""do you like me or something?"" And he did the ""kinda"" hand gestures and told me I'm very cool and beautiful and that we have a lot in common. This is a cousin I felt was like a brother to me. I was very close to him and we shared a lot of interests. The conflicting feelings of feeling wanted and feeling disgusted battled with me for a while. The last time he did it I was asleep. I don't know how long he did it for. He, his sister, and I tried to have an all nighter but failed. We were all laying on the same bed talking shit and trying to stay awake. Eventually my girl cousin and I fell asleep but my other cousin didn't. I woke up to a hand groping my butt and what I believe was his pinky finger passing dangerously close to my genitals. He was kissing me and it jolted me awake. I then grabbed his hand and told him ""don't ever do this to me again."" And I rolled over and went back to bed. We never spoke of it again and I have told only my therapist and two excruciatingly close people. 

I have managed to push this entire experience so deep into my brain to forget about it but recently my mental health has gotten worse and I've started disassociating and depersonalizing at random times. My therapist believes it might've been caused by trauma and all out of a sudden all the flashbacks came back. I started depersonalizing half way through the therapy session. I don't know how to feel about any of this. My mother doesn't know and will never know. I won't tell anyone else or report him to authorities. I've treated him the same and pretended like nothing happens but fuck me sometimes something triggers the flashbacks and it ruins my mood. When I come out of a depersonalization episode I get overwhelming feelings of self-disgust. I feel like it wasn't abuse because I took equal part. I think incest is absolutely repulsive and I'm not into it. But I don't know why I let him do those things when saying stop could've stopped it. I hate myself. I'm disgusting.

I can't and won't tell anyone in the family but I had to let it out. This year has been the the first time I've ever talked about it.

TL;DR: I can't wrap my head around the possibility of my cousin abusing me sexually as a child and I am disgusted and repulsed with myself.",06Sep2018,25
1,"I used to feel things, happiness, sadness, hope, grief, joy, a long time ago, so I know I am not a sociopath. It just that nothing registers on an emotional level anymore. I understand when things are happy, funny or sad, but it is on a cold, analytic level; they don't make me feel anything. They only time I feel anything is during fits of anxiety, and that feeling is of course fear. ",06Sep2018,190

4,"I'm 25 and just transferred from a community college into a 4 year university. I started college at 21 because when I graduated from high school at 16, I had a pretty average GPA so I wasn't eligible for any scholarships (nor did I know of any) and I couldn't afford to either. I had friends who either got scholarships to universities or their family's were financially stable enough to support them through college. From 17 to 21 I worked dead end retail jobs to save money until I was able to afford college with the aid of my family. By that time, certain friends were either in their junior or senior year. I felt really mediocre when most of them graduated either continuing their studies pursuing a master's degree or working while I was literally just starting out. 

During my first year I got on the dean's list and was working on trying to get into an honors society but at the beginning of my second year, I really dropped the ball and made an embarrassing mistake. It involved going to my first college party and getting really drunk because I thought you could just eat jello shots like snacks. I was so disgusted with myself that I became really depressed for an entire year and my GPA dropped; I even stopped being involved with all of the student orgs I held positions in. I got held back a whole year, so in my third year, I got my life together and forced myself out of the rut I was in, fixed my GPA then graduated. It felt so good to rise above what happened and I can easily say my final year in CC was the best because I feel like I sort of redeemed myself and found balance in my life.

Presently, I love my new school! I just happened to sort of remembered that I'm 25... almost 26. I sort of started to panic because I'm thinking who would want to hire me by the time I get this degree? I'm shooting for honor's again and I'm already involved with student orgs and have volunteering/community service booked into my schedule. The only thing I'm short of is maybe an internship because I have no experience in my field of study. All I have is retail experience no one cares about.

In my little fleeting spur of mediocrity, I went on linkedin to see how my high school friends are fairing and they already have 3-4 years of experience in their degree fields or just finished their master's and landed a dream job.

I feel so lame rn.",06Sep2018,11
5,"Soo.. just wanted to let some stuff out u no? 

K so first, I'm waiting for a waiver to be able to enlist in the USMC. Its starting to worry me how long it's taking. 

Today I almost got in car crash. This guy was switching lanes and didn't look to the left (I was there) and I swerved then he did too etc. He left huge streaks of black along with a dent. Afraid of making an insurance claim. Might or might not affect my enlistment. 

Recently I realized I'm an expensive hoe. I spend too much.. my brother has joked about doing more shit than a girl but.. think it's true

I've been using my contacts (same pair) for over a year. I haven't had money to buy new ones so I've reused mine. They're starting to get blurry and cloudy. In the morning when I put them on I have to double or triple check they're on right because they're starting to lose their shape. When I finally have them on I have to press on my eyelids to take the air bubbles out. 

About a month ago I sold my favorite phone (iPhone X) to my brother because I didn't have money. I'm currently using a crappy phone I had. 

My dad kicked me out of the house. He have me 3 months to get out but he's just been pressuring me to leave asap. 

I feel like shit tho. I'm often sleepy, depressed, muscle aches, low energy, constantly full but starving at the same time. Think I'm just anxious over the waiver going through",06Sep2018,1
7,"I just want to get this off my chest. You don't have to read it if you don't want to.

I keep commenting on YouTube, commenting on Reddit, and making Reddit posts on my main account, and more often than not all I do is start fights. I try to be calm at first. I try to be clear and collected, but I just keep getting angrier and angrier until I just start throwing garbage into peoples faces.

Even when I still consider my stance in the argument correct, I know that I've become the bad guy, and it gets to the point where I'm on the verge of crying for days at a time. Part of me thinks that's because what the other says is hurtful, but they only said that kind of stuff because I was being rude and cruel.

My family always says that I'm a good person, that I'm in the right, but I'm not. I'm a horrible, awful, terrible person, and I deserve nothing. These people only say horribe things to me because I'm horrible first.

I deserve it, it's my fault, it always is.

Nothing I do matters, it never did. And I can't cry, if I do I'll be questioned. All I ever do is make people upset and I'm sick of it.

I don't want to get into fights anymore. I don't want people to tell me I'm stupid or that I should kill myself or go away anymore.

I just never feel like speaking or typing again if everything I say is going to hurt someone to the point that they hurt me back.

But I have to keep going, because if I stop talking, if I stop typing, then I lose everything I ever worked for.

I just wanted to get this off my chest. With this being a throw away I have no context to give, so by default most people will probably wrongly see me as some ""unknowingly innocent"" party who's beating himself up for a misunderstanding or something, but that's not what you should think, I've hurt people. And they hurt me back.",06Sep2018,0
8,"I know this is the worst fear for a lot of men, so I thought I would lay out how it really happens. I work in an office that is pretty balanced male/female. My friend, let's call him Jeff, was a Level 2 supervisor, pretty high up (he supervised other people who had people under them). Jeff is a really smart guy and good at his job. We came up through the ranks together and despite him being kind of abrasive I liked him. Over time, our friendship suffered because he just stuck his foot in his mouth too many times ""just being honest"" and I had enough. Still I respected and liked him and still do.

One day he had a meeting with a lower-level staff member. She wasn't being very forthcoming with some information that, though personal, had bearing on her professional life and is something she is required to tell a supervisor. I don't know what happened in the meeting but she filed a complaint against Jeff and everyone took it seriously. There was an eight month long inquiry and they interviewed everyone who has had contact with Jeff, with particular care given to those he supervises or are otherwise below him. These interviews revealed that he had been repeatedly rude, degrading, abrasive and otherwise bad to work for over the years. I never saw this as a big deal, but I come from a family of pretty rough characters and am used to the ""I'm not an asshole, I'm just honest"" type of clueless person.

Now here is where things blew up for Jeff. Jeff is really good at his job and nobody wanted anything bad to happen to him, they just wanted him to have better people skills. They offered for him to go to a training for harassment, he refused, saying he did nothing wrong. I told him, really begged him, to write a letter to his supervisor saying he realized what he had done, why it was wrong, and what he was going to do better in the future. But he felt to do so was to admit guilt (which, I guess it was in the literal sense) and he refused to acknowledge he did anything wrong. He's really smart and he knows it, and he says that is all that should be required to do his job. But the thing is, in the real world, being really smart and competent is the *minimum* you need to succeed, you need people skills most of the time. In the end, they demoted him several levels, so he no longer supervises anyone.  Talking with the bosses, we all know this could have been avoided if he just played ball and didn't go on the defensive right away. If one person says you're a jerk at work, it's their word against yours and no one can do much about it. But if it is revealed that you've been this way with many people, you are in trouble.",06Sep2018,152
9,"Okay, so if you look at my profile I’m literally having so many problems within the last couple weeks with my best friend. I love him (in love with him, really, but I love him like a friend too) and I know he loves me too (non-romantically) we’re best friends, like I just said. But I want to know when loving someone isn’t enough to stick with them. I’m more turned towards the idea of sticking with him, because he just came out to me as bisexual and I’m the only one that knows. Also, he’s the only person who I feel like I can really talk to about things. But I feel like he keeps trying to start little debates with everything I say and it’s really getting on my nerves. Also, he has had this gloomy energy around him for the past couple of days. I just feel so sad, and rejected. But I love him so much and I feel like I won’t really have anyone without him. We just got out of an argument a few days ago, and I feel like that if I bring up how I’m feeling with all of this he’ll label me as inconsiderate and selfish. He’s not selfish, and I’m not trying to ignore that he’s going through things. It’s just that I literally told him I was in a suicidal period and he still just makes me sad.

12,"I'm in senior year of high school and, obviously, university applications are on the horizon. All throughout high school, I've toiled away, all for this. Before this year, I was extremely unmotivated because I could not see the point of working so much, because the goal of getting into university was so distant. Now that I'm so close, I can taste it. Everyone counting their accomplishments and their grades and waiting to see if it all pays off. 

I have few accomplishments to speak of and I don't have much extracurriculars. I have okay grades, but not good enough to guarantee a good chance of getting into the competitive programs I want to get into. I know I should've worked harder. I know I should've taken every opportunity I could. I knew that since I started high school, I needed to work hard to get this. But I didn't, because back then I was a lazy fuck, and severely depressed. I'm getting treatment for depression and anxiety and it's working wonders. I really feel like I'm getting my shit together. But it's all too late. Compared to my classmates I'm way behind. They all have multiple achievements and years of experience in various activities under their belt and all I can pretty much put down in my extracurriculars is my hobbies. 

Right now, I want someone to comfort me and say that I have a surefire chance of getting in and not to worry, but I know those will be empty words. I know that I'm less competitive than the thousands of applicants all over the country and I don't exactly have a great chance.

18,"I spent about 5 years post college working as an administrative assistant for a huge corporation. I was finally able to get a promotion out of assisting last year doing data analytics, which is a strength of mine and a passion of mine. I was feeling pretty good about the promotion. 

About 3 months after I transitioned into the new position, my supervisor told me he wanted to move all auditing planning responsibilities to my position. I don’t have any experience auditing, but agreed to take on the responsibilities (with no change in salary) since I was under the impression the responsibility would be to plan the logistics of the audits. But I’m doing a lot of actual auditing (as well as the planning). I’m literally at an oilfield in the middle of nowhere, inspecting safety equipment I have no experience with and no idea how it works or what it does. I’m not able to contribute much as an auditor since I’m just not qualified in this area. My data analytics responsibilities have dwindled more and more and my supervisor really doesn’t value the analyses I can provide.

So over the course of my 12 year education, I attended 8 different schools (all them outside each other's school district and required moving homes) and have spent a great deal of time alone and potentially depressed. I fear that my past, though not traumatic (I don't think), maybe be haunting my every day life, preventing me from fulfilling my own goals.

I live in Denver with my best friend of 5 years (a depressing accomplishment to me) I wasn't able to get into college straight out of high school because of funding and an unwillingness to put myself in dept.

I've come to terms with the fact that nobody is to blame for the nomadic lifestyle I grew up into, despite the misery it entailed. But after the fog clears, I'm still left with So terrifying little.

22,"How we see the world is framed by the limits of our language and morality. If we see something that we don't understand, or that is contrary to what is conditioned for us to recognise as 'good', we immediately think that it is 'bad', rather than being able to process that it might just merely be 'challenged', or 'different'. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a good example of this, I had a student that everyone (including her own parents) had written off as churlish, untidy, irresponsible, and **lazy**. Whenever she did poorly in exams, everyone thought she was just **lazy**. However, after working with her I realised that she just spent alot of time day-dreaming, and that she was naturally a very creative person who was alot more interested in the big picture and complex subjects of life, meaning, and art- rather than having to deal with the nitty gritty of daily realities. In fact, she shared that dealing with the nitty gritties of practical life stresses her out cos she doesnt seem to match up with the standards that everyone else expects of her, so she procrastinates or just mentally checks out as a way of coping with it. Anyways, this same student paints amazing realism portraits (without ever having been taught), writes beautiful poetry, and was able to speak French with near-native accuracy in her accent when I recently taught it to her. Clearly she's just an artistic soul who unfortunately is being judged by the harsh, fast-paced modern society. (doesn't help that she lives in a highly-efficient Asian city that has no tolerance for 'artsy' people)

I'm going through a bit of a rough patch at the moment and my motorbike started playing up, which meant I couldn't get it MOT'd and had to take it off the road.

27,"Hey all, never posted here before, but thought this might be the place for what I’m feeling. Sorry if it gets a little long.

So this weekend, I took a friend [25/M] up to my cottage in Northern Ontario. My whole family was there, and it was supposed to be a fun, family labour day weekend.

My friend told me on our way up that if he gets in the water, to keep an eye on him as he’s not a particularly strong swimmer.

Fast-forward to Sunday afternoon: it’s sunny and sweltering, and I hop off the end of the dock into the water. 

As I climb out, my friend asks me how the water is, and I respond by telling him it’s chilly, but refreshing. He then told us to keep an eye on him because he wanted to go in, and proceeded to backflip off the end of the dock.

This is where things went sideways. After surfacing, it was clear that he was struggling, and my first instinct was to jump in to help him. I will note that I do have some prior certifications and training with rescue in the water (nothing extensive, mind you), but in that moment, none of my training came to me.

I tried to get him up, and he used me to perch himself above the water, but that only pushed me down below the surface. At this point, I was starting to panic; I was being hauled under in a nightmare you think you’ll never experience.

With my final efforts of energy, all I could do was pry my friends hands off of my body and get back to the dock. It was a terrible, helpless feeling leaving him behind, but at that point I really felt like it was either both of us or one of us going down.

In all the turmoil, my 13 year old brother jumped in, stayed away, and pushed a life jacket towards the situation (the correct way to do things, if anyone was wondering). My sister’s boyfriend jumped in to help get my friend off of me. 

Finally, my step-dad made it to the end of the dock, not even knowing why my mom was screaming for him. He leapt over me as I was still hanging off the dock, and he told me all he saw was me, and bubbles where my friend should’ve been. He didn’t even know who he was going to.

He grabbed my friend and pulled him up, and immediately told him to stop thrashing and to give him his back. My friend was able to comply, and my step-dad got him back to the dock. 

I vomited water probably 4-5 times shortly after while lying on the beach, gasping for breath with every inch of my body on fire. Vomited again while waiting for the x-rays on our lungs to come back. And once more when my step-dad came to get us from the hospital. Everything looked okay at the hospital, thankfully.

We got home, and I passed out, feeling shitty and miserable. I’m still having on and off back pain, my stomach is a mess, and I definitely have some PTSD to sort through.

I feel guilty for not suggesting he go in the shallow end and start there. I feel horrified that my 13 year old brother could’ve been hurt or killed, and that he had to be involved at all.

I’m livid at my friend, not for almost drowning, but for putting mine and my family’s lives in danger because of his irresponsibility.

I don’t know if he’s just embarrassed and trying to play it off as cool, but every time it comes up,  it seems like he just doesn’t understand or won’t accept how serious the situation was.

All in all, I’m just happy that everyone survived. It’s a lot to process and deal with, and while I’m sure I will be in a short while, I don’t think I’m fully okay right now. The situation plays through my head constantly, and I can so vividly feel being under the water, desperately needing air.

If anything, please take this as a precautionary tale, because this happened so fast, and it can happen that fast to anyone, anywhere.

Regardless of how shitty of a guy her ex was, I had no right to do that and still regret it to this day. Anyway, fast forward to September 6, 2017. At this point, we had already broken up after only 2 months together at her behest and decided to try to be friends. This was the beginning of my senior year of college and since we had made schedules back in March, I had the same exact schedule as my ex. Things were shit from the start. I found myself crying to her on a daily basis and wishing she would give our relationship another chance, in spite of her insisting that she can’t be with a guy not of her religion (I’m Muslim and she’s Christian). And then Harvey hit (I live in Houston) which resulted in me not seeing her for a week before school picked back up again.

So on this day last year, we resumed classes and I was excited to see my ex again and was hopeful that things would be okay again. Boy was I wrong. She had about enough of my crying and was at the point where she just yelled at me on a constant basis, for basically the entire day. It got to the point where I just gave her an out, and she took it. This included her blocking me on all social media and texting. So from July 2016 to September 2017, I went from friend to best friend to cheater to boyfriend to acquaintance to blocked.

I was completely distraught and was wallowing in my self pity for about 2 weeks straight. Coming from a religious family, my parents really didn’t help me either. I had also lost many of my “friends” during this whole ordeal, so I was looking for new people to hang out with in order to lift my mood a bit. 

So what I ended up doing was signup with a gym and getting a trainer for about a year now. I managed to find myself a new clique, and still had some of my old real friends stick around and help me get back on my feet. 

Mentally, physically, and spiritually I am so proud of how far I have done and the person I have become now. If you read through all of this, I appreciate it. No matter how dark life gets, there’s always light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you. ",06Sep2018,3
32,"i wanted him to be viand, a lover i could slice open to examine whatever is there.  he had the perverse on his menu.

after the first delectable taste, i spend a few weeks constrained from his bone-drying physical retreat, yet i imagine the minutes apart have a subtle meaning i'm just too stupid to parse.  that's the deception of anticipation.  and i believed in what i was feeling, not in the acts that revealed him.  because i put myself in the center of it, ignoring those flaws in the ego i built because that's what an ego does.

he shows up again when i'm near the brink of extinction.  7 rough years disappear in a few intoxicated seconds.  he looks abridged, a declining edition of what he is in my turbid memory, but i still feel the need to open him up and gouge out whatever is there.

he calls me voracious.  i say he's edible.  

in the end, we consume each other.    ",06Sep2018,0
33,"I dont know any other sub to post this issue link me a different one if you think this doesnt belong here.

For several years I have had quite frequently these particular symptoms. Not everyday but at least once or twice a week when I was in school and almost everyday when I am on summer break . I wake up tired, mornings are the worst. My body is awake but my brain is so foggy and it takes the whole day to feel good and fresh. 
My face is gray and washed out,I have awful and prominent dark undereyes (not bags but rather indented circles). My blood pressure is extremly low. I cant concentrate and dont have any will to continue my day with such low energy.

I did blood test a few times thinking I was anemic but my iron levels are fine. I tried doing pilates classes but whenever I excersize I feel so low and this foggy state of my brain becomes worse. Also I am on anti depressants and they help my mood immensely and it seems that this low energy is not caused by depression. 

Can someone at least relate? Is it a condition?

38,"So I just found out last night my girlfriend smokes. We walked past a smoke shop and she commented how she should get a pipe. I was confused because last time she mentioned smoking she was disgusted by it. Now I'm assuming she does it so frequently that she wants a pipe?

&amp;#x200B;

Every encounter I've had with smoking has ended badly either for me or friends I have. My friend went off the deep end with smoking and I felt helpless. I've had nothing but bad experiences personally with smoking, from puking to doing stupid things. My other friend smoked with a random for the first time under a bridge and was high and did stupid things. He never did it again. I'm not a fan of the look, like when you walk into someones house you can usually tell if they smoke. 

She's anxious lately and uses it to calm the anxiety, I want to help her become a better person like shes making me become a better person but I'm not sure if I can do that if she becomes a frequent smoker.

This was on my mind since she mentioned it yesterday",06Sep2018,1
39,"Ever. Whatever bombs they go through or natural disasters or whatever. I'm not upset.

The Japanese people and their government are foul for pretending like they've done nothing wrong in last hundred years. All those women and children they raped, abused, tortured and killed. All those innocent elderly and sickly people they massacred. I dont feel sorry now whenever they go through any natural disaster. If anything it almost feels as though a god existed and showered some karma onto them. They even have the nerve to worship their war-crime committing generals and cry foul or victim when their war crimes are pointed out. They're as bad as China when it comes to their ethnocentrism. I don't feel sorry.

I'm hella glad they're dying off quickly. From their pedophiliac jpop and lolita culture to those weebs, Japan gives off pure cancer.

Those stupid no-good scum on earth invaders are the reason why I was even born to begin with. They raped and killed the women in my village. My great-grandma only got away by marrying her cousin and running away. She was the eldest and only surviving child of her family because of that massacre. And even after all that history and trash brought by the Japanese invasion, my parents still the gall to name us siblings with Japanese names. Its fucking disgusting.

Kill me now. ",06Sep2018,2
40,"**Some background information:**
I’m currently a senior in high school getting ready to apply for colleges. I’ve had pretty much one college in mind ever since I started high school that I wanted to go to. My parents of course knew this and they were perfectly fine with this college. It was in-state, my sister graduated from it, and it’s only about a 4 hour drive from where I currently live. I’ve also told them previously that I wanted to stay in-state. 

Things changed though. I met someone who lives in a different state that makes me truly happy 24/7. I want to be with them as soon as possible and going to college near them seemed like a good option. Now I’m not just blindly changing my whole decision because I met this person, they more of inspired me to look outside of where I currently live. Obviously, them being there is a big reason why I want to go, but there are other pros too. The school I was looking at, which is not too far from them, has a great program for my major, and my mother grew up in that area for the first 25 years of her life so she’s familiar with it and I’ve also been there many times. Her whole entire family also still lives there, so I have them if I need anything. I also just kind of want to leave where I live now. I’ve mentioned checking out colleges in that area but i’ve never really mentioned that it’s where I actually really want to go. The tuition is obviously a lot more expensive since it’s out of state, which my mom brought up and I don’t really know how to approach that. Thought about maybe getting a job, and I’ll be applying for many scholarships. Anyways, as far as I know she’s still under the impression that I really want to go to the in-state school, and neither of my parents know about my girlfriend. I was going to tell them but when I started thinking about going to college near her I got afraid they would immediately shut me down because they would think I’m changing all my plans for a girl I’ve never even met. Also my sister, who i’m the closest to when it comes to family,  still lives right next to the in-state college and she’s expecting me to go there too. I visit her and her boyfriend all the time and they were expecting me to be there with them next year so that’s another thing. I thought about asking my sister for advice about this but i’m worried about how she’ll react as well. 

I just want some advice on how I should bring this whole thing up to them and what I should do in general. I just want to be happy, and I think being leaving where I currently live and being with her is what can accomplish that. I have no doubts in my mind about her, so I don’t really need any advice on that. It’s long distance but we talk at least 7 hours a day (a lot of times more), and we’re really close. I just don’t really know what to do and I’ve been really worried about this for the past month or so. Should I try to reason with them about wanting to leave without bringing up my girlfriend? Should I just tell them everything? Please, any advice is appreciated.

51,"I’m in my first year of college this year. In high school I did very shitty, grade-wise, because I had no motivation to work and just wanted to shut down. I have been doing better since then.

I moved out of state, live with my grandmother, and am attending a technical school so I can take time to figure out what I’m gonna do. Because of late registration, I am currently considered part time with only two classes. But that should change next semester. 

One of those classes I’m taking is a beginner’s math course. I didn’t place well on the accuplacer do to me not doing the work in high school and slowly falling behind. But this class is for the best. It’s both relaxing to be taking a simpler math course and good that I am re-learning. I notice that I do not know as much as I think I did.

I left high school with terrible grades and barely graduated over the summer. But today, I have A’s in my classes and even got a 100 on my recent math test. 

I’m glad it’s working out for me. But, I don’t know if I should feel proud. I mean, I don’t know if doing well in a beginner’s math course is something to be proud of. Plus, I don’t know if I deserve to be proud after how I did in high school. Not to mention, I still find it difficult to stay on track with homework per occasion. Old habits, die hard, I guess. 

I really am doing better. But I just still feel like my past haunts me. I think I am out of the funk I was in, but I have a new feeling of being dragged down by what I did.

54,"Hey everyone, so me and my girlfriend have pretty recently started doing an LDR as we’ve had to move away from each other for college. We are always so happy when we’re with each other. 

Every time we have FaceTimed since this all started we always end up getting really sad about how much we wish we were together, how much we miss each other, how much we love each other, etc. I have felt like up until point I would be 100% able to make this work. My girlfriend however seems less convinced. She has been saying a lot about how it might be too hard and how she’s afraid I’ll break up with her and how all this pain and sadness she is feeling now might not be worth the short amounts of time we get to see each other in the future. She’s also worried that she won’t be able to handle this for the next 4 years while we go through college and has expressed that all of this might not be worth it because it will all end eventually, unless we get married. 

I’ve tried to quell these worries and tell her that we just have to take it day by day and not worry so much about the future. I’ve tried to tell her that I love her and really want this to work, but all of this sadness and pain and uncertainty I feel like is wasting the only times we get to talk to each other on FaceTime. 

I have to figure things out and settle into college and I’m not sure if i can juggle all of this and college. I do love her and I don’t want to lose her, but I just feel like I might need a break, I’m not sure what to do.

But days like today are bad. The only way I can describe it is that it feels like lead is running through my veins holding me down and keeping me from doing the things I have to do. I lay in bed - hopeful- telling myself everything I’m going to do today, but I watch the clock and the time goes by and I just can’t move. Uncontrollable sadness crashes over me in waves... all I can feel is the grief. The sun outside is shining, the world outside is waiting for me. I tell myself that it’s okay... that I’m still healing... 

But days like today I feel like it’s never going to stop. 

Some days I’m on top of the world. I get up on time, I do everything I need to do, I make sure my bills are paid, I eat healthy, I smile a lot... and I just feel *good* 

Today I’m not okay. Today is one of those days where everything hits me like a freight train and I know that I’m too weak to conquer today.

I need to forget everything I’ve been through. I need to forget everything.

58,"Problem: I have always been so fixated on a guy and I have never been able to move on until I find the next person to be completely obsessed with. It causes me so much pain and wastes so much of my time I could spend finding the right person. I’ve had this problem my entire life. I don’t know why, and I wish I could afford a therapist to help work my way through this.

Context: I’m here because a year after I was talking to this guy things went wrong with I still can’t stop thinking about how happy I’d be if we were together. We talked for a few weeks, in which he promised the world, talked about a wedding, and said he wanted to introduce me to his family abroad, but when he flew me out to see him he didn’t pay any attention to me and treated me badly. He just didn’t like me that much. Pretty much a week after he met me he found some seemingly really mediocre chick and now they’ve just had their one year anniversary and got a dog together, while I’m still fuming, alone, jealous, and sad.

I know my thoughts are unrealistic, irrational, and hurtful but it never stops anything. I don’t know how to get over this when I’m so alone.

History: When I was in high school I pulled a Taylor swift and had a giant crush on a guy who barely knew I existed for 3 years. In college I had a boyfriend for a month who took my virginity and i dwelled on him for 2 years. I had a boyfriend for two years, single, then a boyfriend for 4 years, but that ended 5 years ago (single for five years) and the same patterns started, dated a guy for three weeks and he was so sweet to me but not over his ex, so I was in a black hole for 6 months about him, then dwelled on a shitty musician I was obsessed with and basically treated me as badly as he could get away with for a year then this year I can’t get my mind off the guy I described before. I’m attractive and people want to sleep with me (obviously not date me) but I’m never in love with them...unless I get obsessed...maybe I can’t do it unless I’m at distance or they don’t love me back. I’m always so loving, nice, and what feels like how you should treat a partner or any other human being, but not good enough.

I’ve spent the past two years doing what everyone would say you should do, and what I’ve wanted to do: focus on your career, your life, etc. I’m glad I did but I didn’t enjoy being single for 5 years...I’ve always been happiest in love. I’ve been working on some of the biggest elections in the country and bouncing around from place to place, now I’m trying to settle down in a new city. I kind of just want proof everything will be ok, but idk...help lol. I’m way too old for this and I don’t think I’m a bad person, I’m just so hopeless, sad, pathetic, and mad at myself at this point I’m going to die alone with corgis, but no, I don’t want to be 35 and unmarried.

I have tried to get out so many times but in this economy/state it's not really possible, not even working full time. 

Something I have always wanted was to join the USMC. It's no secret that the Marines have the highest physical standards. When I first thought about joining (freshmen year) I was really obese and even weaker. The thought of joining kinda went into the back of my mind and I forgot about it since it seemed like a far fetched dream. Throughout high school I did PE even though only 2 years are required. Mid sophomore year we switched to block schedule so I technically did 6 years worth of PE credits. I had lost significant weight but I was still weak. When I was about 3/4th into college I revisited the idea of joining, it was still far fetched since I have medical problems and I was still weak so yep. I decided to at least try to enlist.
