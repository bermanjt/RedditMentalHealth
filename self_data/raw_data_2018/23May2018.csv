2,"I'm really struggling with not being a dick to people. I've been having a rough time in my life and people keep forcing their opinions on me. 

My mother literally forced her way into my suite(my career pays for, my accreditation got me my career, my name on the lease, my bank accounts, MY FUCKING LIFE!), demanded an audience, grabbed my kitty and told me I was psychotic. I had to call the cops after I shouted her out of my place. She blatantly refused to leave, hurled insults at me(I'm not her son anymore, OK!). The rest of my family thinks that was going too far. Fuck that. She went too far and not for the first time. 

I've been having trouble with stress, workplace bullying, weed and alcohol to cope and a manipulative girlfriend(now ex). My mother knew about all of this before she chose to do what she did. 

I've been doing everything I can to get my life straight. I'm seeing a counsellor for addictions. I haven't had a drink or puff since May 2nd. I kicked my girlfriend out. She wasn't living there anyways, just using my place as long term storage for her stuff, trashing my place, and eating all of my food. 

She's been stalking me and using my friends and family to get to me. I had to call the cops on her the last time she showed up unexpectedly. 

You know what's funny? I'm the one who's fucked up. I'm the one who's crazy. I'm the one who can't manage his life. I'm scary. I have anger management problems. 

You know what I am? I'm an alcoholic. I have anxiety and depression exacerbated by my dependance issues. I'm not a bad guy, I'm not an evil man or a monster or a paranoid schizophrenic. I'm having a rough time in my life and I feel like I'm getting curb-stomped for it. I'm afraid to let anyone in because I can't get help when I need it from the people I thought I could depend on. I've been lashing out and overworking myself because I don't know what to do with myself. 

I hate this. I just want to have a normal, quiet life. I don't need this. I just want to get back to work, distance myself from the people in my life who are trouble and recover from this. Every time I try to gain ground though it's one step forward and two steps back. I don't know how to have a normal relationship with people. I keep doing the wrong things and don't know how to recover. 

It's ups, downs and all arounds. 

The best thing I've done for myself is to get out and exercise. My mind stops racing when I'm out for a run or riding my bike. I can channel some of it when I write. Cooking has been helpful too. I just can't do people right now. I know that's kind of an essential skill but I'm just too raw. 

The good news is I'm up to 6 hours of sleep a night from 3-4. Little victories, yay!

9,"I still get them. Not that often at all, especially compared to what they used to be. Ive changed things in my life a ton. Nothings perfect in life, and I guess we continue to get down days every now and again. Haha they’re not the best. On these days, I always have this general feeling of either being a failure (if by myself) or feeling like im not really doing anything and its all unimportant and sucky (if im with others usually). Both are feelings of emptiness. I know I’ll feel better tomorrow. I usually do after days like this, especially if i try to schedule more things. Haha it has to do with satisfaction i think. I always liked The Replacements song. Anyway, everything passes. Just do your best. I guess I’m writing this for anyone else feeling this to know its normal. And maybe on some level, i want to know it is too, even though I already do.

Its funny, I was just thinking about this a little more. These are days that I feel down because thats how my outlook is due to my personal feelings. Like its not from outside stressors. I dont know, thinking about it, as exactly what it is, helped.

14,"I work full time and I have plenty of time after work every day to do things. But I (usually) don't. 

Why? Well, I feel like it boils down to two things:

* I don't have things presented for me to do. I have few friends since I graduated college a few years back. I have some, just...not the kind of friends you randomly text to hang out. I haven't ever really had that to be honest.

* Sometimes I have options, but I'll just choose to stay at my apartment. I feel lazy or just not feeling like going out somewhere. But at the same time, j *do* want to go out somewhere. I feel like nothing is stimulating enough, yet I opt to stay alone most weeknights.

On the weekends, its somewhat similar, but I've been able to regularly go to a certain event once a week. This sounds like I'm a recluse but I'm not really. I just tend not to pour lots of energy into finding things to do and don't have a booming social life presenting opportunities to me very often.

But I want to get out more. I feel like my lacklustre social life is a detriment to both my mental health and my ability to find a romantic partner. I have hobbies and do get out some, but it's just not enough. I don't understand how people can get out every night or more than once or twice a week, at least as an adult in the real world. I want to do it more but I feel mentally tired and just feel like laying down and looking at my smartphone for hours.",23May2018,1
15,"My coworker has been battling stage 3 breast cancer for a little over a year.  After all her surgeries and treatment the doctors declared her tumor and cancer free.  

That was about two months ago.  

Recently she contracted pneumonia and severe bone pain and constantly ran a fever (some times getting up to 105 degrees).  She went in for scans and they found some anomalies in here spine and lungs.

Thinking the worst we all suspected that the cancer metastasized beyond here armpit lymph nodes (not sure the medical term) and spread throughout here body.

She just got the result back yesterday and all biopsies came back negative and here blood work shows she is just anemic.

The doctors are pretty confident that this is just late radiation side effects and that she will recover fully with a steroid treatment to boost here immune system and blood creation. 

I was so worried because she has a 18 month old boy who is the sweetest little kid I've ever met and I cannot think of a world that would allow this morally beautiful woman to leave that child behind. 

Sorry for the long rant I am just so happy at the not so terrible news.

17,"Tonight, I was watching Dr. Phill with my Mom. Now I know there are controversies around Dr. Phill's practice and show, but that's aside from the point. 

Furthermore, Dr. Phill wasn't promoting the product. He was criticising it, and frankly saying it was bullshit. The episode was more an open forum for discussion about the products validity and the dangers of the product and the idea of online products in general.

Anyhow, tonight I learned about the product, ""Jilly Juice."" To give a brief summary about what it is, it's basically a blend of cabbage, water, with a very high concentration of salt. It's claimed by it's creator to cure every disease, expand lifespan to 400 years, grow limbs and organs back, and most absurdly in my opinion, cure nerological disorders such as ADHD and Autism, as well as ""cure"" homosexuality.

The creator, Jillian, has no medical or scientific experience or degrees, as stated by herself on the show. 

Now, any rational person as to my understanding would see the absurdity in such a product and it's claims. It's claims for sure are way out there, as modern medicine can't even do what her product claims to do. Furthermore, the fact that she mentions that it can ""cure"" homosexuality is quite offensive. I thought we were passed that. Now believe me, I'm not naive. I know there are people who still practice homosexual conversion, but for here to outright claim that her product does so is insane and insanely offensive.

The side effects mentioned included ""waterfalls,"" otherwise known medically as diarrhea. Any other side effects were considered ""part of the protocol"" and were deemed not serious.

There were two members of each side of the argument brought onto the show. The first two were those who used the product and had ""success."" I use the term success lightly because it wasn't really success at all. The success I'm referring to is that they didn't get seriously ill. 

Shockingly, one of these people stated that they fed their kids this juice. Not only was this alarming, but quite sickening. I don't understand how a parent could willingly subject their children to something so dangerous, but something with no scientific backing at all.

Of the other two members, these were the people who got seriously I'll from the juice. The symptoms experienced by these members included pains, the mentioned ""waterfalls,"" migraines, slurred speech, and chills. Furthermore, one had 2 strokes as a result, and the other had extremely high blood pressure.

The health risks from such a high salt content, over 4 times the daily allowance, were also discussed. Such included heart complications including heart failure and stoke, high blood pressure, headaches, confusion, etc. 

The thing that was most shocking to me honestly was how Jillian acted on the show. For one, she was very narrow minded. She constantly tried to deny and discredit proven facts with her agenda saying that such research had no grounds when applied to her product. She also tried to push her falsified ""science"" as it was clear that she really had no idea what she was talking about. When a doctor was talking on the show, she rudely interrupted multiple times. She even tried to claim that doctors claim to know everything, something the doctor straight out denied. Furthermore, she kept pushing that the medical fields were out for money, and this was her main defense in discrediting any evidence against her.

When discusing the serious side effects mentioned by the latter two members, she stated that they were just part of the ""protocol healing process,"" while also stating that they weren't that serious.

I guess the biggest issue is the fact that these people like Jillian are out there and they're pushing their sometimes dangerous agendas and products. It's really a reminder that we really can't trust these self claimed ""professionals,"" as some are not professionals at all.

Sorry for the wall of text. This product really just shocked me and I figured I'd share to get the word out. Make sure to always look into any health products on the internet. They may not be what they seem or claim to be.",23May2018,6
18,"Honestly, fuck this dude.

So I date this guy for a year. When we met I was hellbent on moving across the country for school. He was 0&amp;#37; interested in moving, didn't want to wait for me to do 3 more years of school and we argued about this regularly. We eventually break up. I apply to school across the country so I can reset my life, focus on my future and ""chase my dreams""™ . Boy and I reconnect as friends 1 month after breaking up. He hums and haws about me moving, it becomes an awkward subject again and I hesitate about whether I actually want to leave. We both get into new relationships, being friends becomes an actual shitshow, we wind up on terrible terms and stop being friends.

After we stop talking, I get accepted to school, take the offer and start planning my move. I look dude up, half\-considering saying goodbye knowing that I'm actually for sure leaving. And he fucking moved to the same city I'm about to move to.

He made me feel guilty for a year for wanting to leave everyone I know. And he did the same thing. And he beat me to it by several months. I know this is stupid and petty.

20,"I have to get this off my chest...please help me if you can.

A few years ago, when I was a junior in college, I tried a pot brownie for the first time with my boyfriend and his guy friend (let's call him Rick) in Rick's dorm. It was just the three of us; I was the only girl. Long story short, I had a really bad experience (they claimed I ate too much, too fast).

I saw something really disturbing--and I saw it so clearly--that I don't know how it could have been a hallucination, although they told me it was. Anyway, here's what happened, from my perspective: 

I was sitting in a chair in the middle of Rick's room, my arms wrapped around my legs which were pulled up to my chest, and rocking back and forth intensely. My ex was standing on one side of me and Rick was standing on the other, both of them facing me, and they were laughing and pulling their pants down--in a mocking sort of way. I remember having this intense fear that they were going to sexually assault/rape me (which was why I was shaking back and forth in fear).

The next day I talked to my boyfriend about it and he said the part about me rocking back and forth was true--that I looked really scared and freaked out--but that he and Rick never messed with me sexually. I didn't push him for more information after that; I didn't want him to think I was crazy, so I just dropped the subject. And I never brought it up to Rick, since he was my boyfriend's friend and we weren't that close. I'd only hung out with him on a few occasions.

It's driving me crazy even years later because I know so clearly what I saw and felt, but my boyfriend told me I had imagined it or hallucinated it or whatever since I just took too much and had a ""bad trip."" But I've smoked pot (although I haven't taken edibles again) and tried LSD multiple times since then and have never experienced ANY hallucinations or anything even CLOSE to this. 

If you have experience with pot brownies or weed in general, please help me figure this out. I really need closure :/ ",23May2018,1

I want to enjoy myself in their company, because they’re all great people despite our different lifestyles (they’re into alcohol, weed, partying etc) whereas I’m more of an introvert (but I can hold conversations, I’m told I have a good sense of humour, and in general I am on good terms with everyone).

25,"To start things off, I'll be graduating university next month, and my dad decided to give me an early present to celebrate. He gave me a big box and inside was a Michael Kors backpack. The thing is, my dad thought it would be a good gift, and my mom had no clue about it at all. Heck, my mom didn't even know about it until I opened the packaged in front of her and my dad. I thanked my dad for the gift, but was also very confused about it because this backpack was super tiny and it just didn't seemed to suit my own lifestyle purposes. The colour was also something that I would've never imagined which was this gold that became shiny underneath direct light. My mom then asked my dad how come he didn't buy a darker colour like black, and he responded saying how the backpack doesn't come in black. Right there, I knew something was off because black is a neutral colour and it's always an available option. Later that day, I went onto the official MK website and went straight to the ""sale"" tab for handbags, and sure enough, I found the exact same MK backpack that my dad gifted to me. I also went onto the handbags tab and found the exact same style of backpack that came in the colour of black.

Here is the link to the said MK backpack: [https://www.michaelkors.ca/rhea\-medium\-metallic\-quilted\-leather\-backpack/\_/R\-CA\_30H7MEZB6K?color=0705](https://www.michaelkors.ca/rhea-medium-metallic-quilted-leather-backpack/_/R-CA_30H7MEZB6K?color=0705)

I also said above that the bag itself does not suit my lifestyle purposes. Even though I am a girl, I don't really have any care for fashionable accessories, especially those that are considered luxury brands or products. I don't really have or use a purse to carry my belongings in. For clarification, I am a photographer, and I have backpacks designed to hold all of my photography gear from my two DSLR bodies, many lenses, 15\-inch laptop etc. Everywhere I go, I always bring a backpack meant for travel, along with one camera body and two lenses. As this backpack is built for travel, it also has enough room for my wallet, car keys, and many more items. 

I am feeling conflicted because I should be happy that my dad gave me a graduation present, but I am also feeling upset because he bought me a MK bag on sale for $200 and the original price was $400. I am also hurt because my dad lied and said that the backpack doesn't come in black. I do not want to see this situation in terms of monetary value, but that is what I am seeing it as.

Well, last night a girl we know sent me a screenshot of a message that he sent her, thanking her for helping him in high school, and claiming that “the universe is an uncaring cruel void” and that “the pain was too unbearable” and that it was his “last goodbye.”  There’s a lot fucking weird about this. From what I know, she’s the only one he told, and I’m pretty sure they’re not even close. I called him immediately and I told him not to do it and that it’s not worth it. He said “not tonight” and yet again I told him to talk to someone, and I got the same stubborn response. He then started talking about graduation today and I made the fucker promise that I’d see him here today. 
We lost a friend to suicide already this year. I can’t go through it again. I don’t know what to do. I feel like all the pressure is on me being his closest friend. I have to do something, I have to address my concerns to an authority figure or something. And it’s not like no one knows that he’s going through shit. People know. But maybe they’re not concerned enough.   ",23May2018,9

49,"Here’s how depression goes. At some point, you start to think that everything sucks and doing things isn’t worth it. But you’re a sensible person so then you think “hey maybe i’m just depressed and everything doesn’t actually suck” and decide to seek help for your problem. So you do your research and find that CBT is the most effective therapy for treating depression and find a therapist who specializes in that. You start building a good relationship with your therapist and learning the practices, and then a few months later he’s no longer in your health care network so you abruptly have to get a new therapist. So then you see your new therapist but it never really clicks and without the therapist really pushing the CBT practice your depressed ass lets it fall by the wayside until therapy is just a weekly venting session and hardly anything constructive. After awhile she runs DSM-V tests on you and diagnoses you with major depression and she recommends a psychiatrist to get prescription drugs. So then you look up psychiatrists in the area and find one in your network and set up an appointment. You go to the psychiatrist and instead he diagnoses you with Bi-polar II disorder, despite the fact that you’ve never had a manic episode in your life, because according to the doctor most people diagnosed with depression are misdiagnosed and actually have Bi-polar II and he’s “never had a patient get better from SSRIs”. Which definitely seems weird because you’ve seen first hand what Bi-polar looks like and it’s not anything like what you’re experiencing, but then again you’re not familiar with Bi-Polar II and you’re a sensible enough person to not think you know more than your doctor, so you go on the mood stabilizer prescription he gives you. At your second visit you ask why you haven’t received a bill yet, because you want to make sure that it will be covered by your insurance, and they tell you that they bill monthly so if you owe anything they will send you bill at the end of the month. The mood stabilizers have no effect on your depression, and with each visit the dosage is increased until the maximum safe dosage is reached, still with no effect on the depression. After your 7th visit, you receive a bill for your first visit from 8 months ago, because apparently that doctor is only in your network when he’s operating out of a different clinic, not this one. You talk with the insurance company and they show you that when you search for doctors in your network there is fine italic print at the bottom of the search results telling you that doctors may practice at more than one facility and only are covered at the address listed next to “Associated Hospital” in their search results listing. So then you call the clinic to see if maybe they can make good on the fact that their receptionist told me that I should be covered and that I should be receiving a bill monthly if I owe anything, and that I didn’t receive a bill for my first visit until after I had seen the doctor 6 more times. But they tell you that all they can do for you is offer a payment plan. And so you have to abruptly stop seeing the psychiatrist right before you have a chance of maybe getting prescribed an SSRI (because it takes about 8 months to rule out that mood stabilizers are not the correct drug before you can try something else). And then you add it all up, and realize over the last 2 years you put more than 10% of your net pay into mental health services. And then you realize you could have bought a Corvette with that money. And then you buy a Corvette.

That's pretty much depression, in general. ",23May2018,2
50,"Hi haha well I have this thing I wrote and I had fun with it so I wanted to share. Unfortunately the most active subreddit for this is r/OCpoetry and they require you to first give super expert detailed feedback to other people's poems. 

But English isn't my native language and I don't know jack shit about literature. So get this :D

**(This is about my mandatory army service)**

I decided to write,

Write another poem

A poem, a rap, whatever you call 'em

I'll talk about the place I ought to call home. But beware - this one will be dark, as dark as an extra chromosome ;)

This place is full of shit so I might as well start naming it

It begins under the ship floors, some four meters below - under water level where the dirt begins to show

So you pull a mattress down from under - find a place to sleep. Somewhere on the floor where the curve ain't too steep.

If you found a spot - good for you, now scoot! Because dinner's running out and that's the one thing absolute.

Wanna talk about dinner? I don't wanna rhyme ""killer"". It's obvious, mundane, Instead I'll speak my mind. Ready for a thriller?

Let me tell you about how knives got left behind. And while we're at it why not share a piece of my mind?

'Bout how back in 2012 this dude called Roy cut himself. So now we have no knives - only forks, spoons, and a shitty chef. ""Chef"" is a big word, bigger than he will get. From me, my friends, and anyone else in this crew as of yet.

You must be thinking ""hold on - what the fuck?"" Did Roy succeed?! No. He ran outta luck. Had to keep with the ship for another year and a half under constant surveilance of the mental staff.

I'm just kidding - although I shit you not, we really do have the highest suicide ratings in this horrible rot. Roy didn't kill himself. He didn't even try to. Well not on the ship and definitely not the way I write you. Roy, you're alright. :)

You want me to go on? 'Cause this is where it gets depressing. I swear to god, we're not 10% through with this shitty way of venting. 

It's taking too long - I think I have too much to say. This thing is getting lengthier and lengthier and I gotta go this isn't okay. 

I don't like talking about bad shit I had to go through. Boo-hoo doo-hoo hand this guy a tissue.

No. I'm not a complainer so let's spin this frown around - I'll tell you so many good things that came out of this countdown.

Because that is all this is: a countdown to my date. September is coming and with it gone all the hate.

That sweet day I'll be released and all this hell won't matter - except the good I took from it and the friends I met there.

In the ship you get mad skill whether it's cooking, talking, or coping with the urge to kill. 

Your speech gets improved, your social skills get edgy. Mostly though you learn to deal with life being unsteady. You never know when you'll be home, or when you'll return. So many times I wished for this ship to just burn.

Along with those things you also learn to give a shit. Suddenly you care about this person you've only known a bit. You wanna listen to their problems, and fight for them if you can. You wanna give them advice and save them so much pain.

I have more to write. I didn't run out of rhymes, but it's late and I wanna talk to my friends too sometimes.

So I bid you goodbye, and send your way a smile. I hope you liked this piece. Was it worthwhile?

54,"Mods at r/confession removed my post so I’ll repost it here.

I have never told the full story before. I have felt too ashamed  and helpless during the event to tell the whole story but I guess Reddit is as good of a place as any.

In 2014, the year after I had graduated HS and moved to LA, I had come back home for Halloween to visit friends and catch up. I attended a party and saw a lot of old friends, one of whom was a friend of my Ex girlfriend. 

My friend and I stood around a fire pit and talked to her, along with other people we hadn’t seen for a year or so, for a few minutes. She began speaking with my friend and it soon became obvious that he didn’t want to carry on the conversation due to his frantic look and him motioning me to help him distract her. I interjected myself into the conversation and my friend slipped away. 

She was very intoxicated and very forward with me. (I had had a few beers but I wasn’t hammered) She spoke of HS and asked me questions about what the other boys thought of her in HS. I didn’t want to offend her so I told her that she was favored well and that she shouldn’t think too much about people who said otherwise. I was very vague and avoided complimenting her directly, not because I wanted to be petty but because I wasn’t interested and didn’t want to lead her on. She took it as I was complimenting her very favorably.

As the conversation continued I realized I was only digging myself into this situation even further. I made an excuse to leave and she said she would come with me. I said I needed to go to the bathroom and she said I’ll wait outside of the door. As I stand inside the bathroom wondering what to do, I couldn’t think of anything and opened the door to go back to the party hoping someone would catch her attention. But before I could do that she pulled me into a bedroom directly across from the bedroom. 

Using her body weight to pull me in, I fell upon entry. She closed the door, locked it and grabbed me. She pushes me toward the bed and gets on top of me. I keep telling her that I can’t do this and that I just want to go back to the party. She continued to push herself onto me and tried to kiss me and my neck. She keeps telling me “it’s fine” and I keep saying “no” but she keeps pushing. I’m trying to be more forceful and she starts to say to me over and over the same thing. “I need this! I need this! I need this!” I’m telling her that she is too drunk and that I’m not interested and she keeps pushing. I said “I’m going to shove you off of me” and she tells me if I don’t go along with it then she will tell everyone at the party that I raped her.

After holding me down with her body weight for a minute or so I started crying and she kept kissing me and holding me down. She says to stop yelling or she will tell everyone, so I stop and she starts to stimulate me and gets me semi-erect. She inserts me into her and holds her hand over my mouth while she is moaning. I start to soften up and she gets up and asks what’s wrong and if I didn’t fuck her well enough she would say I raped her. I couldn’t get hard and while I cried she must’ve sympathized or lost interest because she started to get dressed and said I didn’t have to worry about her telling anyone and got dressed then left the room. 

I’ve never told this to anyone and I’m tired of holding it in. I realize male rape victim seems like an oxymoron but it’s not. Im ashamed of myself for not doing anything and embarrassed as a human being to allow that to happen to myself. Thanks for reading. Please don’t judge me

66,"Throwaway.

So I'm 30 years old. I am the manager of all lifeguards at a nude beach. Myself and the other lifeguards wear uniforms. The women wore one piece suits and whistles, while the men wore white tank tops, red trunks and whistles.

One day, I chastised this geeky college freshman lifeguard James. Someone was in the water, and he hesitated before Hannah had to dive in and save them. I said that his timidness could've cost someone their life.

He finally snapped ""I'm sick of you berating me all the time for being so timid. I quit!!!""

I said ""Really?""

He says ""Yes!!!""

I said ""Fine. Hand over your uniform then.""

He said ""E---Excuse me?""

I said ""Your uniform was given to you by management. You have to hand it over.""

He said ""B---but I don't have anything else...with me. And the lifeguard shack is 2 miles down the beach!""

I said ""That's okay. The beach is clothing-optional. You're well within the rules. Listen James. You can't leave with company property. Either you strip down and hand over your uniform, or walk back to the lifeguard shack, change, and walk all the way back here. Your choice. Of course, we all know you're too timid anyway to take option #1.""

He looked me in the eye, and he yanked off his whistle, pulled off his white tank top, revealing his slightly chubby belly, and after a shaky-handed pause, dropped his trunks, and handed them to me.

There was James. His 5'7 tall body, lily-white from the neck down. His chubby belly in full view. His adorable little package just flapping in the afternoon sun.

To his credit, staring right up at my 5'10 frame.

As naked as the day he was born.

After about 10 seconds, he realized I was holding every stitch of fabric he had on his body and...he subconsciously covered his penis with his hands.

I smiled like the cat who ate the canary. I won the staredown lol.

Then that skyclad geek turned and sheepishly walked 2 miles back to the lifeguard station, unemployed and bare-assed naked lol.

70,"I used to be depressed when I was achieving things. I completed my bachelor and master's degree whilst feeling out of control with my emotions and hardly understanding my feelings of emptiness, and I completed them with good grades, somehow. I did volunteering work at a local mental health organisation whilst studying, and I worked as a psychologist research assistant after my master's. Even though I was down, I had desires, dreams, ambitions- and they were my own, not influenced by my family or peers. Now I don't have those things- I don't care to strive for anything. 

After working for a few years at 3 different places, I decided to take on a second post-grad 2.5 years ago, but had 0 motivation and it was bringing me down that I couldn't push through, like a dark cloud over my head. It wasn't hard; I found the course almost annoyingly easy, I was just not engaged at all. When motivated myself enough to turn in a paper, I would get very high marks, even though I would leave it to the last minute to write it up. I stopped caring about everything. I couldn't actualise all these things I thought I wanted to do anymore. I was later diagnosed with severe inattentive type ADHD- at the age of 30, after 2 years of weekly CBT, they realised it was more than depression when treatment wasn't working. 6 months later, I decided to take an interruption of studies last September, because I didn't want to waste any more time and money on something that I couldn't motivate myself to do. I plan on returning in September, and I'm 8 months into my break. 

After taking the break, I felt relief and I felt free. At first the opinions of my friends and family bothered me, as they questioned me on when I was going to get my life back on track. I was angry and at the same time I looked down on them for not seeing that my mental health was more important, and I felt like their concerns were more about status rather than on personal wellbeing. I also felt that they were a bit envious, as their remarks could sometimes edge on maliciousness hidden behind jokes, and the reason being that I am financially self sufficient as I have an income from a property that I own, and it doesn't really impact me to take a year off for myself. Even if I don't have a high income (I have €350 a month left after rent, I also have decent savings from my work before as backup), I get by quite comfortably and can afford to go to music concerts and a couple of short budget trips abroad (I live in Europe and it's cheap to travel to close countries), as I don't really like to spend a lot of money on materialistic things like items/clothes or on alcohol and eating out. I cycle as transport, and I live in a houseshare with 4 others in the city centre. I also go to free events/exhibitions and spend time in nature. I'm basically frugal. For this reason, they like to tell me that I'm doing nothing worthy with my days. After a few months, I started to accept that their comments  only annoyed me if I allowed it, and I moved on from caring and focused on how I was feeling when they didn't make me feel guilty over my decision. I started to feel very neutral about things, and it was a great relief. 

The thing is that after 8 months of taking a break, I don't feel depressed anymore, but I also don't feel happiness. I feel neural, all the time, and not in a good way- I don't feel numb, I don't feel content, I don't feel anxious, I don't feel sad, I don't feel happy. I question my own existence all the time. I don't want a relationship; I don't want closeness and I don't really think about sex. I'm attractive and several men I know are interested and I get approached, but I don't even have a sex drive, and I don't feel lonely at all. I don't want children- because I wish I was not conceived and brought into this world. I feel like there is nothing that I want from life that could give me feel like it's all worth it. I worked for years with refugees, I worked in community outreach with vulnerable people and I studied psychology because I want to help people, so although these things made me feel like I had purpose before, I don't feel it anymore and I feel disillusioned by life. I don't feel suicidal, either. I feel like I'll just go on living, but no matter what I do, I can't escape how ultimately meaningless it all is. 

I don't think I have felt happy for years, except now that I don't have that dark cloud from uni or from other people's opinions, I don't feel down anymore either. I fill my days with simple activities, instead of being inactive all day; I cook all my meals (I'm a veggie and I keep it healthy and simple) that I take the time to eat. I practice yoga and workout or go swimming several times a week. I read books, fiction and non-fiction on psychology/philosophy/politics. I go to philosophy cafes twice a month every other Friday (also I've been self-teach philosophy for 4 years). I go to free art exhibitions and cultural festivals at least once a month. Take part in hobbies. I spend time with family, especially my little nieces whom I care deeply for and I help out my elderly parents as much as I can (their gardening, fixes around the house, take them to all their medical appointments, go to cafes with them, make sure they're reading/keeping active). Still, the love I feel doesn't seem to be enough for me to feel fulfilled- I am still mostly dispassionate. 

What is this? Is there a ""cure""? ",23May2018,1
71,"First time posting here.

Lately I've  been realizing that I have this pattern of feeling responsible for the  emotional well being of the people around me to the point where it's  completely draining.

When I was  relatively young, a family member committed suicide. Many years later, I  took gatekeeper/suicide prevention training, I guess hoping I could  stop it from happening to another family. Since taking the training, I  have used it with 3 different friends in less than a year. I have very  vivid memories of every incident.

About a  week ago, a friend \[27? M\] I hadn't spoken to in many months messaged  me out of nowhere to say he was suicidal while I was home visiting  family. I ended up calling police. I was cool and calm talking to police  and to my friend, and I felt fine when I found out he was doing OK in  the hospital, but two days later I was a complete emotional wreck.

I  work in a field that has nothing to do with psychology or social work  or anything like that, and I have never struggled with depression or  thoughts of suicide. I'm not sure why it always seems to be me that  people in distress reach out to.

I went  on a lunch date with a friend\[25 F\] I've known since kindergarten the  same afternoon. We are still close, I was her maid of honour not that  long ago, but I'm starting to feel like our conversations are getting  more and more one\-sided. I made a comment about my mom's business and  she replied with “I didn't know your mom had a business”. Combined with  the events of earlier that day, it felt like a lightning bolt. I started  evaluating what exactly I mean to the people in my life.

Flash  forward to this weekend. I'm juggling full\-time grad school with a  whack of extracurricular commitments and it is not at all going  smoothly. Feeling like a failure, I cancelled on a hiking trip I'd said I  would go on with a friend \[25 M\]. This friend is an international  student who moved to my country pretty recently. He comes from a very  different culture and has lots of questions about how things are in  Canada. When we first met, he asked me if I would be his go\-to to help  him with any Canada\-related questions, and I said yes. We are friends  now, but I would never go to him to talk about any of my problems: our  conversations are often just about him. I like helping him and I like  helping people in general, but I was honest with myself this time: I  didn't have the energy.

I feel like all  these incidents are related to me feeling emotionally responsible for  other people, for basically anyone who I think has it tougher than me. I  do like helping my friends, and in some cases \(like when they tell you  they are going to off themselves\) it's the only option.

But...where do you draw the line? How do you make sure there is a balance between give and take?

TL;DR:  I feel like I'm everyone's go\-to when they need social, emotional, or  crisis/suicide intervention support; I am starting to avoid seeing my  friends because I'm exhausted.",23May2018,2
