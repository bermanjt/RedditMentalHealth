0,"Whether platonically or romantically. I might be shallow, but whenever I enter a new group I mentally pick out who looks cool to be friends with and who looks good. Usually, over the course of whatever time we have to interact, the same people I picked out I eventually build a relationship with. It always happens naturally without me actively trying to interact with them and a lot of times they initiate. I always thought it was weird but I feel like there’s like a scientific reason behind it or something

3,"I’m in my senior year of high school, and I’ve been going through depression since last school year.

Last year, I was close to killing myself, but this year I’m actually trying to head onto the right path! Well... tried.

I can’t concentrate in school. I went to my dad two times in the past about it, but it was “nothings wrong with you” or “stop making excuses for failing”.

So I never really went to him about anything anymore dealing with personal stuff, last year when I mentioned that I was depressed, a pretty big thing to mention actually. He just basically said the equivalent of, “just be happy” not that specifically, but more of, he gets me stuff, why am I not happy “I just don’t get it” he said.

Whelp, fast forward to this year and I’m on a good path to improving and today I came up with the solution of not being able to concentrate... make a study area in my room.

Get a border between my bed and tv area, and my desk, allowing for it to feel like a different environment and allowing me to have a study mindset when I go into it. It’s a really good plan.

But when I asked my dad if I can buy the borders, “We don’t need to be adding on anything, you need to be packing. We’re moving in just a few weeks. I’d get it if you and your brother shared the same room, but when you close those doors it’s just you in there.”

“... it’s like, a mental thing...”

“I just don’t get it...”

Here I am, desperately trying to pass. You never helped deal with my concentration problem, you never really helped me with my depression, and you see your son, trying to make an effort to study, and you just treat it like I’m doing something wrong... “I just don’t get it”. I just don’t get why you suck so much at being a supportive father... I just don’t get why you made me the tense person I am today

...I just don’t get why I can never go onto a better path...

So here I am... typing this in my closet, probably my new crying place, luckily the racks are too low for hanging...",26Sep2018,4
4,"It’s a long story, for the main point of it, get to the bottom. But please do read and share some insight on the situation. I have no idea what to do and it’s tearing me apart. 

 I’ve known my friend since elementary (10 years) we grew up hanging out in a small town always trying to find something to do. We knew everything about each other and each other’s siblings.  We hung out every single day in middle school, even when I got a girlfriend that I also hung out with everyday for about 9 months.  Growing up, he was the good kid. He went to church with his family every Sunday, was kind and nice to everyone, I was always getting in trouble and as I got older it was just more trouble. Even though we had two different types of friend groups and lifestyles, we still hung out everyday after school. Eventually I ended up in enough trouble that I ended up in a youth center for 6 months. They let me out just in time to start high school with a clean slate. When I got back home I called my girlfriend and she told me she was now dating my best friend.  She had already been a very manipulative and low person, so I wasn’t even hurt by it. He was already on my next to call list, but he didn’t answer. We started school a few days later, so I just talked to him when I first seen him. He walked past me so I went up to him and told him I’m not upset about it and I’m not going to let it effect our friendship as long as he didn’t either. He hugged it out and then the bell rang and we went separate ways. I didn’t hear from him for about a year until he came to me for some bud.  He occasionally hit me up every 6 months or more, but after we graduated I didn’t see or hear from him for two years. He was still dating the same girl at that time, so when he messaged me about a year and a half ago, I figured they’d finally split.  Me messaged me while I was at work and asked if I wanted to hang out, I was kind of surprised and a little suspicious but I told him to come over after work. We started talking and he told me they’d  broken up and she made him loose all his friends, so he doesn’t have anyone and she some how made him loose his job, so he was depressed about it all.  I started inviting him out to parties or invite him along when I was going out to do something. He was a little awkward, but so was the situation, so when he would say or do something strange, it didn’t seem like anything out of ordinary. After a few months of him not being able to find a job, I decided to to have him come install cabinets with me.  I was in charge of training him, so we drove around and worked together all day. He seemed a little slow to grab things I felt like were basic concepts, but I also pick up in things very fast.  After a few months, his older brother(I’ve also known my whole life) came to work with us too and so me and him partnered up so I could train him.  By this time me and my friend had already fallen back into the same comfortability we had as best friends before. We  started to hang out everyday after work, and partied together on the weekends. After a while of that, I felt like I knew him completely again, until he started repeating past memories he’s told me before but with dramatic change in only one or two of the details. He started acting strange, if we weren’t together he’d call me and ask what I was up too, but wouldn’t ask to hang out and would even decline if I asked him too and was just really bipolar. I thought maybe he’d started talking too, now both of our’s ex, so I started talk to his brother about it one day at work.  He told me that my friend was basically “borderline schizophrenic”  and that if he doesn’t get enough sleep and keep on top of his vitamins and diet, then the symptoms appear, and if his physical health goes down, so does his mental health. I went home and did as much research of the illness and other like it as I possibly could in one night, and the signs and symptoms match up exactly to those of bipolar-depression and schizophrenia. On every article I read it said it’s best to get treatment to mange it as soon as possible before it can progress and become irreversible. Unfortunately his entire family is in complete denial about it and won’t bother seeking a dr or even getting it checked out to confirm what it is he actually has. So for a while he lived with his brother and he made sure he took his vitamins and ate good. And I was there for emotional support and make sure he didn’t do any drugs or do anything that’s known to progress symptoms. We maintained this for a while, but he ended up getting in a fight with his brother over him doing adoral, and so he moved into his oldest brothers house. Once he did this, I noticed an instead change in him. I started working for a different company so I wasn’t around as much, but I went over to his house as much as possible. He was still taking his vitamins and drinking water, but he didn’t ever eat. He didn’t want to make food, and his oldest brother worked out of state, so there wasn’t much in the house to eat. I started cooking for him every once in a while and would even stay with him weeks at a time because he hated being there alone.  He ended up loosing his job about the same time that the place I was working for laid me off.  He would go up and down with his symptoms. most times he was his pretty usual self with the occasional wtf moment, but it’s just gradually getting worse and worse. He came up with the idea of getting a job at a cabinet shop a few towns over. My vehicle was down and since he had just lost his previous job I got him, I knew I wouldn’t be able to rely on him as a ride, but I figured he’d be able to have it together long enough for me to get my shit together. As soon as we started it was a rocky slope. We showed up our first day and he just acted like he hated his life all day long. We were doing something we like and working together again, but he just looked so lost and just out of it. I didn’t want it to affect the way they looked at me so I just worked hard throughout the rest of the day. We went back to my place and he said he was to tired to drive home and he wanted to stay here. So I let him stay, and when I woke him up the next morning he said he was sick and couldn’t go. I tried and tried to get him to go but he wouldn’t. I texted the boss and let him know that he was sick and I didn’t have a ride. He texted me back and said if I didn’t make it in, then don’t even bother coming back. I borrowed my friends truck and made it to work with out him, but him knowingly let me use his vehicle. I then get a call from him freaking out about where his truck was. I told him and he remembered and calmed down. I he did the exact same thing a few hours later when i was driving home.  He came and got his truck but didn’t say much. I struggled to find rides the first week but still made it, and went over to check on him on days I hadn’t heard from him. He ending up having a break down and freaking out on his entire family that week but seemed to get it together again, so we got back to the original plan, but it’s been rough. He’s a different person every morning. He came over to my house one day after work and started tearing threw my roommates room so I kicked him out and so he raged out and tried to fight me.  He keeps asking me favors, but I’m still mad about that incident so I just end up annoyed at him for asking. I’ve been patient and I’m trying to be still, but commuting  to work together and working together all day has me at my end. He has random fits of anger triggered by almost anything, so if I talk to him, he ends up saying something to piss me off, something I’d punch anyone else for saying, so I just ignore him and keep working but then he realizes he’s pissed me off, so he’ll just keep trying to have a conversation or hang out with me when I have no want to even be in his presence. I’m makes me so sad to say it, but right now he’s just a ride to work to me.  He’s about to loose his job, and he talks about quitting every other day. I’ve got enough money with my next paycheck I’m a couple days, I’ll be able to have my vehicle, which is a lot nicer and better on gas, so the plan was to continue the commute together in my car.  But right now I resent him. I don’t know what to do. I completely understand it’s not all his fault, but he just treats everyone like shit so No one wants to put up with him or be around him. So then he gets depressed and it worries me, but I can’t stand to be around him either.  I have so much on my own plate that I can’t keep worrying about his.  I feel like I’m in the wrong for walking away from him at a time like this, but his behavior and moods are so toxic it’s starting to affect me. And since we’re together so much, It’s starting to affect my life and my career. For my better sake, I need to get away. But fits his better sake, I should stay. I couldn’t handle knowing he didn’t something to himself because he had no one at all to turn too. ",26Sep2018,5
5,"From the time I was a little kid I was always wishing for the next thing to get here. I wish it was my birthday. I wish it was summer vacation. I wish Christmas would hurry up and get here. I wish I was 16 already so I could drive. I wish I was in college. I wish I was out of college.

Every time I wished something like that my dad would always remind me, “Son, don’t wish your life away.” My response was always the same dismissive thing. Yeah what do you know? 

Not much has changed except my life has passed me by far more than I ever could really imagine. I never thought I’d actually be here now at this age, at this point in life. 

One of the latest things I wished for was when summer was heating up, fuck this summer was hot. I was walking my dogs later and later because it was getting hotter and hotter and I looked down at them after wiping sweat from my forehead and said, “Guys, I can’t wait for fall so it gets cooler.” Then I thought about what I said and realized, well shit, you guys are getting up in age now and we have less summers together than we’ve already had. We are on the downhill portion of our time together. Little did I know then how true that would be. 

Not too many days later I noticed my oldest dog was drinking more water than normal. Yeah man, it’s hot you better hydrate. Hmm, why are you not eating like you normally do, you have been consistent your whole life with that. I guess I better keep an eye on things but I guess I’d probably drink more if I had a fur coat on in this god forsaken heat. The eating decreased and the drinking increased and for my peace of mind I had to get him checked out. 

One thorough vet trip later and he was a pretty healthy dude for a 12 year old but man, he really isn’t eating like his old self. 

Then one night we went on our typical mile walk and they went to bed. In the morning he could barely get up to get his water. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. I knew instantly that this was basically it. Whatever it was had taken all he had to give even though he seemed pretty much fine last night. 

I could barely explain to the vet that morning when I went in what was going on my throat had swelled up so much as I tried to hold back the tears. Turns out there’s a lump in his stomach area and it doesn’t look good but we don’t know for sure. When I ask the doc what do we do now he suggests operating so we can see what it is and if it’s operable or if we just don’t wake him up. Goddamn it. 

When the time comes I hand him back to them to take him into surgery, I tell him goodbye and I love him. This was the last time I’d see him I thought. Well the doctor comes in and says, “Well, the good news is it’s operable, the bad news is chances he can recover are about 50/50.” Shit. I don’t want to lose him but I don’t want to put him through pain and suffering to assuage my guilt. I ask the vet what he would do if it was his dog and he says he’d operate. Good enough for me let’s do it. 

Little man went on the operating table weighing 29 lbs and he came out 1.5 lbs lighter because that’s how big the tumor was they removed from his intestine. Surgery went great and now he just needs to have energy to recover. Oh and we need to get that pathology report back on the tumor. Whatever, that can wait, we have a hard road ahead still. 

It took some loving and some smart thinking by the vet staff but not only did he start eating again but he recovered and came home like his old cuddly self. I loved on him every minute I could, I was so thankful that I get to see him so happy again. Then my phone rang. 

Lymphoma. Fuck. 

Over the next two months I spoiled the absolute hell out of that guy, he never had to want for pets, he got all the treats his little furry butt could handle. Then the day came when I looked at him and it was that same feeling the morning he was rushed to the vet except this time there would be no life saving operation. It was time to say goodbye for good. 

It was the second dog I’ve held while saying a final goodbye and it just gets harder each time. I made the appointment for that afternoon because I couldn’t make it happen earlier. He couldn’t even walk but I would carry him outside so he could lay in the sun and I’d sit on the floor with him and just pet him and tell him how much I loved him and he wouldn’t have to fight this much longer. He had no appetite at all but he was convinced to eat a couple pieces of bacon. I never gave him bacon before but today he could have as much as he could handle. 

So here we are. It’s beginning to feel like fall a little more and I can walk my other dog, my only dog now, without breaking a sweat most evenings. I don’t wish for cooler days and for fall to really get here. Now all I wish for are those hot days before I knew what was just around the bend. I fucking miss that guy so goddamn much. ",26Sep2018,2

Background: I have been working in restaurants for more than half of my life, started at 15, still doing it, in my 30’s now. It is the only type of job I have had, aside from the year I was a resident assistant at college. It has paid for everything. School in NYC, cross country moves, and booze (not alcoholic status, restaurant people are dining out people) I have worked all over the US, in various types and price points. 

I have loved my job until I was promoted to General Manager. I hate my job! I got promoted about 2 years ago, everything was great while I was assistant manager, and I was able to be the ‘face’ of the restaurant. Our GM was great at the Back of House (BOH) aspect, office and kitchen, not human interaction, he could talk to guests, but I have always been great talking with them. Those were our roles. He handled day to day BOH and office, I handled the floor and guest interactions. Then he was moved to another restaurant. I knew what was in store, me promoted and handling all of it on my own. I was encouraged by everyone around me, owners and other managers, staff and parents, they all said I was ready. (IMHO, I was not. I hadn’t been taught how to do payroll, inventory, ordering. I was given a 10 minute breakdown of each) 

I have loved every moment of my job until about 4 months ago, since I have been on my own. I am in a city where my only friends are the ones I work with, work people and personal people is a hard thing to balance when they are pulling double duty. I have only been here a few years and I miss the flexibility of being able to get to my family easily, I only live an 8 hour drive, but I need to be able to get the days off, I can’t.

I hate my job and yet I love so many things about it. I hate my job despite being great at it! My staff and friends are great! The people I work for are kind and generous. The other managers are incredibly supportive. But I hate what the job has done to my personal life. I am at work from 10 until 9 pm most days, I work for 5 days and usually have to pop in to check on something that is broke/payroll/or have to cover for a shift that I couldn’t get covered because so many of us are wearing multiple hats, and I can’t be short a body on the floor. We are small, well run machine, but the constant little things are killing me! And it is never ending at work, I feel for everyone of my staff members when they have an emergency, I take it all home.   Then, at home, I am dealing with anxiety and depression, which I have never had before. My pets are getting anxious. 

Sorry, I am venting. 

I have options that include me quitting and moving to live with my grandpa (a lot closer to family) and saving money (which I feel is becoming more important); staying in an unfamiliar city and starting over; or waiting it out and seeing if it gets better. 

I just feel so lost. 

Glass of wine, TLDR; I have always loved working in the restaurant industry until I was made GM, I hate what the job has done for my personal life (60 hrs/week), adding anxiety and depression into the mix, (single, also, so impossible to meet someone new with crazy hours). I have options. ",26Sep2018,2

11,"I'm currently taking the medical assisting program and wish I could drop the classes. I chose taking these classes in the first place because I like science related subjects and thought it would be cool to also be in the medical field. I never thought it over because I tend to overthink things and the pressure to start college this year was huge. Overall, being a medical assistant doesn't appeal to me as I thought it would, despite already doing some research on it. I've taken a couple of tests to see what careers would best fit my personality or whatever but that didn't help. I'm really not into anything besides porn, watching anime, and spending time doing useless things. I like art, music, movies but can't see myself spending the rest of my life with an artistic career. I really don't see any point in having to love my job, search for purpose, and have fun. I just want a job good enough to keep things interesting and allow me to provide for a future family because that's what I want the most. I tend to lose focus on important things and lose interest in anything I try, which makes it extremely hard to stick with any ideas I want to pursue. It would be amazing if I could be like one of those anime characters that have a set dream and follow through.

12,"Negative section:

I'm so tired of this. I just want to find someone I can be in a relationship with for a decent while. Instead I keep having strings of first dates that go nowhere and occasionally a second and very rarely a third. But it feels like every person I meet who I get to that third date with so easily just...decides that it's not worth going forward. They must have no issues getting to third dates I guess. I'm sure after two sentences of my post you assumed I was a guy, and if you did you were right.

It just feels like it's always so casual to them when they reject me. Like it's nothing to just pick up and find another guy, in contrast to me where I have to spend a month or two just to get to a second date with someone. I only have so many weekends in a year and I work full time, and it's difficult to meet during the week. I'm worried I'm going to be stuck in dating limbo for a long time and the pool is just going to shrink.

The worst part is always starting over. I've been in one relationship before and starting over from that was rough enough. Date. Start over. Date, date. Start over. Date, date, date, holy crap could this be it? Nope, start over. Date. Start over.

Positive section:

On the other hand, guys in their upper twenties and early thirties apparently have it better with regard to dating prospects. So I suppose I have that to look forward to in the coming years. In addition, I should be glad I'm able to get dates at all, considering a year or so ago I was struggling a lot more. I've come a long way.

K so, lately I’ve been missing my past as an obese person. Idk it’s weird lmao. (Talking about myself) like when you’re that fat and you’re eating (another) burger you tell yourself “well, might as well eat it, I’m too far gone to go back” which is why at least I kept eating. At some point you just feel too far gone to actually be able to do anything aka you give up on yourself before you even start. 

Well, I’ve kinda been having in n out craving and I’m like “holy shitttt I just want ONE 😭” lmao but at the end of the day I know I’m not gonna get it. 

It’s been a little over 4-5ish? Years since I last had junk food. Most of the time I don’t even miss it but yeahhhh.. 

Even if I could I wouldn’t go back though which is why when I have those cravings I don’t go out and get some in n out. I love how much I’ve accomplished, I love how I feel since I’ve lost that weight. 

As time goes by, those fat rolls I had turned into being skinny, as time passes they’re turning into muscle. 

It’s like I see myself in the mirror everyday when I shower right?

18,"(long post, sorry)

Hi. I’m a 17 year old girl and I just wanted to share this little secret of mine that has become a somewhat big part of my life and identity.

When I was 11, my brother died. It was a weird time for me because grief wasn’t the first emotion I felt. It took a while for it to settle in. He was the only one that took care of me since my mom worked long hours and my dad is out of the picture. 

We used to play video games together but we only had one controller so we’d take turns. After he passed I stopped playing them. I stopped doing a lot of things after his passing. I also started a lot of things but never got around to finishing them. When I was thirteen my mom got me my first IPod touch, the first generation one. Everyone at school had this app called kik, so I downloaded it and at first it was just for friends, but through online forums and social media I got a lot of strangers kik names and started talking to them on there.

These were random people, young, old, female, male. I talked to them as if I was trying to be friends with them, most of them were creeps but there were a few gems — cool people — I’ve had pleasant conversations with. Some I’ve stayed friends with for a while, some I didn’t but it was natural since we lived so far away. This tendency to pick up strangers, give them my kik, and initiate conversations with them became a routine for me. It got to a point where coming home after school to talk to my internet friends was the high light of my day. I continued this for years.

Fast forward to this moment. Earlier today I had met some cool dudes online ranging from ages 22–40. I added three or four guys on Snapchat, *only* as friends haha I’m aware of the connotation Snapchat has. 

I took a moment to think about all the wonderful people I talked to over the years and wondered where they were now and if they were all doing well, I sent up a little prayer. I like listening to people talk about themselves, especially the things they are passionate about. Even if I don’t really understand it. 

While I’m thinking about this, I start connecting dots and suddenly I come to a realization. All the people I’ve befriended online were older men. Just a coincidence, right? No, because I actively seek out guys to talk to. I was unaware I was doing this until I really thought about it. I was unconsciously making those decisions. I didn’t mind talking to girls but I prefer guys. 

This is absolutely not for sexual reasons or in hopes of a relationship. I just wanted a male best friend. An older guy I can talk with normally, ask for advice, confide in when I’m having a rough day, poke fun at him, and stuff. I realized that ever since I was 13 I’ve been trying to fill that hole in my heart that my big brother left behind. I yearned for a friendship with an older man, and each guy I’ve talked to has temporarily filled that hole but it was never the same as my brother y’know?  

Anyways, now that I’m self aware I don’t really know what to do with this knowledge of myself. I enjoy talking to strangers online but I think maybe I’m gonna seek out professional help. I don’t know if this is healthy for me, I can’t keep doing this forever.

If you read this, thank you.

24,"It's really tiring. Not a day goes by where someone with any connection or affinity for Russia or Russians goes unquestioned. Racist statements and  ethnic slurs are de jure, and it seems that people actually encourage it, rather than denounce it as they would for any other race or ethnic group.

It's sad that you can't ever go online and say you're proud of your heritage or roots, lest people immediately accuse you of being some 'bot',  and people will ask questions about Russians [that would be unthinkable about any other ethnic group.

Reddit isn't much better, and mods  of the ''anti-racist'' subreddits seem to be worse than regular users. [I was banned](https://i.redd.it/x27huznajvn11.jpg) from a subreddit for criticising someone calling me ''Boris'' while simultaneously denying racism against Russians, and for daring to moderate /R/Russophobic, a subreddit dedicated to exposing anti-Russian racism, and was I myself was banned from /R/offmychest for a post lamenting about racism against Russians, and it just seems to get worse by the day as journalists fuel the feeding frenzy and make things worse for all of us.

Even when in everyday life, when someone finds out you're Russian, they'll immediately start asking you if you are an alcoholic, and even employers will ask if you have 'any connection to Putin', though they always assure that it is done in jest (I wish I could say this was a joke, but in my old industry, it really wasn't). People just assume that you're an automaton without a soul, and only a single-minded purpose of subterfuge.


I'm just really sick and tired of it, and wish more people would do something about it.

And because housing prices are growing, employment is becoming more competitive and I am not hardworking as my parents. I don't think I would be able to enjoy the same kind of lifestyle I had before.

30,"I've worked at my current job for 3 years now in higher level private security. I've come to know a lot of great, and indeed, not so great people and as you can imagine, this makes our turnover a little inconsistent.

People who tend to stay longer than a year grow on me, and while I can never say I've ever hung out with a co-worker outside of work, it still stings more than a little everytime one of them leaves for whatever reason. My latest co-worker leaving is now officially a police officer, and the process itself took the entire time he's been employed with me. I was there for him everyday he had 15 hour days between home, the academy, and his mandatory volunteer hours. He struggled, as anyone would, and I felt particularly fortunate to be in a position to try and help him through with kind words or encouragement.

Well, that day I always referenced to him when things got hard has finally come, and his last day is next week. I'm so proud of him. He worked hard, put in the time, and earned it himself, but to me, though I'd never tell him, it's bitter sweet. I worry about his safety, among many other things of course, but I guess I'm just sad to know I'll have to go without him now as well as train his replacement, and restart the clock on a professional relationship with someone new. Something that in time will likely also come to an end.

 And as I type this, reminding myself this is probably the 4th or 5th person I've gotten close to at work before they left, I think I'm ready to admit to myself that it's because I consider them a friend. I don't really have friends, by my own poor decisions, not due to anyone else's fault, but  some of these people have treated me better than anyone I'd ever call friend. I remember going to his graduation ceremony, tired as I was directly after working, because he had mentioned it was important to him that I go. It made me feel special to be told that, that I was important. 

I know someone will inevitably just say, ""this doesn't mean you can't still hang out!"" And I appreciate that sentiment, however, I have some serious social anxiety and trust issues, combined with the fact he'll of course be busier than ever. The only reason this sort of thing has happened for me now and in the past is because work forces you to interact with others.

37,"It’s interesting, and I’m sure people here can attest, that as we grow older we lose something. We are told all the time to enjoy our youths, and to enjoy being young while it lasts. When I was younger I only half understood what this meant. I thought it just sucks to grow old, lol. This isn’t the case. There is something one loses when they reach a certain age, and it is different for everyone. It’s innocence. 

I recently lost my father to cancer. It was the first real encounter with death I’ve had. Sure I’ve known people who have died, but I wasn’t very close with them. The closest person before my father was my grandfather, but he was very old and I guess it made more sense in my head. My father died before his time, and it was earth shattering. 

I honestly have a hard tome remembering how I thought/felt before he got sick and before he inevitably passed away. It’s hard to even imagine. I changed that day he lost his life. I understood there and then the pain of watching someone suffer and fight only to lose. Fuck it hurt.

Now months later I still look at the world in such a different light. Mortality MEANS something to me now, like it never did before. But what I lost, that youthful innocence, that content ignorance of the mortality of yourself and your loved ones, I never want back. Life was easier then, but I would never sacrifice what I have learned to return to that state of mind. But, if you have yet to lose that part of yourself, enjoy it. It won’t last forever. That’s almost guaranteed.

Not sure what I hope to accomplish writing this, I guess it’s just been on my mind a lot lately. Thank you if you took the time to read this. Sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes, I’m typing on my phone.

43,"I dont know where to begin.... for 3 years I was working for a fast food restuarant. I never wanted to become a manager but after dropping out of university because I couldn't afford it, I decided I needed to stick with food to at least start a life. I moved from a shift manager to a general manager very quickly (less than a year) and was a manager that fixed the fucked up stores. I fixed and ran 3 different stores within a year, but hated every moment of being a GM. Each store was worse than the one prior, saw no raises even though I got promised one each time I moved stores, so I started looking for a new line of work. 

One of my part time employees recommended me to apply at his full time job, a pipe shop. Though I don't smoke anymore, I admire glass, the people, and use CBD and kratom and have quite a decent understanding and experience on with a lot of the job. The job also paid 35k a year. I applied, landed it, quit my job as a GM and started working full time a month ago.

Well the owner would always go on about every new employee needing 3 write ups in the first month to be considered an official employee.  Really he just wanted to cover his ass so no one could file for unemployment. Anyways. Last week, I was working at a different location than the one I normally do, and gentleman got 80 bucks worth of shit. His card declined,  and the machines in this store dont beep at all during any part of the sale. (My main store did) I did not notice this guys card declined; he walked out. It was brought to my attention, and one of my superiors from my main store had a talk with me about it. Just be more careful, you're totally fine though you're doing great! You'll be written up but other than you're okay dude. He reassured me multiple times.

Apparently not. I never did receive nor sign the write up, but later last week (Sunday or so) I was covering a shift at that same location. I was working with 2 guys too; one newer and one that's been there for 6 months or so. one of them took 2 kratom shots (24 bucks a pop) for him and the newer guy. I was in the back eating food when he took them in the back. I did not see him pay nor did I hear a register open, and after taking the shots he placed them in the ""sample/broken bottle"" box we had. It seemed fishy but I didnt say anything. I did not see him pay, but I couldn't of being in the back.

Being a manager for almost 2 years, I've dealt with plenty of theft especially running stores in a shitty part of the neighborhood. I brought it up to hr; he asked if I would go with him to talk to them and back up what I said. Me being so new; I said I dont know. I didnt see him steal but I also didnt see him not steal. He said okay; I get it, I'll look into it and let you know. Well I got to work today, again working at the same store I saw this employee potentially steal from. An hour goes by, and the hiring manager for the company pops up. Pulls me in the back... and fired me. 

All his reasoning was I dont think you're a good fit here, between the 80$ walk off and accusing someone of theft but not backing it up, thatd be like not showing up for court. You'll no longer be working here, give me yours keys.

I didnt question it. I just got my shit and left in shock. I'll never get a real explanation why, as I dont think it's the reason... the entire month I've been working full time I've been complimented and praised over my performance. I got told the dude with the 80$ walk off was okay; just to be more careful. I guess I never should of opened my mouth about the potential theft, but I never solely accused him. I just told the guy in hr what I saw. That was it. I'm so embarrassed. I've never been fired. I loved this job. There were some sketchy things I noticed about it. Most of the people there had only been a few months, only 2 employees had been with the company for over a year between 3 different stores. But I truly enjoyed it... I didnt know I could enjoy work. Then this. I got a fiance and her child to support; we bought a house together in March. I dont have much for savings; but the two of us have a small oh shit fund we just started building. She makes enough for us to coast for a month or two; but I don't even know what I want to do anymore... I was just so blind sided.

School and my mother are both pressuring me to go to College. I have no real interest in College... I mean I would go if I had a goal or career I wanted, but I don’t. It seems like a waste of time and money. 

My dad brought up an alternative, the military. He’s never served, but works with a lot of people who have. (He’s a cop.) 

They say it was a great experience and taught them a lot about life. Supposedly most of them were in shoes similar to mine. But... I don’t know. 4 years with no way out seems long.
