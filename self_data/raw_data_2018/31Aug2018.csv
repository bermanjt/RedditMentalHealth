1,"I'm pretty baked rn typing this but hear me out. Last century was the nuclear bomb, but ours is every single person who uses the internet. There hasn't been a medium in history (to my knowledge) that can affect hundreds of millions to billions of people at once. The information super highway! The nervous system of a global consciousness! The most potent weapon for (and against) the mind, chalice for those who drink the kool-aid of their favorite site, and shoulder for those who need one to cry on. I dunno, I just see something amazing about the big picture behind all of this in distant history.

These are definitely thoughts I ponder when I see 4chan capturing flags or Reddit solving crimes. We're all one gear in the clockwork, one neuron in the brain, one star in the galaxy.",31Aug2018,284
2,"Idek how to start
idk what to say
for example, i feel anxiety because of something, or I feel confused as to what exactly I feel, and I think that I'm the only person in the world who feels like this, and it just surprises me more and more when i hear that others can relate to me, 
but, I feel as though I'm not letting myself experience life, struggle, just like feel, and do.. happy and sad, anxiety and calm, confused and content
but i think i used to be able to do that?
im a writer and a musician
and it bothers me that my feelings are so scattered and .. vague
like i want to channel my feelings into my work, and I do that, and brings me relief, happiness and joy
i've been writing ever since I can remember, its something that has always been there for me, whenever i felt like it, i would write, my whole class called me an author, and about 10 professors/teachers as well
The earliest I can remember, my classroom teacher that taught us till 5th grade, she said that I write well, but lol, I always got confused at her exam questions xD they asked for logic and I was more of a creative person
Then others, 4-5 english and 3-4 native language teachers called me an author
i love it when i write a good story, when i start writing and get lost in it, when i find just the right words to describe something, it makes me feel good about myself, it makes me proud, to read it afterwards, its awesome, as well as when i write good lyrics, make a good beat or melody, its awesome really
but, it's like im not experiencing this wholly,like i could be
some things happened the past few years, I was depressed, I have social anxiety, I tend to overthink things, i broke up an almost 10 yr old friendship with my ""best friend"", because I couldn't stand her anymore, i was always her second choice and she made me cry countless times, last year I found new friends, but now I cant trust any of them anymore
and when I read online about my idols, some of them were in some kind of group with others of their art
dance group and hip-hop groups mainly
and i dont have that, i dont have musician friends, and that makes me kind of sad
and, to top it all of, i developed depersonalization (dpdr) about 4 yrs ago
if you dont know what that is, please google it cause it triggers me to talk about it,
but!!!! good news is, its getting so much better lately, I feel like I'm beating it, and im damn proud of myself
but I think that its left kind of a scar on me, with all this talk about feeling
when I was at my worst with my dpdr, I was literally emotionally numb, ironically it made me cry a lot that I couldn't feel things
But now as I said, Im recovering quite well
and yea, I feel like that's scarred me and I want to just feel things normally again, put my feelings into my work
my problem is not that i cant always be happy, far from that, i know that sadness is inevitable, but I want to experience it wholly without worrying if my feeling is valid, or just worrying in general, idk
Oh, I haven't even said a word about studying yet, lol
I'm a straight A grade student, and for this, I study all. the. time.
all day every day, at 2 am, at 5 am, at 9 pm, at 12 am, probably the whole clock 
and im in a school that I hate which doesnt help
i feel like all of this studying has had an effect on my intelligence and overall mental state
I  CONSTANTLY worry about grades, always, and the non stop studying has brought a new feeling into my life
feeling trapped
because my day would just consist of
sleep, school, eating/free time, study, sleep
and the cycle repeats
and that ""free time"" is minimal, and when i try to relax i just know that later i have to study or go to school
so im basically ""trapped""
oh, and another deal, social media
the only ones i use are reddit and twitter (and youtube if that counts as social media)
and I want to leave both of them, because when I sit down and open a social media I just feel like it consumes me, it drives me to procrastinate, not work towards my dreams, but I want to keep twitter because that's how I can keep updated with my favorite artists
and also the friends I mentioned? most of them are depressed, and so during this one year of chatting with them, I constantly tried to make them feel better, because they were always sad, i felt like it was my fault if they werent happy, and that transferred to me also always trying to make my family happy, i would convince myself that if they look ok they MUST be faking it and actually feel bad, and it made me feel bad
But I've grown out of that
anyway, i've stopped talking with most of my friends, except 3, 2 of them are depressed and I'm scared to not talk to then for a longer amount of time
Oh, and I /lowkey/ got bullied in school/me and my ex bff were loners, no one hung out with us
I am trying to get myself back to the way I was before strong and confident, I would do anything that I set my mind to
And I'm still like that!!! I'm a badass for being socially woke and thoughtful, I work out sometimes, I create art, I care about others and about myself, about the Earth too,Im caring and kind,and I dont drink, smoke or do drugs, and I dont go to parties and randomly make out with someone, unlike my classmates
I've always been proud of that, I've always been proud of myself and I love that
I can set my mind to something and I can goddamn do it. So, I'm doing my best to be the best version of myself,
I want to get off social media desperately and just live life (BUT still contact my friends and keep updated T-T)
I want to pour my feelings into my music and my writing, and I want to fight harder for my dream, I want to get a part time job from next year too, oh I never mentioned, I'm a 17 yr old girl
And I never mentioned that we live in poverty basically lol
Oh,and, the korean group BTS helped me through so much, from helping me recover from depersonalization and depression, giving me a dream and a hope through their music, to just making me smile and laugh and making me generally happy with their amazing personalities

8,"I’m a mom of 6, and my husband works away from home. He’s only home on the weekends, and even then, he’s completely unplugged from us. The “kids” are aged 10-22, and all 4 of the middle ones are extremely critical of everything I do. I have Asperger’s syndrome (now technically known as high-functioning autism) which makes me unable to intuit others’ emotional state or to read non-verbal interactions. I was verbally attacked by 2 of my kids today. I still don’t know why. 

 I have an estranged daughter-in-law who is the most manipulative person I have ever met. She has intentionally sabotaged every relationship within the immediate family that she could. She has only been completely unsuccessful in her attempts to meddle in the relationship between me and my husband and our oldest daughter who also has high-functioning autism. Not only has she sabotaged relationships, but because I didn’t realize it was happening until it was done, I now find myself being accused of everything she has done before I even know what the problem is. 

My husband is either unwilling, unable, or simply uninterested in stepping in and standing up for me or doing anything else to save my younger children from all the destruction this girl has brought into our family. 

I feel so completely lost. I never know which of my children is going to hit me out of the blue with wild accusations that I have no idea where they’re coming from next. My 14 yr old has expressed numerous times that she intends to run away from home. This girl (the DIL) will tell her she wants to see her for her birthday, then not invite her to her family celebration, then tell her it’s my fault she didn’t invite her because she knew I wouldn’t let her go anyway. There’s been about 10 different instances just like this. I’m always made out to be the bad guy, and I never even know anything is happening until it’s done, but I still get blamed for it. 

My adult son curses and name-calls at me. I finally just blocked his number from my phone tonight because I just couldn’t take anymore. No one has ever been that *nasty* to me. I’ve had to break up bloody fist-fights between my sons inside my home when they were so wound up they started shoving me and threatening to hit me. One of them is a 6’3” construction worker, and the other has his MMA blackbelt. I’m a 5’4” 40-something mom of 6. If they hit me, I’d be in the hospital. 

Our home is a disaster - an absolute pigsty - because not a one of them will even do so much as pick up their own trash and drop it in a trash can, wash a single dirty dish, or do a single load of laundry. And they tell me it’s all my fault. My husband and sons refuse to mow the yard, and they’ve filled it with broken-down vehicles. We have the white-trashiest yard I’ve ever seen! I keep my master suite clean, and am working to regain a better foothold in the kitchen (another long story which ended in me closing my small business to stay home and clean up the mess they’ve made of our home). I still teach workshops to make a little extra money.

Until a year and a half ago my home was peaceful and everyone respected me and one another.  Now it’s like I’ve been beaten at some petty, low-brow, ghetto, bat-shit crazy game that I would never in a million years consent to play. 

I just wish I had one good friend who really actually understood that I honestly have no clue what is happening when my children start accusing me and calling me names and screaming at me, so that they would explain to me what’s happening and why it’s happening. I never know if they actually mean what they’re saying or if they’re just pissed off and blowing off steam. I don’t have any clue at all if they really hate me and believe that I’m a terrible mother or not. I just want to understand what’s happening. 

TL;DR Teenage kids have turned on autistic mom. Don’t know what’s happening. ",31Aug2018,0

11,"My allergies have been severe this year (completely out of the blue, never had an issue before). Two times this year I had bad hives/rashes all over my body and besides visiting my doctor and taking his prescribed pills I never though much of it. 

But today I had an allergic reaction to something and I could feel my throat starting to swell up. Wasn't to the point where I couldn't breathe but I could feel it. I panicked and went to the urgent care for a steroid shot. 

It made me think what happens if I'm alone and can't drive because I'm unable to breathe? Call 911 and hope they get me in time? I was prescribed Auvi-Q (basically an epipen) but I threw it to the corner months ago because I never thought I needed it.

You bet I've now learned how to give myself a shot. I'm now carrying one of these wherever I go, even if my reactions aren't bad to the point of anaphylaxis.

Don't get me wrong I've been employed since graduating with different jobs, care giving, serving, and subbing.

21,"No throwaway account for me. To get down to the core of my issue, I was molested at a very young age by a kid twice my age. It happened more than once before it was found out.  I went grade school with a mix of depression and adhd meds. I became a prime target for bullying, and even though I had some friends outside of school it became too much and I ended up being homeschooled before I got to high school.

Outside of a small circle of friends, I stayed inside, just getting out of the house once or twice a week at the most. I went to church every week, but throughout my teen years I was also bullied there, worse than I was at school, but my parents forced me to go. I ended up finding and making really good friends on the internet, and learning that I am introverted and that most of my hobbies can be done alone, I just kind of withdrew.

I had a pretty bad image of myself, I honestly hated myself and thought about suicide all the time. I had trouble finding work, I'd get really nervous during interviews and ended up remaining jobless until about 22 where I found some summer work. I had thought I was dumb, unemployable. I had resigned my life to ""living"" on the internet.

At around 23 I decided to turn my life around. I graduated from community college a few years ago, and today have held the same job for over a year now. The job is related to what I graduated for but involves a ton of face to face interaction with strangers. I've become much more social, and it turns out I'm a pretty funny dude and am not having much trouble making friends now.  

I finally got my own car this month, and am about to take my driving test. I always had a fear of driving due to my ADHD, I'd seriously get nightmares multiple times a week about spacing out and getting into an accident or something similar. So I never bothered to date, because who wants to date a guy in the suburbs who can't drive or get around? I don't make a lot of money, so I live with a relatives that aren't my parents,(My mom passed away unexpectedly last year, we were very close) but I am confident I'll be able to find a better job with the experience I'm gaining working here.

These days my anxiety is mostly gone, I've got a better image of myself and more self confidence. I've lost a lot of weight, and a few weeks ago I got stopped and asked for my number while at work, though it didn't work out. I should also mention I've pretty much dropped my faith almost entirely in the last few years, which opens the dating pool to more than the 0 girls who are around my age at the church I went to. 

So my question is really where do I go from here? I can talk to people just fine now and am really well liked at my work, I just feel like an anxiety ridden, uncomfortable fuck whenever the thought of trying to flirt, or talk to someone with the goal of getting a date.  ",31Aug2018,4
24,"It's a long story, but whatever.

Yesterday I invited a girl (my ex, no, I didn't want to bang or anything, she is in a relationship as I am) over to my house to drink. I guess it would have been nice having her with me for a little more time than usual, so I proposed her (later in the conversation) to stay at my place for the night, as my parents are out on vacation for some days and she passes her day working and studying lately.

[I really care about her. She is one of the three most important people to me (I have a hard time really caring for another person).]

So, she told me she would've been uncomfortable sleeping at my place wich is fully understandable. I told her to let me know if she had a bit of free time for me and what she preferred to do.
She asked if I wanted to say something in particular to her, wich I really didn't, and to just text her or call her if it was the case.

Because of this and my bad anxiety I asked her yesterday evening if maybe she didn't want to see me. She told me pretty soon that, in fact, she didn't really want to. At that point I freaked out because of kind of obvious reasons. Started crying, shivering, texting everyone, and all that. We hung out just days ago, so why wouldn't she want to see me? I texted back like 40 minutes later asking her questions. She told me that the fact that I texted her at 3 am asking her to drink and sleep at my place (wich by the way wasn't so sudden at all, I waited for her response in the morning and then talked about the drinking and the rest) had made her uncomfortable.

So I'm there pretty calmer than before because turns out she was just thinking I wanted to bang (probably), but still crying and with a lot of leftover anxiety. So I just couldn't hold it anymore and opened my heart to her about how I feel good with her and I'd really want to spend more time with her. I didn't expect anything from her as she's pretty cold to me usually (wich yes, makes me cry everytime), at least over text. And as expected she didn't say much. She told me to calm down and such. After this I was returning home from hanging out with some friends, and I decided to apologize about getting anxious and nervous, opening up a little bit once again. I also sent her a ""funny"" picture of me, hoping it could help return to a normal conversation. I just woke up to find that she read the texts and didn't respond. 

Obviously I'm crying again. I don't really want to lose her. I guess I deserve it.",31Aug2018,2

this past sunday, my girlfriend and I had been reunited for the first time all summer. we hadnt fucked since the beginning, so this obviously had us in the mood and ready. i had condoms from earlier this summer as well, and it was the end of her period; we just decided, “why not”. afterwards, taking off the condom i noticed it had a small rip (substantial enough that it was not only noticeable but leaked upon removal of the condom) on the left side of the head of the condom, which i hadn’t even noticed let alone felt. (dont ask why I dont have any fucking clue) I also already had ejaculated in the condom, so we just proceed to freak the fuck out. luckily i had money, so i ran as fast as i could to the nearest store and bought Plan B for her. 

as stated, she was at the end of her period. she was to ovulate in a couple of days. just yesterday she tells me she’s spotting. (im aware plan b can cause spotting) she hasn’t stopped spotting yet, and the blood flow is somewhat consistent. i tried to tell her implantation blood can’t happen this early, but the blood is a deep reddish brown. it is now 5 days after her period. she had taken the Plan B almost right after. we both think she may have either taken it too early, or her body is reacting adversely to the medicine. (she does not have a regular .)

tl;dr - 1. hadnt had sex with my girlfriend since the beginning of the summer, 2. when we finally did the condom broke and we freak out, 3. she takes plan b, a couple days later starts spotting, (ik spotting is a potential side effect of plan b) 4. shes nauseous and the bleeding hasn’t stopped since yesterday

any advice or insight is appreciated im scared shitless :)",31Aug2018,1
37,"My father for the past two years has been in and out of the hospital for surgeries and treatments for cancer and complications coming from it. 

Throughout this time I become incredibly close to my father and my family as a whole, something that wasn't always the case especially with my father.

Growing up he was both verbally and physically abusive to me and just me. Loved my sister but I was the one who he seemed to always expect more from. And if I never lived up to those expectations I got it in the form of being kicked, hit, beaten, cursed at, told how useless I was. 

This always led to having a very superficial (for lack of better term) relationship with my father. 

But when he was diagnosed with cancer, and had to go in for surgery and then had to spend the follow 4 months straight in the hospital I knew I needed to be there for my father. Even though he did a lot of terrible things he stuck around my entire childhood and I could be there for him during a difficult period. 


Well as I mentioned I was able to get really close with him and my family as a whole during this. But seeing him say things like he wishes he was dead instead of having to suffer through the pain, the treatments and surgeries hit me really hard after reconnecting. 

I was never prepared for this as a child. My parents never said there will be a time when we are weak and hurting and going to need help. I always thought they were invincible. They could handle whatever and will always be here for me when I need it. 


Now I am coming to terms that my dad is suffering and I can't do anything. What am I supposed to do when it happens to my mom who has always been my best friend. This is beyond hard to take and handle and I just wish I new of ways to cope or ways that I can one day prepare my children for this. 

I am 28 y/o male and I'm crying my eyes out at the face that my parents aren't invincible, that there will be a time they are suffering and I can't help them like they helped me.  ",31Aug2018,1
38,"have you ever kept anything for a while in your room then suddenly it goes missing? my wallet always laid on my computer desk with others like some coins and keys and gum etc, i went to go get some money from it today and it wasn't there

nowhere to be found either, the building works in my house have been going on for months and the builders have never done anything suspicious like taking anything before so i doubt it was them, and i haven't taken it out of the house anywhere in weeks (last time i used it was sunday)

sad, it's not even the money that i'm annoyed about (about £100 or so) but more that my id cards for uni, learner's license, bank card etc are gone and i have no idea where it could be, in the stress of recent events i guess i lacked care in my basic possessions

just had to vent thanks for reading",31Aug2018,28
39,"My father for the past two years has been in and out of the hospital for surgeries and treatments for cancer and complications coming from it.

Throughout this time I become incredibly close to my father and my family as a whole, something that wasn't always the case especially with my father.

Growing up he was both verbally and physically abusive to me and just me. Loved my sister but I was the one who he seemed to always expect more from. And if I never lived up to those expectations I got it in the form of being kicked, hit, beaten, cursed at, told how useless I was.

This always led to having a very superficial (for lack of better term) relationship with my father.

And I met this girl who I just tried to have for one night stand but after it we started hanging out quite a bit, but in the end yesterday she was kissing with a friend of mine infront of me like it was nothig. And todey she and her group went home so I can’t talk to her.

Its fucking infuriating because I see other people in bed with absolute pricks and I just can’t seem to figure it out.

I see people in abusive relationships, I see people in one-sided relationships, I see people in terrible situations because of their S/O.  I just don’t understand it.

And, I get conflicting advice form everywhere: 

“Just don’t think about love and it’ll happen!”

Or

“Well, if you don’t make an effort then nothing will happen!”

Or 

“Just be yourself!”

Or

“Fake it ‘till you make it!”

Or

“Treat girls like you would your mother!”

Or

“These hoes aint loyal!”

48,"Is so damn soulful, man it's amazing how energetic it is, not a moment of silence throughout and I know she would have wanted it to be so. Just filled with music and people celebrating life, it made me cry a couple times and I never even met her. I gotta say, even though I gave up religion long ago, I do say with absolute certainty, between the catholic, white, and black churches that I've been to; black churches are so much more fun than any other. Ive never bobbed my head from trying to stay awake during any of those Sunday gatherings. And the feast they're going to have after the funeral will damn sure be the best got damn food to be eaten today, I'm so jealous. It's a shame it's not getting as much coverage on reddit as McCain's, both changed the world so much in very different ways. Long live the Queen.",31Aug2018,6

50,"Okay, so like the title says, I have been in love with the girl since I met her. She is 10 years older and the only reason she says we can't date is because of the age difference. I have told her I love her, but she has given the above reason as to why we can't date.

Our friends say we are meant to be for each other. I have dated other girls since we met but never felt as comfortable as when I'm with her. I'm a chubby lad and trying to get fit. I am also kinda doing this so for her, but I also know that she doesn't see me like a sexual partner. On the other hand, she gets upset if I don't take to her for a whole day.

I respect her choice that she doesn't see me that way, but I also l know that I won't be happy without her. This has been going on for two years and I don't know what to do. Any advice?",31Aug2018,1

A lot of the rhymes are pretty weak and feel forced, and the fucking Venom track which everyone is so excited about is very mediocre; the lyrics fit but the beat doesn't match the character's vibe from the film at all. Also, there is a whole fucking track which is just ""Fuck you, I hope you get hit by a truck"". Fuck Kamikaze.",31Aug2018,2
56,"It all started when I met her through a friend, we talked a lot, good chemistry and all that stuff. The day after that we went to a party with our mutual friend. We then ended up in a one night stand that evening. We've had little to none contact from that point till now, where she just shows up at my workplace. She's got a job here. When I asked her about her previous job, and what happened, she just responded with a ""yeahhh..""

She then seems to be a lot more outgoing and talkative around me. 

I'm split in two, because when I met her she also seemed outgoing and talkative, just not as much as a think she is now. Might just be because we know each other a bit better through work..? 

My friend gave me his opinions, saying that I was clearly missing the signs. Am I? Help me out here! Should I ask her out?",31Aug2018,3

I was so creeped out holy shit.   At first I didn’t think anything, but when he didn’t move I was like dude, what the fuck?

It was in the middle of the night too which was even more creepier.  I stared at him and was like waiting for something to happen.  He stood there for a good 2 minutes I think.  To my surprise he was acommpanied by his friend.  ",31Aug2018,1
