2,"I got my blood test results before and I feel like they're low. I have a hard time building muscle and I am very skinny. When I was a kid around the age of 6, I noticed I had a very faint peach fuzz and I had hair on my scrotum. I also have had very hairy arms and legs as a little kid too. When I was 11, I had a spurt of hair that grew. But the thing is, my underarm hair is uneven and hasn't grown since, my pubic hair above my penis has barely grown and my voice has barely deepened, my forehead is flat like a womans, my adams apple didn't come out but I experienced A LOT of facial hair growth, more than my peers in school and I grew very tall. I had a beard when I was 14.  Here are my blood test results of my testosterone that I had recently.

Guys like me try harder than you scumbags and because you get by with your looks and money or whatever you practically shove us in the mud and then steal the girl and give guys like me the middle finger to be a prick while all guys like me get is ""you're like a brother to me"" from the girl we try for AND to add insult to injury all guys like me get for options is the fat ugly girl no one else wants.  Fuck all of you pieces of shit Chad douchebags. I hate you. And to top it off I'm expected to move and be happy for these and people feel I don't have a chpice but to only try and date unattractive obese women cause i have to ""know my place"" 


24 never a girlfriend or been kissed still a virgin never a date No attractive women like me only unattractive obese women like me and that's who people tell me to learn to settle for i hate my life cause of it

5 dating sites and never has an attractive or decent looking woman matched or message me only unattractive obese women or unattractive women do. 

When I go to bars and clubs I get rejected and ignored every time I cant win. 

The women i try for and who i want to attract are Ria Ciuffo from Barstool Sports attractive. 

I get told to aim for girls as unattractive and fat as the girl from youtube Christine Syldelko. 

Big difference in what i try for and what people tell me to get used to aiming for instead of offering advice that would help me attract women as good looking as Ria. 

And if any of my friends saw me dating a fat ugly girl they'd either laugh at me or worse think we're a good match saying I'm as bad looking and as much a loser as her. And if any of the women who rejected me saw me with a fat ugly girl I'd be looking for a bus to hit me. 

To give more context into what people read

 NO I do not hate women.  who I hate are the guys who women choose because the guys who women choose are always the type who have always picked on me and bullied me and then they rub it in my face on how they were able to get the girl I try for


**TL;DR**
Here's a list of all my experiences
1st Friendzone/Rejection ""**SARA**""

The girl i tried for in high school (24) but who friendzoned me is getting married to a scumbag piece of shit. (21) who cheated on her with a teacher She started dating him when me and her were seniors and he was a freshman he was caught sexting a teacher caught on the news and now the girl I want is marrying him and A TEACHER HERSELF 

and now everybody is happy that they're getting married it's like I'm living in the Twilight Zone that people forget that he cheated on her with the teacher and got caught on the news. And the only type of women who like me or unattractive and obese so when it rains it pours. i hate my life and i hate her fiance. 


AND THEN 2nd Friendzone/Rejection "" **ASHLEY** ""

**TL;DR**

Girl i love has a boyfriend and she's in love with him and it depresses me beyond comprehension that she loves him and she will never love me. I'm absolutely fucking depressed. 

Everybody else wants them to get married except me, i fucking hate her boyfriend he ruined my life. I asked girls on here if he's better looking than me and they all said yes he was and theyd rather date him than me. Can anybody give me advice thats beneficial for me? Not advice that only benefits her boyfriend, cause reality is if you say ""If you really love her youd be happy for her"" or ""move on"", that has no benefits for me it only benefits her bitchboy punkass boyfriend.


And again to recap she doesn't love me she loves him nobody feels bad for me because everybody else wants these two to be married already and the only type of girls who like me or unattractive obese girls so I don't get a bright side or a silver lining or happy ending that benefits me all of those is a losing situation for me or I end up with either nothing or what doesn't make up for what I lost out on. 


I told her I love her she rejected me then a week later she had me meet with her only so she can set me up with her fat ugly friend

3rd Friendzone/Rejection **ALEX**

My high school prom date whose a family friend and who i had a crush on for years, she made out with another guy in front of me and fucked him in his car and because she stayed at my place she invited him over to make out with him on MY DRIVEWAY.

11,"Another Friday night, no plans. For the previous 5 years I lived in a big city and had a great life. Lots of close friends, parties every weekend. Living the life. I took it for granted. Recently I moved back to my home state (think small redneck state in middle america) to a small college town to pursue an electrical engineering degree - wouldn't be my first choice  but it was really my only option as far as tuition and convenience. School wise things are going great, however, socially, I feel bored and isolated, like I'm just wasting my youth. 

It just seems so tough to find friends here. It's a university that's not big on clubs, basically the entire culture revolves around frats/sororities, which I feel like I'm just too old to do that (23, not trying to get hazed by a bunch of 19 year olds). I've tried talking to some of the kids in my electrical engineering program, but honestly the ones in my classes who I've talked to have mostly been pretty standoffish, awkward, and/or just plain judgmental (I think some of them assume I'm just some sort of dumb hippie/bro who does a lot of drugs and doesn't belong in engineering, even though I'm actually pretty nerdy and have a 4.0 gpa). This whole school pretty much seems like most people still hang out with their high school cliques, as it isn't really an international school. A lot of people the only conversations I've really had with them is like (""what frat are you in?"" Or ""which high school did you go to?"") 

On top of that I'm always exhausted from studying that it's hard to put in an extensive effort to try to build a social life from scratch.

Honestly I just really need to find me a woman, and I have seen a lot of women notice me, but it's never in a social situation or a good time to talk. Basically all of my interactions with people are in class/labs/etc.. Ok I'll brag a bit, I'm a pretty good looking guy so finding a woman shouldn't be that hard, but I never go to parties or social events anymore so I don't really have the opportunities. So far I haven't gotten to know any woman well enough.

I am a dual citizen of Canada, so I'm thinking of transferring schools, but logistically it could be really tough, especially regarding transfer credits. 

I don't know, I'm starting to just accept that I'm only really here to learn engineering, but how do I cope with this void in my life?

12,"I miss in high school when I’d have ancient history class last period on a Friday afternoon.  My teacher for that class would usually just stand up the front and speak the whole time or we’d watch a documentary.
Even if earlier in the day I wasn’t particularly tired, for some reason I’d become so sleepy and relaxed.  [There’s this great short animation](https://vimeo.com/215498188) about trying to stay awake in class and it is ridiculously spot on.
It was like being in some kind of trance.  The final bell would ring and I’d amble, dazed, out of the classroom into balmy weather feeling incomparably content knowing that after 15 minutes listening to my favourite music on the bus, looking out the window at trees and houses blurring together with glazed-over eyes, I could just crash on my bed and feel absolutely fine.",22Sep2018,1

15,"i went to a friend of mines birthday party couple of weeks ago at his crib. There was loud music, booze, females,the whole shabang. Anyways a lot of my coworkers went including this one girl i work with. Important note she has LDR with her boyfriend (same state, different colleges).

Throughout the party im talking to people, playing beer pong, smoking, dancing just enjoying myself. The girl in question was kinda off to the side just drinking enjoying the vibe, whatever. She doesnt smoke and she didnt dance really. Her friends come later and i end up drinking with them. So here i am drinking with her  and her friends trying to get to know them better. I personally find her friends more attractive than her but that doesn’t change the fact that i talk to them all equally at the party.

Fast forward after the party at work, this girl is all over me. I think her and her boyfriend are going through some shit. I always found her cute but i feel like something clicked at the party where now She always wants to be around me at work. She gets real close and flirty, says shes hates me when i tell her im not closing with her lol. We work retail btw

Anyways why would she switch up after the party. Like we were friendly with eachother before but after shes become real flirty.

16,"I haven’t had a hard life, but yet it hasn’t been quite easy. You could say I have an abundance of issues, issues that normally aren’t at bay. They are tucked beneath the surface, out of sight and out of mind. On the outside I look perfectly fine. 

When I was 9 my parents divorced. My mother, my sister, and I traveled cross-country to our final destination. We lived in a two bedroom townhouse. Mom was slowly losing her eyesight then. Mom was online dating and bringing guys over here and there. I remember a man named Todd, I was fond of that one. 

I remember a picture of a little girl stuck in the air vents and pulling it out. Staring at her short straight brown hair and blue eyes. I remember the crab apple trees in the backyard and the boys I played with every now and then next door. I remember having a trundle bed and sleeping on the mattress nearest to the floor. I remember my mom poking her head into the shared room of my sister and I and leaving red lipstick on the door late at night. I remember my moms anger issues and how she took any little thing on my sister and I. I remember trying to jump out of a second story window after getting in trouble for not eating my tomato soup and trying to shut my mom out of the room before she whooped me. I remember her biting my sisters leg and leaving a bruise for moving too much when we had to share her bed for the night. I remember being hungry and thinking something was wrong with my stomach because the sharp pains were unbearable. 

I remember my moms date with Jim and how I stayed up late one night to play with her make up and bras. I remember being in her room and listening to their small talk, he was telling her how beautiful her eyes were. 

I remember Misty, his dog, that I grew attached to. I remember us moving into Jim’s house in another town. I remember the wooden bunk beds my sister and I shared. I remember the loud moaning coming from the bedroom, and the porn being left on the television in the living room.

I remember being 11 thinking to myself how I will never live to the age 18 and couldn’t foresee any of my future. 

I remember going over to my childhood best friends house to play brat dolls and jump on her trampoline. I remember my mom smashing the CD player out of anger. I remember soccer practice and sonic kids meals.

I remember my mom and Jim finally getting married. I remember scowling as I walked down the aisle. I did not like this man. I remember my sister and I fighting at the reception and going into the bathroom to fight some more, missing the father daughter dance. Intentional. 

I remember my mom trying to force us to call him dad and if we didn’t she’d get upset and angry. I remember the throbbing migraines at 12 years old that never went away. I remember the seizure due to stress. I remember the relentless chores and strict rules. I remember being put on a diet and having to ask for snacks. I was not an overweight child. I remember the emotional abuse which turned physical from both Jim and my mother. I remember them fighting at every holiday. My sister and I locked in our rooms playing UNO and if we didn’t we’d get yelled at. I hate board games to this day. I remember more moaning from their bedroom late at night and the loud banging and me taking my sister into her closet and turning the pink Disney radio on high to mute out the noise so we could finally sleep. 

I remember calling our house “hell house” and dreading seeing Jim’s yellow truck in the drive way. I remember being so scared of getting yelled at by missing the bus I cried to the admin lady, in high school and ended up having to walk home to get yelled at. I remember the spoon fulls of mayo he forced me to eat as a form of punishment. I remember him trying to play fight me and groping my body as I washed the dishes at night. I remember being told I was worthless and would never amount to be anything but white trash living in a trailer. I remember comments regarding my breast size when I was 14. I remember breaking up with my first boyfriend at 16 because I couldn’t handle the abuse at home and a boy who wanted to sleep with me at the same time. I remember bruises and scars from being pinched and hit when Jim didn’t get his way with me. I remember him coming into the bathroom and attempting to open the shower curtain on me every night. I remember the constant belittlement and control. I remember fighting back and biting him through his army uniform. I remember getting so worn down that I stopped fighting and started accepting. I wanted to be the good child. I wanted to be liked. If I did what my mom and Jim said, I didn’t have to endear any pain. 

I remember walking on egg shells all the time. Getting spanked with a belt until 17 as I’m stripped down in my underwear with my blind mother whipping my back as Jim watched. My mom and Jim were both emotionally abusive, controlling, manipulative, and narcissistic. Jim being more sadistic. I remember being woken up at midnight to clean the bathroom because there was a hair in the sink or a tissue on the floor multiple times a night. 

I remember attempting suicide with shoe strings. Jim walked in and took everything with a string away. No therapy. Nothing. I remember digging my fingers into my arms wishing for my life to end because I was in pain. Every waking moment I wished to be dead. I wanted to die. I hated this life. 

I remember Jim following me to work at 16 when I got my first job just to yell at me for my driving and watching me afar at high school foot ball games to make sure I was being “good”. 

I remember being my moms personal chauffeur since she was blind. My sister being diagnosed with Aspergers. I did what I was told or I got punished. 

I remember waking up late for school one fall morning of junior year and deciding to apply make up. Jim didn’t like that so he made me take it off. I remember slamming the front door shut and yelling “I hate you fucking asshole”. I remember my sister giving me the look because we both know he heard. 

I remember coming home from school and being sat at the dinner table. I remember being told by my mother to respect Jim and that my behavior was unacceptable. I remember her telling me he’s my father. I remember thinking in my head that I’ve never once been respected. I remember his smug look at the table. 

I remember waiting until he left to go to some event to creep into my moms office to tell her he’s been touching me. I was shaking and the words barely could come out of my mouth. But I was fed up. So fucking fed up. 

I remember being sent back to my room and being awoken by the both of them questioning me about my accusation. I remember him denying every single thing. 

I remember being pulled out of school to talk to a detective. I remember court. And court again. And court again. And being locked in my room without my cell phone to study the court documents for trial. 

I remember the resentment and the hate. I can’t remember feeling happy from 9 until 17 years old. I was never happy. Just a servant to my mother and Jim, trying to make them happy so I wouldn’t have to eat that mayo. 

I’ve tried to commit suicide 3 times in my 23 years of living. All unsuccessful attempts. 

At times, I still want to die.

These are the things I don’t tell people about my “childhood”. A childhood that was cut short from abuse that has since fucked me up. I can’t form relationships, I get attached too easily, I’m paranoid and anxious of the worst possible outcome, I’m codependent, and have major daddy issues. But on the outside you can’t tell. I bottle everything up, make sure I look presentable, made sure I went to college and got a full time job, made sure to not turn into white trash that lived in a trailer. 

But yet, I am still unhappy. 

But I’m working on it. Fuck, am I working on it. ",22Sep2018,1
17,"I met this amazing girl at my college and we’ve been practically dating, but it’s pretty early in the relationship, and we’ve been enjoying our initial attraction. I thought I was being as intelligent as possible in striking a balance between indulging in our initial attraction and making myself and her aware that that’s what it is and anything could happen. I really like her and I think this is the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in, though it’s very early to tell and I’m going off of how I perceive her and myself. I forgot about one thing.

At first I wanted to make a reddit post about just her and how amazing she is when we were a little deeper into our relationship but I left someone behind.

I live in Orange County for college and I used to live in NorCal, far above San Francisco. I’ve had this internet friend who lives in central California and we’ve been mostly platonic. Mostly.

Recently, I had been getting more affectionate with her after she told me that she was attracted to me due to our intellectual conversation (she’s seemingly sapiosexual/asexual). I knew that we wouldn’t work due to her asexuality but I also had my doubts as to if she was actually asexual or if she had never explored that aspect of herself. We’ve been affectionate before but it fizzled out. I wasn’t going to take any bets of her sexuality because that’s simply ignorant. I was only taking hopeful variables in and running with them.

Without thinking, I became affectionate with her and I even told her I love her. I don’t remember doing this, but it’s not something she would make up. I would have remembered saying it if I had the emotion behind it to back it up.

I told her I didn’t mean it, and that even though I liked her, I didn’t love her. If I had stayed with it love might have developed. But it didn’t, and I hurt her. She’s such a good friend and we benefit each other and learn from each other in talking about our interests. She’s helped me with college stuff and I’ve helped her emotionally. But now I’m the cause of her pain and I feel terrible. I fully admitted to my faults and apologized and that’s all I can do. I valued this friendship and I severely damaged it because of my actions. She tells me she’s even more hurt because this girl is “a prettier version of her”.

Clearly I have some thinking to do.

I don’t feel bad about this new relationship. I know I deserve it and the person that I’ve developed into can handle this, whether it works or not. My past relationship was toxic and being where I am, location wise, spirituality, and career choice(music), I’m happier than I’ve ever been in my life without relying on the approval of others. I was happy even before this started and I feel as though my life is getting better and better, aside from financial stress. I feel like my own person. I’m glad to be where I am but hurting someone just hurts.",22Sep2018,1

20,"Control over my mind and confidence are the two things I once had but feel like I have lost over time. There could be many factors that have caused this, all of which would be my own fault. The fact that I'm not freaking out or beating myself up over even posting this/admitting I have a problem worries me, because that means I've gotten to a point where I just don't care anymore.

Maybe I lost these things because of stupid decisions and choices I've made, maybe it was the drugs, maybe it's my attitude. But these are the two essential things that make a person who they are, or at least make me who I am, and I feel like I can only have these things when I take drugs (i.e. Amphetamine/Methylphenidate and alcohol. Yes, alcohol) meaning that I'm more focused and mature when I am tipsy/drunk than when I am sober. It's worth noting that I've gotten a little too comfortable with LSD over the past few weeks and let that take over my brain as well. My brain, which was once my best friend, has turned on me because of LSD. It told my brain to hate me for what I've done to it, for who I am. I've learned a lot from my trips but, I didn't expect to ever actually lose control over my own mind. I'm not saying I'm crazy, I'm just saying I feel belittled by my own mind after the bad trips I've had. So who knows? Maybe the acid's to blame. It's a powerful and mind-altering substance after all.

Regardless, as I sit here typing this, I hope time will fix me if I treat myself better and stop relying on drugs. I really let myself go. And now, who I once was doesn't seem to want to take me back no matter how much I beg and reminisce. Maybe time is the only true thing that will fix me. It's a shame I've taken steps backward rather than forward and actually bettering myself on top of what I once was, but if that means I have to relearn or make it a point/goal to gain *true* confidence and control, then so be it. I should have never let it come to this. Will what I've learned ever benefit me? Who knows. Who knows where I'll be years from now, what I'll be doing, or what my way of thinking will be. People change, I'm no exception.

Control over my own mind, confidence and empathy? Those three things are the most important things to me right now. I need to change. It won't be easy, but it's not supposed to be. If it was easy everyone would do it. That's what separates me from the rest of the crowd. And that's what I aspire to be.",22Sep2018,1

But I wish I could relive the 90s and early 2000’s. Was watching early gossip girl seasons and just remembered how much fun the early 2000s were and then I thought about the 90s. I was born in 1997 so I’m not a “true” 90s baby as I have no recollection of those years but I love seeing pictures of my family in the 90s and all the ‘vintage’ and fun fashion styles they had; how cars looked; how my neighbourhood looked; what was on tv in the background etc.

22,"So yeah me and my girl got to see each other again and have a few dates here and then. We have a very hectic schedule now and we go see each other every once a month now ever since we got a job unlike before back in college we go have dates every week and have fun. 

Just yesterday, she noticed my nice clothes and ask ""why do I look too good?"" then I answered her in an unintentional fun sarcastic way ""cause you don't know how to look good and fix yourself"" little did I know that she's silently mad and got disappointed at me and she doesn't want to hold my hand when we're walking out in the public and she's keeping those tiny hands in her pocket so I can't hold them. 

She also told me the reason why she doesn't wanna hold my hand that time and it was simply because she doesn't want the people to see us and mistaken her for being a cougar. Cause my girl is a year older than me and I still have this baby face look which kinda makes people think that I'm dating an older woman. But anyway the date yesterday went great and I know that the smile on her face is satisfied to see me.

My girl is simple, she doesn't wear make up, cosmetics, paint her fingers, dye her hair and doesn't dress herself in fancy attention seeking manner, just plain shirt and pants will do for her. Ever since she started her 1st job 3 years ago my GF forgot to take care of herself and got more and more occupied with all of her work and its affecting her health like she's been getting a few hours of sleep, stress eating and she's gaining weight too and rarely do something about her hormonal imbalance. 

She also told me that the trend these days is that guys would cheat and dump on their GF/SO for another hot girl. So yeah basically that's it. Now I'm lost in words and don't know what to tell her.

My friend invited me to a football game for our high school today and I answered with the usually I don’t really want to go. When I got home I realized I was gonna slip into that mood again and even though I didn’t want to and I was nervous I went and I had a good time. This isn’t to say I don’t go out to do things just not a lot and it’s usually the movies and stuff where I’m not gonna know anybody except the people I’m with. Now that I’m home I feel like I’m slipping into that mood again for some reason but I’m still a bit happy that I did something I usually wouldn’t do since I’m trying to be more social and improve parts of my life that I don’t like. ,22Sep2018,2

It was like being in some kind of trance.

34,"Ever since i was 11 (now 19) i have had an eating disorder. It has changed forms and intensity over the years but has been a constant throughout all my teenage years. From the age of 12-17 I was in and out of forced inpatient psych care because of not eating, self harming and suicide attempts. From 12-16 I was in outpatient care at a eating disorder clinic following a meal plan. 

When I was 16.i had regained the weight lost  and was stable at a “healthy” BMI. Everyone thought I was okay, even I did.I was declared healthy and without diagnosis. I stopped going to the ed-center. In hindsight I think I longed to be normal and healthy that I convinced myself to look past all my still very disordered thoughts and actions around food. But I was not okay. I hated my body, I still restricted food and occasionally my starving went on for days. I still managed to keep a weight on the low side of the “healthy” BMI range. 

Until the spring of 2017. I was graduating and everything fell apart. From that time on I got deeper and deeper into my eating disorder and I started loosing weight. First in September I told my mother and we called the ed-center for help again. 

In the beginning of October before I had gotten an appointment I broke down one day after work. I was tired, starved and suicidal. The police came and got me since I attempted suicide and I was forced committed to emergency psychiatric care.  I had lost about 5 kilos by this point but was just at a healthy BMI so nobody there cared or believed me when I told them about my past and current struggles. I released myself and continued struggling at home, loosing more and more weight and becoming more and more depressed. The meetings at the clinic did not work and the world around me seemed to be crashing down.

In November my dad passed away after several years of being sick. It was expected but made me retreat more and more into my disorder. This went on, month after month til I had lost ~17kgs and had a BMI of around 14. My temperature was at a low 34,5 Celsius for days and I was threatened with force feeding and such if I didn’t make a change in the following week. 

Somehow I did. I got on the internet and read about recovery. I had literally nothing to lose. I was so hungry, so sad and angry. I read about unrestricted eating, extreme hunger and everything that follows in recovery. I researched the Minnesota starvation experiment, fat distribution and overshoot weight. Then I just started eating. I started doing what scared me the most in life. I ate and cried, I ate and shook from fear, I ate and felt sick from anxiety. I ate a lot, I ate whatever I wanted, in the amounts I wanted and whenever I wanted. I was so hungry, I ate many many 1000+ calories a day. I started to regain weight. I started to regain happiness, energy and sense of hope.

This was in June. Today I feel better than I have since I was 12. I in no way consider myself healthy or free from my anorexia but I feel hope. I still struggle, I still eat more than most and I still have a hard time accepting my body but I feel that I have a future. My cravings and hunger have started to calm down, I have regained weight(I do not weigh myself any more), I have the energy to work again after being in sick leave for 11+ months , I meet friends, I am anxiously anticipating my period to come back.I am seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and it is the best feeling. 

This was not easy. Me and my mom have cried, fought, hugged and screamed. I have thrown plates on the floor and had panic attacks over 2 extra peas or having taken 3 steps to little.

I just wanted you all to know there is hope. It will be a struggle, you will
Most likely experience extreme hunger, wanting to stop and go back to your eating disordered ways but you can do it! You can live a full life and be happy without restriction.

Also remember, you do not have to be clinically underweight to have an restrictive eating disorder. You do not have to be clinically underweight to be underweight for your body and starved. You do not have to be clinically underweight to deserve recovery. I will recommend a blog/YouTube channel/podcast by Tabitha Farrar for more reading and inspiration. You can do this. I’m on my way and I’m so very proud!",22Sep2018,1
35,"I was at my Costco, hitting up the food court. If you arent near/never been to a Costco, they have self serve for condiments, meaning anyone can help themselves to the ketchup/mustard/onion/whatever or since its Australia, its most likely tomato sauce in the dispenser instead of ketchup.

I didnt mean to pry, I just finished eating, took a piss, washed hands, came out of the bathroom and my eyes just wander when I saw someone eating one of the Caesar salads from the food court... with tomato sauce. I did a double take, a gag, moved on. But that fucking meal haunted me for a while after. Absolutely disgusting. I felt a knot in my stomach and slightly nauseous for while after, my mind was stuck on a loop. ""How could they eat that? Why did they do that? What in the actual fuck? How could they eat that?

This weekend I picked him up as per usual after work when she told me, she has gone to see the Dr and they recommended he go on a gluten free diet.

I know reddit is no replacement for a Dr, and I will take him to see one tomorrow. I just don't feel that this is sound advice, from what I read ""or from complete lack of information!"" there is no accredited information that links a gluten free diet to any improvements neurologicaly, or in any other way than being better for people with celiac disease.

40,"So recently in the news we've had sexual assault victims coming forward and often times a defense is ""But he's a good man"" well here is my story.

My Grandpa owned a lot of rental properties, and one of his tenants was a young man, lets call call him Randy. Randy was a local farmers boy and worked on his family farm. My grandpa did business with his family a lot, and in one of the deals my grandpa agreed to exchange rent for fully butchered cow every year. 

Anyway, Randy liked guns and video games and every time I would visit my grand parents I would go to Randy's house and play video games and we would go shooting together. Randy became a bit of an older bother to me. My memories from randy stretch from the time I was a toddler, some of my first memories are of Randy, 4to the time I was in my mid 20s.

Now one thing I must stress, Randy never did anything inappropriate with me. Which goes to strengthen my point I'm about to make.

Well a few years back, Randy got caught up in some FBI sting on child pornography. Turns out Randy had been involved in some production and a TON OF DISTRIBUTION of child porn. At first everyone to include my family didn't believe Randy could be capable of being involved in something like this.

So he was arrested, and through his trial the evidence came out. Randy had been a major part of a large child pornography distribution operation, even partaking in some production. Randy did a horrible things that harmed Innocent lives and will be spending the rest of his life in prison. 

The reason I bring this up is because of the metoo movement. I think its inspired a lot of sexual assault victims to come forward and this has resulted in some surprising accusations. Just because its hard to believe something, doesn't mean its not true. I thought I knew Randy, and if you would have told me what he did behind closed doors I would have been offended, I would have been mad at you, because I know Randy, and Randy doesn't do shit like that.

But I would have been wrong, So we should all be slow to judge. Truth doesn't need to make sense.",22Sep2018,8

45,"Working with severely autistic adults in a residential setting for the last 10 months has been proper enjoyable. Learning about autism, for me, is an amazing exploration into a fascinating realm of the possible ways humans can be wired differently. Plus I like working in a field which impresses upon me the importance of treating vulnerable people with dignity and compassion.

For me, an autistic person is like a football player in a computer game who has had the levels of their attributes randomised. Their stats are all over the show, and because of this inherent uniqueness, it's highly unlikely any two players created will be the same. They will be strong in some areas of their game, and weak in others. Some abilities the player has are contingent upon others. For example, a player may have 99% passing accuracy but only 2% kicking power, and so they won't be able to realise their passing potential until a way to solve the kicking power issue has been figured out first. 

So an important part of the job as front line support worker and facilitator is seeking out ways to restore or rewire the need for, those prerequired abilities in order for autistic people to have access to the other strengths which are currently lying dormant in them.",22Sep2018,1

52,"Thorough documentation of this ongoing crisis is provided at the end of this post. 

This is a long read, but everyone in the US needs to be warned about this, and every day this problem isn't solved, it's killing more people. Action on this issue is urgently needed. 

I have [polycystic kidney disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/polycystic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes), and for the last four years, (at least while I was still physically able to do so,) I saw doctor after doctor after doctor in search of adequate pain management. In that time, I have not been prescribed anything for pain at all. 

Before that, up until a bit over 4 years ago, I had a life, because I had a doctor providing me with hydrocodone, which had turned out to be the only effective medication against my pain after I had tried every single alternative narcotic and non narcotic medication that existed there at the time. (Surgery had been ruled out as an unnecessary risk.) I used Lortab (hydrocodone with reduced acetaminophen) responsibly and sparingly for years, and never experienced any addiction or withdrawal. Only relief and a chance to live my life instead of survive it. 

Then, I was forced to move across the country in order to access other kinds of healthcare blocked from me in my previous home state. The new federal opiate laws went into effect not long after I moved. My new home state turned into an even worse medical neglect death trap, and now I'm not well enough to move again in order to save myself. 

My physical and psychological health have been utterly destroyed by the complete void of available pain managenent in the US. I can't function at all now, even basic things in my own home. I can't leave the house anymore, and even if I could, I have exhausted every single doctor I am able to access and been abandoned by every single one. I spend all of my time laying around in agony, crying, screaming, mangling inanimate objects, viciously self harming just for one source of pain to distract me from the other, and wishing for death. I have no will to live and no reason to want to. I'm probably only still alive because of rage towards the people responsible for doing this to me. One of the questions I have been asked by many of the doctors I've seen, after I explained my massive list of new and worsened physical and psychological symptoms (not included in this post), they genuinely wanted to know why i hadn't killed myself yet, and how I could still be alive after everything that happened to me. They weren't going to help me. They were just curious. I have also had numerous offers to help me access assisted suicide - while denying me access to the medication that would make suicide unnecessary. 

This is a death trap millions of Americans are stuck in with no way out. At least one in ten suicides in the US is now caused by untreated chronic pain, and that doesn't count all the early ""natural"" deaths (mostly heart failures) caused by symptoms resulting from the stress and trauma of being tortured in constant pain because of government mandated medical neglect.

Chronic pain patients across the country are now left with only two options: suffering, or suicide. **We need the help of able bodied people if we are to have any chance at life.** We have been completely abandoned by our doctors and legislators. We have been rendered powerless to save ourselves. And as long as nothing changes, more of us will continue to die every day. 
_____

This is not just a problem for chronic pain patients. Unreasonable opiate restrictions mean that **whoever you are, YOU TOO are only one painful accident, injury or illness away from being tortured and neglected** by the doctor or hospital you would go to for help. It doesn't matter how obvious your pain or its cause is. It will not be treated because doing so puts doctor's business and career at risk because of new federal and some states' laws based in misinformation and opiate hysteria instead of science, medical need, or compatibility with pain patients' basic human rights to life, liberty and happiness. And doctors always choose to protect themselves and their business over helping their patients. You aren't the exception because your doctor has been nice. It's a problem caused by federal law, and nobody is immune to that. 


The following is only the most recent story I've seen of an experience like this at an American hospital. 

""*For people who think that the refusal to treat pain is just for chronic pain patients and they don't feel that they shouldn't help fix this issue.
This is (name removed). she got severely burned on her arm and went to the emergency room she was denied any pain medication while she was there and was sent home with nothing and was also was not given anything for when they did the debridement. So if you think this problem won't effect you, think again.*""

More information, written by another victim of the American pain crisis:

A little CDC forced honesty from their new report released 8/31/18 at CDC.gov:

Opioid deaths: 14,487 of 325.7 million people died in 2016 from LEGAL PRESCRIPTION opioids. That's .000004% of the population! Now why is there a hysteria over PRESCRIPTION opioids?

Good question!

Especially when alcohol related deaths are 88,000 of 325.7 million. That's a much BIGGER number!! Yet... No hysteria over alcohol

1.3 million people are injured and 35,000 die in car wrecks per year. Just to give you a reference. A WAY BIGGER number. No hysteria over that. (edited to correct information)

Hmmm. 🤔

Maybe it's because this is how they reported opioid deaths to the media:

'Drug overdose deaths in 2016 reached a NEW RECORD HIGH.' 'Drug Overdose Mortality: A RECORD NUMBER of drug overdose deaths occurred in 2016: 63,632, A RECORD 19.8 PER 100,000 PERSON'S.' (19.8/100,000 is still only .0001% but it looks BIGGER reported this way.)

Sounds like everybody is dying from opioids doesn't it? Now why did they say 66,632 died when I said 14,487 up top? That's a BIG difference!

Well...CDC combined LEGAL, law abiding citizen prescription opioid deaths, with ILLEGAL heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl deaths!

Why would anybody want to DO that? It's kind of misleading isn't it? Well...it makes a BIGGER NUMBER.

Where's all the hysteria and 'crisis' for the 1,300,000/325,700,000 each year DYING of car wrecks!!? I can make that sound awful! And it is! But it's still only .003% of the population and people have decided it's worth the RISK:BENEFIT RATIO to drive. And the government lets them.

Because of the way the CDC reported opioid deaths, and others' agendas, a wildfire of hysteria resulted, causing disabled by pain patients to lose their opioid medicine, their ability to function, their dignity as they are treated like drug addicts, and any quality of life. Imagine an Ice cream headache 24/7/365 covering different parts of your body. You can't think with this type of ceaseless pain. You want to die.

This is something that is personal and each person has to decide the risks they take in life. Risks are everywhere, and people have to decide if something is worth the benefit. It's called 'informed consent' when you know of the risk before you take it. 

Shouldn't people in agonizing pain be able to decide if the RISK:BENEFIT RATIO of .000004% is worth the benefit of being able to get out of bed and function? Work? And not want to die from tortuous pain?

Doesn't make sense, single moms are facing homelessness as they can no longer work due to unbearable pain, MS, lupus, etc etc; also Vets who risked their lives for our country with painful injuries, now lie there wanting to die. Elderly people lie there sobbing with NO RELIEF, day after day, wishing they would die. Where's the hysteria over that?

We have no voice. People/media listen to those in power. Not the multitudes suffering at their hands. Please share the TRUTH. 

ALL the above information can be found here: Where things are in context. A LOT harder to get information here than in the hysteria promoting news. And they're counting on that, apparently.

53,"basically here’s the deal. 

i am a 16 year old guy
school and work are my main time consumers

currently work at a grocery store in produce department

mentally iffy manager, non social or enjoyable job/ the scheduling is not really accommodating to my student needs 

i have a hard day at school, i work out at the gym all the time, the last thing i want to do is come to work and be constantly walking back and forth from the cooler and the sales floor. 

meat department has a open position
the job is simple, person selects meat they want,
u wrap and give to the customer. 

i work 6pm-10pm and that equals slow day, barely any customers. my ideal schedule is 6pm-10pm sun-thurs. and have fri sat off(technically whole day sunday just work afternoon). and according to all employees there, the department manager is great and flexible with his student employees 

it’s been 4 days since i put a indirect request in. today i will walk up to the store manager and directly tell him i would like to switch. After that, if he needs more time, i give them one week. if i hear nothing, i go get a interview at another place my friends work that they tell me they can give me that schedule i really want. once i go and get set up there, i give my 2 weeks notice at current location. sound like a good plan?

when i speak to store manager, i don’t want to say i am quitting unless u switch me because that’s a dick move, but i will make up the reason as to why i want to switch which is, “i want to pursue a culinary degree after i graduate high school, and working in meat would be a great experience”. 

all honesty, i been very unhappy with my position for months already but was in the mind set of “fuck it”. i am done, i feel i desire better, i was felt if i did quit, they would take it personally. i am acting as professional as i can, and hoping

55,"Hey all. I originally posted in /r/relationships but was told to post here and made a throwaway for an issue of mine. This is going to be long since I have a tendency to ramble so I’m sorry in advance.

I’m 23F, by the way. I don’t think I have any social awareness issues but please let me know if I’m the one acting weird. This situation just causes me to get so stressed out to the point of tears because I get attacked for it. I know people will tell me to get over it or grow a backbone or that I need thicker skin or something but I just need some sort of feedback. Before I start, the person I talk about in this post is known on FB for being the type of person to pry for attention. Posts about how she’s feeling sad but then tells people to PM her, bitches about people publicly if they wrong her even if she’s in the wrong, and just overall a lot of drama. I kept myself distanced until this scenario and it kind of concreted my realization that we’re not really friends.

So here’s the scenario. Let’s say I have an old phone that I don’t use. A friend will go, “hey, I need a new phone. Can I buy your’s if that’s okay?” And I’ll go “sure, that’s fine. Offer me a price and we can go from there.”. The person will offer me a fair price and then tell me “let’s meet x day”. I’ll go “sure, okay”. The day of and the day after, I won’t hear anything so I’ll check in. The person will tell me “hey, I’m still interested but let’s meet x day instead” (usually later in the week). Again, I’ll say “that’s fine, no worries. I’m not in a rush or anything”. Again, the day will come up and still nothing. No response or anything. I’ll shoot them a message saying that it’s okay if they don’t want it anymore but to let me know cuz it’s not being considerate of my time. 

And that’s when everything goes to hell. They come back at me like I’m attacking them. Like I’m the one causing the problems and forcing them to buy my phone. Keep in mind that every time this situation happens, I’m being more than accommodating with them. Someone asks me for the favor or the item or whatever and then I’m the one that gets treated like a bad guy for checking in because they can’t keep their word. And usually after a week of not hearing from them, I will send that above message (saying that they aren’t being considerate of my time) and get a text back going “oh, I’m sorry, my family member died”. Literally every time this happens regardless of who or how well I know them. It’s always that someone died and that I’m the bad person for asking them to stick to their word after a week or two of this because someone died.

This just happened to me with this girl I knew. She works in a shop near my apartment and I chat with her every now and then when I walk by. I added her on FB cuz it came up in conversation that I have a phone I don’t know what to do with since I upgraded mine. She asked for the phone a while back and I said, sure. Just message me whenever about it. Two months later, she texted me asking if she could buy it and offered a price. Told me that she would meet me last Friday but then tells me her paycheck hasn’t come through. The conversation went almost exactly like the above example except I even told her that it was okay if she didn’t want it after waiting a while (she had me wait about a week). She kept telling me that her paycheck was late and so I was like, I totally understand money problems. It’s really no big deal if you don’t want it. She insisted that she still wanted it and then told me a day to meet her by her work and I show up (last night after she got off work). The day of, she isn’t there and ignores my messages. I message her the next day (today) asking if she still wants it or what’s going on and get told “sorry, my stepfather died” and that I’m being unreasonable for being upset because she had a family tragedy.

I don’t know what to do. I told her multiple times that I wasn’t making her buy the phone but she insisted. Me and this girl don’t talk. She doesn’t reach out to me if I try to message her. We hung out once the day I added her on FB. She texted me telling me everything above and I unfriended her. My assumption is that if she’s going to ignore me when I try to talk to her and then blow up at me when she asked me for the favor then we’re not really friends. So I unfriended her and she gets extremely angry after seeing this. In her defense, I tried to explain to her that we don’t really have anything in common and that I just wasn’t trying to start a fight but people take advantage of me in these situations often so I was trying to be cautious. It made her angrier because, in her defense, I probably came off much harsher than anticipated because this is all over text. She tells me that I’m not really a nice person because of this situation and told me that I’m not welcome at the store she works at anymore and blocked me. I tried to offer that maybe we’re miscommunicating or something but that’s when I saw that I had gotten blocked.

I know this is all a lot of petty drama and people are going to tell me that this isn’t that big of a deal but I really want to prevent this scenario from happening again. I really did like the store she worked at and I didn’t mind chatting with her but maybe I did do something to piss her off so much.

Please, any feedback would help. I just really need to know what to do. It really hits my self esteem when someone attacks me for being a terrible person. I really do try to keep from inconveniencing anyone or being a dick. I know I’m sensitive but I just can’t take this happening again. 

**TL;DR** Friends or strangers will ask me for a favor or if they can buy something off of me but then take days or weeks getting back to me. I will try to be accommodating and patient but then get yelled at and blocked if I tell the person that they aren’t being considerate of my time. They will then disappear again and tell me that a loved one died and that I’m being a monster for bothering them even though just previously they came to me for the favor or item. I usually assume the worst and that I’m never going to hear from them again so I delete them off my phone and off FB and go about my life, only to find tons of angry messages and that I’ve been blocked. Am I doing something wrong? Am I socially inept somehow? ",22Sep2018,0
56,"I just wanted to get this off my chest somewhere people don’t know me. My friends are also probably tired of hearing the same thing.

Last night I decided to end my relationship with the girl I planned on marrying. In short, we argued too often and I always felt like I couldn’t trust her. She gave me no clear reason not to trust her, but she did lie about a lot of small and insignificant things which always made me doubt what she said. She also did and said a lot of small things to try and make me jealous. This latter point had a big impact on me because I cannot understand why, if you love someone that much, you would intentionally do things to make them feel bad. The thought of her doing things to make me feel bad keeps me up at night and occupies my mind all day.

I cried like I’ve never cried before, like a baby on the floor while she was watching me and begging me to stop. I knew noting would ever be the same and I wouldn’t ever be sleeping with her head on my chest or my face buried in the back of her neck. For some context we broke up a few times over the year we dated, but this is the one time I’m 100% sure I won’t go back.

It was like all my troubles disappeared when she was around. Her energy and playfulness and love is like a drug I can’t get enough of, but I know if I stay with her it will end in misery one way or the other, either through her cheating, me getting tired of arguing and leaving, or her saying something too hurtful for me to live with. I’m so proud of myself making the decision to leave and move on with my life, both for myself and for her, because I know I will be wasting her time if I stayed, and it just isn’t fair. 

I’m truly afraid that I won’t find anyone I love as much as her. I was in a relationship 2x as long as this in the past, but the emotions I felt didn’t even come close to what I felt with this girl. Not even 20%. She helped me open my heart up and be myself, while I helped her control her emotions and impulsive actions. She pushed me to learn more about myself than I ever though was possible, and for that I will be forever grateful. I love you, baby, and with all my heart I wish you the best.

Sorry for the rant but that felt really good to get off my chest. Thanks for reading.",22Sep2018,2

58,"No one has ever been so cruel to me or hurt me as badly as he has. He's the only man I've ever trusted. I am sick in my soul and to my core and I am forever changed. I prayed to god to make me better and to make me stronger for him. I prayed to God to help me feel secure inside, even when I felt his love slipping away, and I felt couldn't trust him. I've been so confused for so long. I wasn't even sure why I stopped trusting him. When we first started dating, he came to me with such absolute and honest intention. Like an actual knight in shining armor. In my head I called him my king. He told me once that the lord told him to take me. I knew he was lying, but I laughed inside at the thought. I wanted so much for the lord to give me to him. I wanted to be his wife and his confidant and his resting place. He was so strong, so protective, and... I am so lost. He suddenly stopped trusting me. He suddenly began accusing me of talking to people, of lying to him, of stealing, of doing things I never did. ... ... I never did until last night. I never once lied to him. I used to flirt with others some in front of him, to try to make him feel jealous. To try to keep his attention on me. I've been cheated on and left by everyman I've ever known. None of them ever gave me love the way he gave me love. I didn't know it was hurting him. I thought it was playful, because I thought he was so strong. I thought he secretly knew that I needed him and that I lived him twice as much as he loved me. I thought he knew that I knew that he was a better soul and a better person and that I would never have thought of betraying him. I guess I was cruel. I didn't mean to be. I didn't know that anyone could see me like that. That anyone could believe that I was beautiful... ... I honestly feel like I a huge piece of me has died. I feel like there is the gaping emptiness, and that if I am not careful, and if I am not stronger than I have ever been, that empty place is at such risk of being filled with a reckless spirit and destruction. ... This has changed me and destroyed me in a way I can't even find the words to say. ... I trusted him so much. I trusted him too much. I gave all of myself to him... and then something changed. He became to blame me. He exchanged his playful gleeful glances with suspicion and judgment. He began to question everything, and to try to control everything. He began to run. He began to drink. He began to tear me apart with his lips, when he once used to kneel and kiss my hurts with those same lips. He began move in a dark, hurtful, and entitled spirit. He ripped apart every part of my character and of my worth. I've never felt such hate. Even though I knew what he was doing. Even though I knew  he was trying to kill his own love for me, I couldn't stop it. I didn't know why. He stopped trusting me, which made me stop trusting him. I could only imagine that he must have found someone better to love and that he felt guilty. ... Now I wonder if he just began to doubt himself, and I didn't recognize it. It's a tragedy. It truly is. But, I'm glad he ended it. I saw that I could no longer satisfy him and that he was dying. I just wasn't strong enough to end it for him. I was never strong enough for him... He is a mountain of a man. The last of his kind. And I... am an empty trashed soul. I'll never trust again as long as I live. Thank you for showing me that I  can be beautiful.

61,"I admittedly have a pretty fucked up way of thinking about life. I am 20 now and over the past years I have essentially modelled my life around being the opposite of my 31 year old brother. 

When he went through university he didn't focus on his studies and pretty much failed out of a degree with minimal job prospects at a poorly ranked university. So I used this to motivate applying for a major with great career prospects (that I happen to enjoy as well!) at one of the best universities in the country. I'm in my third year now, and one of the top students in my comp sci class, again because I'm motivated to do the opposite of my brother.

He has been morbidly obese since his ~2nd year of university, which specifically motivated me to maintain a healthy weight and go to the gym in uni. He never worked while in university, so I've picked up different odd jobs that I really enjoy to support myself and so that I don't need to rely on my parents as much. 

He has never had a girlfriend, which I used as motivation to pursue the girls that I've had crushes on, eventually leading to my current girlfriend. He's still living with our parents - so I'm living away from home and saving up a decent amount of money if I ever need emergency accommodation. 

Telling him that his shortcomings have been my major motivations in life would be fucked, and I absolutely never will. Typing this out makes me feel like a piece of shit. We've always gotten along with each other, and I guess this post serves as a call for help and a way for me to vent. 

My worldview results in positive motivations and has put me on a good track, but it's fundamentally based off of negatives - being the opposite of my brother. I really think as I adjust into adulthood that I need to change this, do any of you have advice for changing something like this which is deeply entrenched?

--

For most of my life I've been mainly attracted to older women. I find women my own age very sexually attractive, and also women who are younger.

But for me to really *want* a woman, I've noticed that she needs to be at least 35. Typically 40s or 50s.

My last relationship--which lasted a decade--was with a woman who was ten years older than me. My current partner is just over 20 years older than me.

It's not like this is bothering me. It's been this way for most of my life, and it just sort of is what it is. I'm not anxious about it, or nervous about being seen in public, or ruminating about what people might think. It's just that more and more I've sort of wondered why.

**About me:**

For what it's worth, I'm attractive, and have never had any trouble talking to women. (I hate talking about myself in this way, but I'll go on for the sake of this post.) Most women I talk to seem to find me attractive, and when I've talked to my friends and partners about this, they agree.

So it's not an issue of not being able to ""get"" a woman my own age or younger. It's really felt more like I've been softly dismissing a lot of women in my age range who are into me.

And I've also found that it's much *more* difficult to get into a relationship with an older woman.

I don't *at all* want kids. So that's never been a factor.

Sexually, I'm dominant. Sometimes very dominant. I can definitely be more submissive, but the requirements there are so long and technical that it rarely happens.

Overall, in day to day life, I tend to me more calm/quiet and aloof, but very assertive in conversation. 

**What I find attractive:**

The older women I'm attracted to are varied. Intelligence and competence are hugely important. But there's also the fact that I'm simply attracted to older women physically. All other things being equal, I think a 45 year old woman's face is significantly more attractive than a 25 year old woman's face. I also like the competency of style that older women tend to have compared to younger women. 

Edit: A bit of pertinent information I didn't think of before--When I was younger, I mostly found women around 35 to be the most attractive. By the time I was mid 20s my ideal age (where I tend to see women as being the most physically attractive) went to around 45. Even though 40s and 50s is sort of ideal, I still find women in their early 30s as attractive as I did when I was 20. So I feel like the overall age range has been static, and that I probably felt a little weird about being attracted to women aged 40+ when I was younger and came to accept it as I got older.

--

Anyway, I'm blanking on what other info I should provide. If anyone has any thoughts about information that might be pertinent, please ask.

TL;DR: I've always been attracted to older women and lately have been wondering why. Any thoughts? ",22Sep2018,1

For cancer and surgeries it's the same, you can be poor as fuck and you will be cured (you'll have to wait but not till a point you die waiting) because WE ARE ALL SONS AND DAUGTHERS OF SPAIN and Spain takes care of its sons and daughters.

I'm not an expert but my theory is that, when you put on private hands something everybody desperately needs no matter the Will and Freedom of the Consumer (because you don't choose to be sick) then Laws of Free Market no longer apply and you create some kind of hiperinflation.

Another theory is that, historically the US has been an immigration country: people is constantly comming from everywhere. So, the original settlers (WASPs) don't want to pay for mexicans, europeans, blacks or asians healthcare so they keep their competitive advantage. If you think about it, societies with too much diversity and a lot of immigration tend to be less cohesive and solidarity is not precisely the thing. But that's just a theory I hope it's wrong...

75,"Long story short, I've had depression for years now. Never took meds or got help, it just kept on getting worse. I barely ate (anorexic) and would cut myself almost every day. I was shy, self conscious, and negative. I lost my closest friend over it. Then, I met a group, albeit a little small with just over 10 people, and it changed my life.

At first, I resented them.
I didn't belong in that group. Then I got closer to some of them and I learned that some weren't so bad. I didnt trust a single one just yet, though. 
Then a few weeks after meeting them, I got in a bad argument and had no one else to turn to but one of the people in that group, so I poured my heart out to her and found out that she was sweet, honest, empathetic, and trustworthy. We talked more and had a lot of fun together. I trusted her. Then I began talking to one of the guys and he turned out to be really great. And again, I struck up a conversation with two of the guys and found a three person group to join, and I loved them more than anything. The others in the group became less of a nuisance and more like friends. 
It was about a month in that I vowed never to cut again. That wasn't so bad. Its manageable. When they started gently pushing me to eat, that's when the battle really began. I hated food. Still dislike it, but getting better. I slowly began to trust them all enough to eat around them, and then I trusted myself enough to eat. From there, it was all just an easy battle. They supported me through every hardship. When I stumbled, they steadied me. Nights were spent laughing among friends rather than bringing the mood down with my sulking. I went from the death of the party to the life of it.

For once in my life, I had energy, boundless energy. I wanted nothing more than to do stuff whereas the old me wanted to sleep all day. I loved people and was no longer shy. I became a charismatic-people magnet, gaining new friends. Every day was brighter; I looked forward to waking up. 

And it was all thanks to a small group of people with widely varying personality types, but one common trait: they all love and support each other in the perfect ways. 

Without these people, I would hate my life. Because of them, theres nothing I love more than living - besides them, of course.
