0,Sometimes I feel like my life will never work out and fate is just leading me away from all the cool things I want to do. like I have no anything that happens to me it's just all a cosmic mess that decided to give me the short end of the straw and it will never let me have the big one.,28Feb2018,2
3,"I thought I could probably connect two phone lines together for a conference call. First I asked at /r/answers/comments/7yjc4z/can_you_electrically_connect_two_phone_lines/ but didn't get an answer. Then I asked at /r/AskElectronics/comments/7ysebw/can_you_electrically_connect_two_phone_lines/ and got pointed toward information at http://artofhacking.com/tucops/phreak/boxes/gold/index.htm which says it should work, though there are better circuits for it.

Today I tried it out. First I saw that phone cords are actually crossover cords. If the wires are colour coded, you can see that the red and green wires are in opposite locations on opposite ends. This would connect phone lines together with reverse polarity, which wouldn't work and might cause damage. So I made a special cord which isn't crossover.

Then I tried, connecting the phone to one line, pressing a number to quiet the dial tone, and then connecting the lines together. I got a fraction of a second dial tone and then nothing. The Arris Touchstone TM822 detects this as a fault, blinking lights and disabling the phone line for maybe a minute. The other VoIP ATA doesn't detect a fault.

I wonder how the detection works? Maybe it detects the on hook voltage going too high?

I guess it would work with some other hardware which doesn't do this detection.

4,Hi reddit. I was recently fired and evicted from the motel i was staying at in the same day. I was told by my cousin by day 3 crashing on his couch he was going to kick my stuff and my cats outside.  I have tried to find a job but to no avail. My mother is living in her car now and I cant part with my cats .. Ive raised them since birth... I'm only 20 in Ohio so I have no credit to move anywhere. Homeless shelters wont accept my cats and I have no one to take care of them that I trust. I dont know what to do.. Any help would be appreciated.,28Feb2018,1
5,"If you browsed /r/videos today, you may have seen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh5sswbaC5U&amp;feature=youtu.be) following the story of a young woman's brain cancer.
 

 
It compelled me to share my own experience with brain cancer.
 
 

When I was in 4th grade, my class went on an all-day field trip to the Bronx Zoo. Before the bus ride home, my teacher, in a very non-cautionary tone, informed me that my mom had been admitted at the hospital, but that everything was fine and there was no need to worry. So I didn't worry.

 

I think she was home when I got back from the field trip, which put me further at ease. Now and again I'd see her leaving for more followups at the hospital. I'm not sure when I realized that she had a malignant brain tumor. It may not have been for months after the field trip, maybe longer. I don't know if it was Glioblastomal like Charlotte experienced, but the end result for my mom was the same regardless.

 
 


My mom's cancer dragged on for the next four years as she slowly but substantially declined mentally and physically. Her diet became largely ensure, she spent her final years confined to her bedroom. I remember her lips becoming very crusty and her eyes glassy and dejected.

 

I regret to admit that the worse she got, the less and less time I'd spend with her. I couldn't stand to look at her and be near her, to come to terms with how her body was destroying her from the inside, it was far to painful for me to deal with at that age. It was a lot easier to shut down emotionally and keep all of my focus on World of Warcraft, which is exactly what I did.

 

The day after l she died, the entire small town had read the obituary and everyone from the bus driver to teachers and even somewhat of a bully of mine offered condolences. It was surreal.

 

I hate that I know so little about her to this day. And how she can never meet my fiance or give me guidance in my journey through adulthood. To an extent, am *still* numb a decade later. Her loss left an unfillable void in my life, which I have gotten used to, but know can never be truly mended.

10,"In our culture sex is supposed to be left until after marriage, and I respect that, and I'm willing to comply with that.

What i don't respect is my mom's preventative measures in not allowing my hymen to break (or what she calls, virginity) by not allowing me to ride a bike. Thing is, many girls in our culture ride bikes. But of course my mom has to be extra careful about it.

It has always bothered me but today I was particularly emotional about it. In my college class our professor showed us a movie called ""Wadjda,"" mostly based on a girl who really wanted to get a bike but her mom wouldn't let her (due to same reasons as my mom). I started tearing up during the movie. It really hit me hard.

All through my childhood I was deprived of a bicycle. I'd go over cousin's houses and they'd all ride their bikes and I'd have to follow behind with a scooter or something. And it's not just that I can't ride a bike that upsets me. There's also the fact that I can't ride one for a really stupid reason, which is to prevent my hymen from breaking.

At 15 I bought roller blades, hoping it would make up for not having a bicycle. It didn't. It just wasn't the same. It wasn't fun. What was fun was that one time I rode my brother's bicycle when I was 10, and then my mom saw me and chastised me and my brother (how could he let his sister ride a bike??).

At this point I don't care about my mom's wishes anymore. Come May I'm going to buy a bicycle. I'm going to ride it. I don't care what my mom says. All my childhood I've been deprived of enjoying one, of traveling with one. I'm 18 now, I have a job, I make my own money, and I'm going to buy one.

I just needed someplace to vent about this. ",28Feb2018,18

For the last 28 years, I’ve been living a lie. And for the past six months, I felt on the verge of something I couldn’t put my finger on. Suddenly, the proverbial light bulb that’s been burned out in my head must have gotten replaced, or the planets must have aligned in a way that has allowed myself to see the light.

I have not been the best person in the world. I have hurt many people, and I’m the most selfish person I know. I’ve always been that person that throws myself a VIP Invite only pity party because of the trauma I went through from childhood. While it truly altered my life and my chance of success thus far, the real problem isn’t what happened to me, the problem is me.

The way I’ve decided to deal with my pain was the worst path I could have possibly chosen -because my actions or dare I say, inactions – only caused me more pain. The worst of all? My pain hurt the people I’ve loved the most , to the point most of them aren’t in my life anymore.

I’ve finally realized that I have been the cause of my own demise. The way I have treated myself and others are just as bad as the pain that was inflicted on me in the first place. I would never wish that kind of pain on any person- yet here I am doing exactly what I thought I could never do to someone, and doing so recklessly.

All I’ve ever wanted was to feel loved and be accepted. But you know what? The love I thought I was giving wasn’t love. It was fear of abandonment. I was giving my loved ones burdens, not love. They say you have to hit rock bottom before you can come back up. Well, my ignorant young self-has been hanging out at rock bottom for at least half my life.

I tried to justify that I was deserving of acting, doing, and being the person I am because I was hurt. As if it was my right to be cold, arrogant, and selfish at the price of others happiness. I pretended like I had things going for myself ;that I was better than that- and that was biggest lie that I could so easily get away with.

How did I do this for so long? Because despite how shitty my actions are, I do contain loveable qualities as a person. I used my looks, my genuine concern for others, and my intelligence in ways no one ever should. I used them to take advantage of people I wanted love from.

Im so good at manipulating that they couldn’t even see me for the person I let pain make of me. That being said, I don’t deserve the friends I have. I truly don’t. I don’t deserve my family. I’ve done nothing to earn any of the things I told myself I deserved and the love and affection I have received. I’m a con artist in essence- But there’s a twist to the point I’m trying to get at.

The person I let myself become doesn’t deserve those people or the things I’ve been given. Now that I am letting everyone know what the truth really is- if you don’t want anything to do with me, I respect your decision. Every person I have ever come into contact with deserved better than what I had been giving them/ or the lack of give.

Now that I’ve looked into the proverbial mirror, I took a good look at this mask I’ve put on and got comfortable wearing for the last 15 years. I decided today that I’m taking that mask off. To be honest, my fashion sense could use some work and this mask is not doing any justice for the beauty that lies deep beyond it.

I’ve always been all talk- and I can’t explain how I’ve come to my realization because just yesterday I had the biggest pity party of 2018. So I guess if any of you have heard me say something like this before, we just gotta wait and see what I mean by this post. To any of the people I call my friends, Let me end the burden of our past relationship by introducing myself.

My name is Leilani Lyn Campbell. I’m gorgeous, I’m full of it -and by it I mean, personality, I’m getting rid of the sh(it) (it was starting to stink). I’m hilarious(obviously- IE this paragraph), I’m determined, I work hard, and I love every living being. I found myself again today. How in the hell did I get so led astray? Oh wait, I forgot that’s in the past. Who cares how it happened. Let’s get to know each other.",28Feb2018,2

19,"
While assisting to a seminar yesterday with a highly honored scientist, which presented his ideas and personal achievements related to renewable energy and climate change. As I listened through the very technical and academic talk, my thinking was...in relation to climate change we are still kind of waiting for that “hero” that will find that source of eternal energy, while everyday we are buying more, using more, wasting more...no matter if you are a vegan or volunteer here and there, it is still not enough!

So, shouldn’t we be doing something else? 

It is my point of view that instead of caring but feeling helpless, we need to be pushed to do more. Our governments should have already established a law for a minimum per month quota of tress and/or coral colonies needed to be planted per person. This could even become a type of currency, which would help us reduce our monthly electric bill, something like the more we plant, the less we pay! 

What I mean is, at the moment we know enough about what needs to be done, science and experience has shown all the evidence. We are aware of the catastrophes and consequences of climate change but, we are kind of doing too little to counteract its effects. 

If we really want to take action, this has to be done by every individual. For real results, it will have to be government regulated. Like it or not, we are all part of the problem, but we can also be part of the solution! 

What do you think Reddit??",28Feb2018,1
20,"Just need a bit of a rant. Not necessarily needing advice. This has been on my mind and won’t go away. 

In middle school I made a long time best friend. Life happened and we eventually spent more time apart both literally and metaphorically. She moved out of the country for a while. I stayed here. We always had the internet to talk through anyway. 

In any case, because of this we’re at different stages in our lives despite being so close in age. I’m married and have a kid now. She just closed on a house but is living a single life. I don’t feel that these differences mean we can’t be friends but they are frustrating when noticed at times. 

Today was my birthday and I was hoping that she would have remembered after 18 years and all. (I mean I got birthday texts from a pen pal I’ve met irl twice and an acquaintance from college, but I digress) Instead she only told me about her housewarming party, which mentioned for everyone to “bring their favorite mind entertainment” which is cutesy for psychedelics or whatever you’re into. Not negging on their choice to do drugs. Everyone else do as they will, but I can’t so that’s not in my life anymore. 

That sort of mentality has been the real nagging issue here. I’m not that person anymore. I can’t be out partying, and I also don’t want to be out partying. Admittedly I really like hanging out with my husband and baby. I also like not having to deal with the “oh come on...”s and subtle guilt that friends sometimes do to each other. 

I’ve been back and forth on ending our friendship. She just seems utterly oblivious and kind of insensitive and I get it. If I wasn’t in this situation I’d be that way too. So every time it’s so conflicting. I’m mad at her, but I understand. She also just seems genuinely happy and excited to talk with me or see me. So then I just feel awful for being mad at her. 

For the most part I’ve tried to be sensitive to her. When we talk I don’t bring up my baby unless she asks. I put the focus of conversation on her and our mutual interests. (It’s also just good for my sanity to talk about real people things with real people. Instead of being in babyworld 24/7.) but I’m starting to have a hard time overall. 

The answer is probably “be honest and lay your feelings out” Really I don’t even know why I haven’t, besides a lack of solid wording of what to tell her. Maybe just the complete lack of mental energy I have to even come up with what to say. Not like I’d really be scared that it would potentially lose her as a friend if I was thinking of ghosting her anyway. 

Ugh. ",28Feb2018,2
21,"So I’ve been in college for 2 years now and I still haven’t made any friends. I definitely put forth an effort to talk to a lot of people in my classes, but the people I talk to always stay just people I talked to in class. I even joined clubs and teams, but still nada.

The thing I’m having the most trouble is making that transition to somebody I talk to in class to someone I hang out with outside of class. I’ve tried inviting them to food afterwards but I always get rejected because they got other classes and then it gets super awkward. 

I feel really pathetic for even writing this post but I am so lonely for a friend. Especially female friends. I want a female friend group so bad but I’m so intimidated by girls. (I used to be bullied pretty harshly by girls in high school). I have high school friends on Snapchat who always seem to be out with new college friends and it just makes me sad that I can’t do the same. ",28Feb2018,2
23,"At this point it just feels like neither of those things will ever happen no matter how badly I may want it or need it.

I never make throwaways but this has been bothering me more and more recently and I really can't talk about it with anyone in my personal life but I have to let it out.

I'm 24 years old. I've had one girlfriend in my life. That was in 4th grade, so more like a ""girlfriend"" than a girlfriend. Other than that no type of relationship or shared personal connection between me and a girl at any other point since.

I'll save you the back story but this is the meat and potatoes of why I'll never feel a woman's touch and be miserably alone my entire existence.

I'm 24 years old and live at home with my two parents.(and my sister and my niece and three dogs but that's irrelevant) I don't have a job and have just one job my entire life that I recently quit. All I day all day is sit at home and play video games in my room like I'm fucking 15 or something. I fucking hate it but it's all I know how to do and it's the only thing that can distract me from how shitty my life is. Here's the kicker, I've steadily put on weight since middle school and currently weigh 408 pounds. I have no self love, no self confidence, no self esteem, none of that. No woman in their right and sane mind would be with me.

I used to think losing weight was the key to getting laid. So last year I went harder than ever and got down to 364, a total of 68 pounds lost. Then I thought maybe if I just had a job I could be a little more attractive to someone but that didn't help. I still didn't have the confidence to talk to anyone or seek out anyone.

I hate everything about my life. I don't want to live anymore but I don't want to die. I'm just a pathetic piece of crap that until things drastically change, I'll never put myself out there because everyone deserves better no matter how nice, or funny, or kind I may be.

24,"I look at lists of careers and jobs and realize I apparently have no personality or aspirations. You know how some people just aren't the type to be a lawyer? Or they have no desire to do that kind of work? That's how I must be about everything.

I wish I had at least been born with a normal-sized body so that I could go do hard manual labor. Being outside and working hard can feel good...But nope, turned out to be a short skinny 'man' with twig arms and feminine hands. I'll probably end up spending most of my life in a grocery store or fast food place.

Moving on. I'm kind of tired of reading the obvious answer ""learn programming"" when people ask about becoming successful without traditional education or certifications. I know some basic Python (have for years but barely improved over the years, I guess.), so a couple years ago, I tried to force myself to learn Django, a Python web framework. I made it through a simple tutorial but started to feel overwhelmed after that. I can solve simple problems with Python, but maybe I don't have the intelligence or grit to go far with programming.

I used to think that I had an aptitude for math, but I might have been fooling myself there too. I used to read math textbooks for subjects a few grades above me when I was younger and even bought some old ones from the thrift store. Sounds like a really lame way to learn about something you like, but somehow I enjoyed it. I did well in math classes through high school, but I know calculus isn't actually too hard, considering what majoring in math is like.

Anyway, I was wondering if there's something else I could learn on my own, like I did math,...that doesn't require a college degree to be successful with it.

But I'll probably end up saying THAT'S NOT REALLY MY KIND OF THING to all of them, because I'm a lazy idiot.

In the 90s for example it was still the 80s until 94 at least with all the music and movies and fashion.  People still had the pedo glasses and the highwasted jeans.  Movies still ended with freeze frames.  Animation on tv was still uninspired looking.  About halfway through the decade did things become what the 90s are more or less remembered for.

The 80s where this way too.  I wasn't around back then but watching movies from the early 80s like Stripes, it had no 80s flair at all, it was clearly a movie made in the 70s despite being made in 1981.  Coming to America was peak 80s.  Free Willy came out in 93, that is an 80s movie.

When people are on 90s nostalgia kicks a lot of the nostalgia is for the 80s instead.  When people talk about how the 80s are back in style I honestly don't believe they ever left.  

Another reason 90s and 80s nostalgia is never ending is because the 00s had no character what so ever.  The 90s started that problem obviously.  Look at a clothing catalogue from then, the models are all wearing primary color sweat shirts and had bowlcuts.  Airbud was peak 90s.  Rock music started looking its edge when every bad got obsessed with ballads.  So when the 00s rolled around it was all down hill from there.

News of this broke me even further, I felt like a failure, and that our relationship meant nothing to them. To be blunt, it hurt. I was suicidal, still can be sometimes if I’m honest. But this made me learn a lot about myself. 

Our relationship lasted for 3.5 years, they were my first everything. First date, first kiss, first lover. And that may mean you want to stop reading this because I don’t have a lot of experience with break ups, but this isn’t about just break ups. This is about what to do when your world falls apart.

So, what did I learn? First let’s look at what I did wrong for 3.5 years.

I stopped doing things I enjoyed. Stopped hanging out with friends, stopped playing sports, stopped caring about myself really. I did everything wrong for myself. For 3.5 years every decision I made was for my SO, I no longer did anything important for myself. When we broke up suddenly I had nothing to fall back on. No hobbies, no friends, nothing I truly enjoyed. Nothing I could use to help me overcome my sadness. They, on the other hand, had friends, hobbies, interests, everything that they needed. 

So, what did I learn? I learned that I wasn’t happy with my life. The reason I was having such a hard time was because my only source of happiness was my SO. This was a massive problem. I wasn’t happy by myself and was relying on someone else to be happy. 

If you’re reading this because you lost your best friend or SO you are probably a little depressed. Human’s are pack animals. We need eachother. But don’t rush into something with someone else. No body is the same as the next person. Take as much or as little time as you need. If you rely on someone else to be happy the same will happen. It will happen again and again and again. If you are not happy, the people around you cannot be happy for you. You may be told that you’re happy. And they may be right in that moment. But overall you may be very sad. True happiness isn’t when someone else says that you’re happy, it’s when you can stand in an empty room with white walls, white ceiling, white floor, no windows or doors and declare to no one at all that you are happy.

True happiness for you can only be obtained by you. It took me a while to realize this. I learned this while I was shoveling snow that was in my driveway. I also thought about what it takes to be happy and what happens when you are happy.

What it takes to be happy. Not a lot really, you simply must do what you want to, regardless if it hurts someone else. You may disagree with me on that point, but it is true. My SO broke up with me because they wanted to be happy and I wasn’t letting them be happy. If what makes you happy is helping others, then that’s great; however, not everyone is like that. You, reading this right now, may be one of the people that will step on someone else for your own happiness and maybe you already have. I know that I have. I’ll say again, you have to make yourself happy. Put yourself above all others. If you need to hurt someone else, remember that you are putting yourself first. No one is against you, just for themselves and that is what you need to do. If playing sports makes you happy, play sports; if its helping the homeless, go for it; movies, shows, arts, literature, doesn’t matter. Does what makes you happy.

What happens when you’re happy. Well for starters, you’re no longer sad all the time. You’ll feel better about yourself and what you do. Your confidence will get a massive boost. And the most important part: other people will be happier around you. When you aim for your own happiness others that want to share your happiness will flock to you. Its like a magnet for others. And you will have much richer and closer relationships with other people. But, never fall back on someone else to make you happy. As soon as you do your problems will begin again. 

I have said that you should make yourself happy, but that isn’t entirely true. Happiness can not be achieved by everyone. Instead most will have to settle for being content. Happiness should always be your goal, but being content is good enough for life.

If you take one thing away from this it should be that you are responsible for your own happiness.

38,"The facts are coming out that states the last 2 generations are highly more likely to become depressed and commit suicide. Also more and more people are using cell phones and facebook. Make the connection? I see the effects in myself along with my sister. I actually broke down last night on the 12th hour on youtube in tears because I became so depressed. I've felt it. and I know you have to use these cell phones responsible. You either use them correctly and smart or don't use them at all because they can be dangerous. So I thought.. if I can use them correctly, I can actually tap into the world my sister is trapped in and I can pull her out essentially. But how? Well maybe I can tap into the social media sites and post content myself about life beyond the screen and possibly inspire kids like my sister to put the phone down, or atleast lose interest in the bullshit that she eats on that phone. But this can be dangerous for me, it's risky because I can get trapped into the system myself if I get caught up in the likes and criticism. I just need to post stuff of me being a true human being, as I soak sun and eat as healthy as one can eat so I can show true 100% human qualities to pull even more kids to my content to get them interested in lifestyles other than couch watching netflix chilling, life decaying habits. And doing all this for my sister makes more sense than doing it for money. So lets go guys. This is the true fight. I'm going in the battlefield. Wish me luck.   ",28Feb2018,0
39,"I keep seeing news articles saying the blockchain will change everything, for so many types of information. The problem that none of these articles seem to get is that you need a whole lot of computers grinding the information in order to provide any sort of authenticity to the result, because if anyone had more than 51% of the computers on a blockchain they can arbitrarily change the info.

Noone is gonna leave their PC on at home just to help maintain blockchains for some company's batch tracing, or for a random insurance company's document chain of custody.

Not unless they're getting reimbursed.

So the company is just maintaining its own block chain, and thus nothing is different than a standard database.

41,"im not sure if im right or wrong or what. i feel like im stuck in some kind of nightmare. i feel powerless and helpless. ive asked for help before but i feel uncomfortable asking people for help nowadays because i feel like i've let them down so many times. i dont want to drag them under too. im scared. i dont want to drown but i ESPECIALLY dont want to be a burden. i feel like if i just lay here and give up, nobody else is going to have to deal with me and everyone will be better off because of it.

i only have 2 goals: get fit and get As. i have given up on all of my other dreams for the time being.right now im failing both to a catastrophic degree. 

i havent been sleeping much at all, and even when i do sleep i dont feel rested.

i havent been eating much at all. i dont even get an appetite when im hungry, and im stressed which makes it worse.

i havent gone to the gym all month. i did daily runs here and there to try to feel better but couldn't stick to it. i tried hard to enjoy lifting weights and running but i just felt weak, skinny, and insecure the whole time. i thought i would give anything to be big and muscular, but i guess thats not the case, is it? if i REALLY wanted it, i would just go out and do it.

i havent gone to class in 3 weeks now. im definitely going to fail both of them. i reduced my workload so that i would be able to focus better, but it didn't help at all and im still just as awful at time management as always.

i dont shower every day even though i try to. my acne is getting steadily worse and i think im reinfested with scabies for the 3rd time. the permethrin is going to be an ordeal again, im going to itch all over my body for another month and a half no matter what i do.

i spend all my time on the computer and i keep trying to quit but i cant. i dont know how. i even tried unplugging it and hiding it, but i just spent all my time on my phone, in my bed, or on my 3ds until i finally gave up and dug it back out again. i dont need my computer for school. i dont know why i cant just quit or fill my time with anything else. 

my car broke down. it's the ignition. i dont have a job so i dont have money to fix it or to uber around. i feel trapped in my bedroom and im letting it go to shit on top of that. i only have enough money left over to pay the rent through march - if i spend any more, my rent check will bounce. this also means i dont have the money to go see a therapist, since the copay would be too much. i only get 45 minutes and it's $20. not that it matters anyway...all the therapists at my insurance are booked until april.

i dont even know if i can afford to feed myself. im trying not to think about that.

i dont want to move back in with my parents and have my whole family see how awful ive become. i have to look strong for them. i cant let myself break down in front of them. it wouldnt be fair to ask them to take care of me again, after all we've all been through. my sister attempted suicide last year. this would be too much.

the only thing that makes me happy nowadays is making other people happy, but im not doing such a great job of that. i dont have any friends and im letting my family down. i dont have motivation to do anything anymore. im ashamed of myself for all of my failures. they're all my fault and i havent improved from any of my mistakes. im just a failure.",28Feb2018,1

45,"Hi all - need honest opinions on something that's been bothering me for a while.

Around January 17 I had been with my current gf for two months. Everything was good up until this point, although I was always a little wary that she had a bit of a wild streak in her and had made a few bad decisions in the past when it came to being faithful.

On one night at the end of January 17, she went on a night out with friends. At around around 5pm she text telling me she'd bumped into a guy she had met around the same time we did - he liked her and had been a bit of a creep constantly messaging her (I wasn't too happy about this and the fact she wouldn't cut him off). 

I became a little worried when she said that things were potentially going to be a bit crazy that night and that there were drugs being passed around the group (I assumed this guy had joined too). 

At around 7pm she text me telling me how much she loved me, that I was her no.1, how she'd never mess me about, but that she needed to go hang with her friends. It was clear from her tone that she had taken something.

I then received another text at approx 10pm, saying sorry for the delay, that she loved me and then at 2am she text again saying she was home.

Next morning she called me. She had woken up with a huge bruise down her leg. She was scared/anxious and said a few concerning things like ""oh why does this sort of thing happen as soon as I have something good"". My initial gut reaction was something bad had happened. She was bleeding from vagina and she had a feeling she'd had sex the previous night although she couldn't remember anything.

Over the next week I stayed with with her - she went to a rape crisis centre and the doctors to get checked up as she felt she'd been sexually assaulted. Everything was all clear health wise but she decided not to go ahead with criminal investigation and it was not clear whether there was anything in terms of a date rape drug.

We now fast forward 8 or so months. I always wondered what had happened that night. I was confused because despite saying she'd been totally blacked out and couldn't remember anything, she was still able to text me really regularly throughout the night, and there was a part of me concerned with the fact she'd found herself in situations like this on two previous occasions when she was younger where things had gotten out of hand and something bad had happened.

Regretfully I then did some snooping on her Facebook and saw messages she sent to her friend the next day after the incident saying she'd fucked up and that whilst she couldn't remember how she got her bruise she mentioned that it was probably from having had really rough sex with a guy the previous night. The messages were very jovial and trying to laugh off the situation, and that her friend were not to tell anyone as she was meant to be seeing me. 

This totally crushed me and I confronted her. She was so upset and maintained she had been sexually assaulted and that she'd never do something so bad as to cover up things. She promised me nothing wrong by me had happened and that the messages were her of dealing with things by trying to make it seem less sinister the day after. She detailed that she remembered being in a car with someone and having anal sex and telling the person to stop but being laughed at being hit. She was very sorry. 

I just dont know what to think. Her version of events certainly makes it seem like something horrible happened, and I understand these sort of traumatic events can have a weird effect on how someone reacts, but objectively there are things which don't quite add up and I've been anxious ever since that she did just cheat on me.

I don't want to bring it up again as she's having counselling atm for depression, but I need to advice or guidance on whether this all at it seems.

Tldr; girlfriend goes out, can't recall having sex but claims she was sexually assaulted. Other things suggest this is untrue. I need advice.",28Feb2018,5

He didn’t turn his lights on or anything, but I’m wondering whether or not they tell other cops to look out for your car or your license plate to ticket you at a different time. This is unlikely, but I’ve been curious for a while as to whether or not they do this sort of thing",28Feb2018,1
