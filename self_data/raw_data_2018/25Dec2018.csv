4,"I’m a 23 y/o M. It’s Christmas, it’s a good feeling being with the family and having some good time with them, and I really should feel lucky about it, but suddenly I get annoyed and don’t really want to interact with them because it’s like I don’t have anything to say or sometimes I don’t really feel like I fit in, and it’s the same when going out with many of the friends I’ve been hanging out with for the past 7-8 years, some of them are really close friends and it’s cool hanging out with, but with many of them I can feel the distance, like I couldn’t interact much with them because I don’t know what to say and we don’t have many common interests really. It’s not always like that, when I’m in a good mood and have a so called ego boost then I can easily talk to people but that happens rarely, and many times I just end up greeting people and not knowing what to say and just would like to avoid that. Do you think I can learn how to manage this, and if yes, how can I do that? I just want to give some “good energy” and just be friendly you know, I feel like a nice person but can’t always express myself in front of everyone.",25Dec2018,1

6,"We went to highschool together, and started dating the summer after. Then we did long distance while I went to community college in our home town and she was 2,000 miles away. But We had 2 whole summers together, and all the breaks, vacations, meet up trips at diff. colleges ect. It was both our first relationships, and she was the second person I'd been with. She'd had more experience sexually, and honestly acted like a slut on her social media while away (most of the time just to piss me off when I was busy or ignoring her). Eventually I learned everything about her past, and grew to love her unconditionally.

&amp;#x200B;

But when we were first apart and starting college that shit made me really jealous so I cheated on her. Not like actual cheating, but I would hang out with a girl, and I'd let this girl touch me and feel important. I felt really guilty and told my gf's bestfriend who agreed to keep it a secret as long as I never repeated that behavior\*—\*which I didn't..

&amp;#x200B;

Those 2 years passed by way too fast. I was grinding a job and taking the maximum credits year round. Then I got into a really prestigious university. All that hard work had finally paid off, and it definitely went to my head. Looking back at last summer, you could see how worried my gf was, and how hard she was trying. I'd never had a problem with her weight, but she lost 20lbs that summer. I was so proud of her. She started integrating me into her family a lot more and I would fly her up to my new appt. at the new school all the time, reassuring that I wasn't going to leave her.

&amp;#x200B;

So 2 days after I left to start school, and for reasons irrelevant to the post, the bestfriend told her what had happened like almost 2 years ago, and it broke my gf's heart. But she forgave me! We were so in love.. Everything wasn't great, but we were working on it. I was also joining a fraternity with all my friends, and one morning I woke up to 3 missed calls from her. I was hungover and barely woke up in time for class. She'd failed a test, and needed me. When I got out of class I tried calling her like a million times, but went to voicemail over annnd over. She was grilling me over text. Then I flipped a switch, and left the stupidest voicemail ever: saying I couldn't take it anymore. BLOCKED.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been exactly 3 months since that day, and I am still blocked. I dropped the frat a few days later, thinking that would get her back. It didn't. I spent 2 weeks in bed. Started writing letters. Got on some meds. Started seeing a therapist. Got with quite a few girls thinking that would kill the pain. Started filling all my time with extracurricular clubs. Joined a sports team. Nothing really worked. I still think she's the best thing that ever happened to me, and I love her.

I'm on a skit-trip now with my family; I had to get away from our hometown this winter break b/c she's there now. All our friends are there. It hurts too much! To be 3 miles from her, and her still not wanting to see me. I've been thinking about one last letter to send her. I haven't wrote in over a month, but I think this letter will ultimately say goodbye, and wish her the best. I think I'm just confused and have unresolved feelings of guilt. I knew her so well, and I know she wants me to hurt forever for what I did, and probably keep fighting for her, and maybe one day she'd take me back, but my heart has been broken for too long, and I've honestly grown to resent her for how she has been able to live with herself in blocking me.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr** GF blocked me 3 months ago, but I still love her. I'd like to have her back, but that seems really unlikely. At the very least I'd like to hear from her, and just get her current perspective so I can have some closure and not feel so confused.",25Dec2018,1
7,"I've never really expressed my own political opinions ever in any form. No tweets, snaps, not even talking. If anyone brought up anything political I've just stayed silent. My parents are very conservative, and as I've developed my own identity I've found myself on the other side of the political spectrum and so I've just kept everything to myself. I already to keep to myself enough and am not much of a family person. I never wanted politics to ruin anything. 

About a month ago I retweeted something by a friend with #trumpresign. Tonight after opening presents my parents confronted me asking if I hated our president and country, that I should really think about my actions before I do anything. The conversation was short, but I just feel alienated. I feel like I'm the disappointing child. I can't leave for another 3 days, and I just feel sick to my stomach that I'm hiding in my old bedroom.",25Dec2018,1

9,"Hey all,

Just wanted to wish everyone a Merry Christmas Eve (or Day, depending upon where you are :), and, as per my holiday tradition the last few years, just wanted to say that if you're having a rough holiday I'm happy to listen here or in a DM or whatever.

I know family stuff can be hard, the season can put the financial squeeze on you, and so many other things can be difficult at this time of year.  You aren't alone and I've been so encouraged by so many of the things I've seen here throughout the year so I'm happy if I can give any of that back to any of you.

Merry Christmas!",25Dec2018,1
10,"Advance warning: long post is long.

I was an active kid. Then my parents divorced at 8 and I left homeschooling for public school. The days spent sitting at a desk + terrible food made me a chubby preteen. At 14 I began dieting and working out, and by 17 I was running a few miles everyday before school.

Then I moved to California and got my first job, working overtime in fast food. The floors and long hours were hard on my body and I fell out of the habit of running for a while. I didn't have a car so walking  between 3 and 5 miles everyday to get to and from work kept me in shape.

A few years later, I got a new place just a few blocks from my (new) job and took up running again. But then my life went to crap. I started seeing a psychologist who referred me to a psychiatrist who prescribed a bunch of meds that left me with long term physical and mental side-effects. The meds made me anxious and angry and I frequently came home from a run feeling like I wanted to start a fight or break something. I stopped running and I stopped taking the meds.

I lost my job later that year due to downsizing and moved back home with my family. Internally, I was a mess. Not only was I too depressed to exercise, I was eating way more food since my parents were paying and most socializing here involves going out to eat. I had been starving when I left California and my self-control when given large portions of food was gone. I gained fifty pounds in a year. The first thing my friends said when they saw me a year later was that I had gotten fat. I was about thirty pounds over my normal weight, which was twenty pounds higher than what I had been when I left (nothing like staving off hunger pangs with Adderall!). The kicker is that I remember coming home, being fussed over because I was SO skinny, all while looking at my family, seeing stretch marks on their arms, and thinking, ""I'll NEVER look like that."" Oh boy.

That was six years ago. Since then I've gained an additional hundred pounds. That's right--I now weigh twice what I did when I moved home in 2012. There are a LOT of factors. One is that I make a lot more money now and can afford to eat garbage food whenever I want. I work a high stress job where ""treating yourself"" is part of the culture. I DO still have several healthy habits from my teens, such as not drinking soda or fruit juice, limiting my sweets, and not eating foods with zero nutrition such as twinkies, zebra cakes, etc.

The other factors, besides how much high calorie food I eat, is how little I exercise and how my body likes to cling to food.

I started running as a teenager because, despite the fact that my mom and I were both dieting and I was eating LESS than she was and NEVER cheated, I was constantly plateuing. I found that my body really needs exercise. When I don't exercise regularly, everything I eat gets stored as fat. My dad's side of the family is like this--my grandma had to cut out all sugar and almost all carbs entirely in 2009 to maintain a healthy weight. My mom, on the other hand, eats over 2k calories worth of burgers, fried chicken, candy, and ice cream in bed all day and weighs around 180lbs. My youngest brother subsists entirely on coca-cola, french fries, and chicken strips and is underweight.

Besides eating less (and healthier), I NEED to exercise if I'm ever going to be truly healthy. The weather is unpredictable here. There aren't many sidewalks. And what's worse, after so many years of not exercising, when I tried to start again last year, I found that I couldn't anymore.

I used to walk upwards of five miles a day just to get coffee, buy a book, and see the city. I used to volunteer to staff events in LA for free room and board and spent my time off exploring the city on foot. I once walked all the way from City Heights, SD to Seaport Village just to check out their bookstore (which is awesome).

I was the walking girl. People would tell me I should join a group of hardcore walkers who would walk from Los Angeles to San Francisco in a few weeks. I frequently walked from my place in North Park to the San Diego airport to meet friends, and once even laughed at someone who bet I couldn't beat them back to my apartment on foot (I won, they had to call a taxi halfway through when their legs cramped up). I couldn't f*cking believe that **I** was having this problem. In August of 2017, I put on my walking shoes to walk around the block, and couldn't even make it halfway down the street without needing to sit down.

That was when I made the decision that this couldn't continue.

I had no idea how much walking I COULD tolerate. I tried fifteen minutes. Then I tried ten. Then five. Finally I decided to start at the bottom. I began walking in place for ONE minute everyday as soon as I got up. After a week, I raised it to two. A week later, three. And so on, until I got to fifteen.

I'm still walking in place for 15-20 minutes everyday and while I can feel a difference, there was muscles in my legs and lower back needed for walking that rarely got used. So at night, during my second break at work, I started walking up and down the halls for five minutes three times a week. At first it hurt like hell.

I now walk up and down the halls for ten minutes every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I fully intend to get up to at least half an hour sometime next year. And when, when I move back to California for work in 2020, I'll make it a habit to explore the city on foot again.

My goal is to visit Paris before I'm 35 and spend an entire day exploring the city on foot. :)",25Dec2018,1
11,"Don’t know where else to post this, and just wanted somewhere to express frustration. 

My mom ordered my young siblings some presents and realized today they never showed up. She checked her Amazon orders and it says they were delivered Friday with a picture attached, clearly showing the package at our front door.  She, nor any of my siblings or I, got the package from the front door. It was stolen. We had been visiting with my grandfather all Friday as he is doing very poor. 

The act of stealing packages is so cruel, especially around this time of year. It was around 80 dollars worth of presents, which is quite a bit of money to us. My mom is so upset because she doesn’t have the gifts she ordered and ran out today to get a bunch of last minute small things so they would at least have something to open. 

I just wanted to rant, because I feel horrible for my mom and even offered to buy my siblings stuff with my money, but she declined. 

Package thieves are pathetic. Merry Christmas and happy holidays!

13,"**TL;DR:**

A friend of mine wanted me to help him lose weight and resulted in me almost being kicked-out of my gym along with a membership revocation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quick Backstory:**

I would like to start-off by stating that **I am** ***not*** **a Personal Trainer,** ***nor*** **am I certified or being paid by any gym, let alone the one I go to**. I *am*, however, a total fitness-junkie and have been for the past five years this coming March. I love everything about physical fitness, &amp; healthy food and it's the best decision I've ever made in my life and have so far *(knock-on-wood)* been completely injury-free. So much so that I've had friends come out of the wood-work every now and again to ask me for advice and I'm always more than happy to help when I can. I've gone to only one other gym before the one I go to currently where I started my fitness journey and have only passed on dieting tips that's worked for me and minor help with proper form and until now, no one batted an eye.

&amp;#x200B;

**Today:**

So recently a friend had wanted to go to the gym with me to help him lose a bit of weight. He had his workout and I had mine. I showed him how to do some of the exercises with very light weights and on most I worked out along side him until he used a machine I thought was simple enough for him to maneuver by himself; then I would do my own thing and return. About halfway through I did pull-ups and had my earbuds in. After I finished that exercise and pulled my earbud out, some dude working out next to me motioned for me to come to him and he reached out for a bro-hug, which I really wasn't into (so it seemed really awkward) because it was a complete stranger. He then told me that he overheard a few people were ""seriously insulting \[me\] you, talking shit."" I asked who and he promptly pointed them out. It was a few guys who I don't know at all. I thought that was really odd because I've never had that happen in the gym before. Ever. It was odd and a little hurtful, but I brushed it off...

Now I was helping my friend do bicep curls. Out the corner of my eye I saw an employee with his arms crossed looking at me, then also motioning to come to him. He promptly told me to stop what I was doing and leave or I will be escorted out of the gym and have my membership permanently revoked due to looking like I'm training my friend and not being a certified trainer. At this point I absolutely apologized my ass off. I wasn't sure if he was the manager or a regular employee but he did seem nice enough about it, I think, but I was still almost at a loss for words; I was terrified because this has never happened to me before and it felt like a teacher handing you a detention slip. Now, at this point after the conversation ended I was trying to think from his point of view and all these legal issues that could pop up if something did happen to my friend while working out *(note: my friend(s) were also not paying me for any of this, btw. Never have.)* and I started cringing and feeling embarrassed. Now I'm kind of embarrassed to go to that gym anymore.",25Dec2018,1
14,"I fucking suck. I wanna say fuck everyone and that I hate every single person but the only reason people have treated me the way they did is because I let them and I have no respect for myself or others. I have never respected anyone, I have no manners, I have gotten through life by lying&amp;cheating, and I’ve been an arrogant entitled shit for 21 years. 
At my old university, which was a small campus, I joined a frat that I knew I hated but I did it anyways cause I thought I could get girls and make friends. All I did was talk shit and complain while pledging. I over shared  everything about my life, and pretended to like everyone so I can get weed and alcohol. I always smoked people up but it was annoying how much I would mooch off people. I realize this now but everyone in that frat just treated me like a joke. I had this own little “im the center of world” narrative in my head and everyone just played along with it cause fuck me. No one actually liked me. I would basically beg for girls to sleep with me or just constantly check them out and after awhile I realized I was the creep on campus. I would be friends with people solely for weed but convince myself otherwise so I could still seem like the good guy in my own eyes. When I got high I acted like a fuckin genius and everyone had a great time feeding into that delusion. 
Every person I met I over shared about my mental illness that I used as a crutch for so long, I would be so disrespectful around black people, talking to them in a stereotypical manner cause I thought I related with black people. I relied on other people for validation and I’m just flat out annoying and overbearing. I’ve always been a lazy sack of shit and my closest friend came to realize that soon too and distanced himself from me. I wanna change but I’m scared I’m gonna be this little shithead for the rest of my life. ",25Dec2018,1

17,"This happened last night, about 7 hours ago. My wife and I went out to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We got a hotel in a bigger city nearby and had a great evening at a restaurant downtown. As it turned out, a couple of our friends were also in town and just a few blocks away. We met up for a couple drinks, which turned into more than a couple. At the end of the night, my wife and I made our way back to the hotel and eventually fell asleep.

I woke up in the middle of the night to pee, and in a mix of sleepiness and being a bit drunk, I stepped through the front door. By the time my brain clicked that I was clearly in the wrong place, the door latches and I’m standing in the fucking ice cold hallway.

Butt-naked. 

Fuck. Just thinking about it makes me blush and tense up.

I started lightly knocking, trying to not draw too much attention, but my wife wasn’t coming. I started to panic, and bang harder and harder. She was still passed out. Uggghhh. After about 4 to 5 minutes of sheer panic, a security guard showed up, I was utterly mortified. I started to try and explain what happened, but part way through, one of the neighbouring room door opened, and the guy started to yell at me for all the noise. So here I am, naked, getting yelled at in a hotel hallway, with 2 guys staring at me. All I could do was cover my package with both hands and apologize. Mid apology, my wife opens the door, stares at me, starts laughing VERY loudly and asks what in the sweet hell I’m doing in the hallway ""buck ass naked"".

I’ve stayed in our room all day as my wife is teasing me non-stop. I just want to leave.",25Dec2018,1

This mental energy gives a physical form to everything.

When we die, this % of mental energy transforms into something different.

You can imagine the process of dying as a travel to a paradise where time is not so you can erase all your past attachement and you cease to exist as an individual. This can be grasped with psychedelics.

23,"Once upon a Time, I wasted a good amount of emotional energy on the trashy parts of this site. Mainly politics, relationships and I must say most of the support subreddits. Under a different account I was actually guild it for a post on raised by narcissists, but then I realized it's like covering yourself with mud and wondering why you're still dirty. nothing is gained by sitting around with other adults and complaining about why your parents are still mean while you're in your twenties or thirties living with them.


Yet, I've learned so much from car specific subreddits, career specific subreddits, and car buying subreddits. I've easily saved a few thousand dollars by using this site. I think it points to, the quality of person who reads something like hey I need my car fixed, vs my mom or my dad doesn't like that I want to be a rapper and I'm only 32 why do they hate my dreams. I must stay, when you stop feeling sorry for yourself all day and instead find something more productive, like researching cars or programming, life just naturally gets better.

Don't spend all day looking for advice from people who can't really give you good advice, relationships is particularly nasty, because I feel like no one in that entire subreddit has any idea what money is. I'll give you a personal story , a few years back me and my sister had a nasty dispute about taking care of our mother. I go to our relationships and to be fair I did say I hated the city I was living in, I didn't like the people I was meeting, and I really wanted my sister to help me more in regards to my mom. Of course I was told I was a piece of s***, but you want to know what happened the moment I left that toxic City. My sister magically figured out, she was going to have to take a more active role in taking care of our mother and I've had the freedom to live my life.

Give you a tip, about taking care of a parent. Younger people have no f****** idea what that entails, the only vaguely imagine what they would totally do. Ask yourself someone in their 50s what they did to take care of their mother or father when said parent got old. And I've heard this at least a dozen times, one child will give a s*** oh, the other ones will have their butts so far up their faces they'll assume oh whatever it will all be okay. And since I'm a f****** saint, I do give my sister money whenever she needs it. At this point I'm basically Western Union, takes me about a week or so but I send the money without complaint. R relationships lives in an alternate reality we're magical resources come out of the woodwork so you don't have to disrupt your life if your parents didn't save for retirement.

 Hell, the moment I left that f*****-up hellhole city I met my first long-term girlfriend . We dated for a year  and it was awesome. The moral to the story is, people will extort you to the limit you let them.

And let no one invalidate your own personal reasons, for wanting to do something. If you want to move because you like to watch raccoons and your current city doesn't have as many, Godspeed and enjoy the city you pick.


But oh, that's only the negative side of Reddit. The better parts I've been able to gain so much knowledge about how to better my career, how to better my finances, and even what car I should buy. So this is the best site on Earth, and the worst site on Earth.

You just need to look in the right place, and lastly if you move to a new city and you find everyone's an unemployed loser, move. And hurry, before you also end up doing nothing all day and wondering why your life sucks.",25Dec2018,1
24,"It's the holidays, so I'm back in my hometown with family and trying to get some stuff done before the spring semester begins. Nothing's changed about my hometown except for all the missing older folks who died battling different variants of cancer. It's quite gloomy not seeing those folks around, from neighbours to family friends, distant relatives and even randoms who people knew by just a nickname. Shit's depressing.

I never had many hometown pals but of the few I have we stay relatively connected and check in on each other. I did, know a lot of other folks but never got close to them on the basis that, anything I tried to do would be met with a wave of negativity (shooting down ideas, goals, aspirations, dreams, etc). A couple of hours ago, a pal told me, someone, I knew from way back invited me to an event after my pal mentioned I was in town. This offer to the event was solely on the basis that I could get myself there, which that contact from years ago assumed I wouldn't be able to do. It stems from me not learning how to drive nor owning a car (I'm absolutely afraid of driving); I usually commute to get to where I need to go unless someone offers me a ride and its no hindrance to them. I just brushed it off and never replied. It's just disappointing that I wasn't even given the opportunity to arrange transport to whatever it was that I was ~~invited~~ to? 

It's Christmas and my parents ain't feeling it. We used to put up a tree, decorate it and prepare food in advance but there's none of that. My parents had an altercation; they cursed each other out and aren't speaking at the moment... there's no tree, no food, just an awkward silence and background noise from the tv that was left on.

I can’t really eat, so it’s kind of meh. I still can’t sleep. Not from excitement, though. I can’t even describe this feeling.

Sudden post turn! I got into a car accident almost exactly a week ago. It was my fault. Luckily, I was the only one of three unable to walk away from it.

33,"49 year old male here. I got hospitalized on Sunday Morning here in Australia because of a huge pain in my left abdomen. No idea what it was. Woke up my wife at 2am and told her to drive me to hospital.

Yeah the pain was pretty bad. Once I got into emergency they put morphine into me and the next morning I had a CT scan which confirmed that I have a 2mm stone passing through me. I felt a lot better on Sunday and came home. I was well enough to pick up my son from work on Christmas eve.

So Christmas day has come. Family handed out presents. Now it's 4.20 pm and I'm in pain again. The doc from the hospital prescribed me some Hydrocodone which I have just taken. Never had it before but I have had other opioids in the past so I'm looking forward to less pain and lots of sleep.

The most annoying thing about this is that the pain is also going along the nerve that tells my brain that I need to urinate. So I'm constantly going off to the toilet to urinate a  teaspoon. Then I come back and I need to urinate again. The feeling is constant. Really, really annoying.

So I'm lying in bed. I live in Tasmania Australia so it's sunny outside, 24 degrees C, ceiling fan on. Lying here typing into my laptop with a pain in my left side and the desire to urinate.",25Dec2018,1
34,"I truly didn’t think of myself as having a weight problem until today.

I used to be muscular in highschool, so the BMI kind if lost its legitimacy to me. I was very fit but technically “overweight” but what I felt like were very flawed standards.

4 years later I’ve finished college and barely worked out since. I didn’t really keep track of my weight throughout college, so imagine my disdain and and utter refusal believe my doctor telling me I should lose 35 pounds today. From my perspective they basically didn’t know what they were talking about.

And then I saw it. Our christmas pictures. My face was so fat I barely recognized myself. I guess I had really desensitized myself in terms of looking in the mirror because it was straight up shocking. I felt embarrassed and inadequate the whole night. I feel more motivated than ever to work out or take up a recreational sport or something. Just had to get this off my chest because I feel embarrassed saying this to anybody I know.

46,"Tonight for Christmas Eve, I had dinner at my godparents’ house. I stayed until very late into the night talking with them and eventually my childhood became the subject of conversation. My godparents have known me for my entire life and have supported me through my parents dying and my terrible borderline abusive legal guardian in my teen years.

After my mother died when I was 10, my dad fell into a deep depression. I remember the house being horribly messy. It was always messy, and I was never allowed to have friends over as a kid because of this, but the house was **really** messy after that. I remember there being literal piles of junk, toys, and papers on the floor of every room. My room was completely blocked off by piles of stuff so I slept in my dad’s bed with him for quite a while. My dad was incredibly ill and was going through dialysis due to his kidney failure, so he was extremely weak and could barely do anything, especially clean. When my godparents found out the hell we had both been living in, they helped clean out the house and make it livable again. I remember all of this.

After talking with my godparents, there’s apparently a bunch of shit I have either blocked out or don’t remember, I don’t know which one. The kitchen sink was apparently so full of rotting food and water that it was almost overflowing and there were maggots living in it. Under my bed was a loaded gun for some reason. There were ashtrays everywhere and cigarettes and ashes were all over the floor in every room. The carpet hadn’t been vacuumed in months/years.

This is scary shit. I was shocked when they told me this and I’m surprised I don’t remember much about it. I definitely don’t remember it being this bad. They suggested that maybe it was because that was just the norm for me for a while, but I’m not sure.

All of this made me remember the terror I felt during that period in my life. Because of my dad’s dialysis he developed neuropathy in his legs, meaning that he had less feeling in them and couldn’t move them as well as he used to. He was extremely weak. I remember several incidents that started with me being a kid on the computer, minding my own business. Then I would hear a loud *thump* that made the floor shake and maybe a curse word or two. This meant that my dad fell down. My heart would immediately start racing. Many times, almost always in fact, he couldn’t get back up. The only other person in the house was me, a 80lb child who was not fit at all to help him up. I could barely do it because he was practically dead weight. It was always a terrifying task for me because of how weak he was and what horrible shape he was in and how hard he was breathing. In fact, there was literally an *entire weekend* when he sat down on the couch after dialysis and could not get up. I had to learn how to cook Top Ramen for both of us. He was too proud and stubborn for his own good and literally begged and screamed at me to not call for help. Luckily I eventually did on Sunday, and a family friend rushed him to the hospital.

This makes me wonder. What other horrible things have I blocked out from my childhood? How can I find these things out? Should I find these things out? What should I do about the new emotions I have about my parents and childhood? I have a therapist but am not seeing her for two weeks.

Thanks for letting me vent.",25Dec2018,1
47,"I used to write fanfics and poetry on Wattpad (oof, i know) and I took a break from writing a while back because i didn't feel motivated to anything. Now I started writing again because I want a better way of expressing myself (or moderately better than keyboard smashing) and when I checked my old drafts on Wattpad, I feel so, so, so bad. I was so insecure back then about my writing and when i read those works now, I feel like i became worse. I lost all my writing knowledge (okay, not all) and I can NEVER create like I used to. 

These days I don't have the motivation to do anything. I took a break from Instagram to see if it works and it didn't. Along with that I got problems with food and every single meal time is hell for me because i have this need to starve myself to become beautiful (which i am wholly aware is not how it works) and all i can think of is the amount of calories i consumed that day. 

I tried focusing on art too because 'it brings me true happiness' or whatever yet i cannot be satisfied with anything i create.

64,"For the past few years I’ve been trying to repair my relationship with my father. He was abusive to me during my childhood - when I reached my early adulthood I basically cut him off. I held on to all of this bitterness and anger towards him for years, decades even. 

After a number of years of therapy I managed to let go of those feelings and forgive him. I realized that I wanted him in my life, even if only in a small way. I began to reach out to him; I’d call him randomly to see how he was doing, come visit him every few months. Our relationship was not one of father/son but it was getting better, slowly. 

Last week I invited him to a very small, intimate Christmas party that I was throwing for close friends and family. Literally seven people, including him and his wife. He agreed to travel down for the party which made me really happy knowing I’d have all of my loved ones in the same room.

Yesterday night he called me, drunk, and informed me that five other family members were also going to come. Mind you, he didn’t ask me, he told me. I told him that’s not something I wanted - my apartment is all of 500 sq ft, and the menu was specifically planned for seven people. He responded with, “you’ll figure it out. There’s no other choice.”

I meekly hung up, realizing I’d now have to scramble like crazy to accommodate these other people, that I didn’t even want at my party. My stress and anxiety level shot up immediately. More than that, I felt something else, something I couldn’t quite identify gnawing at me. 

I sat. I meditated. I consulted some other loved ones. And I realized that that thing I was feeling was my integrity. It was telling me that this person had not respected my boundaries, and more than that, had the gall to suggest that I couldn’t do anything about it. I felt trod upon, diminished and incredibly sad. 

Then I did something I had never done in my entire life. I picked up my phone and I called my dad. I told him this: “dad, I love you and I want nothing more than to see you at this party but those other people are not invited. I cannot fit them in my house and I don’t have enough to feed them. If you want to come, you’re more than invited, but no one else. I understand that this might result in you deciding not to come.”

He decided not to come. 

Today I woke up feeling so sad, but also powerful. I know that this was a growth experience and I know I did the right thing for me, but dealing with the consequences of my decisions is tough. And that’s really it, right there - when people say, “there’s no choice”, that’s wrong. There’s always, always, ALWAYS a choice. What they’re really saying is, “I don’t want to face the consequences of those other choices so I’d rather pretend they don’t exist.”

Yesterday, I made a choice, and today I face the consequences. But, as much as I want to repair my relationship with my father, I’m not willing to sacrifice my integrity for it. Not anymore.",25Dec2018,1

82,"Hello everyone! Happy holidays to those who celebrate. 

I've been thinking a lot the past few days about what my goals in life are and started reading some books on personal finance as well. I only recently realized that for the past twenty or so I've been doing things that I /thought/ I wanted to do on my own. Instead, I realized that I was doing things that my parents wanted me to do and that I don't know what I want to do. The voice in my head that I thought was my own was actually mostly my parents' and I was doing things that I knew they would like me to do. Now I'm thinking a lot about what it means to do things I love and what kind of things I love. 

In the personal finance book I'm reading, they mentioned that we all have different definitions of what it means to be rich. For some, it may mean being able to spend 5k on shoes every year. For others, it may mean living in a large mansion. We all put different values on different things I'm trying to figure out what that is for myself. I really like stuffed animals and recently started getting more interested in purchasing high quality clothing goods that last long instead of low quality goods that get old fast. I would always tell myself that I can't afford quality goods and then get self deprecating about it but I totally can afford those goods - I just have to learn to save for it. I'm going to buy my first set of real earrings instead of the fake metal ones I usually wear and going to start budgeting to start working towards buying the things I want.

As I thought about what things I value and what things I would like to spend my money on, I wondered how everyone else defined being rich and what their financial goals are. Or simply wanted somewhere to share what I was thinking and get it out there - hope everyone is having a good day! ",25Dec2018,1
83,"After announcing or discussing my recent resolution to use other social networks and communication channels more often, people keep asking me this question. I am often momentarily dumbstruck, not knowing where to start. My general assumption is that people know at least some or most of the problematic (or even terrible) things about Facebook but choose to use it anyway because it is convenient. Of course, for people who get most of their news from Facebook, I guess I should not be surprised that they have missed a lot of important negative news about Facebook. And for people who mostly or even only use Facebook for online communication, I am not surprised they are blind to its failings. With that in mind, here is a list of reasons to rely on Facebook at least a little bit less than you do now:

1. Facebook tracks your online activity, even when you aren't using Facebook. When you visit any page with a ""like this on Facebook"" button, Facebook knows, even if you don't click the button. This behavior is widespread among major social media companies, but that does not make it appropriate or acceptable. It is probably mentioned in a paragraph buried on page 30 of the Terms of Service, but it belongs on the first page of a human-readable privacy disclosure. You can get around this by blocking those buttons, restricting cookie access, or using various Facebook-specific privacy browser plugins, but that doesn't make them doing it in the first place any less egregious. By supporting a company that does this, you are normalizing invasion of our privacy in the future.

1. Facebook is addictive. Not only that, but they have teams intentionally working to make it more so. There are rooms full of people at this very moment whose only job is to make sure you spend more time looking at your news feed or messenger, by any maybe-legal-somewhere means available. This isn't like other products that want to improve their functionality, incidentally leading to you using them more. Facebook will even go so far as to remove functionality or reduce privacy levels if it results in you looking at more ads. At one point Facebook ran a psychological experiment (https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/111/24/8788.full.pdf) on half a million users to show more positive or negative posts and measure how moods and emotions spread across the social network, all without informed consent of the users. They are exploiting psychological phenomena to trick you into scrolling one more page, clicking one more post, make one more comment, etc. Imagine you were a parent deciding whether or not to allow your children to be exposed to something like that, then apply that conclusion to yourself.

1. Facebook is eroding our sense of privacy. I often lament how quickly a lot of rights are being eroded in our society, especially in the digital realm, such as modern acceptance of the shenanigans surrounding college textbooks. Facebook is a large part of that in some areas. In 2006 when Facebook introduced their News Feed, something like 1/8 of all FB users protested it as too intrusive. Today, we mostly take it for granted, although I notice frequently that people are surprised by one of the many unusual facets of the system such as putting my public post on your parents' news feed because you commented on it. Facebook benefits from people not understanding the privacy implications of its core features, and so we find ourselves as frogs in a pot of hot water, never sure if it's boiling yet. Every time Facebook takes one more evil step and you think ""That one thing isn't bad enough to leave behind all the useful features"", you help normalize that step for other companies, and you don't remember it when they take the next step.

1. Facebook has total control of your access to Facebook. That might sound obvious to you, but this is another one of those places where norms have been established over the last couple of decades that aren't necessary. At the dawn of the internet, private sites were used by the owner of the site to publish content of some sort, and communication networks between many people were decentralized. No single person or company could deny you access to the whole of email or usenet or IRC or the ability to post your own content on your own site. Email is still pretty popular, usenet and IRC are hobbling along, and you can still host your own website... But we are now in an age where the most popular platforms are those controlled by single companies. One person at Facebook or Twitter or Google can press a button and deny you access to millions of other people that you might have been communicating with. A small company might suffer more from losing their Facebook Page or Twitter account than by losing their website. Or you might even be denied access up front, because you are from the wrong country or are the wrong age. This isn't the only way. Multiple modern social networks are trying to bring back the ""federated"" model that makes email work, including Diaspora and Mastodon and GNU Social and Patchwork/SSB. A few are even trying more extreme models such as peer to peer, such as Aether. By using one of these networks, you are securing your access to those networks beyond the reach of any single company.

1. Not everyone is on Facebook. 10 years ago ""only"" ""young"" people were on Facebook and you either struggled to get your parents to use it or lamented when they did. Today, ""only"" ""old"" people are on Facebook, with 13-25 year olds more and more frequently choosing other platforms. Facebook is also less popular in certain countries, and with certain racial and other demographics in the US. By using only Facebook you are living in a filter bubble that won't ever include those people. You think ""all my friends are on Facebook"", but have you considered that this might be a self-reinforcing phenomenon? If you started using a different platform, you might make friends who aren't on Facebook.

1. Facebook is an ineffective medium for serious discussion. It's a great place to post baby photos and selfies and memes all day long, and passable for slice of life commentary, but when you need to talk to a bunch of your friends (or even strangers) about ethics or politics or other topics that Actually Matter In The Real World then I implore you to choose a better platform. There are many anti-features built into FB that encourage content-less comments and derailing of discussions. You will find better results on a platform with some subset of nested replies, inline quoting, convenient inline references, rich formatting (not blink or marquee, but lists and headings and such), and other features you might more readily associate with a forum or mailing list or blog.

1. Facebook is an ineffective medium for organization and planning. Attempting to organize a club or camping trip or charity drive via a Facebook group (or, worse, a single group message thread) is a recipe for disaster, or at least significantly suboptimal outcomes. You are sacrificing the input and participation of people who cannot filter out the noise inherent in using such an inappropriate platform. You are incentivizing subtle misbehavior on the part of people who want to amplify their influence in the group. You are effectively guaranteeing miscommunication in one of a dozen different ways that could otherwise be avoided in a more appropriate medium.

1. Facebook is functionally inferior in its core use cases. There are a dozen great feature of other social networks that you are missing out on by limiting your interactions to Facebook. On Dreamwidth I can subscribe to just your cooking posts, or ignore everyone's baby or politics posts, instead of the all-or-nothing approach to following on Facebook. On Reddit and October I can make posts that show up both on my friends' ""news feed"" and in topic-specific groups where strangers with shared interest might interact. On Dreamwidth and Mastodon I can choose how much of a post appears above the ""read more..."" link, which is great for summarizing long posts or hiding content behind a spoiler alert or content warning of some sort.

On Google Groups and Dreamwidth people without accounts on the site in question can participate in the discussions at my discretion.

I am sure there are more things that belong on this list. I expect some of my more privacy-minded friends will supply some in comments below. I hope that I have given you at least one new thing to think about and that you will at least consider using some alternative platform a little more and Facebook a little less in the coming year.

84,"Sorry for the weird format I’m on mobile. Basically, for the past 6 months I’ve felt anxious posting to social media. Idk what it is, I feel like if I post a picture people (especially my friends who are extremely active online) will be judging me even though deep down I know that NO ONE CARES, and twitter as well it’s like I don’t trust anyone with my thoughts. My new bf wants to post pics of us but I just don’t have the confidence to post one back. If I had the choice I’d delete social media all together but it’s the only way I can stay in touch with my friends who I rarely get to see. Idk what the point of this post is ENJOY MY DRUNK CHRISTMAS RANT ",25Dec2018,1
85,Usually Christmas is great because I get to see my family but this year it has sucked. All everyone is talking about is someone who was an old friend who suddenly died a few days ago. My one aunt keeps talking about her side of the family. My mom is depressed because her boyfriend dumped her a couple of weeks ago. My grandpa has been recently diagnosed with dementia. I saw my dad yesterday and he told me he got fired not too long ago because he is getting too old to keep up with his work. Everyone seems so depressed and nobody seems to be on the same page. There are 15 different conversations going on that nobody can hear or keep up with. I really regret coming home and feel awful for feeling like this. I just want to go back home. ,25Dec2018,1
86,"Says the woman I met a day ago. Soon after that we became acquaintances. She asked me if I had a bf I said no. I told her I had a GF and I'm a lesbian. Her response was: I'm full of shit. 

I thought that was really sexist of her. I hate when some ppl ask me why I like girls but don't like men? It's sexist.

93,"  While binging netflix under a blanket I heard some shreaking noises from outside, I care for the stray dogs of our neighborhood so actually at first I thought that  car hit my fav dog and I  rushed outside. But  there was no car crash . There were two little dog  babies and the noise was coming from them. Turns out my  fav dog tried to attack one of the pups.  I rushed to the street without shoes and shooed the dogs away and tried to calm the puppies down.  Now there are two fluffs iny balcony.

95,"I'm a minority in the US, and I read stormfront posts from time to time. I know most white people don't think like these degenerates, but I always wonder which idiot from my high school or hometown in the South thinks like that. I'm scared that over the last couple years, racism has made a comeback. I read an Economist article on how we shouldn't view history as a progressive upward trend but instead as a cycle. It's kind of depressing because I was taught that every day was a step towards a future where we would blend and converge into a global culture. The internet was supposed to tear down boundaries like religion and nationalism and bring everyone under one umbrella. ",25Dec2018,1

I’m broke and lazy and i can’t afford to take care of my dogs anymore. i love them but they keep destroying my clothes and have already destroyed my room. my room  and bedding stinks like urine and is covered in dog hair, i try so hard to clean it and keep my dogs clean but i can’t do it anymore. i try so hard to keep them on schedule and everything but i’m so overwhelmed i just want to cry and stab myself. i am not working enough to afford to care for them, they are overdue on shots and preventions....i have been feed them a mix of leftover foods i got from a donation bin.
not to mention i get so frusterated with them when they have accidents or destroy my stuff, i yell and scream and hit them because i can’t handle it. i want to get rid of them but i fear they will be put down because of their problems or will go to someone who doesn’t take care of them any better than i do. i just can’t give them up but i know they need a better home.

100,I got my first ever job 4ish months ago and my main goal was to buy and build myself a pc for a birthday/Christmas gift. I then realized that doing so would make me selfish and from the months of saving I had 1.5k but spent 800-900 yesterday leaving me at 500 and no longer being able to build something. It felt nice giving to my brother who always gets me the best birthday and Christmas gifts. I don’t regret his gift. But spending another 400 on my mom who really appreciated it yet still keeps yelling at me makes me sad. I’ve been wanting this pc for forever so I can go back to playing games with my friends and being happy but now yet again I’m going to have to wait. ,25Dec2018,1

103,"So okay, this may just be a rant or needing to vent since I have no one else to talk to. But here we go. 

I am currently sitting alone in a bar at noon-thirty.  Been up for 36 hours now. With no plans to do anything else for the rest of the day. Except maybe a LOTR marathon, and a 1.5 litre of anchor brewing xmas ale waiting at home for me. 


Why you ask? Well two months prior my GF of four years got transfered to a new city to which I agreed to follow her, having no job lined up, and the first couple months were rough until I found anything I could get. Got a job at a corner store just so I could contribute and help. And that's where I guess things started to decline. She wanted me to have weekends off so we could spend them together, but working retail and being a new hire that was damn near impossible. Also being stressed on top of that almost everyday when I got off work didn't help much. 


Fast forward about a year and a half. Ended up in the hospital for health issues. While she stuck by my side I knew right then she didn't want to be there in those circumstances. I saw it in her eyes she checked out emotionally at that point. So for the next couple months I spent recovering and looking for a new job. And low and behold I found something that paid considerably well and would let me have one weekend day off so that we could spend it together,... also close to full time so yeah. Finances were no longer an issue. 


But. At this point it was too far gone. We barely spoke to each other. We weren't close. So both of us began to shut down to the point of 2 months ago where we split. Which I'm not sure if things could have been fixed but not according to her. 


She basically said if your sad you should stop it and get help. If you need friends go get some. Yeah great advise 


So here I sit in a town I loathe alone with no friends or family to speak of. Alone just waiting on till I get my work transfer even though I have no idea where I'm going still living with her, 

Either way. Point being. Hats off to everyone else who is spending the holiday by yourself. Just know you are not alone. I know what's it's like and I'm thinking of you. If it's the one thing misery loves is company. We can be forever alone together. ",25Dec2018,1
104,"Man this sucks so much. Our relationship hasn't been that stable for the past few months, and we talked about it a lot. Thing is, we don't match on big picture stuff. Plus she's not exactly a great girlfriend, shows up late, forgets important stuff and is working way too much and doesn't want to cut back on that, also sometimes not the most empathetic person. 

I'm okay with the fact that we're gonna break up, but we'll see each other again only in a week or so. She's with her family about 2000 miles away and I really don't want to/can't break up via the phone, that just awful. But I'm running around with a stomachache that has been here for the past few days. A constant pain in my belly,  fucking awful. 

Any advice how to handle this? Merry Christmas yall.",25Dec2018,1
105,"This is the dumbest post but if it helps anyone at all it'll be worth it.

As the title says... I had a truly genius thought this evening. What if it's not normal to have a burning, needle sticking, intense itching sensation when wearing certain fabrics?

What if it's possible to be completely pain free in all clothing! 

I tell you folks, I am a god damn genius.

106,"I’m come to the realization that I’m really just a loser. I work at McDonald’s flip burgers for minimum wage in the hopes that I’ll save up enough money to go to community college. I’m so just incapable of managing any sort of romantic relationship. 

I don’t know. It just feels bad a couple of years ago I was this happy, ambitious and hard working person. Now I just drift around just wondering if I’ll ever make it out of this situation. I already see myself being a lonely 40 year old guy with nothing to do other than work and video games and the occasional friend hangout 

I don’t know if I’m overreacting but i feel like I should just put that out there because it’s been eating me up for a while now

108,"Hey guys, just wanted to vent a little and see if anyone can relate to this situation. A month ago, I noticed a bump on the back left side of my neck under the surface of my skin. Then I had a feeling like something was stuck in my throat and I couldn’t get it out. After two weeks of thinking it’d clear itself up, I started getting worried and decided to look at my throat in the mirror with a light. My left tonsil is pretty swollen and that “stuck in throat while swallowing” feeing just wont go away. 

I took my finger and poked around and managed to extract what I believe are tonsil stones (soft, yellowish material.) Fast forward to a week ago today and I went to an ENT who cultured my tonsil and it came up as strep throat two days later. I felt relived and was actually hoping it would be strep so I could know what it was and start getting healthy already. I was prescribed antibiotics and a swish/swallow formula and sent home. Fast forward to today, I’m on my fifth day of antibiotics and it feels like my symptoms haven’t really improved. 

My tonsil is still swollen, I still have that something stuck in throat feeling, and the lump on my neck is still there. Last night I dug around and was able to extract a good amount of tonsil stones (or pus?) from the caverns of my tonsils. To make matters worse, I called my doctor from fear and he said that people usually get better after the first day or two of antibiotics and that the bump on my neck isn’t normal. He said I can go to urgent care if it’s really bothering me or just wait a few days. 

Now, the physical part of this is not that bothersome. I don’t have any other symptoms of strep like fever or fatigue, just swollen tonsil and that stuck-in-throat feeling, as well as the bump. If I KNEW for a fact that this would go away in a couple days, I’d be fine dealing with these symptoms. But mentally, it’s really been screwing me up. My brain makes me want to think of the worst possible outcomes. I wake up frustrated and almost want to punch a wall because at this point it’s been a month of “get the fuck out of me whatever you are.” I know this isn’t a place for medical advice but I just wanted to vent and see if anyone has any similar stories. Thanks for reading guys. Hopefully your Christmas is going better than mine.

109,"This happened last night, a little after 1:00 am. My wife and I went out to celebrate Christmas Eve. We got a hotel in a bigger city nearby and had a great evening at a restaurant downtown. As it turned out, a couple of our friends were also in town and just a few blocks away. We met up for a couple drinks, which turned into more than a couple. At the end of the night, my wife and I made our way back to the hotel and eventually fell asleep.

I woke up in the middle of the night to pee, and in a mix of sleepiness and being a bit drunk, I stepped through the front door. By the time my brain clicked that I was clearly in the wrong place, the door latches and I’m standing in the fucking ice cold hallway.

Butt-naked. 

Fuck. Just thinking about it makes me blush and tense up.

I started lightly knocking, trying to not draw too much attention, but my wife wasn’t coming. I started to panic, and bang harder and harder. She was still passed out. Uggghhh. After about 4 to 5 minutes of sheer panic, a security guard showed up, I was utterly mortified. I started to try and explain what happened, but part way through, one of the neighbouring room door opened, and the guy started to yell at me for all the noise. So here I am, naked, getting yelled at in a hotel hallway, with 2 guys staring at me. All I could do was cover my package with both hands and apologize. Mid apology, my wife opens the door, stares at me, starts laughing VERY loudly and asks what in the sweet hell I’m doing in the hallway ""buck ass naked"". The worst part is she just had to give me a nice, hard laughing SLAP across my bare tush as she ushered me inside. Of course she did.

I’ve stayed in our room all day as my wife is teasing me non-stop. I just want to leave.",25Dec2018,1

I finally asked him to stop the overly fond touching and the comments as it makes me really quite uncomfortable. He responded to that by calling me a cunt. 
That was two days ago. 

He messages me today telling me he wants me out. I have never felt so low in my life.  I’m not really sure what to do now.

This is indeed the most wonderful time of year. Merry Christmas everybody.

114,"True Christians seek Hell to try and eliminate it so there is no more Sin in the world.

False Christians seek Heaven to hide from true fear.

God sends False Christians to Hell for being False Christians.

There is nobody in Heaven, save for God who is laughing at all the people in Hell.

His Creation.

Hence, ultimately, True Christians seek Hell to kill the Devil and eliminate Sin from the world.  And then seek Heaven to kill God and eliminate the possibility of a new Hell being created with a new Devil that will repopulate this existence with Sinners.

Follow neodeej.

I am not a Buddhist, but I am Buddhist.

I am not a Nihilist, but I am Nihilist.
