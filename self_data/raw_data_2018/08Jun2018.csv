0,"I feel like I peaked in my mid to late-20s. I was in a school program and was excited about my future, had a long term girlfriend that I loved, had friends in my program, lived close to family and often visited on weekends, had friends back home too. Now I'm in my early 30s. My career isn't as rewarding as I'd thought -- I'm good at it but it makes me stressed and I need a day to recover after working a few days in a row. I broke up with my girlfriend years ago and don't know if that was the right call, in retrospect. I've lost touch with old friends. Even when I've reached out, it's clear that we're living different lives and it feels like our friendship is very much part of the past. I currently don't really have any friends, if I'm being honest. I largely spend my days off alone. I like to hike with my dog, but human interaction is lacking. Job opportunities were better in another city, so I now live very far from home. I talk to my family on occasion through FaceTime but I hide my sadness from them and as a result we have a very superficial relationship. I'm sad a lot. I've seen counsellors who tell me I have mild depression, but don't really make it clear what we should do about it. I asked my doctor -- he offered to start an SSRI (Prozac or a related drug) but largely left it up to me due to the mildness of my signs. I'm inclined to hold off, not sure that it's what I need. I self medicate. I smoke weed every day. Usually just before bed at night but if I'm really defeated by work I'll smoke during the day too. It briefly makes me feel elated but mostly it's just something to pass the time. It doesn't make me happy and probably contributes to me feeling dull a lot of the time. I almost never smoked when I was happy years ago. When I stop I don't find that my happiness re-appears so I smoke again. I think long term I'd benefit from using it very sparingly. 

I want to date but sometimes the effort seems like more than it's worth. I'm largely relying on dating apps as I meet so few people. Getting dressed up to meet a stranger gets old. Plus, I want to leave this city soon which makes it a weird time to start a long term relationship. Part of me wants to move back home but I don't think there are jobs that I like there. I'm considering more schooling but the jobs it would open up aren't in my home town. I don't necessarily need to be back home, but don't want to finish the program and realize my options are a variety of lonely cities. 

I don't have friends, my relationship with family is a little distant, and I don't have community. 

How do people build these things? How can I become happy again?

I should acknowledge that I'm extremely lucky in so many ways. I have a good job that brings me decent money. My family is supportive and I'm sure open to a deeper, more open relationship.",08Jun2018,8
1,"...and honestly, I've never been more excited in my life.

I have mixed feelings because I love my coworkers, a lot of them are my closest friends. I've been here for 7 years. I was literally just 19 when I started working here. But I'm so unhappy. I feel like there is no more room for advancement. I've been in a higher position for a few months but in a few more months, that person is coming back from a leave and I will be back to my regular position most likely and I am just... done. 

At the same time as I feel terrible and guilty, I feel thrilled because my health has suffered and my happiness has suffered. I'm worried that I won't find another job. I'm worried that I'll regret it or end up back at my workplace in a lower position. 

But I still find it easier to get through my days. I feel like I need this.
...but I'm scared. ",08Jun2018,17

4,"I feel like this is becoming more and more common of an issue in today's world but does anyone feel like no matter what they do or think, their self esteem always remains the same? I've pretty much had low self-esteem my whole life but I can't pin point an exact reason why. I get good grades for the most part. I'm average looking. I do have insecurities about certain things like my shyness or my nose or my lowish voice, but I don't think having insecurities is that abnormal. I just wanna know why my self esteem tends to get worse or just stay at a low point  and if anyone has any tips to try? Ive already been in therapy for four years for anxiety and depression. And I do know taking compliments is hard for me and I tend to overthink a lot of my day-to-day interactions to the point of tearing myself apart.

7,"Throwaway so here goes.

I've been with my current girl three years about. Most of it has been long distance which sucks. I love her so much. I could see myself spending my life with her. But the long distance thing isn't going to change for a long time. And I'm starting to get real down about that because I'm really starting to crave physical affection.

I miss holding hands, going on dates, or just having a night in. I'm always pissy and sad and cynical now - I don't like the person I am. We're always fighting because of my shit moods. I feel like it's coming to a close. Right now were on a mini ""break"", a few day hiatus with zero contact. I needed time to clear my head and think about where to go from here.

I'm weak I guess. Talking on the phone and texting isn't enough for me, even if I'm totally smitten. But it is for her, and it kills me how much I hurt her by telling her how I feel. Hearing her cry on the other end of the phone is like torture. She visited 6 or 7 months ago for a week and if we stay together she'll be visiting again for a couple weeks soon. But then it's back to this.

Shes one of those girls who needs me to text every 30 minutes or so or I get a guilt trip. I need to constantly tell her where I am, who I'm with. And she recently got laid off so she's had nothing to do most days but talk to me. Whenever we talk about our relationship she tells me I'm her only shot at happiness. That if I break up with her she'll give up on life. That shits not fair. But i don't want to make her sound manipulative or whatever. I know she actually believes it. And when we are together we are so happy its crazy.

I think I want to end things. I wanna go back into the singles world and see what I can find out there. If the answer is nothing, well, I can't ask her to wait for me. I don't know if I'm really asking what I should do because I think I know. Just wanted to vent a little. Hope everyone is having a good week :)",08Jun2018,1

9,"Every time I see something or think about doing something my mind tries to convince me how amazing it is.

12,"So I grew up and an extremely Christian-conservative home mostly due to my mother but also my dad. I guess sometimes my dad can be very unpredictable, so much so I question wether I truly know him or not. He works a lot and ever since I got a job and moved out on my own we rarely see each other anymore. 

Anyways, he met me the other day at my work on the way home from his work because we had to switch cars for other reasons. Both my parents know that I vape and I know my mom doesn’t like it at all and I thought my dad didn’t like it either but I guess he was always just agreeing with my mom. 

I was vaping and talking to him on my lunch break and he interrupted to comment on the sweet smell of my vape. (Charlie’s Wonder Worm. Bomb asf btw) I saw him eyeing it and he was asking me how it worked and stuff. I knew almost right away that he wanted to try it but I knew he would never ask so I asked him,

“Do you wanna try it?”

“Um.. yeah sure I’ll give it a go...” followed by a quick, “Don’t tell mom!”

I showed him how to fire it and he took a 2 second-ish draw. I was both excited and scared for a second and he looks at me and smacks his lips and says,

“Wow that is very tasty!”

I never thought my dad would have had a reaction like that but it absolutely made my day and idk if any of you care but I had to share it somewhere and this seemed to be the place😁

Our friendship fizzled out and we didn’t talk as much as we had in the past. It turned into only talking here and there and eventually the time between each time we’d talk got further and further. 

We met in person 3 years ago for the first time. He came to visit me and the following month I went to visit him. After the visits we began talking again like we had done in the beginning and then it fizzled our again. 

He was supposed to come visit next weekend. We already rented an Airbnb but this morning he told me that he’s changed his mind. I’m so bummed out I was really looking forward to seeing him.

21,"I've shared what I'm about to express here in a few comments on /r/relationship_advice and to friends IRL with great feedback:

My background with this: I've had a few relationships only 2 were what I'd call serious (for me). I've been dumped 3 times by 3 different girls. The first was not very bright, she made mistakes and I made mistakes. The second was very attractive but she had a serious temper and other issues. I developed a temper, jealousy, and became emotional. The third was perfect but she fell for someone else and wanted to experience life a bit more. I had some growing up to do. With her, I tried *way* too hard to be a ""perfect"" boyfriend. All three of them came back to me eventually (they came to me, I did not seek them out). I married the third now and our roles definitely changed. After every break-up I made a rule to get over them and improve on what I did wrong.

Underlying this whole explanation is the assumption that you must **GET OVER YOUR EX**. It's a must in any break-up. It is what it is, there isn't a choice. It will serve you well if they ever want to come back (you set the tone) and it will serve you well if you find someone new.
    

Being broken up with is a huge teachable moment for yourself. To be thrust out of a strong romantic friendship is a very painful thing. Your feelings and thoughts, in the period of time surrounding your break-up, will not likely be forgotten for years. It's an opportunity to think back on what you've done wrong. Regardless of what your partner may have done wrong, think about what you did wrong. 

If you don't think you made any mistakes there are 2 explanations:

1. You actually did nothing wrong and you probably weren't hurt too badly by the breakup. If you did nothing wrong and the problem was entirely with the other person, you should feel ok and maybe relieved. If you feel pretty upset, this explanation probably isn't for you. 

2. You have problems with taking/identifying responsibility. This probably affects other areas of your life as well.

The most obvious argument against these 2 explanations is 

    ""What if you were cheated on?"". My response: either you
    should be glad to be rid of the cheating scum (option 1), you
    made an error in your judgement (option 2, especially if you
    were dating for a long time), or you have done something
    that led your partner to seek comfort elsewhere (still option 2).

Even if your error/mistake seems small, tease it out and think about it. If you do realize what you did wrong (in most cases you should), take responsibility. Once you acknowledge it and own-up to it, realize now *your mistake* is the only one that matters. This shift-of-focus, and owning-up does two things:

1. It shifts your focus away from your ex-partner and whatever they may have done wrong. He/she/it is gone now. Involving him/her/it in your healing wont help one single bit.

2. It rewards you with control over your own happiness again. 
Likely, in the period before your break-up, you felt like the outcome was out of your control, or you felt powerless. Identifying and accepting your fault gives that power/control back.

The added sheer pain of the break-up serves as a reminder and will motivate you immensely (this is the ""gift""). There isn't enough hyperbole in the english language to help me emphasize how the pain of being rejected by someone you held so dearly can create such great cosmic motivational power... If you take advantage of it.

Think about your mistake, make a plan to change it. You will find someone new and you will be better than you were before.

22,Here comes another weird writin thing because apparently I’ve got some close friends but no one close enough to share my true weird and confusing mind. So I guess I’ll talk to a screen. I seriously wish I understood my own emotions. I don’t understand why I feel the way I do at specific times. Maybe I’m just upset because I’m lonely and wish I had a girlfriend. That’s kinda dumb though because I feel like if I’m telling myself I need a girlfriend is admitting to myself that I can’t be self sufficient and that I’m mentally unable to bring myself out of any terrible moods. But I guess even when I’m in a good mood I want someone to share it with. But I really have no clue what I want. I think that’s my problem maybe. I’m just wandering aimlessly through a confusing world with a confused mind. I feel like I need a purpose or meaning or something. I just don’t know... my life consists of everything in the moment and it’s really not as exciting as it sounds. It’s boring and depressing. I want to be clear to myself that I don’t think I have clinical depression or anything as it’s not physically affecting my day to day type stuff. Just getting in some bad moods lately :( I feel like girls don’t like me. Wow I’m really 18 years old at this point and writing about my emotions holy I’m pathetic. I think self awareness is good but lately I’ve really been over-analyzing myself and how I may be perceived from another’s perspective. And I’ve got to say it seems kinda unhealthy because I want to display this kind of “perfect” image but I’m also fully aware that I’m not like this and I know for a fact this its impossible as every person perceives others differently. I feel like I need to get better at understanding my emotions because this constant strong fluctuation of emotions is kinda exhausting or just not something I enjoy too much. I just wanna be happy on days where I have no reason not to be. Oh well ranting sorta helps I guess,08Jun2018,1

27,"I am sitting in my house alone right now and I don't have any friends to call or people that I can reach out to, plus it is the middle of the night. First and foremost, I am not suicidal or anything like that. I struggle with severe anxiety, specifically PTSD, and I am absolutely not in a good place right now. Terribly long sob story below, if you want to pass on the wall of text you may want to skip to the last paragraph now.

So background, I moved out when I was 17, put myself through cosmetology school, worked full time through college taking 1-2 classes per term, and now after nearly a decade I am in my last semester. I met a great man that has been in my life since 2010, and we've been living together since 2013. I had a decent but demanding job, 3.5 in school, and had my health issues mental and physical under control. Our relationship was good, we had rocky moments but we loved each and I was sure he was the one I would spend my life with. 

This last year things got really bad. Both of my parents were diagnosed with cancer, I lost 2 grandparents, and found out that both of my living grandparents also have cancer. My boyfriends small business tanked, I had to work 2 jobs (12 hours everyday), we almost lost our home this winter as a result but we fought through it managed to keep it. My sister graduated with her masters this year (which is obviously good) but she got a job in a different state and she was my only friend. So as much as I am happy for her, I am also totally devastated, she was my only other support. My dad couldn't work anymore so he sold his beloved farm house, and is currently in the process of selling his business, he told me yesterday to start cleaning out my mothers house (they are not together, but for religious reasons they are still married and he takes care of her). My partner and I started talking about moving after I finished school and starting fresh in a city closer to both of our homes and had better job opportunities as well as more affordable housing, I knew when he started talking about moving without trying to make concrete plans with me something was wrong. We have been struggling financially all year, he just found decent work an hour+ away, but his car is always breaking down and we just couldn't get ahead. I totaled my (and our only reliable vehicle) about a month ago and had to have my dad help me get a new one after some insurance issues that we are now going to court over. With all of this on my plate, my previously well managed anxiety came back with a vengeance but I hid it from everyone, even my SO. I got very dark and introverted because I didn't know how to handle everything life was throwing at me, he also started dealing with massive depression and shut me out. Relationship got toxic. We still love each other and after an intense argument decided we needed to end it. I did not want to break up, I don't want to quit, I love him he is my everything and I get physically sick at the thought of him being gone. But things were bad between us this year and we both need to recover. He wants me to go home to spend time with my family, they want me to come home, and that's honestly what I know I should do, but I don't want to. I love my family, but they have massive issues. After about a week of being home I need to leave because things start to revert to the way they were when I was a teen. My hometown makes me feel sick because it doesn't feel like home at all. All of my old friends are gone, I lost several friends to reckless driving, another became very mentally ill and very violent, and the few that were left moved away and cut all ties. My grandparents are gone, my family isn't talking to each other after fighting about inheritance/property. All of my former homes are long gone, the family business I thought I would work for is done and my sisters gone. I don't want to see my family like this, I don't want to be around the the fighting and sadness that always surrounds them. I don't have a choice though, with my savings totally depleted, I have no place to go but my mother's spare bedroom. I have to get rid of most my belongings and am currently selling them off, donating and recycling everything. 

We have a little over a month to move out of our home that we fought so hard to keep, the only place I've lived in for more than 2 consecutive years since I was 15 and the only house that actually felt like ""home"". I am changing careers with no idea what I am going to do after graduation, I am single for the first time I can even remember in my adult life, and everything I used to know back home is gone or in the process of going. Everything hurts so bad right now I have so many emotions and despise the thought of my future, I don't want to go back home, but I have to and really I should be there for them but I feel to weak to try and support them, I can't handle all of this at once. 

My now ex and I spent the last few days cleaning and packing. He left about 6 hours ago to take the first carload to his new place across the state we got a bit emotional when he left and now I am in my house alone with all of these boxes. I have been up all night and I keep trying to sort through all of our thing or at least finish one box but I can't do it, I bought a pack of smokes and sat outside sobbing and smoking for an hour straight and just want to talk to someone, anyone and I desperately want to be consoled but I don't have anyone. I considered going to the ER and seeing if they could give me something for the panic attacks that have been coming and going all night because I can't take this anymore but I can't really afford it. I need help for the anxiety because its scaring me how bad it is right now. I am scared I'm not going to be able to finish my classes or fail them and not get degree because I am so lost right now. I have been trying all night to make progress on literally anything but I can't without freaking out.  I am lost and scared and so overwhelmed, what do you do when your world is falling apart? How do people even begin to deal with this? Please tell me anything; advice is good, happy thoughts are good, honestly if you don't have those just write me a comment of whatever you feel like writing about. I just want hear from somebody, anybody. It's so lonely in my head and in this house.",08Jun2018,3

God, im getting tired just thinking about how much fucked up shit I can write. So I wont, lets just say nothing has been normal and easy and skip forward to the past year.

Im one of those long stories, but there are so many who have even more fucked up lives than I have so I wont dedicate too much time to it. But the last year has been hell. My former job couldnt keep me, been homeless on and off and the relationship with my girlfriend over many years broke down into a nightmare. Havent been able to hold down a job and ive been screwed over both job and housewise a couple of times. Everybody says im really unlucky with things.

I had a bestfriend in her, she kept me going but she  betrayed me in the end. And now im sleeping on the floor in some smelly stonerpad, he is a nice guy though but im homeless on Monday again. Im broke, heartbroken, lonely and so hopelessly empty. But hey, im used to this... and thats the problem. It starts consuming you as a person after awhile and I cant stop it now. Its sucking all the energy out of me after all these years, im 33 now and currently based in Oslo, Norway.

At least im not completely alone, I have some friends and im relatively well known around town. But I dont have anybody I feel close to, somebody I dont have to pretend around. The last couple of weeks have been hell, just trying to survive and its about all I can do now. I have slept outside and I might have to do it again next week. The government can help to a certain degree, but its also a bureaucratic hellhole with a very mixed bag of results for those who know what its like.

There was a time in my life where I could feel the ground under my feet and I was moving forward instead of standing still, and I dont know how I ended up here. This last year just seems like a blur, like a bad dream. Im seeing the best years of my life just rotting away and its killing me, I dont feel anything anymore and it scares the hell out of me.

I cant remember when I got a good nights sleep, and the little time I spend sleeping i just feel suspended in a nightmare i wake up from just to wake up into another one. I dont know if I can keep this up much longer and im running out of options. I can write so much more but I dont have the energy.

I wish I was brave, had some energy, hope, and that something good would happen for once so I could pick myself up from the ground. But im stuck here in the basement of life and I cant get out. Another sleepless night...

I have just been this way for so long that im not sure if I am ever going to get much better than this. And its going to cause problems, problems that I am not equipped to deal with anymore. Its not a good combination. I just wish that I would have lived and experienced more, it all just feels like such a waste.

Ill stop meandering anymore now, forgive me, im just depressed and desperate. I just wish for a better life than this, and I hope yours isnt killing you like mine is. Im open to any kind of help, or advice for that matter.

I dont want to be like this anymore, but im not sure if I can go on like this either, thanks for staying with me, wish me luck.",08Jun2018,19
29,"Okay, so I met this guy over Memorial Day weekend when I was out of town. I was drunk and asked for his help with a scavenger hunt I was doing. Long story short we kissed a couple times but it was for the hunt and I have photos of it because I needed proof to take back to my group. Insecurity broke through my liquid courage and I didn’t get his number. As soon as I was leaving, I had instant regret. I already posted in missed connections, but I’m wondering if taking to Twitter or something is too much? I think to myself, no don’t do that it was just a drunken night and you’re making this something it isn’t. And on the other hand I’ve read stories about people who put out ads and create hashtags to find someone they encountered briefly. I just can’t decide if  their determination is creepy or admirable. Is it taking a chance, or just a sign of delusion?
Also, yes I have photos of him but I don’t plan on posting them in order to find him. Obviously because he can’t give his consent for me to post his image all over the internet. One is on my IG of me kissing his arm for the scavenger hunt but I have other photos of that night posted with it and I don’t mention him. It’s just a random photo among 5 others.

I asked my doctor about that, and he said that I shouldn't bear much weight on my foot for 2 more weeks, and I have to still use those annoying crutches. But at the same time he said that everything is healing great and I will be fine in 2 weeks.

33,"So I ended a friendship yesterday that has lasted for a long time. One of my friends made a comment to me yesterday that if you agree with my opinion, you are a true American, but if you don't agree with my opinion, you are Nancy pelosi.

I had to stop and gather my bearings because I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This friend of mine who has always said he will never force others to believe what he believes or belittle others because they believe in something different did the exact thing he said he was never going to do.

I told him this: I respected you for a long time, but because of what you have said, that respect went out the window. You have lost all respect from me, and in turn, you yourself have just lost a friend who has had your back countless times throughout everything. I cannot sit idly and listen to you say the things that you just said, and go along with it. We are done being friends. I then up and left and went home, blocked all communications from him, and left it at that.

That means I have just one less person I have to deal with and that they aren't trying to force me to into their views and beliefs. I respect and acknowledge others views, and what they believe in, but I will never force you to believe in something that you do not want to believe in. I will always lay it out in full for you and allow you to make your own decisions for yourself. You have that right.

36,"This is a call out for input, so if you guys have experience or your own view on the subject, feel free to share.


I've been hearing a decent amout about people forcing opinions, acting as the judiciary between right and wrong, and being self righteous with their full belief that they are 100% right. However, while I've had moments where I thought I was clearly the right one, and understand even the mosy level headed people have these moments.

However, I've been more and more quiet in scenarios I would usually want to share another perspective with. In public, or with simple aquaintances, I've always avoided debating or pushing points. People can beliebe what they want to believe, but I've always loved sharing interesting or unknown ideas.

Being in a crowd more and more recently where I've felt like i've been walking on egg shells talking about just about everything, I wanted to get some input. What would you guys consider to be the defined line between forcing views and sharing perspectives? ",08Jun2018,11
37,"I'm flat, I'm really flat chested. Probably like a 7th grader, I thought in high school I would have something but I'm about to graduate and I'm still flat. I don't hate it, I'm really okay with it. The only part I hate about it is how people judge me. I hate how people bring it up constantly even though they're just joking around. I'm happy with my looks, I look at the mirror and I don't hate my looks, I used to consider myself ugly, I was damn ugly lol but now I've come to accept my looks. I don't want people to be attracted to me, it'd be better if they weren't actually. I just want people to stop judging me, to stop thinking my small boobs are a problem, they're a part of me and I like them. If I can't change it then I just need to accept it. Yes, I need to exercise since I'm really weak and I need muscle but that's all! I don't know if I just need new friends or if I need to be less sensitive, I know they're joking and sometimes I joke about it too but damn, a day can't pass without someone reminding me I'm flat. Dammit how hard is it to accept it? Even this guy that apparently liked me laughs at those jokes. Yeah well our friends are the ones that do them, I might laugh at them too but hey it's my body and I'm kind of tired. That's a huge turnoff lol I kind of feel bad for giving the guy hope but then I remember he laughs at those jokes so nah. I mean at the start he was like ""but why do you let them...?"" But I guess he got used to his friend's jokes.

I don't get upset for being flat, I like it, I just wish other people accepted it. I only have one friend that said he liked that and I shouldn't mind it. I feel that most people judge my body. I look at the full mirror, I like myself, after so long I've come to accept me and yeah call me conceited or whatever, I know there are many flaws about me but I'd rather ignore them and accept myself but these kids don't let me, and I'm damn aware it's really noticeable and everyone judges me. I don't need my ""friend"" telling me I'm pretty but I can't get a boyfriend because I'm flat. I don't need him telling me nobody likes me (because first of all lol? Is he okay? Yes I'm not popular but hey, I still get more people than him. I honestly think there's something wrong with him, I mean yes I'm not popular but why does he feel the need to drag me down so much? I might take it from a handsome guy but this guy isn't even popular, he was all high school behind this girl and now she's kind of with him but I'm pretty sure she's just playing with him lol, people say he's just her servant, she even cheated on him once then went out with 2 other guys and that was a mess and now apparently she's with him although they aren't anything and were never a thing.)

If I hadn't come to accept myself I would feel like shit but luckily it was probably months ago that I came to accept myself and I'm proud, insult me as much as you want, I don't care, it will just make me tired of you but I'm happy with myself and I won't change, I still feel ugly often but it's not important, I'm still happy with myself, I know my flaws, pointing them out won't make them bigger, even if you don't like my looks there are others that might do so yeah, good for you but I'm okay with my looks.

I'm so tired of males. Well at least I haven't had girls make fun of my chest (I mean I've had girls calling me ugly but they were bitches). I want girl friends. This probably isn't the only reason why I'm tired of guys, I mean not everyone does this but I feel like not texting them most of the time. Sometimes I feel like not talking with them. I mean guys are great and I've had some great guy friends. I just want to be treated like a regular dude friend,
I don't want my looks to be mentioned. I don't want them to call me pretty, when a guy does that I feel like throwing up (I'm straight but ew), I get they're probably just joking but yeah, it stills make me feel sick (it feels as if they were my brothers and it doesn't feel right). I just want my looks to be ignored. I hate when guys treat me like a girl or are flirty but damn there's no need to drag me down. 
We are friends, keep your boundaries, consider me a guy friend, I get it I'm ugly, I still wouldn't go out with you so keep your insults or flirty comments to yourself, we are just friends, ignore my looks. ",08Jun2018,3

The thoughts of them purposely avoiding me is constantly flowing through my head. And just now I was constantly checking discord to see if they were up and the moment I, not soon after two of them joined. For some context these particular two friends are the closest to me( to me at least) and they knew each other longer than I’ve know them. So that’s where the insecurity comes from.

52,"He comes home every night past 2am, and sometimes he won’t even come home.  He comes home and eats whatever is in the kitchen and makes a shit ton of noise.  He leaves a shit ton of mess around the house and blames everyone else for it.  Then he doesn’t even wake up until past noon and even sleeps until 4pm sometimes.  He wakes up, eats, and leaves more mess.  Then he leaves to repeat the process.  

My mother has been extremely patient.  She has allowed this to go on for the past year.  What’s worse is that some stranger walked into our small, family business and told my mother than my dad was cheating on her.  In my opinion that should’ve been the end of the relationship.  He lies all the time about things (taking money, where he’s been, or what he’s supposed to be doing). He’s irresponsible and childish especially for a 43 year old man.  He takes no responsibility.  Whenever my mom has money, she gives him a couple hundred dollars.  This isn’t just every month.  This is every other day.  If she doesn’t give it to him, he gets pissed and blames it on everything but himself like the taxes he hasn’t filed in who knows how long.

Since I’m already writing a book, let me mention that he goes into my room and wears all my clothes that are too damn small for him.  I need him to file taxes so I can get some financial aid for college that’s coming up but that’ll probably never happen.  I can go on and on, his car smelling like straight dope to gambling hundreds of thousands of dollars into debt.  He even tried to sell our house.  WTF.  I’m over his shit.

58,"Background: 24, female, Asian\-American.

I've felt this way a few months after I graduated college and settled into my current lifestyle. I guess my entire childhood and life up until 22 has been working hard to achieve as many artificial points as I can, with the hopes of scoring a good career. Now what? What's next? 

I'm not and have never been interested in having children, so I don't really have that to look forward to. I'm currently engaged to ""the love of my life"", and while and I do love him and he makes me feel good about myself, we've been dating for like 6 years, so all the feelings of excitement and butterflies and ""ooh I wonder if he likes me"", and ""OMG he texted me!"" are in the past. Do people just have kids out of boredom? Just to have something to do and focus on? 

Work is fine. Objectively, it's pretty good. But I have little motivation to try hard or apply myself more than the bare minimum. As long as my managers think I'm doing well, that's enough for me. There aren't anymore A\+'s to earn. Just pass vs fail. Also, my fiance said he would be totally fine just providing for me and ""bringing home the bacon"". But my job is one of the very few things I have left to measure myself with.

I don't really have any friends anymore because it's just too much work for me to maintain and be interested in. I used to be SUPER social in college, and it was fun having friends to chat with, but I'm equally, if not more, content just sitting on my couch, playing games and watching TV to pass the time, until it's time to go to bed. Much less anxiety and drama this way; less exhausting. At work, I just have acquaintance\-level small\-talk with my coworkers, but never attend social events anymore. Though, I did in the first few months.

I don't mean to sound ungrateful for all the things I do have in my life. Objectively, from the outside, it's pretty good. But on the inside, it's just so dark and empty. What else is there in life? What makes it worth it, if anything? I don't know how people live like this for 50\+ more years.

Despite all my bleakness, I don't have suicidal thoughts or tendencies. But it might be easier if I did. ",08Jun2018,15

63,"I can attribute this to: my incessant porn watching (trying to cut down), my negative self-image, my constant social comparison (which leads to jealousy which leads to negative judgments of others and myself).

So it happened one day when I was younger (23 right now) that I became concerned with how I look, and from that point on I developed a set of criteria or an image for what it means to be beautiful/attractive/handsome/etc. Instead of trying to tear that down I reinforced the idea that I had to look a certain way, like not be fat, being strong, having nice facial bones (i.e. jawline), being athletic, having visible biceps, not having a flabby chest.

The worst thing that happened in this process is that my mentality lead to other ways of thinking about people. Thinking that I never had a chance with women, I directed my attention towards porn. Unfortunately, it has influenced what I perceive as being pretty and beautiful, and nowadays, if I go out, I do in my mind start judging women for looking a certain way or picking out features that are wrong.


The worst case seems to be very recently, where I was heading into a new therapy session with a new therapist. Immediately, I noticed certain physical features about her, and I become uncomfortable because of it. It was actually ridiculous. Before she even said anything, I was already judging her and looking at her in a negative way. Of course, her appearance had nothing to do with her capacity to help me, and I feel fucked up for having had those thoughts.

This is all a word vomit so I don't think I had a sensible point to make other than my perspective is fucked. But I know I'm going to keep going back to the porn and keep comparing myself physically (and not to mention intellectually) to others. At the same time that I realize my errors I also either don't care enough or don't have the willingness or willpower to evade them. 

I don't want to make excuses, but I still think that I'm sort stuck in a mental rut. Hopefully the therapy can help me address some of this.

The first doctor misdiagnosed me with an upper respiratory infection, and after I was still feeling terrible the next day, I got an x-ray and a second opinion who told me it was definitely pneumonia.

I don't even know how I could have gotten it. I guess all it takes is breathing in the same air as someone else who has it. I've had shingles and lyme disease and while I can't say this is worse than shingles, it's definitely close.

The worst feeling is when you are an hour prior to being able to take more tylenol, and the hour following you taking it again, because that's when you feel like hell the most - the hours in between that though are what keeps me going.
