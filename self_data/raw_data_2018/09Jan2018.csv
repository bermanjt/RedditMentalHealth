0,"Not plan on dying soon (if I can help it), but my relatives are idiots who dont know how to handle money. I am the only fiscally responsible person in the family. I dont have kids or a wife to leave money to. Just sisters and they (and their husbands) are just idiots with money. They all have kids too (a reasonable amount).

What can I do to make sure they dont blow it all at once when I kick it?

6,"A bit of backstory: we met something like 8 years ago in school. We became best friends some time later. Later on, I started having feelings for her during our junior year of high school, and confessed to her. After a 6-month long shitshow of trying to make it work, we finally end it. As time as passed, we've kept in contact on an intermittent basis during our college years. My feelings are still there. Every time we catch up, my feelings for her just cloud my judgment, and we ultimately end up drifting away from each other. This time, it got really bad. I realized I am painfully in love with her. I sent her a message just saying that I had feelings for her, hoping that the impending rejection would be enough to shut my feelings down. Besides, given how we're each dealing with our own issues, a relationship is very impractical. She obviously turned me down, and we agreed to just stay friends. A few hours later, I had a bit of an epiphany, and realized that I need to close this chapter of my life if I want to grow as a person. I sent her another message, basically saying that I love her, but that I couldn't keep myself in the same cycle and hurting myself in the process. I said goodbye to her, and I haven't heard from her since. 

I still can't stop thinking about her. I trust I'm doing the right thing for me. I'm not sure how she took the whole thing. I can only hope that she isn't as affected by all this as I am. So, here I am: venting and looking for advice. How can I make this process more bearable? Did I even handle this situation properly? This feels straight out of a Nicholas Spark novel, and I don't even know how I feel about it, or how I'm supposed to feel about it. ",09Jan2018,6

8,"Today was the first lecture of this class that is required for my degree. I didn't know what to expect from this class, otherwise hearing that there's a lot of self-reflection... We were asked the following questions regarding our vision statement of:

Who do I want to be? What do I want to do? And why?

I didn't really know what to write besides graduating university and finding a job afterward. I went to go hand my paper in and I stayed behind after class when everyone left, so I could tell my professor that I didn't know what else to write down. She just told me not to worry about it, as it's just the beginning of the class, and said if I was still worried I could go see her during office hours and talk about it.

Just those questions alone made me think about what I have been doing for these past four years of my life. It also made me realize that I haven't figured my life out and I am scared for the reality of the real world after university. 

After class was finished and I got home, I just felt this overwhelming sadness or frustration and broke down into tears. I don't know if I should be feeling like this and I don't know why I'm feeling like this. I don't know if my family members will understand, and I don't have many friends, so I don't know who I should tell what I'm going through besides this subreddit.

I say this as an active commenter on /r/suicidewatch: please stop glorifying a lack of emotion. It doesn’t make you unique or interesting. It just means that you’re too unmotivated and disinterested to do anything worthwhile. It also seriously detracts from those with legitimate mental health issues.

Later in my trip I went to this school that I used to go to really high and swing on the swings and talk to my two friends for hours having so much fun, but when I got there this weird feeling overcame me and i felt really bored and I tried doing what I did the previous summer and it didnt feel the same and then I jus felt really sad .

37,"I haven't had the best of luck with people in my life. For the most part, people have been real shitty with me since just before junior high, including both adults and peers. The bad luck with people continues to this day in just about every facet of my life. I seldom talk to family as a result of toxicity, as well, which probably alludes to why I am so bothered with not being cared about. 

It really feels like I'm a red cape to a bull whenever I meet people. That...or they just don't find any interest in talking to me, no matter how hard I try. I've never had friends in my life that gave a shit about me ---- I would have to contact them, or they would contact me if something was wanted from me.

I've been working on myself a lot. I have an idea of what the best version of myself is and I actively work toward that goal. It's just that there seems to be this insurmountable pile of shit in my brain (depression) that blocks progress, specifically this feeling that I am going to die having lived the life of a miserable person. 

In 2012, I found that I have a small brain tumor. At the time, I didn't know I'd be okay, and had severe panic over it. The people around me didn't seem to take me very seriously and I really got to evaluate just who gave a shit about me in this moment ---- it was almost a blessing. Having been kicked out of my immortal phase and now facing what I thought would be my death, I became stuck with this feeling that I will continue on this path of bad luck with other people and having no friends. 


I guess if I were dead, stuff like that wouldn't bother me. I guess I'm scared of the day that I look back on my life and see loneliness and sadness. I wish I could be content with being alone, but I'm just not an introvert ---- just a very shy, misunderstood extrovert.",09Jan2018,74

Without telling my whole life story my parents got divorced when I was 7. My mum got in debt buying him out so we could keep the house, and I visited him on weekends. I grew up in a weird situation where I was dirt poor but visited my well off dad on the weekends. Like involuntary vegetarians and mum crying when I said I needed new school shoes poor. 

I'm now 22 and a student. I'm writing this post looking for advice. I live very frugally and have trouble spending money on myself. I have £12k in the bank from saving birthday money, my loan and working for the summers etc. 

I get stressed at spending and I wish I wasn't like this. I forced myself to buy a new ecig (£30) since my cheaper shittier one kept malfunctioning. I got £100 for Christmas and am now stressed the new ecig uses liquid at a higher rate than my older one and will be a bit more expensive to run. 

The point is, I have no reason to worry about money and want to be able to spend on myself without huge guilt.

I’ve gone to a therapist about four times now, and I hate it. I can’t stand therapy. I hate the therapist voice she uses, like I’m a young kid. I hate how she goes “Mhm” every time I say anything. I hate it. Not only that, but I don’t believe in therapy working for me. I know it works for other people, but I don’t believe in it working for me. My parents have gotten mad about me for this belief, but how am I supposed to change that?! That’s my beliefs.

So therapy today went terribly. I cried, my Dad got a little angry, and nothing really got done. So when I get home, he talks about it with my Mom. Afterwards, I tell her I don’t want to go to therapy for the exact reasons I’ve stated above. She gets pissed, because she thinks therapy is the only thing that’s going to help me. But what about medicine? I’m going through a medicine change right now, and it seems to be helping. I’m happier and less anxious. I believe only medicine will work for me.

But for me, it’s like she’s saying I’m a burden, and IM SORRY FOR EXISTING. It’s not my fault. And I never said she couldn’t have friends over.
