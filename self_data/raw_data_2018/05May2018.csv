1," So my mom has been stressed with her job for awhile now, she works really hard and is very overqualified for what she does. She's got almost 30 years experience in her field and was being paid well for her work. We got into a financial crisis and she lost her job 6 years ago, She had immediately found a job for a bit above minimum wage in her field. 

It was a very basic job depicting only minimal skills required. She was very over qualified and found it easy to do, and she quite likes workin there despite not making any money. She immediately had a large workload piled on above her job description, shes been put in charge of her depatment with no additional pay, but she stayed working there due to our financial issues and because there are no other jobs in her field anywhere nearby. Time has passed and saying it's been very stressful would be a major understatement.

It's getting to the point that if we stay on this route were just slowly sinking into deeper financial crisis.

I've been pressuring her constantly to get a raise, her company is making over 130k annually from her work alone and shes getting less than 24k running the department. I finally got her to do it once she realized the guy sweeping the floor is getting paid the same wage as her. 

She asked to see her boss about a raise and was met with ""If I give you a raise I'd have to give everyone else one."" He asked what will she do and she said ""I don't know."" Over the weekend they hired a new worker for her to train at her exact pay with entry level experience. They assumed she was quitting and put pressure on her the next work day and she went along with it. Now she has no job in 2 weeks and were freaking out.

What should we do?

We have a large amount of debt, I have siblings in school and I feel really guilty for putting her through this. ",05May2018,3
2,"“Just a little messier and perfect” but not quite. I spend an insane amount of time trying to look perfect in the morning. I’m not naturally good looking so I have to do a lot just to look “not ugly” — sad but that’s the truth. 

“Maybe if I use a different product or a different routine I can make this work” is a lie I convince myself to believe. I scour through the “Men’s Grooming” section of groceries looking for a secret potion. I’ve probably spent more than a hundred dinars on products that have neither made me look normal or feel good. 

“Fucking hell” seems like an apt description of how I look. No matter how much I build up my self image it never seems to stand. Even a cloudy reflection of myself seems to take the sun away.",05May2018,3

4,"Have moved cities for work and slowly made a few friends but was quite anxious about being lonely, and it so happened a girl from my home town was moving to the same city, so we sort of clung to each other. She was nice enough, easy enough to talk to but I always felt kinda awkward and acted totally unnaturally with her. She kinda didn't get my dry humour, wasn't that interested in movies or music or hobbies that I was, she was very 'straight edge' in that she was quite reserved physically and never drank or took drugs \(which tbh for me is where a lot of great 'here's this stupid thing that happened' stories start for me\). We were seeing each other for a few months and then I went back home by myself and had an epiphany that I actually hated it with her so ended it. Spent some time by myself.

Finally worked up the energy to work myself on tinder, ended up chatting to a nice girl, set up a date for last night. In a vain attempt to seem like I'd actually do well on a date to myself, I cleaned my room and did everything to 'prepare' for the best, knowing full well I've never actually done first date \+ sex. 

Night went amazing. Had a few drinks, she took me to a local bar/pub, we danced and I actually didn't feel awkward. I didn't have to try and 'act' like someone I'm not or pretend like I'm actually kinda straight edge too, yo. She laughed a lot at things I was saying, we kissed dancing to Run To Paradise \(absolute banger\) and went home.

7,"My little girl Sadie has been at my side for 10 of her 11 years so far. She’s a great dog that we rescued from the pound. Little brindle pibble mix of some sort.

In the past year she has a mast cell tumor removed (common malignant tumor in this breed), and everything was ok. But we recently noticed a lump in her neck. Took her to the vet and on just physical exam, the vet is 90+% sure it’s lymphoma. He took blood and her numbers look good. We could do a biopsy to be sure, but he’s confident enough he doesn’t think it’s worth the cost or the pain she’d go through.?

I’m heartbroken. We’re going to treat her with steroids and hope she goes into remission naturally. But really it’s just a time game at this point. We could do chemo and it would buy more time, but I can put her through that.

So for now we just spoil her while she’s still feeling good. And we go back to the vet in a week to see how she’s responding to meds. Now the only good news would be that we get more time. So that’s what I’m looking for.

9,"My in class senior project presentation is on Tuesday, where I may or may not present that day, depending on if my name gets drawn. Then it’s Thursday and the following Tuesday. I’m recording my vocals, the last track on Monday and putting it all together. It’s two songs.... I’m fucking stressed as hell about it, and on top of everything is 4 projects, all from one teacher, not exaggerating. I have 2 done. I’ve had zero projects since January so they kind of just decided to pile it on at the last minute. I might not graduate if I don’t get the senior project done in time.

That’s not really the half of it. My mom is a mess and I wish I could help her. My sister gave up her kids to a drug addict ex boyfriend and she’s not going to try to get them back. I’m never going to see those kids again because they’ve isolated them. Nothing we can do or prove. My mom is depressed and anxious and freaks out over little things on a regular basis, and I’m just trying not to be the same way. She’s always crying or yelling or talking to herself, mostly about running away. I can’t work when I can hear her suffering and I don’t know how to help because I’ve never been able to.

I can’t stop thinking about suicide. I tried to take a nap today and the image of blowing my brains out just stays there. I feel as though I might actually do it if I don’t graduate. In reality I can go to summer school and be fine. But that tacit ultimatum is still there and I don’t understand why. I feel like a failure before I’ve even failed and I don’t understand it. It’s like I’m afraid of it so I’m already there.

I just have to hang on and know that I’m going to be in Southern California pursuing music and I have the entire world to live for. Everything I’m doing right now is just hoops to jump through. 

It feels so much like a waste and there’s nothing useful about all these projects I’ve been given. One of them is which I have to theoretically open a franchise in the town I live in, it’s done and I learned nothing. One is about the food industry and it was actually quite fascinating. One is a two year plan and I have to budget for the next two years. And the last one I have to interview a small business and make a presentation.

Other people have AP classes too so I don’t have it as bad except for this panic.

10,"So I at a bar after work, and the owners know everyone (small town). The owner's wife had had a few, and she's getting outspoken, shall we say. So she's talking about how she didn't tell the cops that her husband had hit her. I don't honestly believe he did, but I wasn't there and that doesn't have that much to do with the story. So she's talking to another woman and she basically implies that since my dad is talking to her husband, he must be a domestic abuser. 

That made me irate. My parents are divorced, but to my knowledge, my dad never laid a finger on my mom in anger. I'm just so pissed that someone could freely say that about my dad without never knowing anything about us. My dad has never been arrested, and never been in any major legal trouble.

14,"I used to be this alright person, like I didn’t always know what I was saying but I did my best to be empathetic as well as like wholesome and fair minded. But then like a lot of stuff happened and I became disappointed with how it felt like everybody abandoned me or like, would abandon me. So then I became like this person who wants to tell others to just “suck it up.” Since then I’ve done my best to get my good natured self back, like yknow the person who would smile at strangers in a genuine way. At this point I’m a bit like one foot on both sides, sometimes basically numb and other times I see this glimpse of a more caring person. I really have to cry to get that glimpse though. I catch myself feeling hard hearted and then I have to think of puppies and then all the hurt and disappointment comes flooding out, embarrassing me but also like, I’m really grateful. I miss these feelings. 

Right now I’m feeling numb. I’ve also just cried writing this. But to be numb is like to grow this armor, and then like to start wielding anger, but actually not anger but icicles (still looking forward to Game of Thrones new season). Like this sense that I mean nothing to you therefore you mean nothing to me. 

I’ve had some episodes of paranoia. Like I mean just this raw, angry feeling that people are with me and they don’t want to be. I didn’t know what it was and then I found out and now I’m trying to help myself not get that dark again. 

When I found out that some of my desperation could be solved with a diet of shaved ice, Arizona iced tea and puppy videos, I mean like things I do to cheer myself up, I had this whole new idea of myself. I guess finding the simplicity of myself, I mean my simple need for attention and how it can manifest in outwardly cold behavior. . . Well I guess that makes me more forgiving of people. 

Yknow those videos of sharks eating people, being vicious. But then there’s also this video of a diver who hugs the shark like a friend. I think people are quite unlike what I imagined. 

Sometimes I’m pretty numb, still. If you saw my face now I doubt you’d call me friendly. But other times I want to trust again. I want to know about people being friends, humanity being “bros,” you know? The last couple years have been a fog. It’s been lonely. But I hope things can change now. ",05May2018,3

17,"Is anyone else really anti-establishment? Like are not able hop on board trends because you physically cannot bring yourself to conform/partake in what everyone else is partaking in? Popular memes, style trends, popular music, dumb inside jokes that float around your circle at school/work. 

I know it doesn’t make you cool to dislike something just because it’s popular but I have a (probably misconceived) notion that people who do so are unable to think for themselves/have fallen victim. To what? I don’t know. To society? To the system? Maybe nothing. Maybe I’m the only one who’s fallen victim. I feel as though I’ve built a wall and have lived behind it all of my life and I am just now seeing that it might be flawed.

I’ve always been quite stable mentally. I’ve been rational and able to think with clarity, however, recently I’ve felt out of touch with my emotions and have been questioning the way I’ve lived my life up until now. I am finishing up my first year of college and I want to fit in and make friends. I want join everyone and find my place within society but it’s difficult when I want so badly not to conform. I want two opposing things. 

I perhaps am this way is because deep down I am afraid that none of my thoughts are original/I am not able to think for myself. Every thought I’ve ever had has been thought before and everything I’ll ever do has been done before. I am not special. In fact I am painfully average.

22,"Let's start with the beginning. My mother was left alone by my father after a few months since I was born. She had a really, really hard time growing me up alone, only with the help of our relatives, but she made it how no other could ever do it. I am 19 now. And starting from last year, until now, she started to not understand me.

To make some things clear, although I am not the type of person which talks big of himself, I really need to say that I was well raised by my mother, I was always the best in school, I will graduate with almost a perfect 10, so I can say that I am a wanted child \- or little grown\-man.

The problem is, she can't get used to the fact that I've grown up, I need to go out, know people, have a girlfriend or someone who I enjoy spending my time with.

Now I have a girl who has become someone really special for me. I don't want to say more about her, but I need to mention it because it plays it's role. Nowadays, almost everyday, mom starts to brag about the fact that I don't spend time with her, I don't talk with her, I only go out with my girlfriend and always finishes with the sentence that: ""I wish God would kill me"". She is a very religious person and so do I fear God. The problem is, things are not like that!

I never skip classes, I go to the gym every day from monday to friday and usually get to home by 4:30PM. She comes home at around 6PM and probably finds me doing math for the upcoming final exams. When I finish, or between the short breaks, I ask her how was work, how were people today, usual things. I tell her things that happened at school or with my girlfriend...

But I NEVER ignore her. If I do math or something for school, like programming, she keeps bragging that I ignore her, that I don't talk to her and again the cicle repeats. It's just that I care about my future, but she seems to not understand.

I go out with my girlfriend maybe 2\-3 times a week. That's all. I am with mom the other times. But I don't understand why she wants to die. Why she can't let me live a normal life.

And what hurts me the most is when she says that she would love more a kid who is like mediocre, an 8 child, who listens to her and do things the way she wants, than having me. It hurts and I really don't know what I could do more. And I wouldn't want for anything to lose her... She is my mother after all and I love her no matter what.",05May2018,2

24,"I'm saying this in public in an attempt to perhaps save someone else from ever having to watch such a thing happen right in front of them, and in the hopes that someone else may get to skip having to bury their beloved pet and fur covered friend in such circumstances, and most importantly in the event some other wonderful dog will be spared such an unwarranted and unnecessary premature death because their human failed them.

Being unwaveringly diligent regarding the use of a leash would have saved my dog's life last night, and would have saved me from experiencing this gut wrenching feeling of loss and of ultimate responsibility in my role as her human friend and guardian.  Sure, she ran into the street herself, even after being taught what had seemed like adequate lessons, but in the end the responsibility sits firmly upon my shoulders and conscience as the adult human in charge.

Let this be a lesson to others in the horrific consequences of over confidence mixed with laziness and convenience, and in how it only takes mere seconds for everything to change... 

This dog was 6yrs old and otherwise bright and well trained, and not the sort to run into the street, having been off leash and without incident hundreds of times over the years, but dogs will be dogs at times no matter how bright or well trained they appear, and all it took was an instant of instinct taking over for a squirrel to catch her attention in the right/wrong way, and off she went across the street.  She even did a 180 and started to return the instant I called her name, but at the worst possible time a vehicle rounded the corner and hit her as she was coming back.  She managed to stumble back into my yard before collapsing and basically dying immediately.

At least it was quick and without more than an instant of suffering for her.

My suffering and feelings of guilt and failure will no doubt last.

TL:DR

Leash your dogs at all times, people, unless it's in an absolutely securely fenced area, even if they've seemed to know better and act right numerous times before.  Ultimately - dogs are dogs and aren't as smart as we are, and this poor dog's human failed to adequately protect her, and now she's gone forever, and I'm the asshole with a dead dog on his conscience.

Please no Reddit Gold. Give to your local animal shelter if you feel the need to do something.  Otherwise, just make sure to leash your dog, always, please.",05May2018,16

27,"I've grown up in a world that preaches confidence and self-esteem, and I think it's bullshit. For some reason, we have grown into a culture that values feeling great without actually being great. People want to believe they can play video games all day and somehow magically fall into a great career or change the world. People want to eat like shit, become obese, yet still expect men and women to flock to them. People want happiness and confidence, but they also want it to be free of charge. 

Do you know what confidence is? It's when you feel comfortable and safe in your own skin and in a certain situation. Feeling comfortable and safe is nice, so who wouldn't want it? But where does it come from? It comes from having an actual reason to feel comfortable and safe. Let's say you want to start playing basketball. You've never played in your life, but one day, you go up to a group of people who you see playing every day and ask to join them. They let you, and naturally, you suck. If you start feeling bad about this, the generic response from someone on the outside might be ""you just have to have more confidence! Just believe in yourself!"" To which I have to ask, what about that situation warrants confidence? You suck at basketball. You just proved to yourself you suck at basketball, so why would you feel comfortable and safe in a context where you consistently make a fool of yourself? Being confident in this situation is not rational.

So what do you say to a piece of garbage rookie who wants to play in the NBA? Two words -- ""get better."" You should never tell someone to force good feelings upon themselves. If you want to play in the NBA, then you can't expect to be coddled. You need that pressure. You need that pain of knowing you're garbage, and you need to know it's never going to truly go away until you're so good at what you do you have no choice but to feel comfortable and safe because it has simply become as natural as breathing. 

Frankly, I think we've grown into a bunch of pansies. I think we're fostering [anxiety-riddled generations of people who can't handle life](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Adulting) because we never taught them how. We want to be strong, but steel is made with fire and hammers. Let's stop putting the carriage before the horse. Let's stop patting ourselves on the back and rewarding ourselves with good feelings after we fail. Let's use those negative feelings of failure as fuel toward real, not imagined, progress. If we want to feel better, then we need to be better. ",05May2018,1

30,"My brain perceives food as unclean or disgusting for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it's taste, sometimes texture and/or color, and sometimes just knowing that some of the foods used in the mixing gross me out. It's bad enough that I've been losing weight because so much food absolutely disgusts me. I'm trying to eat buttered garlic rice right now but it's making me want to vomit. Realistically there's no reason for it, because I like the ingredients but my brain hates the smell today. I had to spit it out.

I also perceive the food I make to be ""bad"", but the food that other people make is ""good"". So I never cook, yet I can't spend money eating out all the time, so I skip meals. 

And none of it really makes any sense. I can eat something like McDonalds, which is arguably disgusting, but I have a hard time eating lettuce if it isn't chopped finely enough because my brain perceives it as eating grass or tree leaves. I also perceive my kitchen to be dirty, but can easily eat out at a restaurant where it's highly likely my food is coming from a place way dirtier. 

None of it makes any sense. It has nothing to do with my weight either. My brain just thinks most food is disgusting. I hate most dairy items. If anything seems ""off"" I'll throw and entire bag of string cheese away. I also pick through my white meat only chicken to make sure there are no impurities.  Fruit reminds me of pollen, which I am allergic to, so thinking about eating an apple grosses me out. Although I can eat pre-cut apples for some reason.

34,"I sunk my head beneath the water nearly brimming the lip of the bathtub; let it fill my ears and languidly cover my face enough so I could finally get to the point of it all--hearing the pace of my heartbeat. It was a day of self-consumption, self-destruction, and all of the pieces of me were now buoyantly vibrating against each other in this porcelain baptism. Racing, I hear her; inner me exasperatingly gesticulating to my heart, pointing, screaming; ""trust it, trust it, trust it"". I hold my breath a moment longer feeling the ache of my lungs expanded in this heavy pool. Here, in this moment, I remind myself that I am alive; this is feeling. 


A gentle suckling and the water is gone. I'm standing naked, not quite cold, my hands feeling clammy in anxious anticipation of clothing myself and presenting my existence to the man in the kitchen. I focus now on the metallic quartet of the pots hitting the stove, from the sink to the table. It's easy to image him, feet shoulder's length apart, resting his weight lightly on one hip, bending the opposing knee, deep in his head while his hands move in memory to their occupation. I am standing similarly, imagining him doing the same, water rolling from my short hair onto my shoulders. I think of that droplet of water traversing the silhouette of my body until another metallic clang pulls me back into myself. 

Clammy hands and a racing heart, but clothed, I step closer to him. I wear shame on my face, not for any actions that I've done, but for thoughts that I've unjustly articulated a day before. ""Here I am"", I think, ""a tangle of words and emotions that remain painfully  and inarticulately in hibernation within me"". I meet his eyes with mine and, without looking directly, take note of the way his hands have fallen down to his sides and his expression softens from mechanic focus to adoration. ""Ah, he loves me still"". 


Holding myself up against the bed, my back to him, I want to dissipate; disappear; and leave him as beautiful as I remember him. His hands trace around the curve of my hip bones, moving languidly, warmly, to my rib cage before his arms encompass my sides and he's pressing against me; chin resting on my shoulder. His body conforms to me like water and I feel myself rest into him; allowing my head to go under; to hear my heart in my chest; to feel his and know, too, how alive we are. ""If I ever lost you"" he begins, speaking softly in a near whisper into my ear, his breath hot and alluring, ""you would be the one that got away"".

Took him by his wrist, cut him; cut his wrist, vertically. Then I said “What now, hoe?” Oh he was on the floor dying, making a scene. That nigga daddy came over and said “What happened?” I said “Nigga, I slit his wrist.” Took his Letterman from him, put it on, left without paying!

The following day I see this shy girl and shes looking hot. Like as in ""holy crap I've noticed you before but as of right now all I see is you!"" kind of hot. Her hair game was on point (it usually is anyways but it had an extra bounce), shes walking with some insane confidence, she eyes have a fire in em that made me sweat bullets upon bullets of sweat, a smile that screams ""I got this"", and her lips... lips have on this red lipstick I've never seen her wear before and; Oh. My. God. Becky. I. Have. An. Erection. Why do I have an erection? I don't fuckin know but that red lipstick has something to do with it... Which is weird because red lipstick never did anything to me until she wore it.

But my dudes and duddetes this girl when I saw her the following day was just... wow. I'll admit shes kinda cute and I've had some interaction with her in the past but she always came off really quiet a goofball, and a bit of an oddball. But in a fun, and adorable kind of way. 

Lol one situation I vividly remember was when I first met her back in December of last year and she was pacing back and forth rather quickly for some odd reason and this caught my attention as I found it funny but at the same time I was concerned. I looked at her for a moment and I was about to speak up but I'm guessing she caught on and perked up and waved at me in a kind of sorta cute way. Sort of weirded me out but at the same time it was kawaii as fuck so I let it go. Still kept my distance... As like I said it weirded me out. 

But when I saw her... Nope. I was focused on her and my heart started to race. She was walking right past me and a group of my coworkers who have gathered at this cafe bar but all of a sudden our eyes connect and she makes a B line for us and my boner goes away and my skin turns ghost white. Thats when I noticed for some fucking odd ass reason I start to groom myself and correct my posture. Like what the fuck man? Why am I doing all of this?? Either way I make myself handsome as best as I can as a really fiery hot girl is coming in 2 seconds. 

Shes here. Smack dab right in the middle of us. I'm at the right edge and she looks at me and I look at her. She smiles. I smile. She then turns to one of my coworkers and they start to talk. At this point in time I figured I best just read something on my phone and ignore her and let her do whatever she came here to do. I finish reading what popped up on my phone and next thing I know shy girl and my coworker moved from their edge are next to me. 

Coworker looking all suave and shit. I notice he has a credit card in his hand. Hes talking to the cashier of the cafe bar so I'm guessing hes are gonna buy some coffee for the both of em and have a chat. I then notice the shy girl then pokes her head from around my coworkers shoulder (the dude is at least a foot taller than her so she was hidden like a ninja lol) and shes kinda looking at me and I return the looks with a cheeky ""oh really?"" look and she does a half smile. I and then tell my coworker I'm needed somewhere else as the supervisor sent me a message saying I'm needed in a different terminal and a bid them both a good day.

I'll be honest. I never knew they had interacted before all of this. Shes a sweet girl and that day I saw her it really made me notice her. My coworker is an alright dude and hes someone I shoot the shit with whenever I see him. I hope something pops up between em as this world has too much negative. I wanna see some more positive in this world of mine!

Plus I cant help but be insanely jealous of what I witnessed... I hope that happens to me someday!",05May2018,5
37,"every job i’ve ever had i’ve been sexually harassed on the first day. I dont know why women think its ok to call guys they dont know “cutie”, “hot stuff” etc... It makes me uncomfortable and if the roles were switched it would be a totally different situation. I was meeting my coworkers today and a girl just started throwing all these pet names at me around my manager and everyone else and everybody just laughs and says “stooop”... Its not cool and it makes me genuinely upset. I used to work with people who would sexually assault me and it was the same story because im a guy. Ugh ",05May2018,23
38,"I'm not sure if this belongs here, /offmycheet/ or even /r/depression, but for now you guys win.

Thirty something years ago I felt that life was mocking me. It took a long time to get over it.

Now, at age 65, it seems that it's doing it again. The big difference is that this time it's entirely possible (perhaps probable)  that I have actually failed life, and this is the logical result.

I tried my best, or thought I did. And no, make no.mistake -- I have no desire or plan to do anything final. I just needed to get this out there.

Hope you're having a nice weekend. ",05May2018,14
40,"I couldn't sleep.

The world seems such a sad place. People, bad childhoods, bad experiences, unmet expectations, unfulfilled desires. I feel sad for myself, and for all of humanity. I wish I were less lonely. I wish someone were a witness to my life. I wish I were witness to someone's life.

I just want to let go, of everything. I want an end to all my desires. I want to liberate my self from the emotions, so that the self may no longer be brought down. I want out from the pain and misery of human experience.",05May2018,1
41,"**TL;DR:** Due to issues we're having communicating and her general attitude change towards me ever since asking her out, I've finally decided that I've lost interest in this girl who I've been close-ish friends with for half a year. However, I'm anxious as to how things will turn out within our mutual circle of friends. I'm also not sure how I can express this to her without breaking our friendship and most importantly, our bonds with the circle.
________
About five weeks ago, I decided to ask out this girl who's been my friend for about six months. I could go on and on about how I felt that she was ""the one,"" but she did say yes. I was beyond ecstatic. I came up with a brilliant plan for our first date which under different circumstances, would have happened on the upcoming Saturday. 

See, about a week before this all happened, my grandfather succumbed to pneumonia. She was the first person I consulted for emotional support. As we had told each other that we'd be there for one another, she was extremely helpful and I was absolutely grateful for her support. By the time I'd asked her out, I'd already moved on from the tragedy. This was the part that made things *very* complicated.

In her words, she didn't believe that I'd *actually* moved on because I never got to mourn for my grandfather or even see my relatives in person (they are all currently living in Japan; we are both living on an American campus). She came to the conclusion that until I've visited my relatives after the semester, we shouldn't be dating. At the time I was too hesitant to say no, so I agreed and we decided to move our date till the beginning of June.

You'd think after we settled this and called it a day, we would still treat each other like normal. But lately, I've been noticing she talks to me less frequently and more often than not, she shows me attitude, even in front of our group of friends. Now I'm almost positive that the latter is just playful, but that's hard to say since even if I'm trying to engage in small talk (e.g. asking how her day was, weekend plans, etc.), her tone would suddenly change and she'd find something to pick on whenever I said anything in return. You've heard of people who take pleasure in starting fights/arguments with other people; this is pretty darn close to how she's been behaving towards me. 

This has been going on for weeks, and even after the numerous times I pointed this out to her, it just persisted. It was hard, but I finally decided I should just put an end to our first date plans. I haven't told her this yet, but I intend to when the time is right. I have very little motivation to hang out with or even pursue her for a romantic path. At this point, I'm even questioning if she said ""yes"" just to be nice.

The part that I'm anxious about is how things would turn out within our circle of friends. You could probably imagine how awkward things would be whenever both of us occupied the same room along with our friends. I absolutely do not want to burn any bridges since we had already made arrangements to dorm in the same hall for the upcoming sophomore year. Again, at the moment she's unaware that I've lost interest in her. So I've yet to figure out a way to communicate this without becoming foes. Although, I am feeling *a lot* more relaxed now that I've finally made a decision and I was able to write it all out here.",05May2018,2
