6,"We were sitting at our table smoking hookah and talking. I was wearing a Squirtle shirt and was bobbing along to the good beats playing. This nerdy looking dude came up to us and mainly started trying to talk to me. He commented the he liked my shirt and we talked about Pokémon for a minute and he asked where I was from. I said I lived in Ohio and was just visiting Florida. He said that’s cool, what for? and I almost felt sad telling him I was there to get married. My now husband, who was sitting across from me, gave him a tight-lipped smile and a wave. He probably thought my husband was my brother, since we look enough alike. The dudes’ face fell and he didn’t try too hard to continue the conversation, it seemed like he felt awkward. 

He was a really sweet dude and seemed chill. I hope he’s doing really good and that he’s staying hydrated and that his pets are healthy.

8,"I’m a high school kid who’s dealing with some insecurities. I’d like to think of myself as somewhat attractive and athletic, but I’m really not. However, I’m very confident in my academic ability. Sometimes when I’m feeling really insecure about something  else, I’ll mention in passing an academic achievement. It’s stupid, because none of it really matters, and all I’m doing is making people think I’m arrogant, and I hate that I do that. I’ve been trying to not do it, and it’s been working okay. But today, I tried to ask some people why they were poking fun at me for making some test score, and afterwards I realized it came across as really “iamverysmart”. I’m incredibly frustrated with myself, and I wish I’d just keep my mouth shut, but I have a lot of trouble. I just want to make more friends and be more social, but I’m alienating myself. 

1. Is there any way I can reverse these perceptions? I have a friend who’d stick up for me and could explain my issues, but I’m inclined to think that’s not the best idea. 

2. After I fix the issue, how should I do better in the future to not talk about myself? I want to be more of a listener, and not keep talking, because that’s when I run into issues.

10,"I go to a really good school. People would kill to get their kids into this school, and here I am fucking around because I'm ""not motivated"". I really shouldn't be feeling this way at all. I gotta get it together. Freshman and sophomore year I didn't mind going to classes, I kept my chin up. What happened?

I used to be pretty upbeat in classes, even if I didn't really like them, but now I feel myself starting to just slog through, doing the bare minimum and going to sleep happy with a B+. I'm not so high-strung (good!) but I also feel like I can't be assed to do anything (bad!). I'm taking classes that are harder than I'm used to, and instead of taking the opportunity to grow as a student, I'm shrinking back into bad coping mechanisms and brute forcing my way through.

It gets worse. Lately I've been eating more than usual. I'm wondering if I'm subconsciously trying to fill a void by eating. I'm procrastinating more than usual, and I feel worse about myself afterwards. I feel heavier--walking up stairs is more difficult (though that might be all the food...). I'm almost worried I could be, like, spiraling into a depression.

That might be a bit of a stretch, but I am worried. I'm kind of a goody-two-shoes (I like to say I'm straight-laced!), so suddenly only giving half a fuck is a little frightening.

If I were actually depressed, I could go talk to a guidance counselor. That's a legit problem that happens to real people. But there's no way I'm gonna waltz in there and bitch about being an entitled little shit who doesn't want to do homework.",24Feb2018,2

Even well beyond neglect (in terms of not protecting young people from gun violence), it's not unrealistic to think that (many) older people are at least somewhat predatory and abusive toward the young.  

So imagine if you were born into a society in which everyone else decided to enslave you once you come of age, and you were not even given a chance to vote on the representatives who made those decisions.  Obviously this is rigged and grossly unfair in a society that is supposed to strive for justice.  This is a corrupt game of Monopoly in which the latest generation arrived long after all the land and spoils were claimed.  

Pretending that we deny young people the vote because they are minors who lack judgment just makes it easier for predatory older people and criminal global plutocrats to sell off their futures before they can politically or legally do anything about it.  

If old people are going to sacrifice the lives of our young at the altar of the corrupt global plutocracy, young people deserve some means of fighting back. 

As adults, we would be up in arms if people tried to take away our right to vote, because it is the only means we have of fighting back against people who would enslave us.  

Young people deserve that same respect and protection in society from their elders who are happy to abuse, exploit, and prey upon them.

From housing, to education, to finances, to healthcare, it is unrealistic to expect that the political system will do anything to help young people if they do not even have the means to fight (vote) for their interests.  

Even more than gun control (which is a symptom of their lack of political representation), this should be the issue that young people start fighting for.  ",24Feb2018,0

17,"This is my first year year in college. Before this I have had girls friends before but they were all middle school flings and nothing serious. All this changed when I met this girl a little into the first month of college. Our encounter was total chance, a friend of a friend of a friend, but some how we were kicking it and found ourself looking into each eyes until 3 am in the morning. I was with this girl 2 months, longest relationship I’ve ever had. We spent every night together since her roommate and I were all good friends. We would hide from everyone else in the closet or find another room so we could be alone together. 

I thought everything was going great until one night she goes to a concert hella turnt and ends up not coming back, crashing at her friends place. She crashed at her friends place 4 more times after she finally tells me she is breaking up with me. Just like that everything I have had with this girl was gone just like that. She told me that she didn’t trust her self when she got drunk at parties and didn’t want to cheat on me. I don’t know if this is the truth or not but isn’t this why people get into relationships? Isn’t a relationship suppose to be hard to maintain and require commitment from both ends. I’m not a perfect human being and I had thought about other girls at parties when she wasn’t there but I knew everyday she would be there when I can back so I stayed strong and in the end it was all worth the effort cause all I ever wanted was attention from this girl and for her to notice me. 

She told me that she didn’t want to hurt me that way and that she loved me as a friend. This was the hardest part about the breakup as I saw all the fun times we have spent together, but realized this whole time she thought of us as friends. 

We are still friends and to this day do we still hang out. A couple days ago we biked to Costco while took an hour there. We took breaks on the way there because it was so windy and there was a farm which looked beautiful to walk in. This was where she saw her first sunset as she embraced me in her arms. 

I am going to be living with her and a guy friend next year and do not know if I can continue this. I really want to be with her and miss her cuddles. Everyday it makes me sad when I have to leave her room and walk back to mine reminding me that things have changed. ",24Feb2018,3
18,"On mobile sorry for format

So I’m going through a breakup right now, and it’s really hard for a number of reasons. First, I don’t actually know if we’re “broken up” or just “on a break”, so I have no idea if I’m ever going to hear from him again. Secondly it was the single weirdest breakup I’ve ever had. Basically, there are fundamental differences in our personalities and the way we each respond to stress, to the point that it would be unfair for either of us to ask the other to change. We still love each other and last night when this whole situation went down we laid in bed and held each other and cried for like an hour. 

So now I’m stuck with this thought that it’s highly unlikely to work out even though we love each other. Which is stupid because since I was a child I was told “love conquers all” etc etc. That is very clearly a lie and I feel cheated. 

Then I started to think about all the successful marriages of people I know who actually had arranged marriages. They are happy people and their relationships appear even healthier than married couples who are/were in love. I know, appearances can be deceiving but still. 

So I’m left with this notion that not only is love not enough to keep your relationship afloat, but it’s not even needed. And if that’s the case...I don’t really know but it makes me sad to think about. ",24Feb2018,2

29,"As the quote goes ""sometimes the person you'd take a bullet for ends up being the one behind the gun"". As of last year myself and someone that I used to call my best friend have been drifting. This is because our friendship was based on drug taking.

When we first became friends I tried too hard to make him like me which gave him the power in the friendship. The more we hung out the more and more I considered him to be my best friend. I would speak highly of him and felt like he could do nothing wrong. 

In terms of the drug taking I can't blame him, we were both equally at fault at least it ended up being that way. Ever since the end of 2016 where I had a bad drug experience I've been put off by drugs although still took a lot of time to eventually quit weed etc. 

Now here's the issue at hand. I opened up to him, more than he ever opened up to me it feels like and I truly trusted him. I eventually found out that he told at least one other person what I shared with him. I said I know what he did and I forgive him but soon after could no longer trust him. Flash forward to now and I'm just done. He gives me a negative feeling. He doesn't see the change in me over the last yeah and a half and it's like he needs nothing but happy vibes. Meanwhile I'm waiting on seeing a Psychiatrist for mental health issues triggered by drugs and he doesn't seem to give a fuck. 

We've slowly began talking less and less which is a relief but I really don't want to say or do anything to make him flip out and backstab me even more. I still don't say anything bad behind his back, I'm holding myself to a standard and not stooping down to his level. But honestly the pain I went through last year and my mistrust of others... I can forgive but I'll never forget. 

What do I do from here on out. Do I still hang out with him from time to time? (We're not usually out for long) and what do I say in occasional messages? I'm trying to not be detailed while still being polite and kind but I'm on edge that one little thing he'll take the wrong way.

He’s a bit of an ass who sees the world in caricature but I think he’s an otherwise intelligent and funny good man. So his comment though inappropriate are not the worst thing in the world to me because I can still appreciate the good attributes he has.

It’s just not appropriate on a professional/human level to mock gay clients. No one knows I’m bi. They assume I’m standard straight because I have a boyfriend. But this man joked that he hoped an annoying clients boyfriend beats her. I immediately called him out and said that’s gross (without being too aggressive, he is not only upper management but married into the company owners family). He conceded and was like “yea you’re right that bitch probably doesn’t have a boyfriend. I hope her girlfriend beats her tho!” And he meant it as a joke but Jesus Christ was it ignorant. People make awful and inappropriate jokes all the time that they do not necessarily hold as a core belief. But I was just struck on multiple folds by this off-hand joke. Making light of domestic violence is horrible. Insinuating a woman is so undesirable she has to be gay is also offensive.

I had half a mind to come out right there in front of the whole office. I’m bisexual. I’ve been hit by men. But I decided not to.

Who knows if we hire another person less tolerant as I am of these comments.  I didn’t tho because this is stuff ppl should be talking to him about anyway.

I also wouldn't expect disagreements about geology, like evidence claiming dinosaurs were older than the world according to Christians. That seems like evidence against the Bible.

Also, ""wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life"". Well, it seems everyone dies here, getting their wages for their sin, even though Jesus was crucified. BTW In more scientific terms you could say death is required due to the imperfect nature of everything in this reality.

If Christianity was true, I would expect to feel more at the rituals. But even then, how do you know it is not just the ritual causing you to feel that way, as it seems optimized for that. Plus, there are all sorts of different Christians who claim to be the right one. Surely if they were really in touch with God as they claim there would be some unity!

About a mile up the road from our dorm is a nudist resort. Everyone always jokes about it. Of course you can't see inside, but there is a 7 foot tall hedge that separates it from the rest of the woods/highway.

As a few friends of mine were walking past it between classes, at around 2:00 on a sunny afternoon one day, amd one of them made a joke about going there for Spring Break.

I made the mistake of speaking up, especially since I'm already known as a ""know-it-all"" type of nerd.

I said ""Yeah right, you guys are the last pussies who would do that.""

My friends basically said ""Oh and you would?""

I said ""I'd be more likely before you guys."" That was an obvious lie.

They all looked at each other. Smirked. And pounced on me.

After dragging me behind a tree and pulling at my button-down shirt and belt on my pants...2 minutes later, I was dragged towards the hedge.

""No guys, please...PLEASE!"" but they ignored my request.

And then I was shoved shoved up and over.

I fell with a thud, right into the resort.

They yelled ""Enjoy the fresh air, virgin boy!"" as I stood there, helpess.

Butt-naked.

In front of a live, nude audience.

Have you ever been naked without expecting to be?

There I was, in the open. Sun shining on my bare ass and bare penis for the first time in my entire life.

Eye wide, mouth open. Hands at my sides for about 10 full seconds in total shock.

Lily-white from the neck-down. Only 5'7.

My chubby ""Studies While Eating Doritos"" belly.

Just a smattering of hair on my chest and stomach. Clothed by nothing but my body hair like an animal.

My round, very white ""bubble butt"" as my friend Ashley would say, shaking with every movement behind me. The brisk breeze caressing my bald, hairless butt-cheeks.

And my little (hey, it's a throwaway!) penis and balls being hidden by nothing but my hands cupping them when I finally snapped out of it and covered my shame.

I was as naked as the day I was born in front of about 20 laughing people.

They say ""you only see nude people you wouldn't want to see"" at a nudist resort. That is sort of true, and sort of isn't. Yes, a few old people. A few out of shape people.

But also that group of 3 very attractive women in their early 40's, pointing and laughing. I don't blame them. They thought I was a college kid overstepping my bounds and playing a prank. They didn't know I was the one with the prank played on ME.

One attractive 40 year old woman yelling ""Better keep that little worm covered, the seagulls haven't had their lunch yet!""

A guy my age, an obvious gym rat who was tanned, standing a few feet from me in stark contrast of my chubby body.

And that one hot 26 year old girl laughing hysterically and saying ""Wait you're STILL a VIRGIN?!""

My first mistake was turning around, jumping up and down and yelling ""Pull me back up! Pull me back up!""

My bare butt is big enough. A jumping, jiggling bare butt is quite the comedic sight.

I finally gave up and ran across the entire green lawn, inside the main building, desperately looking for the reception desk, hands covering my balls like my life depended on it.

After explaining my ridiculous situation to a laughing 28 year old geeky (and fully clothed) 5'11 girl, I was given a towel out of mercy and kicked out.
