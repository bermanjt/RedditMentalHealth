0,"After working for my shitty job for almost 5 months I quit because I just can't deal with it anymore, I don't know how people can manage working fast food for more than a year because it is honestly the most depressing job ever I think I pretty much cried sometimes when I have to go to work. To be fair I had to juggle college classes too but it was hell coming back from work and being so tired I can do nothing but fall asleep then wake up for classes and go to work immediately after. Leaving quite literally no time for myself besides on commute since I take the bus... anyway whenever I go to the restaurant even the smell makes me sick so I never eat there anymore. 

I heard people like it when you smile and say please and thank you so I do that plus I try to leave tips when I can... I never noticed really notice the former but definitely the latter. Going home with some dollars in spare cash felt sooo nice",30Oct2018,1

And I was all brooding and then I was like yay! I told that guy I like that I liked him and he knows1 and I was getting all smiley and then it was time to do the class thing we were doing togetherz So I was like, ok, I'm gonna forget about this for like 5 minutes but then I had to look at him and it was all like AWWWWWYYY and then I couldn't keep it up so I ran off the classroom.

5,"So im a senior in highschool and application season is starting soon. I have a 3.2 on the 4.0 scale and a 3.6 on the 5.0. Ive been taking hard classes all of highschool and i did great freshman, junior, and so far this year. But i got a 2.4 sophomore year. UCs (which is where im applying since i live in CA) only see my grades from sophomore and junior year, a 3.2... I cant change what happened and i know i can write a good essay and my SAT wasnt terrible (1200) but im waiting on my other score to come in, and im taking an ACT soon. Just discouraged and i dont want to disappoint my parents since i feel like i have for a while. Really stressed, anybody have similar stories or been through similar times? i need reassurance. thanks.",30Oct2018,1
7,Honestly the idea of being able to write with both hands astounds me. But apparently I’ve researched that it can do more harm than good. I saw this as a hobby that I could probably start doing just for the fun of it though I guess it’s not a good thing to do due to brain development and genetics? Any help or opinions on this subject would be appreciated.,30Oct2018,1
9,"The situation I’m in is a bit more complicated than just the title. For the past couple weeks I’ve been catching up with an old friend and we have been talking about moving in together next spring. 

We’ve always have been really good friends so it seems like a great idea, but I’ve started to have feelings for her and I don’t really know how to tell her/ ask her how she feels about me. 

Also I’m not sure if getting into a relationship with her than moving in shortly after is a good idea?",30Oct2018,1
10,"Whenever I’m stressed, bored, have had a bad day, etc, always resort to delicious junk food. More so now because the summer is over.  My body is punishing me for it alright! What things or activities do you resort to when you want a quick dopamine release in the brain? ",30Oct2018,1
11,"I am a male and am 17 so I cannot currently do it but I'm thinking that's what I'm going to do when the time comes. 

I dislike my parents. I barely hold any love for them. It's not edgy, this isn't my 'rebellious' stage in my teenage years, as they call everything I do. I just hold so much resentment towards them. My *parents* include my birth dad and my step mom. My step mom has never loved me, never showed it, and in fact showed the opposite. She has always tried to make it clear that she loves her own kids than me. This doesn't bother me. What bothers me is that she can tell my father anything and he will believe her. I will admit when I'm wrong in a lot of situations and always have, but sometimes she has straight up lied to him about things I have done and he believes her over me. 

I'm just tired of it. Recently I got in a lot of trouble and just... pretty much feel neglected honestly. Not only in this situation but I have felt this way for quite some time.. This ordeal was partly my fault but her exaggeration of it just did so much and it's probably the most trouble I have been in during my 17 years on this Earth. 

I've been thinking and... I know this might sound harsh, but I've been saving up from working and I think the day that I turn 18 I will move out and cut all contact. And after I get my living arrangements situated I want my last name changed. I don't want to have the name they have. I don't want to be known as them. 

I didn't come here only to rant though, I also came for advice. If you have any experience doing the same, please share your story. I thought about taking my girlfriends name but neither of us are sure how we feel about that (not that we don't think we're not gonna last, because we do plan to get married eventually, but we just have mixed feelings about it- she'd rather have my current last name). 

TL;DR Male. Want to legally change last name. Not sure what to change it to. Would enjoy some personal stories and advice! ",30Oct2018,1
12,"3 years ago I never gave a shit about US politics, didn’t care at all, some Bernie Sanders guy showed up in my feed and I watched a few of his speeches and was blown away that a politician was saying the things he was. Fast forward and he lost the nomination to Hillary, I thought she was the embodiment of everything that is wrong in politics today, I didn’t follow much after that until I saw some videos of anti trump protesters and then the chaos at one of the University speeches of a right wing speaker can’t remember who maybe Milo or Shapiro either way it didn’t matter who, I just saw the way they acted and could never support that behaviour, then it kept getting worse nearly every sub in reddit was infested by this political sickness of insanity. Terms like fascist and nazi were thrown at anyone that supported trump and I will be honest I would have never voted for him, I found it laughable a reality tv Star was going to be President. I just didn’t see him the way he was being described, sure he is a clown but come on in no way is he some sort of fascist nazi dictator. So I started to defend him, I thought the idea that the world is getting taken over by nazis completely insane. Look I’m all for immigration my family was immigrants but it needs to be done properly and for this stance I’m now a nazi, someone that is constantly described all over every social media platform that I am some sort of subhuman that should have no rights and be banished from existence.

I don’t support the left and I don’t belong in the right, I mean I support better wages, better healthcare and education, I think money should be removed from politics and i believe in free speech even for actual nazis, but I also have a dislike for religion and hate the pandering to Islam.

This has all gotten so crazy, both sides seem bad as each other. So who is wrong? Am I on the side of evil and just can’t see it. How can we even move forward from this point. Both sides seem so split and it seems to get wider every day, I don’t want some looney sending bombs to Democrats and I don’t want people assaulted and labeled subhuman for supporting a different political party. Can we even get to a middle ground.",30Oct2018,1
13,"Recently, a family friend cheated on her husband. She is calling my mother constantly now because she is worried sick he’ll commit suicide, though to my knowledge he hasn’t threatened to do so.

14,"I have a lot to say, I give great advice, I’m very well spoken and thoughtful. Yet, I often stay quiet, I only give advice or opinions when I’m asked directly. I type long thought out comments on social media, only to erase it, because who really cares. I relate to so much to so many things I read, but no one knows, because regardless of my interest or knowledge on a subject, I don’t join in discussions. My husband and best friend want me to join in starting a Podcast, and I’m terrified. They know me the best, and know how vocal I am in private. I don’t think I can portray who I am on a public platform of any kind. I’m a people person and at the same time I have a hard time talking to people unless I know them well and feel very comfortable.

15,"It's been a while since last time, but it's happening again.  
Insomnia followed by thoughts about my life.

Odd thing is, everything in my current life is ok. I am for the first time living at my fullest, or I should say for the first time really living.  
But I realize now that my past will never disappear as if it never existed. I remember. And I will eternally remember.

I once was in middle school, as mostly everyone actually. I had a best friend, with who I could literally talk about anything for days. During this period, I was beginning to be bullied, but it didn't matter much, for I had friends to compensate. By my personal stupidity, greed and possessiveness of what I did not possess, my best friend became an casual person. Being bullied did not matter as long as I had friends. But losing this person made all of my friends to reject me. So I began a full year of being bullied with no one by my side. And that is something I will probably never be able to forget, no matter how hard I try.

So, here I am, not being able to sleep, contemplating the rain, and remembering some phantoms I would rather burrow.

I had enough reality.

Now leave me to dream.",30Oct2018,1
16," I have an upcoming cleaning at the dentists and every time I go I always cringe and flinch whenever the assistant uses the metal scraper tool on my teeth and when they floss my teeth. It’s kind of like that feeling of nails scratch a chalkboard, you cringe.

It makes me hate going to the dentist. ",30Oct2018,1

19,"I don't know how to reconcile how I feel about the state of my country and the realization that I'm just becoming one of those people that think the younger generation is garbage. But it seems different this time, the left and right seem more divided than ever and there's a complete lack of basic respect and understanding from where you can even begin to have any type of productive dialogue. 

I'm no philosophy expert but the word ""axiom"" keeps coming to mind, and it's like we lost *that*. There's no agreement on the most simple, underlying truths that are required for getting to more sophisticated truths. Plus neither side has any respect for the other. I'm part of the problem too I know it. Reddit is certainly very left leaning and as someone who for their entire life thought of themselves as progressive, I now see myself becoming super critical of the people I used to think of as like-minded. I'm constantly amazed by how downright moronic a lot of the comments I see here on most subreddits are, although maybe just the popular ones. And so I start losing respect for them and it's hard for me to engage them in a way that will result in anything positive. 

I've lost faith and it's just the way it is. I can't escape it because my family, friends, coworkers, they all talk about politics and it seems fucked. Everything has become a meme and once it's that, you can no longer say things that remind people of it or you lose credibility in their eyes. I can't say that I hate both sides without someone instantly going ""Ya BoTh SiDes ArE SaMe"", and to them that's the end of the conversation and they win.

Whatever. Shitty rant over. I'm gonna play some RDR2.",30Oct2018,1
20,"I’m normally so happy and full of life. I love it, my friends love it, my family loves it, my girlfriend loves it. It’s the best feeling in the world. But I can’t focus enough to hardly read a sentence. When I’m on my Vyvanse that changes. I’m extremely focused and it completely fixes that problem...but not without making a ton more in the process.

I have to take it shortly after I wake up or I won’t be able to sleep, I have almost no appetite and it’s incredibly hard to eat (which makes it hard to workout, my favorite hobby), it makes me irritable, paranoid, sad, stressed, and borderline bipolar. If I’m on my pill and I look happy I’m probably faking it or I just smoked some pot and if I use that to fix it every day it causes it’s own issues.

It seems like all my problems boiled down to my pill. Being on my pill at my apartment I was so sad. There were other things going on too but it caused me to start taking Prozac. I quit my job and went back home last December and I was so happy. Looking back on it, it’s probably because I was off my pills. August was a great month for me. I quit my job to prepare for college, stopped taking my pills, it was fantastic. I started going to therapy recently because I was so depressed but the more I think about it I’m only like that on my pill.

When I’m off my pill, I can’t work or do school stuff, I can’t function, but I love my life. When I’m on it I’m like a machine, but I’m dying inside. 

I know people have much worse problems than me, but I just wish I could be normal. I wish I could read a book whenever I want, I wish I could have my mom’s delicious pancakes without feeling like I have to force down every bite, I wish I could talk about my life to people I meet at college without trying not to mention my ADHD so I stay a person to them instead of a potential drug source.

People think it’s so easy being able to take a pill and becoming a super focused machine, that I should be able to force down food, that I’m overreacting about everything. Maybe they’re right, all I know is I’m either happy and useless or efficient and sad.

More kids are being prescribed this shit every day and I used to support it, but I don’t want them to be like me. Nobody wants this. I’m essentially dependent on amphetamines and I wanna be done, but I’m afraid I never will be.",30Oct2018,1

Maybe.) I'm not going to ask the singer because we're still friends and I think it will be awkward and non of the other bandmates know the lyrics.

24,"I'm a third of the way through some interesting journeys in Canada. I mean, this is my home, I've never left Canadian soil. I'm currently in my hometown, in my grandparent's basement. I love this home. I have so many memories here, from hammering my first nail to building a fence, getting in shit for changing the radio station to playing checkers and eating my grandmother's chocolate chip cookies. Things are the same, different cats around, though. But... They're not the same, either. My grandfather had laryngeal cancer for a couple years, last year he had his voice box taken out. He has a prosthesis now, but it's difficult for him. I can see his frustration. He's been bugging me for years to move back... And I feel like I'm disappointing him for being unable to. 

My hometown is rough. My dad lives here too, and his lifestyle would leave most people scarred for life. I wonder if I am, sometimes, but I know I'm stronger than that. But it's so very difficult seeing him. When you're the child of an addict, it'll never be easy seeing your parent. But he's slowly getting his life together. He just got an apartment, he's moving in tomorrow. He's on the methadone programme, he's now hep c free. I am proud of him for finally trying to make a change in his life. And he's finally seeing his life differently, too. 

I have a lot of feelings about my time here. It's simultaneously too long and not long enough. I got to finally connect with my great aunt. She was a lovely lady. I've been overwhelmed by how proud everyone is of me...

Tomorrow morning I depart. Off to see my mum two provinces away. I'll be with her for five days. I haven't seen her in a year and a half. She's bought a house and she wants me to know I'll always have a home with her. She has half of my belongings there with her. I'm so excited to be with her. She's my rock in life, she knows me better than anyone else. I've missed her so much, too. I don't care if we do nothing but enjoy each other's company the entire time. I don't need to do things, just vibe it out and have good conversations. 

A week from today I'll be leaving my momma bear. I hope to get a job that has a break at Christmas so I can go back to see her. I'm going to Montréal to visit my girlfriend. Legasp! I have a girlfriend.

After five years of singledom, I finally found a partner that is so very sweet. I'm flying across my country to visit her for eight days. I'm learning Spanish since English is her second (/third?) language. It's been a crazy time in my life, but she's chosen to spend this time with me. She saw me and just thought I was so beautiful. It took us a while to finally connect, but when we did... It's been electric since she kissed me on the dance floor. I know it's all still new and there's the whole honeymoon period, but she's rocked my world in a truly unforgettable way. I'm cherishing this for as long as I can. This will be a lovely memory for years to come, going to a city I've been dying to visit for ten years, being in the arms of my beloved.

She didn't know if a relationship could work beyond a couple weeks. We were both seasonal workers at a hotel in the mountains. We only had two weeks left of the season before we got together. I had suggested we keep seeing each other long distance, but she couldn't see how that would work. I told her I wouldn't be able to sleep with anyone for a long time after she left. I told her that I would commit to her, if she would want. At the time she said we could date until she left.

 She still calls me her girlfriend, and we text everyday. It's been a couple weeks since the season ended. A few days ago she told me she loves me. That we have to talk about it when we're in person. I feel this will be a pivotal time in my life. I see her for eight days. Then she's visiting me in my new home in the mountains for seven days. I never thought I'd be in a long distance relationship. Nor feel so strongly to be in a committed relationship. 

I know I'm young, I've slept with a lot of people. But I don't want that anymore. I've had too much meaningless (and terrible) sex to let this go. I've never been with a woman whose libido is as high as mine, perhaps even higher hahaha. I guess having an emotional bond makes the sex better. We've been vulnerable together. I've made terrible mistakes in my past relationships, and over the last five years I've fled prospective ones at any sign of dishonesty, or getting too intimate or vulnerable too fast. I have cheated in the past, but I think I've matured. The idea of sleeping with anyone else just feels wrong. I don't know what the future holds, but I know she's a very big part of my present. I can hope that this lasts, but I know I can't expect it to. So I will love her as fiercely as I can now, and if that turns out to be for a long time, I will enjoy every moment of it~",30Oct2018,1

26,"I suspect I have PMDD. It’s always difficult to fight through this one week a month. I used to vent to my boyfriend about it, but we broke up before I went off to college. 

Soon after that, I realized that nobody else cares about how sad/depressed/suicidal I’m feeling. My friends ignore it whenever I give hints about it, trying to imply that I can’t be alone right now and they’ll just move on with the conversation or send a couple memes to make my statement seem ignored. 

And whenever I try and talk about it online, nobody will respond. Online therapy things where people just listen don’t work. They just leave after they get bored. 

I’m going to a doctor soon to get on birth control to try and fix this, but I want to talk to my ex and have him help me feel better. I don’t know if I should. I just feel so ignored and I don’t know what to do. 

People always tell me that I’m not alone in all this, but honestly, I really am. I broke up with the one person who understood me and helped me. And my friends don’t think I should talk to him ever again. I don’t know what to do to stop feeling alone and ignored. Maybe I deserve to be alone and to suffer like this...

I can't help but feel guilty about the expense, even though I can afford it.  I shouldn't feel that way though; I may always want something but I rarely go spending large sums of money and like I said I can afford it.  Also If I want something I can't stop obsessing over it till I get it.

I'm a college student and I'm pretty good friends with people in a certain fraternity. It isn't unheard of for me to stay the night after the bars on someones couch because I don't want to walk home late at night, but that includes me having to leave in the morning wearing what I wore the night before. Well, this certain instance when I was leaving the next morning (shoes in hand and all) I got caught on streetview on Google Maps. This night was over a semester ago but no one noticed till now, and someone I don't know tweeted it. Everyone knows that it's me, and people are retweeting it. I am so embarrassed, because I already have the reputation of a ""party girl"" but I've been since trying to get away from it because I wasn't happy with it.

29,"I am not sure if this healthy psychologically but this is helping me a lot nowadays. After getting rejected on relationships and career, getting over and moving on is certainly hard to do. Recently, I was aiming for a job on a prestigious company. Prepared thoroughly for the exam and interview but failed to get even a single phone call. Obviously, I was frustrated and sad (a little bit, even now).  What I did was too think of reasons why I woudn't be happy if I landed the job. (e.g stressful work environment, elitist people, demanding  managers, the company wasn't even that good for my line of work).  Then there is this relationship I want to build but didn't pan out because of infidelity. My initial thoughts was to blame myself. Why didn't I invest time on the relationship, what was I lacking that the other didn't?  Then I changed my thoughts to gratitude. Thankful that this happened before any serious commitment happened.The relationship would have been bad because she is demanding and controlling. (Seeing her picture nowadays, I even wonder what attracted me to her :))  Repeated these thoughts whenever I feel any negative feelings and really helped me think moved on and be thankful. And being thankful is always a good thing. So sour graping? Yeah. It is good? I think so.

At the time I never thought much about it. Growing up I’d have some friends ask why we had different last names and I’d explain. Still never really bothered me. 

But a few days ago my bf’s mom asked me and I told her. Due to the fact that I’m from a different culture she asked if that was the reason. To the best of my knowledge no. It’s not cultural custom. 

So it got me thinking and wondering why she did it

33,"Hey all. It's hard huh. These events that happened. My 8 year relationship ending, getting 3 girls numbers and they end up ghosting/rejecting me. My grades suffering because of difficulty of my classes in university. My mother losing her vision. The loss of all my friends over the course of 4 years. The side effects of prescription medication and the harrowing withdrawal symptoms if I don't take them. The overwhelming tide of the future and my fear of being rejected as a person.

I want to be tenacious.

I'm sure you all had difficulty too. More or less like me, just need an output. Please understand though, expressing condescending comments and comparing your situation will not provide the consequences you desire. We are all in pain in some way. If you reach out, that can significantly boost your mood and provide a foundation for a support system. It hurts. It really does. Even with my doses of antidepressants and antipsychotics doubling or tripling, I want to get better.

 It's been 4-5 years since I felt happy. I feel time leaking away from me and I regret it. The chances I have taken aren't fruitful. It's as if the actions I do won't take me anywhere; but, it annoys me to high hell if I don't do diddily shit so I'm gonna keep getting rejected, I'm gonna keep racking my head in my studies. I'm going to keep reaching out to people even if I know I will be rejected as a person. It's alright though.

37,"Alright, so, I've been very introverted my whole life. Something clicked this year and I've been changing to hang out more with friends. I still live with my mother and a friend of hers together, and I will probably not be able to move out any time soon, as I'm planning on improving my education first instead of making money. 

My mother has been depressed for a long time now (she's 48) and has been on anti-depressants and in therapy on and off. A couple years back she lost her mother to cancer, and I'm now her only living relative, so she clings onto me like crazy because she fears that something will happen to me. I know she tries to stay strong and let me live my life, but sometimes she just snaps, and it's incredibly hard for me, because I feel trapped.

 I've been looking for good therapist for her, and she always agreed to seeing a therapist. But yesterday she said that she doesn't want to see a therapist and to leave that decision to her, just as she leaves my decision to go out with friends, despite her being scared, to me. She also lists that the cost to go to the therapist is too high (public transportation) for us to afford it as a reason, and that she is scared to go there alone. I offered to go with her, but she said that I couldn't do that every time there's an appointment and that it would drive up the cost to get there even higher. I tried finding a therapist that's closer, but to no avail.

On top of that we're living in Germany and with media fear-mongering 24/7 because of immigrants her fear is up to 11. (thanks a lot, media)

I just feel at a loss. I want to help her. I want her to feel better, and secure. I don't wanna feel trapped or guilty for going out. What am I to do?",30Oct2018,1
38," **I am a short guy, about 5'4, and I was wondering if it was more acceptable for a short guy, like me, to hit a woman, around 5'7 and up, back? I am asking this because a man hitting a woman is looked down about in U.S. culture due to men being physically superior to women, but short guys are seen as inferior compared to their taller male counterparts; if a woman is taller/ bigger than the guy, is it really that wrong or considered that much of a social deviance especially if the woman physically attacked him first?**",30Oct2018,1

On the other hand in countries like the USA we have an abundance of food but for not for the poor lol. It's very hard to eat healthy when groceries can cost so much but fast food is cheap... but what's the first thing we do when we see a fat person? Mock them of course...

I also think it would be super great if this country had nutrition classes in school and maybe even gardening, learn how to plant and harvest your own vegetables so you don't have to rely on going to the store, but seriously I didn't learn what calories are until bio in high school and it's pretty depressing to see parents (usually with a lower income) feed their kids nothing but junk",30Oct2018,1

44,"BIG TRIGGER WARNING!!!
Suicide/drugs 



Assisted suicide:

I got in for an assisted suicide. I’m alone. Dad is busy on his phone and at work to spend my final hours with me. Mom is busy doing something..she’s upset and doesn’t want me to go. I’m scared it’s going to hurt. But I remember thinking “I’m so excited to finally find out what happens after we die” I feel very high but happy. I cry a lot.. I meet someone else doing it and he tells me not to worry. I meet another girl and she’s pretty but doesn’t like me much. Me and boy kiss. We spend our finally hours together. I try to call grandma and grandpa but phone doesn’t/ can’t dial the number. (Coworker) text me on Xbox and jokingly asked “it’s dark (it wasn’t) is anyone working” I tell her what I’m doing and she gets upset and said “this makes everything so much worse” Me and boy go out and get even more high.. We have a great time and makes me feel safe and happy. We were going to die in each other’s arms. On our way back I think he dies before me because my dream changed to having (sister) and (childhood best friend) in the back of the parking lot where me and boy were just at. They kept throwing my phones and items in the water. I was angry.. i just wanted to enjoy my final moments. The sunset is beautiful. The most beautiful I’ve ever seen earth. I feel like I’m going, the walls slowly closing around me. I try to take a photo on my phone just for one last goodbye and (sister) jumped in front of it and wouldn’t move. I just wanted a photo. I get up and bite her to move and (Best friend) shuts a garage like door. I try and rip it open because I want to see that beautiful sky before I go. I get one panel off and the life floods from my eyes. I’m finally at peace. 





Not really sure why I had this dream.. I felt happy and at peace until I woke up. I was sad and bitter. I know I need to get help I would never really kill myself.. but I definitely didn’t have any regrets in the dream. Also very sorry if the writing Is bad I wrote this still half asleep and sobbing but i needed to remember this dream.. ",30Oct2018,1
45,"It's been a few years since I've realized it.
I've always been very depressed and anxious, and it turned me into that quiet person who would always listen and not add much to the conversation out of fear of saying something dumb.
But recently, in moments of bravery, where I wanted to say something, I couldn't, because I've never got anything useful or relevant to add or to talk about.
So, I'm boring: I'm not funny, I've got no deep knowledge of any subject whatsoever, I can't keep up with a simple conversation, I've got no cool hobbies to talk about.
I just can't keep a conversation going, my mind is blank. There are times where my mind is literally blank, not even thinking about anything.
I think my depression harmed me in a way people don't usually talk about. It may have made me dumber: it changed my mentality so I would either think ""it's not worth thinking about it"" or ""I'm dumb, it's better if I let other people think about it"", and now I unlearned how to think. Stuff people comprehend easily, became very difficult to me.
Anyway, the bottom line is I'm boring, I've got nothing to say about anything. 
I'm pretty sure no one cares about some random internet person's problems, and probably no ones gonna read this, but the reason I'm writing this is because last year I was dating this girl, who suddenly decided to not see me anymore, and it may be because I'm boring.
Now, I'm seeing this other girl, who's very energetic, talks a lot, and I think she's already getting bored of me, and I'm spending my whole day thinking how not to be boring.

46,"So I’ve been focusing a lot on improving myself over the last couple of years. I go to the gym pretty often, read all the time, try harder in class, go out more, etc. While I have a little more confidence, one thing that just never happens is any sort of success in relationships. While I realise this isn’t the ultimate goal of life, I’m 20 now and it would be nice to have some kind of romantic life happening. The thing is that no matter how much I improve myself, I have a fucking laundry list of defects as to why it doesn’t happen for me, and I think most of it stems from a lack of self-confidence that I just don’t know how to fix.

I am terrible at picking up hints that someone is flirting with me (I’ve had friends ask me at the end of nights out why the fuck I haven’t made moves on girls who I thought were just having a polite conversation with me, but who it was clear to them were blatantly flirting with me). I suppose I’ve been so used to the idea of girls not being interested that now that it happens a little more, I just subconsciously think it must not be real and must be like a big joke. Even when it’s so obvious that even I notice it, I internally freak the fuck out and kinda sabotage myself, and try defuse any sexual tension. Things go fantastic until the point I get a big enough hint that basically says ‘I totally want to hook up with you tonight’. I have literally stopped talking to girls before when I realise it’s happening. I have no fucking idea why I do this, it’s like I’m scared of the thought of getting with a girl. Like when it becomes a realistic possibility I get terrified and inevitably fuck it up, even though I obviously want it to happen. It’s so bad that the one night I made out with a girl I was black out drunk, and she told me at a later date that she actually had to tell me to kiss her because I still wouldn’t take the fucking hint.

Two videos I think really sum it up in a pretty funny way is the [‘Is She Into You’ Casually Explained video](https://youtu.be/xa-4IAR_9Yw) and the [Fallon clip when Nicole Kidman tells him he could have got with her](https://youtu.be/qtsNbxgPngA). I see so much of myself in both of those that it physically hurts. A girl could literally be in my room, in my bed, and I’d still be questioning what the fuck is going on and whether I should do something, but still be terrified at the thought. I’m scared that I’m gonna grow up and look back at all these opportunities and hate myself for it, but I’m just so scared of rejection and intimacy at this point and I honestly just don’t know how to fix it. No amount of going to the gym, reading, or self-improvement fixes this fundamental lack of self confidence at all.

So really my question is how can I stop being so damn scared of all this, and be more confident in myself? People say ‘just go for it’ but honestly it’s such a deep rooted fear that it seems basically impossible. Taking better care of myself doesn’t actually address the underlying issue that for some reason I just feel like I don’t deserve to get with anyone, it’s completely fucking ridiculous. I wish I knew how to fix it, but I honestly don’t have a clue at all.

It’s really a wonder how people with college degrees can be so... socially unaware, or incapable of understanding social queues (ie. the right/wrong time to say a certain thing).

For the past three months, I’ve had to hear from our receptionist about this huge, ridiculous breakup and ensuing actions between she and her boyfriend. She doesn’t even begin to realize or entertain the fact that she is the insane one out of them! I’m new at the office but apparently this woman has been in this unhealthy relationship for years and constantly talks about it. During breakups, she contacts men who she knows will spoil her just to send pics and such to her boyfriend. So after three months of shit talking this guy, today she comes in and says she’s going on a trip with him and his parents... Oh, the same mom that just a week ago you told me was filing a restraining order on you?

Why does she feel comfortable blabbing about her life issues? If I had anything close to this going on in my life, I would make sure people didn’t know about it! I get so frustrated and so much secondhand embarrassment from listening to her.

Another coworker has been complaining about the holiday party being scheduled during his time off since it was scheduled about a month ago. Nonstop bitching.

I mean, where do you get off coming into work, having to say something about the damn party every day when you know full well you’ll be in paradise on the other side of the world?

So this post really is mostly venting, but I can’t take it anymore. I have such a friendly, positive demeanor, and I think it invites people like them to complain to me about what they deem to be frustrating.

I have lost my best friend. He has been the single most important and trustworthy person of my life for a good 6-7 years of my life. I am bipolar so he has been there for me when I'm really depressed and can't find a reason to live as well as when I'm being maniac and partying too much and making some stupid decisions, he has always been there looking after me and taking care of me. I understand this must've been really tiring for him.

At some point he developed some feelings for me and he had quite a strong crush on me and we spent occasional nights together, especially when I was feeling bad and needed someone there. I also had some feelings for him but I made it clear that I don't want a relationship with him because the friendship we had was worth too much for me to risk and he was always fine with that and agreed.

I spent the summer away and we saw once during summer when he came to visit me and we went to a festival together to see my favourite band. When I came back after summer he was being weird. He didn't answer to any of my messages, he never had the time to see me when I asked and he kind of completely ignored me. After about a month I found out from a mutual friend that he had started to date someone and after that I heard from a few people that he had been talking shit about me and comparing me to his new girlfriend, like how she is so much better than me. 

Not many things have hurt as much as this did. I guess it was only me who considered our friendship worth something. The second he found a gf I was worth nothing to him, he didn't even bother to tell me and I think you're supposed to tell you're good friends things like that. He just completely shut me out of his life. 

I'm so sad and so angry. I always considered him to be my best friend, the one person I could ALWAYS trust, no matter what. I cry almost every night, I sometimes get these sudden feelings of anger and rage and I'm constantly having nightmares about him. I have no idea how to deal with this. I have told him how I feel and he said sorry and that was it.

What can I do? How can I get over this? I'm happy that he's in a happy relationship, I'm only hurt because he didn't tell me and shut me out of his life without any warning.

62,"I don’t really know where else to post this, I just feel so nervous and panicked, as if I’m just wasting time right now. There really isn’t a point to this post, I’m honestly just so.. scared that I need to vent. Excuse me. 

Just about the only thing I know about college is that it’s the level of education above high school, it’s extremely stressful to apply to, and there are a variety of different types in terms of location, housing, and majors. 

Other than that, I am completely lost. I go to a rather high ranked public school and every single one of my peers are looking into what colleges they want to go to, picking safety schools, comparing SAT and ACT scores, asking what majors everyone’s interested in..

I, on the other hand, have not studied for either ACT nor SAT (although I’ve taken the PSAT because my peers tell me it’s just good to do.. it was fairly easy? Makes me nervous because maybe I did things wrong lol) and I loosely know what “major I want to go into”, if that’s the correct wording- Game art, or at the very least something to do with art. 

I feel utterly lost and hopeless, because every time I try to search up specific schools or just “art school” all these terms come up that I really don’t understand, and google search just confuses me more because every site just assumes I should know what these terms mean. Things like bachelors degree, masters degrees; BFA? MA? Undergraduate? Graduate? What’s all that? What is considered as an expensive school? How would my living situation work if I don’t live near home? What’s the difference between a major and a minor? Should I be hiring a college “helper” (assistant? tutor?)? Is it okay if I only take the ACT? What even is the difference between the ACT and the SAT? My senior friends just finished submitting early applications (is that what it’s called..?), what are those? And then what’s early action? What about supplemental essays for admissions? Is there any difference between that and normal college essays? What about the common apps that r/applyingtocollege (or some subreddit) hates so much, what are those? And in regards to prestigious colleges, I’ve heard somewhere that going to one doesn’t necessarily mean you have a higher chance of getting a job; is that true? If it is true, then why do so many people apply to such high ranked colleges in the first place (if their end goal is to earn a career that they like)? What is the difference between just a regular college and a university?

And in relation to art, I’m mildly interested in game art, but so far everything I’ve seen leads to game design and programming and such, when all I’m interested in is the illustration of game environments and character designs. Since I have no experience in 3D modeling, does my ‘major’ description even exist? Or do I have to learn 3D modeling and programming to go into the gaming industry? Actually, is what I’m describing just illustration? I’ve seen some colleges that have a drawing major and an illustration major; what’s the difference?

I apologize for the lack of organization and panicked tone of this entire post. 

I’ve literally vomited out every single question that I currently have on mind, and there’s probably still more. A lot of them are google-able and I will actually just go down my block of questions and google them once I’ve calmed down a bit, but can anyone tell me any of their personal experiences with college? The process of applying, going to college, prepping for college.. any of the sort, please.

I picked it up and looked at it before realizing what it was, then very quickly put it back.
Considering the closest security cameras are on the roof of the library which is 5 stories tall, I figure out a distance it could look like maybe I'm the one putting the posters in the newspaper stand.
Should be I be concerned? The email said they currently don't suspect anybody from the campus doing it, they are still investigating the possibility of that. I guess it just ticks me to think I might be considered a suspect.

It’s interesting too because I only work 3 8 hour shifts maximum per week or a 12 hour shift and 2 8 hour shifts due to how bad my anxiety has gotten. I use to work 3 12’s for years until I just simply couldn’t. Part of it is the job and part of it is I just don’t want to be around anyone sometimes even though my coworkers and I get a long really, really well. The days I work 12’s are the days I sit and watch telemetry.

I don’t know what to do and I almost feel like any job would make me feel this way. I need help...

EDIT: I’d also like to add that it’s much worse when I have to work consecutive days in a row. I fall into an anxious depression and am so horrible to be around. ",30Oct2018,1
78,"Alright, so, I've been very introverted my whole life. Something clicked this year and I've been changing to hang out more with friends. I still live with my mother and a friend of hers together, and I will probably not be able to move out any time soon, as I'm planning on improving my education first instead of making money.

My mother has been depressed for a long time now (she's 48) and has been on anti-depressants and in therapy on and off. A couple years back she lost her mother to cancer, and I'm now her only living relative, so she clings onto me like crazy because she fears that something will happen to me. I know she tries to stay strong and let me live my life, but sometimes she just snaps, and it's incredibly hard for me, because I feel trapped.

I've been looking for a good therapist for her, and she always agreed to seeing a therapist. But yesterday she said that she doesn't want to see a therapist and to leave that decision to her, just as she leaves my decision to go out with friends, despite her being scared, to me. She also lists that the cost to go to the therapist is too high (public transportation) for us to afford it as a reason, and that she is scared to go there alone. I offered to go with her, but she said that I couldn't do that every time there's an appointment and that it would drive up the cost to get there even higher. I tried finding a therapist that's closer, but to no avail. She also says that her enduring me going out so often is already like therapy.

On top of that we're living in Germany and with media fear-mongering 24/7 because of immigrants her fear is up to 11. (thanks a lot, media)

I just feel at a loss. I want to help her. I want her to feel better, and secure. I don't wanna feel trapped or guilty for going out. What am I to do?

80,"I thought I would be fine, but now that I am left alone with my thoughts it is hitting me like an avalanche. I don't like this. 

I had the date all planned out. We would go together after work to the art gallery for a photography exibit because she casually mentioned that she is into photography. She would show up dressed up and I wouldn't care if she wore sweatpants and hoodies. Afterwards we would head to a vegetarian restaurant recommended by a coworker because she is vegetarian and it is the best vegetarian restaurant he knows. It would be rainy that day and I was looking forward share my umbrella with her, she would be standing on my left and my right side would be wet. At the restaurant I would be telling this story of this girl I met at work that I have a crush on which is just her but in third person. Afterwards I would walk her home, make sure she gets home safe and end the night with a parting hug and a kiss on the forehead. In the morning, since I get to work before she does, Ill leave a cup of her favorite coffee at her desk with a note underneath. 

That was the plan, and at this point will remain just so, and nothing more. ",30Oct2018,1
81,"Today I got in a fight with a petite guy. Petite until he threw his shirt off. Yep. I was not expecting that. He was loaded, but I still thought I could take him. After a couple punches and being thrown, literally thrown, across the field was when I finally realized: ""maybe I didn't gain as much muscle as I thought I did."" It was still a good fight, I got in some punches and I wrestled him until he was out of breath, but the thing was, I used up so much energy wrestling him, when he threw me off and started punching again my defences failed in the midst of fatigue. After that he lunged for me, picked me up and threw me to the other side of the globe. This was when it was really done. The audience cheered. And when I got back up, it was only to come slamming down again. Only this time it was done by an audience member. 

Now, hours after this, every single muscle in my body aches. Especially my legs. I'm not surprised. My face is now decorated with marks and I have a swollen eye. Do you people have any tips for recovery? Everything hurts.

82,"“Often, it’s not about becoming a new person, but becoming the person you were meant to be, and already are, but don’t know how to be.”
― Heath L. Buckmaster, Box of Hair: A Fairy Tale

Oftentimes I hear women voice that they want to become a new person. We strive to be someone that is perfect or close to it. You are already beautiful as you are. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be better. We are steady looking for ways to improve ourselves. There is absolutely nothing wrong with having personal goals. My question to you is at what point will you accept yourself. At what point will you love the person you are. Take a moment to adore who you are, right now. Self acceptance is crucial to being happy, to feeling free. Without self love you will always search high and low for approval or love in the darkest places.[yatese](https://yatese.com/all-articles/self-acceptance)

Over the last couple years, every time I go to a funeral or a viewing, I find myself compulsively taking a few swings of vodka before hand. I realize how disrespectful this is. I realize how terrible of thing this is to do, yet I can’t stop it. Maybe I’m afraid of dying myself, and this is my coping mechanism. Who knows. Maybe it’s just my closeted alcoholism getting worse and worse.

85,Why would you even pretend that such a cheese fungus stench is even remotely pleasant. I like cheese. I like onions (red ones at least) but trying to put those two things together in a taste is fucking stupid. It stinks. Every bite is an effort to resist the gag reflex because i want that crispy goodness and i'm prepared to suffer the foul stench of a cheese and onion crisp. That is what they are. The reject stink crisp that no one wants and will only eat reluctantly. So of course some knobs have to pretend they 'totally like' the taste. Fuck those people. And fuck cheese and onion. All hail the master taste Salt and Vinegar! ,30Oct2018,1

87,"1. Set an achievable savings goal for every month/paycheque/etc. and do not do any unessential spending until you hit the goal.  The goal doesn't have to be consistent, as long as you can reach it.
2. When you see something you want, walk away from it and distract yourself.  If the item is stuck in your head ask yourself the following:  Is the item good quality?  Is it useful at all?  Is there a cheaper substitute?  Should you save for something better?  Why do you really want it?  Will the item really satisfy you?  Do you have room for it ?  Will you feel bad for spending the money later?  If it feels tedious asking all these and any other pertinent questions the item is not worth your money because whatever you had to do to get the money was harder than asking simple questions.
3. As soon as you want something, imagine if you were called into work at that moment.  Would you take the extra work to afford it?  If not you clearly don't  really want the thing.  Imagine that the work would earn you exactly the cost of the item you want.  Would you accept the item in place of the money?  If not, it isn't worth your money because it clearly isn't worth the time and effort used to earn your money.

90,"Hi everyone! This post will bounce around a little; it's going to cover a few things with the over-arching theme being moving away from abusive parents.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me quickly say something as a background... I'm 25 years old now, with a newly started business that I spent a lot to create, mostly out of interest in it as a hobby. I put \~$25,000 into it, as start-up cost, in order to do what I love, and I work at an automotive dealership earning minimum wage. I know that my second career, my business, being as seasonal as it is (think something like landscape, there are way more customers in summer time than winter, except it's even worse...)  


Anyways, I am working these two jobs to try to get my life started. No savings, I'm doing a charity donation soon ($1500), and buying a car soon, too. $5000 in debt, approximately already. This is even while living at home with parents; I paid the start-up costs of my business out of pocket. The business is now becoming profitable but that's not much, it's more for the passion of it. It will take years for the start-up costs to be covered, but it's okay.

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is, I've met the woman I'm going to be with forever, and we both want to move out. She lives with her parents. She's in better financial shape, owning a car and \~$16,000 in savings. But, she's not moving anywhere yet until she lands a full-time job in my city. She currently lives in the next city over, on the far side (\~40 minute drive,) and has a part-time job, also paying minimum wage.

&amp;#x200B;

But, my parents are pushing me to a point where I really can't stand being around them; their abuse (emotional, verbal, financial) is taking its toll on me and her. It's bad. I can't stand being near my father and want to move out badly. I just don't have the funds for it... Need to get out of debt, pay the charitable donation I promised (I'm not going to not do this, it's the most important thing in my life so far), and need to get a car, need to pay first &amp; last... It's going to take so long!  


I really want to know if there are better options for how to move out than just saving and living through the abuse my parents are putting me through... I know that I need to save for a long time in order to move out, but, man, I need out of this abuse.",30Oct2018,1
