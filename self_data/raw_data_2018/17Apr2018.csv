2,"For about five years after college I was in a relationship with a girl I met around graduation. We lived together in the same apartment for most of our relationship and it was pretty serious. At one point I was very close to proposing, but held off and eventually she broke up with me at one of the lowest points of my life. 

After we broke up, she started up her own business (funded by her parents), and out of curiosity I decided to look up her business (it's been about 2-3 years) to see how it was going. Turns out the reviews are almost entirely 1 and 2 stars, with everyone saying how much they hate my ex-girlfriend but sometimes giving more than one star since they liked her employees. 

You'd think I would feel happy about people hating on my ex but I actually find it heartbreaking. One person described her as the most vile, arrogant, and manipulative person she'd ever met. Other people called her lazy, inexperienced, unqualified, cold, socially awkward, painful to speak with, passive aggressive, and accused her of gas-lighting them and lying with a straight face. 

I really loved my ex at one time, and spent more of my adult life with her than anyone else so I have to wonder what that says about me. I know my ex has her flaws, but she's also had a tough life and has dealt with a lot of tragedy and disappointment, as well as physical and mental illness, which I think really changed her. 

I wouldn't ever want to get back with her, but it hurts to see how other people perceive her... they never saw the side that I saw. It also makes me wonder what other people would say if they could anonymously review me--I know there are definitely people who would have negative things to say. :/",17Apr2018,429
3,"Throwaway.

I'm a college senior geek. 21 years old. Graduating in May, with honors.

I was always very shy throughout college, and I'm sick of being such a coward, so I decided to try to get over my shyness in an extreme way - by spending spring break, by myself, at a nudist resort.

I'm only about 5'7, not fat but a ""studies while eating Doritos"" belly on a geek who never hits up the gym. Glasses. Hair parted to the side. 

I walked up to the resort one afternoon wearing my casual clothes, and expecting a barrage of nude people when I threw open the doors. Instead, there was a long corridor leading to a front desk where a very cute (and very CLOTHED) 28 year old female stood.

She took my information and then said ""You can go into one of those rooms to undress and I'll get your room key when you get out.""

I turned and saw the small room. Then realized I was going to have to strip butt-naked and parade in front of this girl.

I started hemming and hawwing. Then decided to chicken out.

She said ""Well, that's okay, you didn't seem like the type to do something like this anyway.""

That really upset me. And I wanted to prove her wrong. So I went into the soft-purple-colored dressing room. I took a deep breath, and I undressed.

First my sneakers. Then my button-down shirt, which I placed down on the chair and folded. Then my khaki pants joined the pile. 

Standing in only my white undershirt, my light-green boxers and my Hanes socks, I was getting more and more nervous. 

I removed my socks, then my undershirt. And then grabbed the waistband of my undies.

I couldn't remove them. This was my last shred of dignity. The last vestige of modesty I had left.

Then I imagined how embarrassing it would be to FULLY chicken out and leave clothed now.

I took a deep breath, and I stripped off my boxers.

I was naked.

More naked than Adam in the Garden of Eden, who at least had a fig leaf.

More naked than the trees outside, which were at least clothed in leaves.

I blushed pink as I saw my glasses-clad only reflection in the full-length mirror.

Protected only by my body hair like an animal. Just a smattering of hair on my chest, and my (blush) pubic hair.

My chubby belly, well-hidden by my shirt, now exposed for all to see.

I turned to see my ""bubble butt"", as my friend Ashley back home seemed to love teasing I was ""hiding"" under my ""nerdi khakis"" all the time. That butt was very round, very white and very much jiggled at my every move. Shudder.

And there it was, right in front of me. My limp penis, bare for the world to see. Only 3 inches when limp. I subconsciously covered, then let go. I would definitely stand out if I covered.

Feeling more vulnerable than ever, I turned the doorknob. Then stopped.

Then paced around the small room, giving myself a pep talk. ""They see naked people every day. Nobody will notice. You can do this!""

I turned and opened the door and quickly closed it. Was that a giggle I just heard from the front desk? Nah, must be my imagination.

Finally, I steeled myself, closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and walked straight out into the open hallway, as naked as the day I was born.

I felt a WHOOSH of air conditioning across my exposed penis and balls, and my bare ass behind me.

I walked slowly up to the front desk, seeing a very detectable SMIRK across the front desk girl. Was she...gosh...checking me out?

My penis slightly flapping in front of me, and my buns jiggling behind me, I never felt more exposed and vulnerable in my life.

After a noticeable glance directly down, the front desk girl turned to get my room key, which was taking FOREVER.

I stood there at the desk, in my birthday suit, feeling goosebumps everywhere, feeling so exposed. Finally, I heard more guests coming. 

A laughing group of 40-45 year olds. 3 women and 2 men. They were fully clothed, not yet checked in. Definitely had a few drinks.

One of the women said ""Oh boy, looks like this jaybird couldn't wait! He just stripped down to his bare white BOO-TAY already!""

I squirmed and didn't turn around. Then I turned to the left, and saw a resort worker carelessly grab everything I owned - all of my clothes, tossing them in her bin, ruining my neat pile, as well as my wallet, cell phone and keys. 

Leaving me TRULY stripped bare.

I subconsciously covering my penis with one hand as the front desk girl handed me my key.

As I walked towards the outdoors into the sunshine, I felt her gaze on my jiggling white butt as I traipsed into the (surprisingly a little chilly) sunny resort.

Again, out of instinct, I placed one hand, palm facing out, to pathetically hide my butt-crack from view as she noticeably giggled.

I begged by the next day to come home, embarrassing myself even more than I was before I showed up.

""Please, PLEASE process it and get my CLOTHES!"" at the front desk, covering my balls with my hands.

""One minute, Lady Godiva"", the laughing receptionist replied.

Even worse? My mom got my credit card statement sent to her house, and now once I return home from school, the fact that James of all people went to a NAKED resort will be the topic of all my family.",17Apr2018,0
4,"I had my heart broken by my best friend. He was always there for me as I was for him. We just understood each other. Next thing I know, I realized that I had feelings for him. Big time. It's been a month since I told him my feelings and since he broke my heart by being a dick about the whole thing. I'm still having a hard time getting over it. How do you get over someone? What's worked best for you? ",17Apr2018,1
6,"I don't ever want to do anything that makes your life easier. I'm even ready to throw my life away just to prevent you from feeling good about me. I don't ever want you to feel proud of me. 

You have no idea how much damage you caused me by convincing me that I'm lazy. You had no trust in me, so then I didn't trust myself. When confronted with a long-term task I thought ""I can't do it because I'm lazy. I'll just give up because I'm lazy. What's the point in trying?""  You called me ""lazy"" so many times throughout my life. It was as if it was your job to call me that word. If only you were lazy when it came to that job. You did a good job at making me internalize that word as part of my identity. I might as well write it down on my resume. 

Just thinking of that word makes me explode with anger because I can still hear you say it.

I'm convinced that's the only thing you think of when you see me. That's why I don't ever want to eat at the table or do anything where you can see me. I can't be around you because you make me feel worthless. I can't remember you ever saying something positive about me. 

I notice that you call me lazy only when I don't do what you want me to do. I've noticed that when I work hard towards my own goals I'm actually willing to do a lot of work. Remember when I read a hundred pages almost every single day one summer? No? What about when I spend all day writing about something I care about? Or what about the my ""run at least a mile a day"" challenge? You just don't notice because you either don't like or don't care about my own goals. Or maybe you don't notice because I don't go out of my way to tell you about them, which gets me to my previous point: I don't want you to feel proud of me. The moment you start feeling proud of me I have a strong need to stop doing that thing. 

You are the least charitable person when it comes to interpreting who I am and why I do (or don't do) things. You see me not doing what you tell me to do and simply conclude ""I'm lazy"" when you could have also concluded ""maybe he has a need for his own autonomy and is willing to absorb punishments to preserve it. Wow he has such a strong will"" or ""maybe he wants his giving to come from the heart and so he doesn't like it when he is forced to do favors"" 

Here's another interpretation: I'm not lazy, I just hated this life and I didn't see hard work leading to anything good. Maybe if you showed me that life could be wonderful, I'd be more willing to work for it. Instead, all you've shown me is that hard work will lead to your miserable life. I thought, ""I see you and dad work hard all the time and you guys don't seem to be any happier, so what's the point?"" I saw hard work as pointless and endless. I wasn't being lazy, I was being rational. At least to the extent that a kid could be rational. You did so much to give me what you thought I needed to be happy but the most important thing I desperately needed was to see you happy. 

Maybe if you were more curious about your own son and not so quick at diagnosing me, you would notice these underlying truths. Then you would be able to fix the problem instead of spewing damaging words at me. Every time you made a negative judgement of me, you were closing an opportunity for connection. This connection would have ironically made it more likely for you to get what you were seeking. That's tragic isn't it?",17Apr2018,1

Over spring break we had a great time out at a casino for a weekend, and at an aquarium with friends during the week with a “sleepover” party that same night. But when break ended, life resumed faster than he anticipated. Tonight he hit another rough patch and got angry with his family because they’re too controlling, which I agree with. Almost every night at 11:11 I make a wish for him to be better, idk why. I don’t really believe that stuff works but it helps me feel better sometimes, especially when it seems to “work.” 

Tonight I missed 11:11 by a minute and I feel kinda bad because this is one of the nights he needs that “wish” the most. Other than this rambling, can anyone give ideas to help me cheer him up?

13,"They say people who could be saints to you in the office, gym or grocery store turn into absolute monsters when they get behind the wheel of a car.

I second that to when they move in next to you.

My mom's stories were countless. A lady was jealous of my mother buying a house across the street that was nicer then hers, so she put poison in the lawn to kill her dogs, throw baseballs at her son with derogatory slurs written on them, threw broken glass into her backyard, even tried to get her fired from her job by calling up with multiple ""anonymous"" complaints. I remember when I was little, she enlisted my mom's driveway to her block party guests and sometimes the street as well. I even caught them dumping trash into her lawn until mom received complaints on THEIR behalf, but this was the end of the feud, and they moved away when I was 10 or so...

And today, I have a senile old lady who digs through my trash, I just discovered that she ripped open one of my delivered packages and removed the contents.

There is even a reality show called ""The Nightmare Next Door"", up on its 3rd or 4th season full of content, where neighbors have had disputes turning into fires or pulling a weapon or assorted attempts of assault/harassment, with modest replies from police and usually five or six family members to chime in on the victimized families.

I know these things can be over-dramatized, but its not unlikely. Almost all of our family has had bad experiences with neighbors, and neighbors can do some off-the-rails things in general, or take simple disputes to life-threatening heights just because someone built a fence a few inches too close to their lawn.

Any ideas why?

14,"I'm tired of working so damn hard all the time. I'm tired of hearing ""It's crunch time"" at the same two times of the year. It's so depressing. I just don't have the patience to work now that I've been at it for so long I can't take it anymore. I don't see a very promising future, I need gratification now. I can't keep running on the promise of potential success and rewards. For several years now I've been in college and the work gives me no real breaks, I can't do any of the things I want to do, and I haven't seen any rewards for my suffering, not even a taste. If working this hard is the cost of getting anything then I don't want to live. I'm at the end of my patience, I don't get satisfaction out of good grades, I don't feel rewarded for going to college, and I don't feel like I can amount to anything once I graduate. My major is useless and its too late to change it. There are some fields that just shouldn't even be offered as a major, because then you get fools like me who get duped out of their future and $20,000, at best some of these majors should be minors. If you can't get the kind of job you go to college for with it, then allowing people to major in it is a trap.

All my hard work is going to mean nothing. I'll never get those years back, and I'll end up doing something I hate until I'm past my prime. I want to be successful while I'm still young, so I can do young people things and have a good time. If I can't have that then I just want to die. And fact is that with the choices I've made I can't, the years I've wasted were my most potentially productive, even if put the work in I won't be where I want to be until I'm at least 40, and even then there's no guarantee that'll happen.

16,"I’m not even going to beat around the bush. I am a 20 year old college student in a toxic relationship with a 24 year old man. [Note that I suffer from depression and anxiety, and have been prescribed with medication(I rarely take).]

We’ve been seeing each other for a year and some change. We live in the same city but I live 2 hours away to go to school, but don’t mind the drive. However, things have turned for the worst. Every thing I do pisses him off and he bullies me. If I tell him my emotions he’ll call me stupid or weak. He doesn’t trust anything I say or do. He tells me not to apologize because he doesn’t believe in them. 

Now this man is 24 doesn’t have a full time job no car and living with his friends, (who have banned me from coming over because I refuse to leave my 24 pound emotional support dog with anyone). He still has some sort of income but that’s none of my business. Currently he’s sleeping on a small sofa with a couple of pillows.

However, despite all of this I am madly in love with him. He once made me happy, something I yearned for since I was in middle school. He tells me he still loves and cares for me, after he has yelled at me. He threatens to leave all the time and that’s my greatest fear because I’ve cut everyone off for him, and don’t do certain things, (including taking my medication because he doesn’t want “government BS” in my body) because I know that will anger him.

Today I was overwhelmed with my studying, and have been for a while(finals, duh). I asked him if he was busy and if not could he call me to keep me up and encourage me. Yet that turned into an argument and he told me “Now I have to be put to the task to encourage you when you literally put yourself in depressing situations”. 

He ended up calling me, and asked me if I was being a cry baby? Of course I was; I cry all the time, I’m an emotional girl. We then argued for about an hour but he told me he’ll just talk to me whenever. 

This may sound insane but I don’t want to lose him. I’ll be alone with no one since I had to cut everyone off for him. I can’t lose him. 

So my question is how do I overcome being so weak? 

I’m not a mean person, I don’t like saying ‘no’, I’m very bubbly, I put others feelings before my own, I hold my tongue, and I’m actually a really pretty girl. I’m just an emotional wreck. I put in so much effort driving back and forth to him on the weekend except recently. I even offered him my social media passwords just so he would trust me again. I have nothing to hide. I love this man yet I’m losing him because I can’t stop crying and open my mouth to say anything; if I do he’ll just get louder and angrier.

I go to an antisocial commuter school where there is no one like me. Most people at my school don’t try and drop out.

I’m a social person but I’ve had trouble making one meaningful friendship so far. To make things worse, I don’t drink or smoke. I have no plans to and I don’t want to be in that environment.

SUCKS that I live in the most *boring* city where 99% of outings involve drinking.

Life is just so...uneventful and boring. I’m involved in so many things on the surface level. My resume can show you that. But I’m getting nothing out of college or like currently. I’m getting tired of watching TV, too.

I’m not suicidal or depressed and I know it. I’m just in a weird ass middle place. I feel like life is happening somewhere and I’m just cursed living in this rut. I don’t have money to travel. If I did I’d be out of here.

Fucking blows that I don’t even have anyone to vent to. All of my acquaintances/“friendships” involve me acting polite and I don’t wanna blow my cover by exposing how much I hate my life. I haven’t been out on the weekend in like a year. I’m getting bored of browsing the internet. I excel at my internships and jobs but it’s just so routine and mundane that it doesn’t help my case.

I wish I went to a better college. I wish I lived in a better city. I wish I had money. I wish people wanted to do more than just drink all the time. But I won’t get those wishes.

Mostly, I read/research a ton about the field I’m trying to get into. Then I study, work, and sleep. 

I can’t take two more years of this bullshit. I’ll end up doing it and doing well but I just fucking hate it. I hate my stupid degree. My school doesn’t have any of the majors I want and I obviously can’t transfer.

I’m mostly blowing steam. I am 100% sure I’m not depressed.

I have big goals for myself. I keep them to myself, too.
There’s not really any hobby I want to do I haven’t picked up on. I’m awaiting releases for like four video games. 

I literally sound like an incel or some creep or something but like...people have the worst advice. I do go out of my way to meet new people. I talk to many people. I’m not afraid to approach anyone. I have an open mind and I mean it. I go towards fun if I see it. If there’s an event I’ll go.

The reality is that there’s just nothing happening here, and many people are shitty and shallow. I just mind that we have some laughs, I’m not really looking for “deep convos” or that fake deep bullshit. Yet, it’s like everyone has their own established social circles.

I had this childhood friend since birth. Our moms were best friends so we were too. We were attached to the hip and were also neighbors for years. They even lived with us for a couple of months. 
But as we started high school her mom’s alcoholism started getting worse and our moms had a huge falling out. We didn’t let this ruin our friendship though. 
But as most people do, they change in high school. But she changed for the worst. She got into drugs and started dating thugs. (Lol that rhymes). And she just ended up not being the bff I had for so many years anymore. And I didn’t want to associate with the lifestyle she was living. 
The falling out was bad. We ended up hating each other. She would tweet about me constantly and threaten to fight me. So I had to block her.
I’ll be 21 in a week and I’m in college now. And for the past year I have had a dream about her almost every single night. But I never think about her! It’s just really starting to get on my nerves. And I’m not interested in being her friend again but...

31,"Eight years, so listen up newbies and pipe down old-timers.

It seems every month the number of people joining increases, as the site's profile is raised and people leave their self-alienation on Facebook to seek the warm blanket of anonymity. Long before I dipped my toe in the choppy waters of the Internet some twelve years ago, the possibilities of discourse and mutual exploration had been blown wide-open by the creative and expressive freedom offered by usernames eschewing real-world identification.

Then the suits moved in to make some money and society's baubles set up their pedestals. Subscription was dropped in waves of self-doubt, and advertising developed from clumsy banners to the ghoulish stalkers we know and love. Not content with the idea of a person choosing to buy something they want, now an industry has their every word recorded, passed around and pored over to find the smallest veins of profitability. But you know about that.

What I'm noticing that hasn't yet been absorbed by the repertoire of stock phrases, is a strong polarisation of argument. Not opinion, not political thought or range of taste, but a tug-of-war concept when conflicting views interact.

Only in the subs safely distanced from the mainstream do you see a debate play out between thoughtful and self-aware users. They make a point of considering what other people have said, and of wondering how their own words might be read by another. They both understand that the other person holds a different position, so the task is to find some common ground and present your differences in a way that shows both internal logic and relevance to the real world.

This has always been the hallowed forum of people who can be bothered, but I want to note the trend I'm seeing more recently. Instead of engaging with each other, users are making hard-line statements that commit wholly to one perspective and abhor the presence of any other. You are no longer just left-wing and others are right-wing, as the pendulum swings to find the best way forward. Now you are the purveyor of truth and herald of the coming utopia, battling through a horde of evil connivers.

People seem to think that if they just say something strongly enough, and get others to do the same, then those who disagree will be drowned in a flood of opinion. Threads no longer connect the curious, they just corral gangs of deaf people with megaphones.

This division into discrete groups makes each of them manageable, and serves no one but the people who find a way to become leaders. The British Empire became the largest in history by splitting complex societies into simple factions to be pitted against each other. The empires of today are doing the same.

34,"A good friend of mine is a drug addict, a heavy user. He also likes to manipulate and use people around him, a habit which both his family and I have seen. He always seeks the easy way out. We've put him through Rehab 3 times...he's checked out early each time. We've helped him with his lawyers to deal with his legal troubles. We've paid his rent, we've bought him groceries, we've loaned him money for ""car repairs""

We gave him one last chance, we made it clear this was his last chance with us we made it clear we were united as a front, his friends, his family and if he succeeded we'd all be at the finish line cheering him on and after he passes that finish line we'll support him. He doesn't have to worry about paying rent, finding a job, we'll help, we will all be there together.

But no, he ended up going with the first girl who would give him a bed to sleep in and a pussy to stick his dick in and he went straight back to his old habbits. He told us ""man its just a bit of weed"" we warned him. Then he said ""its just a bit of beer"" we warned him. Then he started using ""legal"" drugs we warned him.

He's now gone down the path and has relapsed...he's begging for help again...but its just a ploy he's not serious...had your girlfriend not gotten tired of your shit you'd still be doing drugs.

37,"so i grew up in a small town where everyone knows everyone's business. my family was well off but incredibly abusive. the dysfunction stemmed from my father's alcoholism and it impacted me severely. recently, my father cheated on my mother for the 4th time. he was abused as a child and has a lot of baggage, but it does not justify his actions. my parents did not love each other the way that i have always dreamed of: there was no romance, nothing. they fought constantly and never seemed to be happy; their fights shook the whole house. my dad was never around, and if my mom was around she would threaten to leave if I didn't act a certain way. to me, love has become seemingly conditional rather than ""unconditional"" as most people say. the verbal and emotional abuse i went through has made it hard to move on with my life without having so much anxiety that i can't function. i am in college and doing well, but deep down every decision i make terrifies me and i just long for death instead of dealing with the consequences of disappointing the people around me.

my boyfriend is also severely depressed. he has clinical depression but has not sought intense treatment. he seems to have seasonal depression, and it is the time of year that he pulls away. we have been together since high school, almost 3 years now, and i love him more than i ever imagined i could love another person. at times, we have been toxic together by feeding off each other's depression. we broke up last summer to work on ourselves and we truly did and got back together in the fall. but as soon as i found out my dad cheated again and that my parents were getting divorced this time, i became so depressed that i took the semester off this spring. i am worried that i dragged him to this dark place, but i know that i can't blame myself for his depression.

since coming home it has been hard on our relationship. my boyfriend hates my family because he watches the emotional abuse they put me through. i love my family, but they put me through so much that i get so tired of hurting. on the other hand, when my boyfriend becomes this depressed and distant he also hurts me unintentionally. we are long distance still, but when we are together he is a different person and he calms all of the storms inside of me that wonder if love is even real. i know it is real because we both stay loyal despite all of the baggage we both have, but i get scared that love won't be enough just like it wasn't for my parents.

i don't want to leave him. we have talked of marriage and kids and i honestly couldn't imagine being with anyone else. when i was single over the summer, i met someone that was ""perfect."" he would have given me the world if he could, and made me a princess like i had imagined i wanted as a kid. but i felt nothing towards him. the first time we got intimate, i pulled away and made it stop because i wanted it to be my current boyfriend. a week after that, we got back together.

i guess what i'm getting at is that his depression is so hard for me to handle. it makes me so scared that he will leave me again and hurt me, or worse, hurt himself. my mom and some other members of my dysfunctional family and some of my friends tell me that i should find someone who treats me better, but they don't see who he is when it's the two of us or when he isn't depressed. i'm not a materialistic person like my family, instead, i like to collect moments. my boyfriend gives me all of those and then some. he gives me good and bad, but i wouldn't want to have good moments with anyone else. it just so happens that we both come with a lot baggage. and when people tell me to leave and find someone else, i get chest pains thinking about not being with him. i love him deeply and with all of his flaws, i just need to learn how to cope with them better. trust me, i am flawed too, so i know we both have to accept a lot of things about each other. there is no doubt in my mind that he loves me. but i just can't get over this hump in my mind: what if love isn't enough? what if 20 years from now, we wake up as strangers like my parents did?

how do i help myself heal and give him the space to heal himself so we can prove everyone in my family wrong?

i love my family, and i want them in my life, but their jaded love hurts me so much. how do i have them in life but accept their dysfuction?

Some were outdated, there were a few duplicates and I tried to actually read and get rid of as many as I could that would only take a few minutes of my time.

Plenty of my saved posts were things that I saved in the first place because they'd take longer to go through. Megathreads of must-read books and must-watch movies, podcasts, documentaries, detailed writeups of subjects relating to hobbies and my profession, and so on. These kinds of items I moved to Google Keep and now have them organised under a dozen or so labels. I estimate that I've added 500-550 items to Google Keep.

In total it's taken me 5 or 6 hours to get through them all. It feels good to have a ton of interesting things now well organised and easily accessible. It's also a pity that I couldn't handle this on reddit itself, and basically nothing has changed with the system in the last 4 years.",17Apr2018,4

I put my hope in a doctor, but after todays appointment where he told me he had no clue.. I am just disappointed, got home exhausted and saw that I got some money (40$)  from doing an online diary for some research.

I don't have any income as I am unable to work in my condition so this is a lot of money for me, so I decided to get a game, to distract from all this bullshit.


I went online and looked for people who sell discounted steam keys, found a seller who had a good reputation and messaged him.


A few minuted later I get a friend request on steam, he offerd me my desired game at 40 dollars and I agree, dumb me was so done with everything that I just didnt see the red flags...  I was supposed to buy him a gift card and send it to him, I told him my fear of being scammed and that this was the only and first money I had in a long time...  he told me it's alright and I needn't worry, he had a reputation to lose if he scammed me.


I sent him the gift card and he said he would get the game right away... never to be heard of again of course.


It turned out he was an impersonator of the seller, changed his Steam name and everything to look exactly like that of the seller....

67,"EDIT: This was supposed to be a list of things I hated about myself, but as you can see there’s much more on here than just that. I just hope that one of you can give me some words, any at all, that my thoughts were heard. That what I am isn’t weird, or that I’m still figuring stuff out. I don’t know what I want to hear, but please tell m something. 

Things I hate about the way I look:

I’m quite short at 1,73. I won’t grow anymore, I’m a man, and I live in the tallest country in the world. Just being short alone gives me a significant disadvantage in both my preferred job, managing, and in the dating pool. I don’t blame women for this, because everyone has their own taste, but it does really suck.

I either have a receding hairline or it’s always been high. I used to love my hair, as ever since I got a new haircut, I felt significantly more confident. Then someone made fun of my high hairline, and then someone else did, and someone else did. Not out of spite, but just for fun. Yet, they all came to the conclusion that it’s very high, which I can’t really help, unless I want to pay money to make it lower.

I just don’t look good. I have no muscles, I have a skin condition that gives me pigmented skin all over my body, as well as red cheeks almost all of the time. Nobody has ever really mentioned either as unattractive and most mistake it for chickenskin, but I love nice, clear, skin. It’s one of my favorite things about a man or woman. If they have nice skin, I’m definitely going to be more attracted to them, yet I don’t have, and can never have, nice skin. I guess my face itself has nice skin, so that’s something. 

I have pretty yellow teeth. It’s not something that many people notice, and it’s not crazy bad, but I used to brush my teeth badly and now I’m suffering the consequences. I can still confidently smile, but if I could change something about myself with money right now, it’d be my teeth or hairline.

Last and definitely least, I can’t grow a beard. Sure, this might come with time as I’m only 21, but for now it’s just an uneven mess. Without a beard I have no jawline and I look 12, but with facial hair I just look like I forgot to shave for a while or don’t take care of myself.


What I don’t like about myself:

I’m just plain lazy. I can’t get myself to do things. If I could, my life would be so much better. If i wasn’t lazy I’d be at the gym right now doing something about my insecurities, I’d be good at something and not just get 6s on all my tests, dropping out of football, guitar playing, violin playing, and hell even the YouTube channel that I had hasn’t had a video uploaded in months because I can’t get myself to make another. I love making those videos, I love it. Yet, I can’t get myself to make them.

Now get this. I’m going abroad in a few months, and I’m incredibly excited for it. I’ll be there some 6 months or so, but I’m going to have to live on the money I’m loaning every month. Sure this will be enough to get by, but if I had a job right now I could really make the best of it then. I applied to multiple jobs, and got a lot of interviews! I planned them, got dates planned, but then either made excuses to not go and stayed in bed, or when I didn’t have any other contact info but their phone number, which I hate calling, I just didn’t let anything know. I hate myself for that. I’ve never been that rude, I’ve always at least been considerate, yet I’m letting my anxiety and laziness get in the way of being nice to people and helping myself in a few months. It’s not even that I don’t want to work or dislike it. I’ve loved every single job I’ve had before, and I’d love to go back to any of those, but I just can’t seem to set something new up. 


I’m extremely jealous. Of everyone and everything. Sure I’m often happy for someone but there’s always something in the back of my head that mentions how much I’d want to be that person. I’ve had moments where I thought about not minding to be in a terrorist attack just so I could get attention for once. To be cared for for once, to see which people would care if I got injured.

I somehow care way too much about likes on Facebook and Instagram. I don’t know why. I know people like me. I don’t know a single person that actively dislikes me, but it seems like I just fly under the radar sometimes. Some of my friends have maybe 60 people congratulating them for their birthday on Facebook, I had 11 last year, most of which were family. Yet, that doesn’t really tell the story. My friends called me, whatsapped me, snapchatted me, and tweeted me. Though still I think back on that day as my worst birthday ever, because I didn’t get a lot of happy birthdays that day. My day gets significantly worse if certain people that I hoped would wish me a happy birthday didn’t. 

The stupid thing is my life is better than it’s ever been. I used to barely have friends in high school, and got bullied. I didn’t dare talk to women, I wasn’t myself, and I was genuinely depressed. I know I have it much better now. Better than most around me. Yet I’m jealous of the lives they have because they went to one party I didn’t go to, or because they have a few more Instagram likes than I do. 

My life really is good right now. I have a solid group of friends that genuinely care for me and that I have a real social life with, I actually have girls as friends now for the first time since I was 8, and I love it, because I wanted nothing less. I finally have people that care enough for me to talk to me every single day even when we don’t see each other. And last but not least, I have the best family alive. My dad is literally the best dad I could imagine, my mom tries her fucking hardest, and my two brothers are great and supporting. Doesn’t mean that I didn’t wish that I wasn’t the youngest, or that I didn’t wish that I had a sister so I’d have someone to really, really talk to about my problems.

Now most of this shit seems trivial to most of you probably. They’re huge deals to me, but mean nothing to you. You probably have worse things to deal with on a daily basis, so let me get to the “worst part of me”.

The worst parts of me:

I’m bisexual. I’ve recently told one of my male friends for the first time because he basically forced it out me, and I still don’t think it was the right time to tell him, even though he took it well. I wish I hadn’t told him. Maybe because I can’t take it back anymore, it’s now real, and no longer in my head. I’m attracted to both men and women for sure, yet I only really want to have sex with men when I’m really horny. I have Grindr, but I only use it when I’m horny, and the moment I’m not horny anymore I delete the app because I want to go for just women again. It’s fucking stupid. I’m yearning for someone to love me and be affectionate with me and men are almost lining up with me to be with them, but I don’t let them in. I only really seem to want to have a relationship with a woman.

Why? I don’t know. I’d love to have sex with plenty of men but dating one? I can’t see myself doing it.


Even more controversial for me is that I wish I was a girl. This has been a thing for me as long as I can remember, as I remember watching “It’s a boy girl thing” back in 06 or so, when I was 10, and thinking I just wished I could be like that.” After recently watching “Your Name” I once again felt just sad, and realized that this is something that I really wished for. I’ve never been a super girly guy, and nobody would or has ever guessed I’m into men, yet I do like quite a lot of girly stuff like girly music, shows, and honestly just the way girls treat each other and get treated. When I started watching porn I was more focused on the girl than the man, and I later realized that I always fantasize me as the woman in the scenario. I didn’t want to be the man fucking a woman, I wanted to be fucked. I wanted to be a woman, talk like one, act like one, and get treated like one. I don’t feel like I am one though, which makes me even more confused. I don’t want a sexchange, but if I could snap my fingers and be a girl I’d do it in an instant. I want to actually be a girl, and I want everyone to see me as one. To treat me as one, and I don’t think I can truly be myself this way. I just wish I was born differently, but I don’t think I should’ve been a girl, or that I was born in the wrong body, but I do wish I was a girl. Does that even make sense? I can’t even make sense of it myself.


Probably the worst thing I have done and still do is catfish as a girl. I’ve been doing it ever since I was 13, and I had a different account. I loved that people thought I was a girl. And that I could truly talk and be the way I wanted to be, and that people were listening. This obviously escalated really quick, as conversations became more sexual. I had sex talk with fully grown men at the age of 13, knowing what I was doing, and them thinking I was a 13 year old girl. I never stopped doing this, but later told a internet friend of mine all of this. She offered to let me use her pictures with a different name, so that I wouldn’t just use some random girls pictures. I used hers, and talked with other girls, plus sex talked with a lot of men. At that point they were definitely pedos, or whatever the slightly older teen way of saying that is, which is how I told myself it was okay. I was sextalking with these twisted men, so I was fooling people who deserved it! At one point, I don’t remember when it started, men started offering money for nudes. I pulled some random pictures of the internet and they gave me some extra cash that 16/17 year old me could really use. To this day I still catfish men, although I’ve grown with my character and am now supposed to be 19. I don’t really ask money for pictures anymore but I have started writing sexstories, that they then pay for. 

I feel so fucking weird for doing this. I’ve been sextalking as a girl on Facebook for 8 years now, and on Reddit I’ve been doing the same for 5 or so years. I just feel like there’s something wrong with me, and every so often I’m scared that one of my catfishees has found me out and knocks on my door, demanding an answer. This whole catfishing ordeal has made my sex fantasies so twisted, that I don’t really know if I can ever go back from all this. I feel like I need the validation of men to live now, and I can’t go two weeks without at least one man telling me how goodlooking I am, or that they want me. I never let it get to love, but fuck do I still hate that I’m fooling all these men. 

It’s just one these things I do online that I’d never tell anyone about in real life. They’d find me so fucking weird for it. I’ve thought long and hard about whether I should just report all those men for liking the underaged girl and asking for nudes but I don’t think I can, just because of me selling pictures that weren’t mine in the past, and because I can’t let my own life suffer under it.


Sorry that this post didn’t turn out the way I wanted it to, not even close, and this seems to all just be rambling, but they’re just things I needed to get off my chest.
