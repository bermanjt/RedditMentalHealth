0,How do you locate your unmet friends?,17Dec2018,1
1,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Everything you are about to read is real and true, I just needed to tell my story.

Growing up, I moved a lot. Like I changed schools every year until my sophomore year of high school and I still ended up commuting an hour each way my senior year because we moved again and I didnt want to change schools for my senior year. Moving sucked and it was really hard trying to make new friends in a new place every year but my I always put on a brave face for my parents. Keep in mind, this is long before social media so when my family moved, it was like everything just vanished and I had to start over again. I never let that pain show. I smiled and pretended to be this outgoing kid, but on the inside I was so lonely. Still, I couldn't let my parents down. I pressed on with a big smile and when I graduated high school, I joined the military. It was a great experience, I got to do some amazing things and I finally had friends that moved with me. But then it happened. 

I was 20, at home on r&amp;r from my second tour, doing gymnastics at a local tumbling gym when the accident happened. (I had been an amateur gymnast for the past 13 years) But the floor gave out under the spring mat and I ended up clearing the 14 ft foam pit and slamming head first into a CMU wall at a dead spring. Cracked the top of my scull, a C-6 fracture, and a C-5 burst fracture. My said the largest piece of my C-5 burst fracture was smaller than a pea. I should have died, but the surgery went flawlessly. They replaced my C-5 with a titanium cage and double fused my C-4 thru C-6. I regained motor control of the right side of my body in the next couple of days and was diagnosed with Brown-Sequard syndrome. That just meant I lost feeling on one side of my body but motor control of the other side. Thus began a very long and difficult recovery; both physical and emotional. 

A year or so later I stepped out of my wheel chair. I still have limited sensation of the right side of my body. Some partial paralysis in my left leg and partial paralysis in my left hand but I can walk with a cane. I felt like I was so close to being normal again. 

Three years after my accident I was out of the military and had recovered enough to live a normal-ish life. It was a hard road but I fought my way out of depression and began living my life again, even went back to school to get a degree. But then my little brother committed suicide. And then everything was just numb for years. 

It's been three years and I'm trying.. but it's been so much harder and I'm so tired. 

I dont talk about it much, not because its particularly difficult to talk about, it's just wayy too heavy for almost all conversations and I dont like bumming people out. But I think I need to talk about it more. I'm still carrying around a lot of pain and unaddressed emotions and sometimes it feels like I've just been broken into too many pieces. Still, I know I can't give up.",17Dec2018,1
2,"My dad died when I was 17 and a half. Since then, we moved to my grandparents house and been living there for the past few years. I'm 23 now. 

I just finished college and got a decent job. Enough to start paying my student loan and pay for house services, food and a car I got so I can go to work.  My mom can't work at a regular job because my sister is handicapped and needs constant attention, she did what she could and I'm the most grateful person for it. I also filled in as the paternal image for my sister. So I'm supporting the entire household on my own.

As I was leaving college I got some extra money, so I was planning on getting a new laptop because the one I have doesn't cut the bread anymore. Gaming has always helped me get through tough stuff, so I decided to get a nice gaming laptop. First thing I was getting for myself since ever.

It goes without saying that I haven't been able to have a life of my own. Studying hard to maintain my scholarship and working part time. I always arrived late at the room I was staying and ended up sleeping late doing homework and projects. No dating, no parties, almost no free time. 

Things finally started to look good until just a few days ago... But a major problem has forced us to leave the house. The money I was hoping to use for my new laptop is now going towards my student loan, so I can use the money I won't be paying monthly for the next few months for rent. 

This means that I won't be getting my laptop, I won't be going on vacations that I had planned for next year and I won't be able to save money at all.

Anyways, I'm actually cool with this. Sure, I'd be happy if I could get my laptop. But I'm really grateful for all my mom has done for me throughout the years. 

To be honest I was used to things not going my way. I really thought that graduating and getting a stable job would change this. I was getting really excited to finally be able to get something for myself, but I guess that'll have to wait at least another year. ",17Dec2018,1
3,"About a year ago I reached out to get help to be diagnosed by a psychiatrist because I've been depressed and have been having suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. Probably since the age of about 7. 

Anyway I waited six months to see someone even after saying I was suicidal. I finally seen the psychiatrist and they diagnosed me with pretty severe borderline personality disorder and put me on anti depressants. Only after a month of seeing this doctor he discharged me cause he was moving. So I went back to my family doctor and got another referral it's been about three months.... my meds have been upped twice and I'm just so tired

I want help so badly because I don't wanna be sick and sad anymore and I'm tired of thinking of taking my life nearly everyday... I wanna get better so badly but the mental health system in Canada right now is terrible and I'm scared I won't get help till it's too late... I wanna go to the hospital but I know by doing that I'll hurt everyone I love... I'm so stuck on what I should do...",17Dec2018,1
4,"So my friend and I are going to Vegas next month to strip for our first time. I recently got accepted into school, therefore I have to move away from home and it's going to be pretty pricey. I pay all my bills and have been working three jobs to cover all my expenses. Once I start school I won't have as much time to work and I was talking to a friend of mine who used to strip in Vegas and she told me to try it out! The thought has been lingering in my mind for the past few weeks and I actually think I'm going to do it! I'm 24, tall, consider myself pretty attractive, and workout a lot and have a nice round butt lol. Any tips of what dancing in Vegas is like?",17Dec2018,1
5,"I'm getting evicted.

My girl cheated on me.

My best friend had a stroke.

8,"Dec 16, 2018
I thought about killing myself again for the first time in a long time. I hate this. I hate how I feel inside. I hate how I constantly let everyone around me down. I hate how I push everyone away and expect them to still love me. I hate how I barely talk to anyone anymore. I hate how I have to put on a face everyday. I hate this. I feel so sick inside everyday like I am slowly drowning to death. Usually being around family makes me happy but today it just reminded me of how fucking lonely and empty I am. Why am I suppose to believe it gets better? Yeah it does for some but some it doesn’t, will that be me?

12,"I found out that watching the entire 8 seasons of Game of Thrones would take you approx.  3 days, 14 hours, 23 minutes and 59 seconds. ",17Dec2018,1
13,"And not because they're toxic or abusive or manipulative. But because almost every second that my mind isn't preoccupied with something else, I'm thinking of them. Past conversations, possible future conversations, what I might say when I see them, how they'll react/ I'll react to this, past grievances to the both of us from each other.

They're my only real friend right now since the summer of 8th grade. We work together, hang together, they helped me move into my apartment a while ago. I just ... idk, can't stop thinking about them. They are like family to me and I couldn't have made some big decisions without them pushing me to do so, all have been for the best.

I know for a fact that they don't think about me nearly as much, and I (don't think) I'm salty about it. They have other friends and do other things. But if I'm not hanging out with them, then I'm at my apartment either playing video games with internet friends, playing video games by myself (most of which they got me into), or binge watching TV shows (some of which they got me into.)

Another reason why I think its unhealthy is because whenever they talk about getting drunk/drinking I get physically sick from it. My stomach churns at the thought of them being drunk. I'm super against drugs and alcohol, so, at 20 years old, all I've ever experienced with that is what I've seen from movies and TV shows, so its skewed to be more dramatic than it really is, but whenever they talk about it, I get sick.

The worst part about this is that I don't know if this is all in my head. I am very paranoid about my friends for some weird reason. I always seem to convince myself that my friends are only my friends to use me and they don't actually care for me. Even with so many examples, ones that I remind myself of constantly, I freak out. But then I see them at work or we hang out, and they disappear in a heartbeat.

I don't know what my goal of this post is. I don't know if I want conformation of my fears or denial of them. There's a lot more to this story but I feel like this is already long enough, and it would just confuse you guys, for those of you that read it, and me even more.

TLDR; I think about my best friend almost all day and I don't know if its unhealthy for me to do so because they're my first real friend for a really long time.",17Dec2018,1
14,"First thing first, I am not posting this for attention. I am honestly not normal when it comes to being social. My whole senior years in high school I went through depression and I fucked up my grade 12 years. Didn't graduate...

I think I am not mentally capable of connecting to people after I came to Canada (Been here for 6 years, I am 18 now). I had few friends in high school (Four people I would always hang out with). After I left that school I only talk to two of them now. I hated talking to people because of how they would treat me different. I wasn't like this before I came to Canada, I was so social. I feel like having these same 'feeling not normal around them' got me to this stage. I hardly talked to my parents last two years of my high school. I was acting like a douche bag to them so they wouldn't know I was depressed. I think even after that, my parents knew deep down I wasn't feeling the same. I love my parents so much, but I think I wired my brain to act super rude around them. I didn't talk to my relatives from my country in a long time. I don't like who I am becoming. I am trying to change so much, but I feel like end of the day I still am the same.

People from my summer school, different school I went to, tried to hang out with me and talk to me etc, but slowly and slowly I stopped replying to them, not showing interests. WITHOUT me realizing how much of a bad person I was being. I think of my self being judged negatively all the time. Even if someone said ""wow really nice drawing"", my brain would tell me they are being sarcastic. Even though it could just be in my head. In class I show no emotions, just sitting like a fucking mannequin. I am not like that inside, it just how I present myself.

Recently I got into this tutoring place, and every other day I have class with this girl that stares at me from time to time. First time I saw her she looking at me, she looked at her friend real quick, looked pretty shy not gonna lie. She did it few times this week. Today I was little fried when I went to class and when I saw it happen my reaction was so rude. Like my facial expression was like ""what is this bitch doing?"", even though I was little happy inside. Like honestly never see how I truly am unless I am smoking weed. Makes me see these things, like how I talk to my parents, how I dress, how I should be doing something rather than wasting time. I am telling you I keep putting in work, but I lose motivation super fast because of low dopamine release.

The other day in my school class this girl came late and sit in our table (I don't usually sit on that table). She was like ""so how come you are sitting with us today"", I literately replied ""I don't fucking know, I didn't feel like talking to anyone"". She was like ""Oh ok"" and people in the table was just looking at me cause how offensive that sounded.

I am not presenting myself as I would want to, these negative thoughts keeps coming back to me again and again. I really love my parents and my friends who was with me all these years. I just feel like my life is a fucking movie and it's just playing by itself till I die. Even all the actions I am taking, I feel like someone is taking these actions for me.

Recently (past few months) after few psychedelic trips and meditation I keep REALIZING these things that never crossed my mind. At this point I talked to a therapist and he is really helpful and supportive. He want's me to take medication (Adderall), which I know can fuck you over years. That's why I got into meditation, to help with my ADHD. I am trying my best to change. I just want to know if any of you had this happen to you before, maybe you overcame it and can help me too.

\*\*TL;DR;\*\* : I am really lost in my brain and I feel like I have no control over what I am doing and how I am communicating with my surroundings. I feel like everyone is thinking negative thoughts about me and I keep going down from that. My confidence dropped so much overtime and I don't know what to do. My parents love me so much but I was too blind to see it before. I am being rude to people without even me realizing it. I don't know what to do to be honest other than just letting my life flow. I am crying while writing this... I am sorry.

Have a good day!",17Dec2018,1
15,"O boy this is kinda sweet.

Long story short, I recently converted from a chapter 13 bankruptcy to chapter 7. Anyway my vehicle was included in the Chapter 7 and my trustee was going come get it.

My dad wanted to buy my car, I told my dad all the issues it had, the maintenance that was overdue on it and basically explained he would be an idiot for buying the car. I told him to just let the court come get the car (He was buying the car from the court not from me)

Now if your son, who has 8+ years in the auto industry tells you not to buy his car and he gives a long list of reasons...you should listen to him.

The biggest issue was the transmission was skipping, and the car had just gone out of warranty. I told him this.

So what did he do?

He bought the car

Last night the transmission blew up on him, and its in the shop. My mom and I talked, and we are both laughing about it...he should have listened to me. 

Whats crazy is the book value of the car is like $12k. I told him he should pay no more then 8k because if he doesn't take it, its going go to auction and it might sell for $9k-10k and the court will prob be happy to take 8k for it and not have to mess with it.

So he offered 11k, he was countered at 12k and accepted it.",17Dec2018,1
16,"hi everyone. my name is Eli. im 21 years old. first of all, i want to point that english is not my primary language, and im trying my best to be clear.

when i was little and i started to learn colors numbers and letters, i remember that in my head everything had it own color, personality and shape. for example, red was a color that tried to be nice with the world, but bc of humans seeing it like danger it is misunderstood. another example (a more common one) is that the numbers used to have  colors in my mind. seven have always been yellow for me. and friendly.

im studying classic arts and design, so starting to learn about art make my mind change, and the colors and feels started to manifestate everywhere amd more often. now i can ""feel"" paintings, movies, music, etc. this phenomenom also increased when i was 18 bc i started smoking weed and doing acid sometimes.

 a few months ago, i finished some psychological treatments, and ""officially"" got  diagnosed with it.

its weird to look back at my childhood memories because now its more clear that this phenomenom was present, but i was used to it, i never thought that i was ""different"" (i hate calling myself like that)

now, im just tired of it. i´ve been living almost all my life with it but, now that i know that i could have not, its weird. 

it feels like i feel more than i should, and sometimes it harms my day-to-day.

if i go to a very populated city, with lots of builds and sound everywhere, i can feel gray, i can feel the place crying (trying to describe it with words)

also, some music really hits my mood. there are so many song where the guitar shouts and try to get my attention (the yellow songs) and it harms when i try to do something that requires a lot of attention

for example if im on a mall and i start hearing some red, yellow or green; i just cant concentrate on what i was doing.

some good things also happen,  some colors taste amazingly good, and some places like forests or beachs feel more quiet, more happy, more gratefull

but idk guys, i think this is too much for me and i would really like to feel like i used to feel 8 years ago (little less little more), now the feels are strong, i can hardly use headphones, cinema is no longer enjoyable, the things that people wear are more shocking on what i think about that person, etc 

thanks for hearing me. if you want to say something to me or ask something, you are welcome. thank you so much....

I've never been able to picture myself in a relationship. I was starting to think it wouldn't happen for me. Now it's so easy to picture myself with him.

I live in the US and he lives in Germany. I've been trying to find a German police number I can call from the US, but I can't seem to find one. I could try calling 911 and try to have them connect me to German police, but I fear it might take too long if there's an emergency situation.

19,"Today is the day of my jobs Christmas party, I went and put in my 2 weeks for my job because I was offered a manager position somewhere else. While this is fantastic news I'm also really really sad. I'm leaving all my friends behind, and even my bestie. Me and her didn't get along at first, she's so quiet and introverted and shy that my loud extroverted personality made her want to keep her distance. She thought I was a bit crazy, and she still does. I constantly asked her to consider hanging out with me because she was such a nice person but she constantly said no. In fact everyone at my job thought I was crazy and tried to keep their distance. But due to the fact I'm so kind and loving to everyone they eventually started to like me and so I became friends with them one by one. The cook who I call my dad and he calls me son... the dirty old cook who always jokes about sex, the cook who jokes and alternates between us being buddies and hating me, the shy loving girl and her girlfriend who threw me a birthday party when none of my friends from highschool did anything, my boss who gave me a raise when times got tough for me, his son who gave me a hug behind the restaraunt when I revealed I used to battle with depression and then told me to tell nobody about the hug, my friend the baby bird who is my bottom bitch and also shy girls boyfriend.... and the shy girl who didn't want to be my friend. Eventually she warmed up to me and I cut the lid off a box and drew a mock picture of our future friend dynamic... me being happy as fuck and extroverted, and her ignoring my bullshit but staying with me.. That was one year ago and we have become inseparable friends who tell each other everything. She picked me up and got a speeding ticket when I accidentally stabbed myself and couldn't drive to work. She was scared at in the car when she got pulled over, she asked if she was going to jail. She had no idea how getting a speeding ticket worked. Our ventures to get sushi and crepes, and going to target to get candy on break.... today I gave her the cardboard tops that I drew on as a going away gift. I'm going to miss them all..

And they told us tonight no one would be getting the cards because they gave 3 paid days off to the maintenance workers. Not even us. We didnt even get those paid days. Just maintenance. It's $175 too so that was a good amount of stuff I could've gotten.  I wish they at least would have told us when they decieed to give the days off months ago.

27,"          I’m a 15 year old girl and I love babies with all of my heart. I’ve wanted a baby for years (I had puberty early), I just absolutely adore them. However, I am also a very rational person. I know that babies are so much work, I will lose my childhood if I have one, their needs are much more important than mine, they don’t care about how little sleep or how much homework I have. I also come from a religious Muslim African immigrant family, and I am a virgin and have never had a boyfriend or even a first kiss, I want to save my virginity for someone who truly loves me, and I do not want to be a single mother, I know that a high school boy will almost never stick around, no matter how much I love them or feel like they will. 
          So I know that I can’t have one until I am hopefully married and have a lot of life experience, but what should I do in the meantime? How do I deal with this feeling, what should I do to lessen this feeling or to satisfy this urge? I literally have a section in my notes app filled with parenting articles and articles about baby development and psychology! I’m not gonna go out and have sex with the first guy that wants to just for a baby, I’m not that immature, but the feeling is so strong that I feel super sad when I think about the fact that there are no babies around me for me to take care of!

28,"Im 14 years old and i have only ever been surprised on Christmas with like a few gifts.My birthday i could care less about i actually feel like its a waste of time because congrats you were born literally every one you know was born.So yea birthdays are pointless to me why do i deserve a present for being born?i mean it would make sense for my mother to get a present on my birthday because that was probably painful.But me idk anyway Christmas is my favorite holiday I absolutely love Christmas.It is truly the most wonderful time of the year ❤️.I love giving gifts and receiving gifts.It is amazing.But the only thing is that I literally will not allow myself to be surprised on Christmas and I think it has gotten to a extreme level.no one knows that I do this stuff.I just cant stop its like I most know what im getting it kills me not to know.Just so you understand how crazy I have become here is the thing I do every year to discover weeks before Christmas what im getting.I have figured out my dads laptop password, my moms , my grandmas , my brothers, and my sisters phone password.I have figured my dads, moms, and grandmas amazon account passwords.I know every spot that they hide wrapped/ not wrapped yet gifts.Also if there is a present underneath the Christmas tree for me I will stay up until midnight then very strategically open it and see what it is then wrap it back up.And no one is even suspecting of even trying to know what im getting at the smallest extent.Some presents from other people I don't usually know what im getting but I don't really care because they are usually small gifts that they just happened to find out by ""them selves"" that i like.So i usually have a 75% chance of knowing what they got me.I have done these things since i was 7 years old.But lately Christmas has become dull because on Christmas morning i have to pretend to be surprised even though i know everything that im getting.But i just cant stop my brain tells me don't do it not this year.But my body says otherwise.Now its a week before Christmas and here is what im getting....

49,"Yeah this is a story that happened not so long ago (quite recently actually), I just wanted to share with you to let it out and as well raise concern about this practices and how vulnerable depressed/people with mental issues (or just people in general) are to fall in this type of shit. 

I was having a very bad day, on a very bad week, on a kinda bad month, on a bad year. I was very sick and returning from the doctor, I was carrying a some money to buy me a smash edition pro controller for my switch so my mom and I went to see my trusty vendor only for him to tell me that it would take some days to arrive to the store.

Oh well so the real story begins here, then we went to the supermarket to buy some groceries and finally go home. Arriving at the supermarket there was like 2 dudes at the avenue coming out of a badly parked white van, i thought to myself “man this guys are going to steal my money” so I nervously grabbed my pocket in order somehow “hide” my wallet bulge. Then these guys started yelling my mom about some anniversary promotion some club had going (a very unwanted fan club now that I think) they had a tent mounted with a table and three guys doing a casino “game” that went like this: you had a little cup with marbles in it and you had to throw the marbles into a board with holes in it, each hole had a number form 1-6 and there were like 6 marbles, then you added the numbers of the holes the marbles got stuck in and do the thing the number said (+5 ponts, small price, -5 points, +50 points, etc.) in order to win you had to accumulate 100 points, now back to the story. The dude that was yelling at us got to my mom’s nerves so we played the game, I took the 2 free plays and got a lot of points, at this point I was excited  I was at nothing of winning some free cash or a speaker I felt good about it, after all the shitty stuff that had happened to me, something good was finally going to happen right?... 
R i g h t ? ? ?
After the “promotion” free plays each play costed a little money so I thinked to myself why not? I accepted and “bought” another 2 plays that got me even closer, my mother after this was looking to me with disgust (always listen to your parents) but I was feeling so hyped I wanted to keep playing, then I got a “special” number that doubled the price and the cost for each play as well as nullyifing the negative points. I was like heck yeah I “payed” for another two plays and got the special number again got closer to the 100 points but had to pay extra to keep playing. After that my mother looked angrily at me and said “Anon stop playing is just a scam I’ll be buying vegetables” man if only I listened to her. 
The guy just was like “moms am I right?” I kept playing and the price for each play kept increasing with each “special” number I got. My anxiety was kicking in everytime I played, it was no longer hype but sadness and fear each play. At this point I was done my mind had convinced me out of it, I told the guy I no longer wanted to play but he and the other dudes he was with persuaded me giving me a free play and sadly I accepted (god no).
I was almost out of money and managed to get to 99 points and then the cost doubled again due to another special number, all the joyful special emotions I got were replaced with extreme anxiety and fear, the sentiment of “heck yeah I’m finally winning something” got replaced with “not again please no why didn’t I listened”, but thanks to that kick of anxiety and depression I gave a look at my wallet and realized all the free money I gave to those bastards I quitted playing but they won’t persuade me anymore because they got enough money from me. 
Man I returned to help my mom with the shopping and realized hoy little time had passed since she walked away and I was still “playing” at a very minimum price. She gave me a very well deserved scold but then she felt pity for me realizing how I was really the victim over there, when we got done on the shopping I noted they were no longer there, i got a quick search for the game and gambling legislation here in Mexico and to my (little) surprise it was ilegal. So likely they got caught or they got scared because someone called the police.
 I didn’t said a single word on the way back home and I just stayed there, feeling like shit realizing how much money I lost in a second and how many people like me got scammed in the same way. 

I hope you read this post to the end and helped you to get an idea how this scammers work, as well as raise concern about them, or simply let you know that if you were drawn in you are not alone. Gambling and games like this are not something you can just ignore, i just lost enough to not be able to afford my special edition pro controller but there are people out there that are loosing all their money (money that they use for living and maintaining their families) to practices like these.

51,"My experience:
I was still in school, the time was 10:34 A.M.
my 3rd class teacher told us our full day schedule changed into a half day, we were all happy...because we didn't know what would happen the next day...
Time 12:30 A.M.:
the school had just ended and my parents told me to clean out our entire room, I was surprised at what they asked, normally for typhoons we would just take all the important things and put the rest into boxes, this had me worried so I check my weather app on my laptop... I was scared, when I saw the typhoon progressing I said to my mom ""Mom before I clean out my room can I go check our neighbors and tell them to come to stay at our house tomorrow?"" she immediately said yes and tell them to pack all their belongings
The next day 10:00 A.M.:
I woke up and checked my weather app, the typhoon was close now I quickly dressed and told my mom im going to get our neighbors I ran to their house, as I was running I looked up to the sky
it was all grey the wind was already strong so I ran faster and told them to come to my house now
my neighbor had a daughter so the daughter followed me and we waited for her mom until 11:00 A.M.
12:00 A.M.:
I and my neighbor's daughter were in our concrete room, the room we stayed in was the only safe place in our house that wouldn't break
4:00 P.M.
The typhoon picked up but we still had power, me and my friend decide to go live on FB
we were messing around until 7 p.m. she was told to go to sleep
I went to vid chat with my friend in the states 
he said I don't need to worry and everything will be ok
I was so stupid to believe his words...
9:00 P.M.
the power went out at that time so I decided to go sleep
12:41 A.M.
I woke up to the sound of loud noises from the outside of our room
my friend was scared and we said that we will live
2:00 A.M. 
the storm had finally calmed down my friend thought that it was done but no
I explained to her that it was just the eye of it
we were in the middle...
3:00 A.M.
the typhoon had just gotten worse there was water flying into my face and my friends face
her mother and my relative were staying in the same room as us
my parents were in the next concrete room although they never got a wink of sleep
4:00 A.M.:
I woke up at that time and when i looked outside...
my house the main part of my house...
was gone, it was completetly demolished...
5:00 P.M.
the winds were still strong i was comforting my friend because she saw what happened to her house
her entire house fell apart
The next day 6:00 P.M.
nothing had been happening but at this time i was able to start seeing patches of blue in the sky
The next day 2:30:
It was gone...
THE TYPHOON WAS GONE AND WE LIVED
not a single scratch was on any of us we were very happy but sad too
oh well better to just live in the moment than regret the past

The other comment I anticipate is the ""oh I saw a few celebrities who got botox put in their face (botox is not even plastic surgery) and it looks bad"" or something. Ninety percent of the time, they haven't had plastic surgery - they got something like botox or fillers.

The reason she looks so bad is because of fillers and botox which are both nonsurgical. But whatever I don't have to explain that any more than this

Anyways, I'm getting a genioplasty (chin surgery) no matter what. But what I'm confused about is whether it's worth telling anyone about it and what I should do. Should I tell partners etc, I mean is it really any of their business? I mean both of my parents were legitimately attractive but I came out ugly as fuaark for some reason. I'd like to get back some of the genetics I lost lmao

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm not doing this for anyone but myself. I want to look in the mirror and genuinely feel happier with what I see and I'm sure this will do that for me.

I will do “that” because your life is worth more to me than yours. When I say I will do it on a condition; it is “on your life.” Because your life means more to me than mine. You can’t kill yourself unless I do, and that is the reason I can’t. I am still sacrificing for you…even if it is only through my existence…. 

Life is hard, life is complicated, Trump is president and the FBI has to defend ITSELF; I rest my case. Life is hard; especially today…..even “tomorrow’s today” if this survives the “purge” aka the movie. Yeah, I am serious; you still matter. You can’t have a “you” unless you have a “me” looking at you, hoping for you, existing because of you. There is no you without me; and that is quite, literal because I am a Dad.

Purpose defines us. My purpose is you. I have too much to need anything… Need gives you a purpose. Interjection: Fuck you if you want to use this to claim that I think only Moms or Dads matter. Moms and Dads don’t matter unless they teach their kids. I mean, that is humanities job. Teach the youth. If you impede that development, through inequality, you have failed. Yeah, inequality is a vague term. For the purposes of this rant the definition is anything not offered equally to another as an intangible commodity that creates chance. Chance to be as smart as the rich kid who doesn’t care; because of the human-reality…we only want what we don’t have.

For me the simplest term of this expression is in the word responsibility…and it is only relatable (to me) if the responsibility is for another. IF you are motivated for yourself, you went wrong somewhere on the path of existence. Quick find someone! Everyone needs help. 

Tuning out, buzz is killed. I will answer 5 questions a day, because we deserve a chance to be answered if we spend 5 seconds laughing critiquing or whatever. Yeah, I realize I live in the entitled generation.

56,"My mom leaves to work at 4 am, and we usually text each other good morning because I can never sleep. Today, she messaged me and told me to call her as soon as I could. I asked what happened, and she told me that my dad got into a bad car crash. It was yesterday, at around 10 pm. My parents are separated, and he went to drop my brother back off at my moms.

I don't know how to feel. My dad was so shitty to us, all the time. My mom was an illegal immigrant at one point, and he would threaten her to take us away, and get her deported so she'd never see us. He would fuck with her psychologically, and would always make her feel so shitty. He would hit her constantly and yell at me. He used to do a lot of drugs before. My brother was born, and he still was so fucking shitty. My mom had postpartum depression and he certainly didn't help. She tried to kill herself once. He used all our money on drugs, and we were shit poor all the time. Growing up I hated him so much. Now that they're separated I don't see him as much, but my brother does. My brothers is still so small, so he doesn't remember how he was like before. When I think of him, I think of everything he did to us. I had such a shitty childhood because of him, and he tortured my mom for years. But he's still my dad, and still a person. He had dreams and hopes once, and he probably loved at some point. And I know he loves my brother. He hasn't changed completely, but he was slowly getting there, for him.

I've thought of it before, how I would feel if he passed away, and I've always been blank. But when my mom told me, I worried about them first. My mom was married to him and loved him at some point, and my brother loves him so much now. If anything happens to him, I'm worried it'll destroy them.

I'm 8 hours away from them right now, as I'm still at school. I wish I could go there and find out for myself what's going on. I really hope he's okay. My mom told me she'd keep me updated.

Back in september I (M18) meet a really nice girl (F18) via the internet.  
We instantly clicked. We both never dated before, but it went great. We had a lot the same interests and hobbys.  We chatted a lot and meet nearly every weekend for 1-2 month. (we live about 1h apart).   
But before I could tell her how I felt about her, she friendzoned me, by telling me that we are and will be not more than friends.   
I continued ""trying"" for 2 weeks, but she dodged/ignored me more and more. Then I wrote her a long message, telling her how I felt and how she hurt me and that I probably won't write her for a while because of that. She apologized and accepted what I wrote. After that I felt miserable.  
I don't really have friends (got picked on in elementary and kinda introverted) and pushing people away that don't want to date me is probably not the right thing, if I don't want tot be alone. But if I do it, there is the probability that she could hurt me again.  
Now I want to write her again, because she was so perfect and I miss her, but Idk if I really should, if I don't want to fall again for her...

59,I’ve been rewatching Parks &amp; Rec because it’s happy and makes me forget about my troubles. Last night I basically had a Parks and Rec dream with the gang doing goofy loveable things. I think I was coloring Pokémon on a banner for some reason (I also just recently did one of those paint by numbers thing so I think that’s where the coloring came from). Everything took a really dark turn suddenly. Our loveable Leslie Knope was campaigning with a volunteer and gave her a ride home. The poor girl comes running out and is being shot at by her evil red headed brother. The gunshots sounded too real and I felt genuine terror. I woke up paralyzed with fear- it might’ve even been sleep paralysis because I couldn’t make myself move. I could feel the fear like a rod from my chest to my toes. I was also really sweaty and I had passed out with the room really cold. I woke up my SO and made him hold me even though I was already really hot and I don’t usually like being spooned. This is the third nightmare in a week. It wasn’t even what happened in the dream but the fear I felt was so real. ,17Dec2018,1
60,"I don't really know where this should go but I need to get something off my chest. Lately I only feel frustrated with how things are going with my country (Peru). Just how messed up things are becoming, pretty sure it goes like this in other countries but its been affecting me more and more; this is just my opinion from a person who grew up and lives in Lima but a little disconnected with society so if I'm wrong about anything feel free to chip in. This is important since Lima is very very different from other parts of Peru. This... will be sort of a long read.

There's been this... string of corruption since always and things are starting to come to light with the Oderbrecht scandal that involves multiple South American countries. The latest presidents are all being prosecuted and 3 have already been in jail. 3 of these are ""preventive jail"" as in there might be a chance they try to run away so they get prison time. Its so ridiculous that these political figures are being sentenced for 3 years of preventive jail while the prosecutors try to make a case. So there are no charges but allegations and these people are spending 3 years in jail. They should be sentenced whatever should be sentenced through due process, not ""just for show"". 

People charged with terrorism after planning and killing people through bombs and kidnapping are leaving jail and being payed for the time they spent in jail since they are ""revolutionaries"" or ""heroes"" and have had their human rights violated. It just blows my mind how these terrorists who murdered are getting away with it and other people where no evidence have been found of corruption are getting 3 years of jail just through allegations. The prosecutors could potentially just remove their right to leave the country if there is a chance for them to flee. But we're removing their rights to freedom and taking 3 years which is absurd for allegations, which is a violation to human rights. 

One of our presidents being investigated for corruption is now living in the US in Palo Alto having a great time, and I can't believe I'm saying this but seeing as how things are progressing, if I were him I wouldn't come back either since there is a clear absence of due process and almost no chance of him getting a fair trial. Speaking of trials, judges are also getting caught red handed in recordings and other pieces of evidence where they just rig trials. It's absolutely disgusting and makes us citizens feel powerless. 

Corruption is deeply rooted in the culture, cops are stopping people all the time just to see if they can get some extra cash by people looking for the easy way out of trouble just bribing the cops. Not saying all the cops are bad, since they do a very risky service and clearly are not paid enough to risk their lives but hell I don't even know what to say. If you want a better service in some of the public institutions you gotta bribe your way through. Drivers licenses are being handed out left and right just by paying $30 USD or S/. 100 PEN approx making the streets an absolute cluster fuck. Rush hour times are unbearable and could potentially make people take from 1 to 2 hours stuck in traffic compared to a 15 min ride when there are fewer cars. Motorcycles are going on the sidewalks and people don't even think or know why its wrong. Even some cops do this. 

Also, Peru is very centralized in Lima, every day more and more people are coming from different parts of the country to Lima since its the place with the most infrastructure looking for opportunities and that doesn't say much since our infrastructure is pretty bad. You go to anywhere and there are people living in hills since they can't afford property and just claim the land. They can't be kicked out because I don't know and they get very violent and most of the time these people end up as thieves or murderers since they need to get something to eat and nobody is going to hire someone who probably can't even read. 

Education is a thriving business in Peru since public education is so bad. Public universities only take a few amount of people and the process is quite tough, so the average peruvian won't even have a chance to get in them. Private sector is out of the question since it is so expensive so a lot of people don't finish school, and don't even think about going to college. Also these are the same people that vote and choose the president. They know something is wrong but can't do anything about it, easily manipulated through sheer ignorance. George Orwell's Ignorance is Strength propaganda in 1984 really struck a chord in me recently because of this. Those in power know this which is why they aren't doing anything about it and also another reason why there are no decent candidates. Unlike the US where you have 2 major parties, everyone here is independent and some parties have more money than others. Education is becoming unaffordable, private schools increasing prices by insane amounts every year, and public schools being trash, can't really blame kids who decide to become thieves and murderers when they think public education is absolute garbage.

But the drop that spilled the glass for me to write this is a case where one of the most prestigious schools, Markham, is sweeping under the rug a rape case. A US exchange student went to the school and in a party before she went back home she got drugged and raped. This rapist is being protected by who knows since under age laws protect him from his identity being disclosed, most likely the school to avoid losing prestige and his dad who might be a very powerful person since not many people get to afford going to this school. This is utterly embarrassing, the judge archived the case so nothing will be done about it. I can only empathize with the victim and feel fucking shame for my country. Just thought this should get a little international attention since local media is being censored by who knows and only one person is even talking about it on local TV and other news sources just mention it. People are being threatened with their jobs I'm guessing and can't do anything about it. 

Again, things are probably like this in developing countries or even worse but, these are driving me insane, increasingly becoming more depressed as I watch more news were people are getting murdered left and right, cops doing nothing, no plans or projects to better infrastructure in the country, scandal after scandal and more nasty and shady business brought to light just letting citizens know politicians are scum and nothing we can do about it. If you've read till here, well thank you. I'm very upset so I'm sorry if these feels just like poorly worded thoughts. Just ugh wanted to get this out.

62,"Just for background, at one point I was a successful student who was friendly and had almost everything going for me. The only problem was that I didn’t really have friends. I found it easy to become acquainted with people and I can hold a conversation but I felt that a lot of the cliques formed without me and I didn’t have a place. Fast forward a little bit and I am severely depressed and get pulled out of school. Whole life basically goes to shit and now I am just depressed and lonely at home. 

Recently I was taking a photography class at a private school of sorts and I don’t own a camera so I borrowed one from a family friend. 

This is where it starts to get kind of creepy/perverted. I know I am fucked up and I apologize in advance. 

The camera did not belong to the parents of the family friend but to the daughter. She is in college and didn’t need the camera at the time. When I got the camera the sd card was still in it so I looked through/downloaded some of the photos. Fast forward again and I am returning the camera back to the family. The mom tells me that if she is not there that I should leave the camera in the garage. 

As I pull up to drop off the camera I see the dad leaving. I walk up to the door, ring the doorbell and no one answers. I think no one might be home so I could go in and look around her room. I go into the garage and there is no door into the house so I go to check the back door. That is locked too so I give up and go back to the garage to drop the camera off on the washing machine. I think about looking for a hidden key and after about half a second I decided that it would be a waste of time. 

As I am walking out of the garage I see to the side of the door a key hanging from a nail. I stood there for a good 30 seconds before figuring that I would regret if I didn’t go in. 

I put the key in the lock and twist it to the right, nothing happens. I twist it to the left, and the door opens. The house is quiet, it is about 2:30 in the afternoon. I start walking down the hallway, her bedroom door is closed so I open it a crack... “Hello,” I hear from around the corner. I am stunned, I stood there frozen for a second thinking I should just run away and maybe she will think the wind opened the door. I responded. I said how I was just coming to drop her camera back off, how it was nice to see her, and thank her for letting me borrow the camera. I walked back to the garage grabbed the camera, dropped it off to her and left. 

I don’t think that she knows what my intentions were, but I want to go back when no one is there. In my head I know this is completely wrong and fucked up on so many levels, how can I stop myself from doing so/satiate my perversion.

She is smart and confident and has a sweet group of friends, She is not bullied, per se, but I know she doesn’t get included in parties and things that her other friends are (who are not nearly as funny and sweet as she is, and I know that hurts .).  My question is this—- what things can I say to her that will not hurt her feelings?  I feel like I have really failed her in trying to help because I don’t want to crush her spirit    My own mother was and is horribly prejudiced against overweight people it makes me sometimes not even want to speak to her.  I was never overweight as a child or Adult, however my mother would make snide comments about things I was eating and I never want to do that to my daughter. I cannot talk to my husband about it because his entire family is overweight and he accused me of accusing him of giving her “bad genes” and “blaming “ him for her issue. Wtf?  
What are some things that were particularly helpful and what was particularly damaging?  
I honestly feel like it would be better coming from someone else such as a personal trainer or a diet coach but how to go about that??? She goes to college next year and will be out on her own and I’m afraid if we don’t get a handle on it now she will be never able to overcome this especially the blood pressure part.   
I feel like the medical professionals that we have seen never really addressed the weight problem Because they’re also scared to hurt her feelings.  they just wanted to put her on blood pressure meds —really?   
Any thoughts or shared experiences would be so welcome

67,"Hi all. I thought I'd share something that is difficult for me to comprehend. Maybe someone else out there could share a similar experience.

I keep a log in my iPhone notes app of all of the noticeable coincidences that occur in my seemingly uneventful life, because when you're a depressed 20-year-old trying to dig yourself out of a hole you dug for yourself, you cling to what the universe gives you. Lately, though, it seems the coincidences have been closer and closer together, almost every day. Here are a few of my recent logs:

* 10/5/18: At the gym. Put on Brockhampton's new album. 2 minutes later I look at the brand of weights I'm putting on the squat rack. ""Hampton"" 
* 10/6/18: this one is a stretch... Sitting on couch with roommate, where phone is not in her line of sight. I think to myself, *what time do I work tomorrow?* \*opens Google Calendar\* -- ok cool. Also have ""Movie with lil bro @ 5pm"" in there. Google Cal is ""smart"" in that it takes words from event title and inserts a picture to the event -- for instance, since my event was ""movie"" they put a little cartoon of popcorn and soda as the event image. Not even 5 seconds later, roommate says ""will you make that popcorn on the calendar for me?"" and I'm like ""how the fuck did you -- wha-what?"" She looked at me like I was nuts and repeated herself, ""will you make that popcorn on the counter for me?"" 
* 10/8/18: I'm vacuuming my room. Self Control by Frank Ocean is playing in my head. I'm singing it loud and proud, because why the fuck not? Turn off the vacuum. 10 seconds pass, and the very same song starts playing on my stereo. (mind you, this was a Tame Impala Spotify station.) This one brought tears to my eyes, not gonna lie.
* 10/10/18: 8am, about to leave house. Think about writing ""have a good day roommate"" on the whiteboard, but being in a rush I didn't. Came back later that day, and roommate had written ""have a great day roommate"" on the whiteboard.
* 10/11/18: At the park with my goodboye. I come to find he is digging a hole (quite uncharacteristic of him). To divert his attention, I kick a ball near him. He runs up to it and kicks it (yes, we play soccer. would recommend) and the ball rolls into the freshly-dug hole. The brand of the ball is ""Gopher""

That's just a few things. The list is long. But today... today was something different. The days leading up to today, I've felt something that I can't quite put my finger on. Almost like a shift in the cosmos -- or, at least, my cosmos. Like the universe was trying to tell me I'm doing something right. It probably sounds wonky but hear me out.

I produce music and write songs, and though I'm very passionate about it, I am also very new to it. The past few days, though, I've just had a lot of a-ha moments, where things just start to fall into place. I'm really vibing lately, and things just gel in the studio, you know?

I saw a shooting star last night. I've seen them before, but this one was huge compared to any other I've seen before. It was just incredible and it left me in tears. For some reason it made me want to pray, so I closed my eyes and whispered a little thank you to the universe.

Now, today. Just now. I'm watching a [video on music theory history.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M33cRNx3ohI) The narrator begins talking about Chopin's *Prelude in E minor*, suggesting to the viewer that they ought to listen to it. I've never heard it, at least to my knowledge. So I do. Cool, the majority of Western music can be traced back to Chopin, and everything follows the theme of tension -&gt; resolution.

15 minutes later I'm trying to pinpoint a certain sound. It's the instrument played at the beginning of the song [Life Itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52ZCcAoTzlw) by Glass Animals (sounds like an Asian string instrument). So I go listen to the song. Scroll through the comments like I always do, for whatever reason. Someone commented ""cock"" which made me giggle like a schoolboy. *View 4 replies. \*click\** a YouTuber by the name of The Nev Potato comments ""Dock, Mock , Lock , Calk.﻿"" *What interesting vernacular* I thought. Clicked on their name, goes to their channel. Only 2 videos. Watch one of the videos, titled [My friend had a mental breakdown over Bluetooth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSGdCdQhPos). What music have they chosen to represent the theme of the situation in the video, you ask? Well, I'll tell you. Chopin's *Prelude in E minor*.

Soon after, the lights flicker and a loud noise rattled from all around. *Probably just a power surge,* I tried to rationalize-- and I'm sure that's what it was. Just then, an overwhelming sense of... something came over me. I want to say power but I'm not sure that's the right word. Perhaps energy is the better word. A profound presence. The cumulation of it all caused my eyes to well up. I crouched over and said a humble prayer, thanking the cosmos for living through me. I didn't know what else to say, and I don't know how else to describe the situation. I'm not a religious person. I go to church every now and again with my little brother (he's 3) but life's hardships and my cynicism make it difficult to hold that belief strong. I've fucked up a lot in life, probably made more bad decisions than good. But, I'm a good person, and I want to be a benefactor to human existence. Lately, I've really tried to be that ideal human, making more of the right decisions, being more selfless, caring and genuine. Little things. (microdosing has helped with this process)

I'm humbled by this experience. It may not seem like a big deal from the outside looking in, but as I said, when you suffer from depression &amp; PTSD, you take what you can get. Has anyone else had a similar experience, who could perhaps more eloquently put my feelings into words?

Thank you for reading.",17Dec2018,1
68,I dream too much every night and those dreams are too vivid they woke me up in the middle of the night. And the next day it feels like i haven’t been sleeping much even though I’m in bed for 7-8 hours. Is this some kind of disorder?,17Dec2018,1
69,"For the past couple years I've been traveling the world. I spent the majority of my time in Bulgaria. I'm an American. 

Bulgaria was the happiest time of my life because I had an amazing girlfriend, social circle, lifestyle, etc. 

Eventually they wouldn't let me stay any longer so I had to go (immigration rules). It was so painful and I was quite depressed. 

I kept traveling, then returned back to Bulgaria when I could several months later. Again I was so happy. Eventually me and my girlfriend broke up... she was my everything, so amazing. 

The relationship was incredible but unfortunate circumstances we weren't prepared for is what tore us apart. I desperately wish I could go back in time to prepare us for the dangers we were about to face so we could handle things differently and stay together. 

Now I'm back ""home"" in the USA. I feel so disconnected. I don't belong in this city anymore. I'm even slightly disconnected from my family and I feel like my friends &amp; ex-girlfriend in Bulgaria took better care of me when times were tough. 

I have an internet job so I can work anywhere in the world. That's great until you travel the whole world, trip out, feel like everything is a matrix simulation, and have no roots anywhere. 

A part of me considers moving to Bulgaria... like fully immigrating to be with my friends there. It was definitely the most ""at home"" I ever felt in my life. 

The other part of me is so shocked at the idea of it. I never thought I'd be considering leaving the USA at this age! The other part of me just wants to settle somewhere in the USA and hopes that if I put in the same amount of effort into building a life that I did into Bulgaria I'll be just as happy. 

I just can't tell whether *Sofia, Bulgaria* made me happy or I was happy because at the time I was there I had the best apartment, most money, best friends, and best girlfriend of my entire life. 

It feels like I lost everything. Back in Phoenix, even now, it all feels like a dream. Everything is so trippy. I need to leave Phoenix and settle in a home rather than this nomadic craziness that I've done for the past couple years. 

With the whole world at my fingertips, I just don't know how to pick a home in the USA, or if I should leave for Bulgaria. I'm so disconnected nothing makes sense life &amp; reality is just so strange. ",17Dec2018,1
71,"I am a 25 year old female who’s very petite, I’m 106 pounds and 5’2. I have small boobs (32B) and I hate them. I’m so self conscious about them and seeing women in everyday life with great cleavage and a bigger chest makes me feel horrible about myself. I’ve been bullied throughout my school life about them, even my friends would joke about me and call me a 12 year old boy because my chest is small. I have a boyfriend who loves them and constantly says they’re amazing and sexy but I can’t help feeling bad about it all the time. Is there any other woman who feels super insecure about her small boobs? What should I do to accept them... what should I do when people make jokes about them? ",17Dec2018,1
73,"I have always felt like I was female, ever since I was very young. My family and everyone around me has always been extremely welcoming and accepting of this fact. I wanted to wear girl’s clothes? Fine. I wanted to keep my hair long? Again, fine. I wanted to change my name? They wouldn’t legally change it too early on, but they would very consistently call me by my first name. Even my grandparents, great-aunts and other elderly relatives did their very best to make me feel welcome…

But to cut a long story short… I just, don’t feel well. I feel like a fraud. Even now. I’m twenty-five years old. I have gone through the whole circus. Through all the treatments and operations, the legal name changes, the whole epic struggle of “becoming me”. Now I stand here and I feel… empty inside. Completely and utterly, weirded out by myself. Because I am not, who I wanted to be. All the money my family spent on my happiness, and I still feel, less-then. And I cannot say it to anyone for fear of making them sad of all their efforts being somehow ‘wasted’. If that makes any sense?

I’m tall and gangly. I have large, thick hands, and thick wrist with a wrist bone sticking a little out. Broad, long fingers and bulbous knuckles. Manicures and cremes and nail polish cannot hide the fact that these are the hands of a man. My shoulders are wide, and while hormones have had some effect on making them less massive then they would have otherwise become, they are still far wider then I feel they should be – my family consists of very big-boned people, and it just… shows. My fat distribution is now that of a woman, my body gained some curves, but my skeleton is and always will be that of a man. Even my own voice weirds me out. I cannot listen to it being recorded. In my own head I sound like that old guy from the BBC wildlife programs. 

Part of me regrets what I have done. Part of me regrets my transitioning. Because I tried so hard to become something I could never truly be. My genes, my chromosomes, my bone structure. The fact that I can never carry a child of my own. I could have stored sperm, the doctor mentioned before my final operation it was “a possibility” but he also warned me that it was expensive… I never did it. I was eighteen years old and dumb. I’ve spent the next seven years after my operation, after my recovery, trying to come to terms with my new, improved self. But I don’t feel improved. I feel broken. And I am not sure if, and how, I would ever feel unbroken. 

Don’t get me wrong, I hated being in a male body. I would have been in hell had I remained in one. But the hell I was in once, never stopped. I’m still in hell. I still don’t like myself. I still feel fake. I feel like a fraud. Like a freak. I wish I wasn’t born this way. I wish I wasn’t born at all. But I pretend to be happy, when I am with my family and friends. I pretend to be complete. I pretend that I am now fulfilled, satisfied, that my story is a success story. Truth is, there is no success in my life story. There are no victories. Well maybe a few small battles I won. A few small hurdles I took and obstacles I overcame. But in spite of those battles, I feel like I’ve lost the war. I feel like I lost the war the day I was born.

Maybe this is going to be a little long, but I doubt someone will actually read this.

&amp;#x200B;

 I am a 20-year-old male living away from home for university, I am Italian and live in Italy.   

&amp;#x200B;

UNIVERSITY:

I'm in the middle of my second year of University, I study computer science. Out of all the seven exams of the first year, I only passed 2. One out of pure copying skills and the other because it was a subject I had already studied in high school. I haven't passed all of the others because I can't study. Literally, I procrastinate until the very last day before the exam and learn none of the things I'm supposed to. As a matter of fact, I should be studying right now. During the first year I failed 14 exam attempts. My parents are spending a lot of money for the rent (I live in a very expensive city. My family is middle class, but not insanely rich), I told my dad I could look for a small job to pay the rent, but he said no because he thinks I will only think about it and not study. Every time I go home during the holidays I bring 0 results with me. I've been thinking of dropping out of university for a while now, also for some reasons I will explain later. The problem with dropping out and going back home is that where I come from there are literally 0 working opportunities. 

&amp;#x200B;

RELATIONSHIP:

I have never had a girlfriend (one, if you count a two-week story during middle school), so I'm really not that good with women, what they want, and how they want it. This summer I've met a girl in my hometown, and I fell in love with her the same day I met her (I'm not even sure I love her, she's not the kind of woman I always have thought I liked, but somehow I do, and there isn't a day that I don't wake up and fall asleep with her in my mind). Now, there are some problems. I might have already fucked up all my chances, as I told her I liked her the day after we met, and she rejected me, without saying a clear no (it might have been not to hurt my feeling, but I don't really know). After that, we spoke every day over Instagram, and we became really good friends.  I am now home and I am planning on telling her what I feel, but I'm obviously afraid (and almost sure) she will reject me definitely, and even if I think I am prepared for it, I don't actually know how my brain and heart will react to it, but I fear for the worst (as always). As I already said, I'm not good with women and I don't know if she dropped some hints along the way while talking, but my best friend (who was with us the day we met, and can read people very well) says that there is something between us (I doubt it, or my low self-esteem does). However, if she miraculously feels something for me as well, another problem arises, I will go away the first week of January and come back in the middle of April, for Easter. So this MIGHT be one of the reasons I could consider dropping out of Uni and go back home.  
FRIENDSHIP:  
I have made no friends in University. For a year and a half, I have been alone, with nobody to talk to, hang out with, and study with. Most of the days I go to University in the morning and then go back to my room and get out the morning after, not even speaking with my flatmates, who already have their friends and girl/boyfriends. I have no one, I am alone 1200 km (roughly 750 miles) away from my family and my (few friends). The few times I drag myself out of my room I drink and walk alone, thinking of how my life sucks and how I'd rather be sleeping or dead. I haven't any social skill, I'm insecure and have low self-esteem (thanks middle school and high school bullies). I am considering changing University and going to the one my best friend attends, a one-hour drive away from my hometown.

&amp;#x200B;

MENTAL HEALTH:

My mental health was never good to begin with. I have always had low self-esteem because of my weight (I'm just a bit overweight, I'm not obese) and my height (I was bullied for it, as I already said before) and a lot of self-hatred for not having the will and the force to improve any aspect of my life and my person. I think I started developing depression around January, after failing my first exams, and it got worse during October (the reason being the girl above) (note that I have not been diagnosed with depression *yet*, so everything is supposed). I constantly think of being a useless human being, of being a disgrace to my parents, who are the most workaholic people I know, they manage to start a task and bring it to an end without procrastinating and without complaining, while I can't even study 2 days in a row for a fucking university exam. I think that my friends and the people I know fake caring about me just because they feel pity for me, even my grandmothers and my parents, the sweetest people I know. I constantly think about death and suicide, but I've never attempted it and I doubt I ever will, I'm not brave enough (or I'm too brave to live, depends on the point of view) to do it, and my parents would be sad and disappointed. I struggle to find even a quality in my character and in my body or even a reason to love me, and this leads me to think that an awful human being like me doesn't deserve any love, and that I deserve being rejected or totally ignored by every girl I met and know. I should be at the prime of my life, having lots of sex, lots of friends, lots of fun in the biggest and most young-friendly city in Italy, but all I do is drink cheap beer and listen to 15-year-old music sitting in the dark on my bed while having an existential crisis. I think solitude plays a big role here, because when I go back home I almost don't feel any of these things (almost).

I'm planning on visiting the University's psychologist when I go back, because it's free and because I feel like I must do something about my life, I can't stand living the rest of my life like this. Also, I already know he/she will lead me to a ""real"" paid psychologist, but if it can help me, I'll happily accept it.

76,"Sentimentality is truly a bitch. I can't hear a song that I used to listen on repeat years ago and reminisce on those times, constantly festering on them. There's nothing fun about it. All I do is wish I could go back and rewind the clock. What if I want to enjoy that song again without getting flashed back immediately? It's as if I wish I could reset my brain so I don't have to suffer through those happy memories.

I know that sounds contradictory...how could thinking of *happy* memories depress me? Well, it's just that things aren't the same, and knowing I can't do anything to make them how they were is *not* a good feeling. I'm not gonna lie, it triggers anxiety/panic attacks in me sometimes even.

How on earth can I better deal with this? *Is* there an effective method I don't know about that can reset my brain? Would meditation help? Being sentimental is torture, and in my perspective is a useless characteristic that we as humans have.

Is it a defense/coping mechanism we've inherited from our ancestors or something? Because other than bringing negative tears to your eyes, it doesn't do much else.",17Dec2018,1
77,"This summer I got a new job doing install work that I love and made the best money I ever made. Only thing... it was a summer job, now I can’t start again til next summer. I decided a couple months ago to try out selling that same type of work. I needed some income and they offered a sign on bonus. I signed a contract saying I would work 90 days or have to pay back the entire bonus. I hate this job and find it very difficult to keep myself going since I am not even getting by. I’ve been making about $300 per week. I have two kids and a wife to support and at this point I’m just going through the motions until I hit the 90 days. With Christmas coming up I can’t even afford to buy my wife a present. We took care of the kids earlier when we had money. I also drove across the USA for this job and left my family back home to see if I could get things rolling here before making a permanent move. My manager knows I’m struggling and talked with me about it and I told him everything I’ve written here. He was very positive and trying to help me out but said plenty of guys quit and never pay the bonus back. I don’t think I should do that but faking it here is so depressing. I’m ready to pack up and drive home in the morning but my wife doesn’t support that idea. I figure I could be at home working any other kind of job where the income is not dependent on my abilities to sell and create income but rather show up to work, do the work and get paid. For my sanity I just want to go home. But I have this bonus payback weighing over my head. This next month we have to go into debt for rent, food, etc.  it doesn’t make logical sense to stay here when I could be making money even if I have to pay the bonus back. I would have to work about 25 more days to hit the 90 days. What would you do if you were in my spot? Do you have any advice? Suggestions? Help?",17Dec2018,1
79,"Worry has literally done nothing for me in my life. When I was in high school, I thought it was a good thing b/c it would at least force me to do my best and triple-check on things. But looking back, it didn't really make a huge difference. In fact, I was so damn paranoid on doing poorly on the ACT that I spend **way** more time on the ACT instead of my GPA. I blind-sided myself and wasn't able to get the full-ride that I wanted as a result. It's funny, because I've made peace with that ordeal, right? I see it as, not something horrible that happened, but just something that *happened.* But I've come across too many people that fall into two habits that has screwed me over constantly: 1) allowing fear to paralyze you 2) not asking for help

You have a goal right? Let's say it a HUGE goal, something that very few have done. Something that people deem as lofty or even put you down for. If you spend every day working towards it while also finding new ways to improve your process and routine, then you WILL achieve that goal. And if things don't work out the first time, it will work out eventually as long as you keep pushing forward. Now, let's say 2 or 3 or 10 years down the line, you've achieved it. How would you want to look back on your journey? Would you rather see it as a long period of fear and paranoia that gave you nothing, especially since it all worked out? Or would you rather see yourself having fun everyday, and working to achieve your goal while also concentrating on the little things, pleasures. Family, friends, hobbies, relationships, relaxation, experience, travel etc.? Take a deep breath and do what needs to be done.

I have fucking no one to talk to and end up just thinking, pulling myself deeper and deeper into thia hole. I start blaming myself and hating myself and still no one gives a fuck.

But I only got worse. I held her up, and now that she is happy, she can't bother to pull me up with her. She broke her promise. If anybody had responded, i would have started with People always leave. And they do. Every single person I have been anything more than aquantices with have left. No one stays. She was someone I completely trusted. She knew me best. And she threw that away. She doesn't care. 

I am on the verge of self destructing. Calling people out on social media.

I need to decide if I'm going back to college or not, starting this next semester. I need to decide this week and commit.

I want into cybersec, and I want to be able to hold a job. Trying to teach myself which is fine. The degree will only help open up doors.

The problem is, I'd need to pivot immediately. I'm not getting younger. I'm 24. I have at least 3 years left for a bachelor's degree. I can't be a fuckup when I'm 30, I want to actually have my shit together ASAP. I'll need to take on loans... Community college first of course,  so I have time to set that up.

I'll need to move back in with my parents maybe; but they're... terrible. I love them but their house is literally falling apart, and it's disgusting. Living in my own apartment, keeping it super clean, has been the best living experience for this past year. It'll be hard to go back.

So what if I don't go back to school? I'd live on my own and grind it out. Maybe I won't totally be reaching my potential later in life. Maybe I can't work where I want to. It's all a lot more uncertain.

My current job is a sinking ship, or a ship barely holding together. I'm paid 16/hr essentially to handle a big workload. I do everything from sysadmin to helldesk to putting together new network environments for clients. I communicate with my clients professionally, but I maintain that relationship and a lot of them like me and think they can rely on me. The problem is the workload keeps increasing and people are leaving with no replacements but my pay isn't increasing.

I'm so mad. I've been putting it off. Trying to get to next week, next month, through this ticket or that ticket. Gotta put off getting a haircut or watch how much I drive or not buy replacements for my shoes that are falling apart.

I'm so mad because I can do more than just survive. I'm not satisfied here. If this is what I have to look forward to - just surviving? - I don't see the point.

I have to stop letting things slide by until it hits me and I hide in a bathroom vomiting my thoughts onto a small cell screen or mentally scream from the stress.

I ripped off his t-shirt, yanked his shorts off, threw off his socks and sneakers into the kitchen. I hauled him up by the waistband of his boxers and dragged him towards the backdoor.

He was begging me to stop, and then I saw his little white buttcrack and had an even better idea.

""You know what? You can use some sun.""

I yanked those off, spun them around my finger, smacked him on his bare ass and locked him right out of our house, butt-ass NAKEDDDDDD hahaha.

I looked at his friend and said ""Don't you DARE fucking help him!"" and called back the boy to apologize.

I turned to see his friend opening the door for him and again the anger took over.

2 minutes later, his friend was right there out with him. 

With a smack on the ass and just as naked as his friend. (Must admit: Cute round white butt on that geek, who knew?! Lol)

They were both a fucking sight.

Two little 5'7 chubby freshmen, tanned from the neck up but lily-white from the neck down, both with chubby bellies jiggling, desperately covering their little penises with 1 hand and banging on the door with the other hahaha. I'm sure their plump bare butts were jiggling up a storm behind them.

I waited a few minutes snuck out of the front of the house, and snuck up next to them.

""SAY CHEESE BOYS!"" as I snapped a hilarious photo.

Two naked virgin geeks. Both looking at the camera, eyes wide, mouths open. Chubby bellies in full view. Bare ass cracks in full view.

I told them if they ever messed with me again, the pic would be my profile photo on Facebook.

They have been on best behavior ever since.",17Dec2018,1

It's completely normal and part of a balanced masturbation session. There's people out there who masturbate to children which is sick and disgusting so masturbating to an adult cartoon character shouldn't be criticized.",17Dec2018,1
89,"I graduated college a year and a half ago.  I hadn't had any experience in my chosen field, though not for lack of trying/applying to internships each summer.  As a result, I had to complete three unpaid internships after I graduated and then a short grad program before I actually started getting consistent interviews.  All the while I was getting more and more angry.  I realized that my situation was hardly unique, but still, it felt like everyone else was moving on, moving out and moving upward in the world while I was still an unemployed loser living with my parents.

That all changed today.  I applied for a job that wasn't exactly where i expected to end up, but is actually a really great opportunity.  And the best part is I'll be working in both English and Spanish (I'm a native English speaker but studied Spanish in college and it's really not a skill I want to lose, but until I got this job didn't see how I'd manage to practice enough every day to stay fluent)!  I'm so excited because soon I'll have money, I'll be growing in skill areas that I really care about, and I can start the next chapter of my life!",17Dec2018,1
90,"So, a bit of a backstory... I was raped repeatedly when I was younger and have suffered from PTSD ever since. One of the most gut wrenching things that I’ve had to deal with is dissociation/panic during sex. 

Shortly after I was raped I got into a serious relationship with a guy and ended up dating him for 3 years. I never told him about my dissociation until the tail end of our relationship. He knew I had been in therapy for a long time but didn’t know sex was something I was trying to work on. Once he found out, he broke up with me a few weeks later. I found out a week after we split that he had started cheating on me after I told him about my trouble with sex. Asshole. 

Anyway, after we broke up I started to go out a lot more with my friends and they helped push me back in the dating saddle. I dated a couple of guys here and there but wouldn’t have sex because I was terrified of it. I could never get past that mental barricade. Eventually I worked up the courage to hookup and then boom. It turned into an out of body experience and I’d have a panic attack shortly after. I never felt I’d be able to have sex normally. I was devastated. 

Fast forward a year and a half and I started dating my current partner. He’s absolutely incredible and I knew instantly that I’d marry him when we met. I worked up the courage to sleep with him and.... nothing happened. It was amazing. Fantastic. I felt as if he had lifted the veil and allowed me to experience life and love in a whole new light. Trust has everything to do with it, but the fact that it was so so hard for me to trust anyone is a huge step forward. I told him he was the first person I’ve never experienced dissociation/panic  with during sex and he just hugged me and held me and told me how much he loved me. 

I just wanted to share my joy!",17Dec2018,1
92,"I pooped twice today. The first one was really dark. I attributed that to the Malbec wine I drank last night.

The second poop burned! And I knew that was from spicy chicken sandwiches I had a few hours after the wine",17Dec2018,1
93,"After a few seconds my roommate woke up and went ""It's okay, I'm just having a bad dream"", and the seizure released itself.  I did some stretches for a bit before falling back asleep.

So I woke up feeling like I was dying because my roommate was silently having a bad dream.  Must've been a toxin his pores were releasing or something going on with his spinal cord creating tension that mine picked up on, and when I woke up with tension it woke him up and we both got released.",17Dec2018,1

96,"Been together since right after high school. We are both 26 now and already have a wedding date. A few months after the proposal, I started to have second thoughts, with these thoughts being more and more prevalent the past few months.

She's a good person, and didn't do anything new that caused me to start having these thoughts, but as I've thought about it more, I feel there are certain values I want in my family and my children that she doesn't share (no drinking of alcohol, certain values I want to instill in my children). We disagree on some other things such as money, however I am confident that can be sorted out before the wedding and we can be on the same page.  


I do care about her and love her, but there definitely isn't that spark that has been there in the past. I had these thoughts before proposing, but they faded away so I decided to propose, but now they're back stronger than ever.

Sometimes I feel like the best thing for me is to end the relationship, focus on my life for a while and eventually find a woman who is also muslim so that our values are similar.  


I know this post is all over the place, but I need to know if my thoughts are normal, or at least some ideas for what I should do. I think I'm going to speak with a marriage counselor, and I also think I need to speak with my fiance in depth about my concerns - I've spoken a little bit, but nothing concrete.  


In the end I know it's going to be up to me and what standards I'm okay with, but I'd love any input.",17Dec2018,1
97,"I don’t ever take chances with people I ever get feelings for just cause I don’t want to ruin friendships and whatnot.

I finally built up the courage to talk to a girl I had been crushing on and she didn’t even acknowledge me except for a glance at me.

98,Does it ever stop? It really doesn't seem like it does. Even when things are looking bright I'm so soon struck with the same kind of thoughts and feelings and I hurt myself again and again. I just want to stop breathing and leave.,17Dec2018,1
99,"Recently (within the past 3 months or so), I have had no real motivation to do anything, before i get more into that let me say a little about me, 

I am a 17 year old male in England, studying a level 3 course in travel and tourism in college(England college, not US) I did the level 2 version of this last year in college as well. That's all you need to know for now

Anyways, I have had ZERO motivation to do anything but kind of force myself to do small things anyways, but even the small things i dont do much at all simple things like taking plates, glasses etc downstairs. I have also noticed myself getting more and more arguementitive with my Mum, who i love so much by the way, she is amazing, and i know i should not be getitng angry at her, but for some reason my temper is really, really short with anyone at the moment, one of my college teachers from my first year of college said today to a couple of people in the room as i went out of it ""what has happened to awayyouthrowplease, he was much happier last year and funner to teach, what has happened to him this year? I have not noticed any difference between last year and this year in college but have in the rest of my life. I really have no clue what is going on, I am pretty close to being kicked out of college, for low level things, like being late, not showing up etc, again this did not happen last year, and talking when i shouldnt be, very small things that have just been building up over the past few months. I want to know what i can do to stop this from happening and get my life back to normal? Nothing has changed since last year, still getitng the same amount of sleep as i was. 

For some reason this year it has dawned on me how close i am to being on my own and having to get a job, I have no life goals at the moment apart from living abroad somewhere, no job goals at all, I have tried speaking to a few people about the no real life goal situation and they all just say ""well you'll find something, you dont need to choose a job you want for life, just something to start"" 

Literally yesterday i got a job at an Indian takeaway shop and kind of enjoyed working there, just taking orders but the moment i got home i started thinking about going back and working there and it literally made me sit up in bed and just sit there thinking about how fucked i am, as i cant even motivate myself to go in for a job i just got. 

Anyways, i know this was a long post and kind of went off topic but im just looking for something that i can do to sort this out, thank you.",17Dec2018,1
