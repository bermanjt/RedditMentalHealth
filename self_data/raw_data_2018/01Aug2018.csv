0,"For the past three years my ability to socially interact with others got worse and worse and now I can't even call people (except for people I know well) without having to mentally prepare myself for 20 minutes. Today I wanted to call someone for a paid survey but I just couldn't. When I dare to call, I often stutter, tumble over my words, forget to breathe and then have to inhale because I don't want to interrupt my sentence.

When I talk to others (mostly just strangers but sometimes even with my friends) I'm stammering and am all over the place and don't know how to articulate my thoughts. Often I try to form sentences in my head to prepare myself but when I try to say it, it gets stuck in my throat and I'm panicking.

1,"So lately in my life or past couple of years, I've been really bad at making friends and losing them.

I've lost a friend years ago, due to a strict mother and her accusations of words I said. That started from there, and the friends I made from her didn't want to talk to me at all. I was never given a side to tell my story and I was made to be a monster.

I lost one friend from an abusive relationship, we use to be close spending the night. When I was in a relationship, I vented on Facebook (which made me learn a lesson) she would never message me and liked comments that said: If you stay then you are stupid or it's your fault for you staying.

After the first friendship, I had another friend, for at least a couple of years. I accidentally messed up and she straight up went crazy on me. She told me that I couldn't have depression and that she needed proof that I have a mental illness. And that I disrespected her. This was because I told her mom about what happened to us..

And lately, I lost another friend when I opened up to her. She was one of the people that made a comment about me being in a abusive relationship. I tried to explain that the comment she made really damaged me. She said: I've been there for you and you hurt me! She then blocked me without explaining fully what I meant and that I was gonna show her what she meant but she didn't let me finished..

I only have one friend that doesn't judge me and listens to me but it makes me sad that I feel like I lost so many good people in my life. And I feel like it's my fault for causing so many things. Am I at fault or is it just the people I pick?

7,"Like I can talk with girls, that's fine. I can also speak with girls I'm attracted to. But when I'm talking with the latter I just constantly feel like I want to dig a hole and dip my head in there. Or physically hide, get into the fetal position, and shut my eyes to pretend it isn't happening. Worse yet is when I start thinking I have some chance with them because then my head runs amok with thoughts/fantasies. I have had a few bad experiences caused by that so now I just try to shut them down as soon as they happen and become frustrated with myself when I can't stop.

It's pretty bad with one girl. I'm sort of good friends with her in that we've hanged out and given each other advice a few times. But we have some prior history and now I get super uncomfortable when I'm alone with her. I intellectually know that we're a bad match, we both agreed it wouldn't work out between us. There are several red flags I can see that just point out it's not good. Yet I can't stop thinking about her, not as bad as it was a year and a half ago but it's still a semi-daily thing I do. It's not limited to her either, it seems super easy for me to start fantasizing when I interact with a girl I like. It's not like I have horrible social skills (I can be a little awkward at times but so is everyone) so I tend to become friends with them, which honestly makes it worse since I get even more opportunities to be around them. All these thoughts make me nervous and anxious, borderline agony for me. I'm not creepy about it or whatever they just cause me a lot of distress because I want to live my life but instead I'm worrying about some girl I'm not even hooking up with.

I don't like actively pursuing women as a result. I get panic attacks when I start to take the first step. I really dislike it because on one hand I want to get in a relationship with a chick, on the other hand my fear and past history scream at me to stop whatever I'm doing and dip. So while I can talk comfortably, my body behavior tells the other person I'm uncomfortable, so people get mixed signals of how I really think and feel.

I think I got my main point across. I'm tired of feeling conflicted of what to do in regards to women I'm attracted to. I already have depression and general anxiety, I don't want to avoid attractive women because I'm worried of potential flare-ups just by hanging with them. I feel bad that I contribute to someone's discomfort and want to remedy both of ours by learning how to be more comfortable around them. I have my meeting with my therapist tomorrow so I'll go ahead and bring it up, I'm just really tired of dealing with this BS. A recent flare-up in depression is taking a huge toll on me and I don't want to worry about romantic stuff right now, I'm just trying to keep my head above the water.

I would appreciate any assistance given, thank you in advance.",01Aug2018,2
8,"Today i was in this crash course on gas chromatography. Just a fancy name to an equipment that separates and analyzes stuff.

Anyway. We were in a group and our task was to analyze how much caffeine there was in a coke can. We had to make some initial analysis, but since we didn’t know how much caffeine we were going to find, we had to decide some initial parameters to run the equipment and see how much should we adjust it on the next iteration. It wasn’t to complex, but we had to optimize our conditions to get good data. 

There were these two women who were discussing how should we do it. But they weren’t having a consensus because both of them (and also the rest of the group) was still figuring out what to do. 

Somebody asked them what our first steps should be and they were just standing there, clueless. So I decided some initial conditions that made sense based on the theory we had and was ready to start working. 

But then they stopped me. Why was I doing this and not like that? Why do this first and not the other thing?

To illustrate how annoying it was, imagine yourself having to do the laundry and you have two piles of clothes, whites and colored. I said “let’s wash the whites first” and they were “why not the colored ones first?”... which was the same thing, just in a different order that wasn’t going to influence one another. So I didn’t bothered and just said “ok, let’s do the colored then.”

I don’t know why but the fact I didn’t argue and just accepted made them think i was kind of angry. Although I wasn’t, they were like “no, ok, don’t be mad r/mvpetri, we can do the whites first”, or “we can do it your way.”  Woman, it is not my way. It is one of the ways. Who cares, let’s just begin. Each run on the equipment takes 20 minutes and we have a few to do!

I didn’t say that but I think my face showed a little bit, so in order to not be angry at anyone who were just trying to learn something (albeit being annoying for no reason) I let them decide and started talking to the other group. 

I waited a little bit and then returned. I said “ok, what dilutions you decided? I can make them.”

The response was: “we haven’t them yet, what concentration you think we should make?” Which I replied “hmm, the other group made this one but the equipment wasn’t able to read it, so let’s do a little bit higher. I can make X and test it”

And then one of them said “why X? What if X is to low?”

The worst part: the girl that was arguing the most left the class after 30 minutes. We were there for 3 more hours and did all the work and she didn’t even see it. We almost didn’t get what we wanted at the end. 

It amazes me. Why argue without an argument? Why just don’t go with other people’s suggestions and build upon? Or at least suggest something concrete? We were there at the same level, learning the same stuff. I don’t mind if you reject my suggestion, or that “you always did this that way so let’s try it”. We are a group, let’s not be a barrier to one another.

And be professional. If I reject my own suggestion so you can have yours is not for spite, it is just because yours is as good as mine and I want to get the job done.

12,"In a couple of days I move away to start an internship. This is the first time I will be away from home without someone close to me. I’m going to a new place, with a new language, and I don’t know a single person. I will truly be alone for the first time ever. On top of the anxiety and building depression, I’ve basically just been called useless by the owner of the company I will be interning for. I was given about 3 1/2 weeks notice for this internship, and during this time I was given about 50 hours of video to watch plus another 75ish developing an app. During this time I’ve maintained a full time job + overtime (I need the money to support myself  during this internship) so I haven’t been able to learn everything I wanted to learn. About a week ago I was given a test to turn in, I turned it in and that’s when the owner basically called me useless. I put in so many hours, so much effort, just to be called useless. The anxiety that’s building inside is starting to effect my physique, lost 10 lbs in 2 days while keeping the same routine as normal. I can feel all my negative emotions coming out telling me to cancel the internship. Everybody around me is very supportive of me, and most have high expectations, but so far I’ve only let people down, and I haven’t started this journey yet. 

Any thoughts or opinions on what I should do is appreciated. I’m just very confused with my thoughts, and my doubts about this are starting to overwhelm my head. Maybe I should stay close to home, I know I can be successful here, but this opportunity could change my life completely.",01Aug2018,1
13,"So I havent talked to my best friend since the end of May since she pissed me off so much that I snapped and broke everything off in that moment. She pushed me too far, she was selfish and awful. In the time away immediately it was nice, but after awhile I missed us before we started falling out. So, last week I called her and she missed me too but was too scared to apologize. We are on good terms and now want to catch up badly. I was very busy, leaving openings specifically for her to hang out with me, but the fact was she wasn’t doing the same for me in her schedule. I was getting a bit frustrated but then suddenly I thought, “she knows you want to hang out, reminding her constantly isn’t going to change anything. You put yourself out there, its up to her to continue. If she isn’t going to hold you to the same level, why care? I will see her when I see her, I was fine without her for some months.”

Just after that I was so surreal. It was like everything made sense and was calm. I lost all stress immediately and it put things into perspective. I don’t need to chase people for shit to happen. If they really love me I shouldn’t have to pry for them to show it. Hopefully someone else who reads this can see this too.",01Aug2018,7
14,"...and I can't vent anywhere because no one in this world's Darwinian society cares. ""Suck it up,"" they say. ""Everyone else is doing it,"" they say. ""Quit yer winging,"" they say. Can't cope with having to work for a living and all the other responsibilities you have? You're a useless ""Peter Pan"" loser, according to top psychologists like Jordan Peterson. 

I live in a foreign country with lots of opportunities, lots of healthy choices, and a healthcare system that won't bankrupt me because of my chronic conditions. I have hobbies I love. I have friends. I have a girlfriend. I have decent income and can save a decent amount of money each month. I don't hate my job. For the most part, I enjoy my job. I only work 4 days a week, 15 weeks at a time, with 6-8 weeks of vacation between each term. By all accounts I should be happy. Instead I'm bitter because I never have the time and energy to fully enjoy life outside of work. I'm bitter because I can never do or be what I want. 

What do I want to do? I want to come home from work and spend all my time on my hobbies. What do I want to be? I want to build some muscle and get fit because I'm a scrawny 58kg chopstick. But no. When I'm off work, groceries need to be bought, meals need to be cooked, laundry needs to be laundered, rooms need to be cleaned, essays need to be graded, tests need to be made, lessons need to be planned, research papers need to be written. Oh, and I lose 13 hours a week to commuting. That's an entire ***day*** of awake time that could be used on hobbies and exercise. I get home too mentally exhausted to do any of my hobbies. I try only to end up rage quitting in frustration because I can't concentrate. My memory has gotten awful. I only have a couple hours a day of peak mental performance. As I'm writing this happens to be one of those peaks. When I get home from work, I'm too physically exhausted to do any exercise. I force myself to do it with mixed results. 50% of the time I feel physically better, but still stressed out because I didn't have time for hobby stuff, and the other 50% of the time I just get dizzy and weak and have to quit.  

My medical issues don't make anything easier. Ulcerative Colitis and a rare autoimmune liver disease. They're a big reason why I'm so mentally and physically exhausted after work. They're under control with medication, but that doesn't mean I can do the same things everyone else does at the same capacity. I need at least 9 hours of sleep but I never get it thanks to society's expectations of everyone being a good worker drone. I'm up at 6, and by 9-10pm I'm about to crash. I never get to sleep until 11-12 at night. I'm constantly in a state of mild sleep deprivation. Every morning I wake up in such a stupor that I can't walk straight. I've fallen asleep on the floor for 10 minutes after hitting the snooze button. I have a near constant brain fog with short windows of clarity during the day. If I didn't have these issues then maybe I'd have the energy to enjoy my hobbies after work. 

That's not the only thing medical problems are preventing. It's thanks to the UC that I'm scrawny. Every time I try weight lifting and packing away 2700-3000 calories a day until I can't fit any more food in my stomach, the progress is excruciatingly slow, and then something unavoidable like work and tiredness absolutely destroys my physical ability to stick with consistent exercise. Oh yeah, I also have Scheuermann's kyphosis and this year suddenly developed scoliosis. Now I can't do deadlifts, squats, or bench presses. Only the three pillars of ""starting strength"" and gaining mass. My genetics were designed to keep me from achieving my goals. The game was rigged from the start.

On top of all this, I'm expected to ""better myself"" and stay competitive in this rat race to the grave. More skills? Great. More certifications? Great. More degrees? Great. More research and publications? Great. When am I supposed to have the time and energy for all those when I'm already exhausted just by the effort required to be average? 

And what happens when I vent about this to family, friends, coworkers, or *anyone*? I walk into a minefield of invalidation. ""Suck it up."" ""Everyone else is doing it, why can't you."" ""Then just quit."" ""Stop complaining."" ""You complain just for the sake of complaining."" Plus these gems:

&gt;You don't look sick. Stop complaining.

Do you know what it's like to have a UC flare? A straight month of diarrhea 6 times a day, mild fever and chills, loss of appetite, and your body is so weak all you can do is sleep and drag yourself to the toilet for another defecating session? Do you know how easily I tire when it's in remission and I'm relatively normal? 

&gt;Other people work harder, longer, for less pay, and get less sleep than you.

You know, I've never thought of it that way. All of my problems have suddenly vanished and I no longer feel stressed or bitter. Thanks.

&gt;Why don't you teach fewer classes?

Because I'm paid by the class, bills aren't going to pay for themselves, savings won't save themselves, and hobbies aren't free. 

&gt;Why don't you move closer to work so you aren't spending 13 hours a week on commutes?

Because I have to teach at multiple schools to make enough money, and they're located all over. Even if I had just one school, yearly contracts can suddenly be non-renewed and then I'll have to move around every few years. My mind, body, and bank account can't afford that much instability.

&gt;Then maybe you should move to a different career?

Yeah, I can totally just quit with no transferable skills and not enough money to pay for another degree while I'm still paying off my last degree. 

&gt;You have months of vacation time!

Oh, so I'm supposed to just bottle up 15 weeks of stress and release it all in a 6 week period? 

&gt;Work hard now, then retire and do what you want to do.

First, you're assuming my generation and later will even get to retire. Second, you're assuming my liver disease doesn't kill me or make me get a transplant in my 40s or 50s. Third, do you really think I'm going to have the physical fitness and mental sharpness to do what I want later in life? 

&gt;You're full of excuses.

You evidently have ears and a brain but can't use  either of them. 

Those are just a few of the narrow-minded excuses I hear used to justify society's bullshit expectations. I just want to shut myself in my apartment and never come out. ",01Aug2018,3

18," **Before i start let me share a story with you:**

Once a gentleman was walking through an elephant camp, he saw that the elephants were not bound by a chain.

They were not even in a cage.

Elephants were tied only by a small rope. He thought that the elephants could run away from the ropes very easily.

It is not difficult for elephants. Why the elephants were not trying to escape?

He became very curious and asked the trainer about the elephant.

He asked ” Why the elephants were standing here silently? Why not escaping?”

Then the trainer of the elephants replied ” The elephants were tied in same sized rope when they were small. The little rope was enough to keep the elephants trapped. Baby elephants failed to escape even after trying a lot”.

When the elephants grew up, they gradually began to accept that escaping is impossible from the rope. They still believe this.

Now they never try to escape. They give up.

We are same like the elephant.

On the child age we were just like elephants believe that we could a lot of things.

But as we grow older, we realized that our thought was wrong. We can not get everything we want in life.

We start accepting defeat in different aspects of life.

Our new start up business failed, relationship goal failed, Six pack failed. We accepted.

And the worst thing is that some time before the success is coming, we give up.

Difficult times in life teaches us to be more powerful.

Almost everything is possible when you are alive, healthy, independent.

So never give up,keep trying until you finally succeed. But you have to think realistic.

Two words ~~“accepted defeat”~~ never keep together in your life.

maybe you do not even know how much positiveness hidden in you.

When you feel frustrated and want to give up, a small reminder like this article will remind you of your real power.

Just remember one thing

* If you accept defeat by a temporary failure, you are defeated.

If you continue again and keep going then one day you will definitely became successful.

## Why Should You Never Give Up?

* You have everything you need.
* You are alive and healthy so almost everything is possible to you.
* You have to prove yourself who you are.
* You can learn a lot of things from “never give up”.
* You deserve the happiness and success.
* Failure is normal.

#### Conclusion

Always speak truth to yourself. Keep your minds open for learning new things.

Take responsibility of your failure.

Think realistic work hard but never give up.

When everyone is telling that your dream will never come true you have to believe in yourself.

Abraham lincoln failed 7 times in his business and 3 times in election,

finally he became successful.

There are many such examples of never give up.

19,"I *really* try to be the best, kindest, non-judgemental person I can be. I want to be a good Christian. I want to be a good *person*, above all - and that includes keeping good family relations, unless a *massive* boundary has been overstepped. I understand some people are just raised different, some things get twisted, and I just have to accept that and deal with it. It’s just who they are. This will probably be long. I need to sort myself out. A big part of this is reconciling being a lesbian and a Christian, and the judgement I have towards certain people. There is a fine line between unfairly judging someone coming from a place of hate, and unfairly judging someone for your own safety and/or wellbeing. I’d rather unfairly judge someone and assume they detest my existence then get in a physical altercation, or build a great platonic relationship where I find out they think my sexuality is a choice and I’m not *realllly* a lesbian. Not only is it rude, but it breaks your heart a little bit, each time, especially if they’ve seen me and my wife together. I’m head over heels, and the common belief is true love isn’t a choice, and among Christians, that God made someone just for you - so saying that... is like saying they don’t *reallly* think my wife and I are cut from the same stone, meant to be put back together. I’ve had this happen a lot, and my heart’s started to harden, and I’m trying to be the same loving person I was before. 

Being gay... is hard, in terms of family. Some are ‘alright’ with it, but think it’s a phase, even after marriage. Or they say, ‘hate the sin, love the sinner’. There’s those who think I’m perverted, or I was molested, or I’m sick in the head. Some say yes, you were born like that, and God doesn’t make mistakes - but being gay is a choice because you can choose not to act on it. What God would put me in this life, make me gay, and force me to suffer a life of isolation and loneliness? Not mine. But you can’t change every mind, and unconditional love is a great thing to have. It’s just so hard separating who you can love despite what they think and who is actually toxic and draining to you. Like I said before, I want to be a better Christian, but above that, I want to be a better *person* over all.

Even outside of religious beliefs. I honestly feel like I’m progressing backwards on my journey to being a better person because of them. I cannot even take one piece of probably well-meant advice from them without wanting to, forgive the drama, *fucking* *kill* *myself*. I feel like I’m going insane. I could be buttering my toast and one of her family members will be like ‘oh, if you warm the knife under hot water, it actually helps the butter spread a lot more!’ And I swear, I feel my heart physically grow harder. It just immediately kills whatever good mood I was in. It’s spread to advice from anybody. My *leasing* *agent* gave me some rental advice and I almost burst into frustrated tears.

I know it’s just one piece of advice. But it’s *all* the time. On such simple things. You can’t differentiate between when they honestly want to give a simple tip or piece of advice and when they’re trying to be holier-than-thou. It’s constant. Just every day. I’m trying so fucking hard to be a better person. I *know* I should be thankful for the tips and advice. Like, I really should. I can’t assume every tip is back handed. But a lot have obviously been them just assuming we’re fucking stupid.

We’ve moved into a few different houses together. We’ve both been through a good amount of moves - we know the ropes. Most of her family hasn’t moved in about eight years, when they were adolescents (13 and under). It’s a *lot* different when you’re older. We know what happens in a move. They have asked us if we ‘are aware we need to call and make sure the water is on’ or ‘that electricity isn’t included in the rent’ or ‘to check the neighborhood and house to make sure it’s a good area’. Literally, *common* fucking sense. I want to be able to brush it off. I just can’t.

Also, what they mean by ‘making sure the house is in a good neighborhood’? They want to make sure it’s a *white* neighborhood. I’m not even exaggerating. They’ve flat out said ‘yeah, predominantly white neighborhoods are the best to live in, no excess of little kids running around’ because POC just can’t control themselves, huh? /s It’s really fucking interesting because they don’t mind if it’s white children. White kids play outside in a neighborhood and they don’t bat an eye. Mexican kids play in a neighborhood? ‘Oh, this is a lower-income community... probably not the best place to live :/‘ It’s so fucking blatant. When we were looking for a house to rent, there were two black teenagers just hanging out outside. Just doing teen things, you know, loitering around outside what’s most likely *their* *home*. They were in pajamas. It was early. Immediately, her family was saying, ‘Yeah, maybe not the best community... you might not be the right color for here... have you checked the crime rates?’

I want to divorce who they are as people from how they were raised. I was raised by racists. As in, ‘white people are being drowned out by POC and we *must* reproduce and have white children’ racists. The kind that assumes you’re a filthy, no good (dedicated racial slur to whatever race you are - they have one for everybody.) unless you do some incredible contribution to society and don’t mention your heritage or skin color. I only got out of it when I was exposed to non-racist things - media, certain episodes of shows, when I got a phone and discovered the world of social media, etc, etc. Even after I was exposed to these things, I’d try and be funny with severely racist jokes. I get it. Raising affects you a lot, it’s hard to unlearn. Am I perfect? No, but God damn do I try to always improve.

It’s like they don’t *want* to improve. They honestly believe they’re oppressed in some way for being straight, Christian and white. Some more than others. Nobody hates them for being straight, Christian and white - they hate them because they talk about how ‘oppressed’ they are and how talking about their beliefs ‘offends’ people. Well, yeah, if you bring up how you don’t believe in marriage equality because it’s ‘against God’ in a room full of LGBT people? You’re not going to be fucking liked. It’s like the high school loner who thinks they’re hated just because they’re themselves but really it’s because they have no boundaries, are God awful, and fucking creepy to every member of the opposite sex. I want *so* bad to divorce the person from the actions, but aren’t we all just our actions? I do love them. But every day it gets harder.

It’s constantly racist, homophobic, and elitist. Anything you can do, they can do better. Reading a book while laying on the couch? ‘Hey, did you know if you read sitting up, you retain more knowledge and are generally more engaged in the book?’ Making an Asian style-dish for dinner? In the back, one of them, immediately: ‘*KOOOONNNNICHIWAAAA!* *Oh*, *yes*, *rice*? *Me* *add* *dog* *meat*, *yes*? *Nani*? *No,* *me* *add* *dog* *meat*!’ I call a customer service line? ‘*Eeee*, *yes*, *this* *is* *Juan*? *Habla* *espanol*? *No?* *English?* *Eeee...* *me* *no* *comprende*... *we* *close* *now*... ‘ they always laugh at these racist-ass tirades. They even mock random people working. They see a Hispanic waitress? ‘Think she’s legal? L O L’ The homophobia is always more subtle... that specific kind of ‘acceptable’ homophobia. Criticizing gay things, whatever they are. ‘Why does Pride even exist?! You have full rights, it’s basically just a one-up on straight people now, where’s my straight pride?’

Or the ‘well meant’ homophobia. ‘Well... I mean, gay images in media and kid’s shows are too much. It will confuse kids. It’ll normalize it, and we’ll have kids who’ll think they’re gay! I saw an article about a nine-year old boy who thinks he’s gay...’ I knew I was gay when I was nine. I wish I saw someone like me on TV. The most devastating is when it concerns kids, really. Especially our own kids. ‘So... are you going to have a male roommate move in? Where will your kids get their male role models from? Kids need a mother and a father.’ ‘Is it right to adopt kids that are young? Aren’t you socializing them to be gay, even unintentionally?’ It hurts, because it’s hypocritical. Their father was gone for work 95% of their childhood. Where did they get their male role models from? Did they socialize my wife to be straight? Obviously not. Personally, I think maybe kids do need a male role model, but I come from a massive family. They’ll have role models. To propose a live-in man is a thinly veiled attempt to say we as two women can’t raise a child.

Digging into this, everything hurts. I can hardly overcome the massive amounts of fucking *hurt* to forgive. I know I have to. You can’t carry this much hate in your heart and be happy. 

I couldn’t say anything before because we were temporarily staying at their house until our new lease on our new house started. My wife has been beaten down by them on speaking up about everything to the point even talking about bringing up how racist/homophobic/transphobic they are will throw her into an anxiety attack because we would not be able to leave the situation for a breather, in our own space. We’d be essentially trapped in a shroud of confrontation. I’ve tried bridging it before, and they don’t want to change. I only tried on the homophobia aspect, because that really is the one I have the most hope for - they see us, they see us as people, my family got a little better, maybe they could. It was in an enclosed space where we were all in the same quarters, it soured the rest of our time together. Made what should have been great family time painfully awkward and passive aggressive.

Obligatory they are good people a lot of times - I just had a talk about my wife’s quirks with them and it was all good! We can have breakfast and dinners and it’s a lovely time. But these themes really do come up *daily*. 

But we have our own house now. I’ve come to a mutual agreement with my wife that, understandably, we are a united front on these things - in their house, it’s their rules. In my house? I won’t fucking tolerate it. My house, my rules. I’m far from perfect, I’ll admit - I cuss, I drink, I smoke, but those are all things that affect just *us* and not anybody else.

I’m filled with resentment. Which is a massive problem. I resent them for how they alienated my wife growing up. I resent them for how they alienated her after she came out. I resent them for refusing to acknowledge me when she first introduced me to them on a video call, and every call for a few months. I resent them for how they viewed me because I showed skin. I resent them for making no attempts to understand my wife’s anxiety and depression growing up. I resent them for every racist comment. I resent them for feeding into the ideas so many hold that we somehow chose to be gay, that being trans is a mental illness, that we’re against God - those ideas lead to lgbt deaths and their racism leads to ideas that feed POC deaths. I resent them for never trying to say sorry for what they put her through growing up. I resent them even more for trying to save face and deny it. My parents apologized, somewhat, they try and support me as much as they can and tell me how proud they are that I am unapologetically myself. My parents aren’t perfect themselves, definitely racist, definitely transphobic, definitely homophobic (except to us - the ‘good gays’), definitely sexist... but at least they *try* occasionally. If I bring something up, they’re open to conversation. They do deny a bulk of their homophobia, but they also try their best to understand their daughter and daughter in law.

I don’t think this hate will ever leave my heart, which is an issue. I’ve dealt with plenty of people like this, and I still hate them, it’s just dulled.

The biggest issue I can see with myself is that I should view my house as someplace safe I can try and educate them. But I just *dream* of calling out their hypocrisy, trying to see them squabble their way out of the hole they dug themselves into. Of making them as uncomfortable as I have felt. I *dream* of pointing out every single shit thing they’ve said and asking them why? Why would you tell me to my face you think this is a choice? Why make fun of a waitress just living her life and doing a damn good job at her work because she’s Hispanic? You know you’re a fucking racist, right? You know I know you think I’m stupid, right? You know you made her life growing up absolutely Hell? You know how often trans people are murdered because people believe the same shit you’re spewing about them, right? You know you’re super fucking homophobic and vote *against* our rights, right? You know there’s a gay kid at church who wants to kill himself because of how everyone treats being gay, right?

You know you can indirectly have blood on your hands from spewing your bile, right? That you feed into the ideas people use to justify hate crimes and murder us, right?

I know anger is rational. But I want to let go and let God, so to speak. I also desperately want to try and help them unlearn these things. But, God, holy fuck, do I want my petty revenge also. 

Most of all, I want my clean heart back. The one that didn’t have to worry about if someone was going to respect me for who I am. The one before I got sexually assaulted for being a lesbian and daring to tell a man no. The one that took the time to educate people, and was *hopeful* they would change. I want that sweetness I had way back when I was fifteen. That fire and spit I had, even if I held some problematic beliefs myself back then and did stupid shit. I wanted everyone to be kind to everyone. I went out of my way to help people. Even the heart I had when my wife and I first started dating, that hope that her family would come around to me in the way mine did. We didn’t have our wedding because none of them would come. Imagine what would have been my wife’s position - looking out into the crowd and seeing all of my family, all of her and my friends, but a big gaping hole where her family should have been. What would have been a joyful occasion would have just been a painful reminder.

This is basically just a long vent with me questioning my actions and who I’m growing into as a person. I doubt anybody will read this, but if you do, just please do one nice thing today. We’re butch lesbians and I about cried when a random woman asked me to take a picture of her and her family (husband, two young kids, my wife and I had just kissed before she asked and she treated us as just normal women, and not the predators a lot of random women view us as). It’s the small things that keep me going. 

I’ll try and sort out my issues, I’ll try and be the bigger person, but above all, I’ll try and soften my heart. While also staying safe, and being true to my cussing, crude, but soft, self!

I can't even stomach to be within earshot when she's having these conversations.  Our marriage is rocky anyway and her joining an MLM when we are in such a terrible financial position makes me almost hate her.  I can barely make eye contact with her.

33,"I'm single and I don't like it. It's freaking me out a little. 

I'm jobless, basically by choice. Living off savings and charity. 

Things I buy:

Food
Alcohol (rarely)

That's it. No gas. No car. I get clothes from a free cubby in town. No haircuts or products. My makeup is literally found on the ground or Christmas presents from last year.  I go to free community events daily, from trivia to poetry (well catered with wine), and world class jazz, yoga, etc.  I get compliments often on how I look, so I don't think anyone is really aware of how differently I live compared to them. I socialize almost every day as well. 

I needed a comb, I found one in a rideshare' s car- he insisted it wasn't his. I own basically nothing. A laptop and a broken phone. A backpack. Cheap camping gear. A few clothes. That's it!

Weird, huh? I know... 

I live in one of the most expensive and beautiful towns in the US, with one of the wealthiest populations (1%ers), eat for free often (events are usually catered)... 

It's a competitive town with limited housing. So, outsiders are usually jealous and curious about my circumstances. They think I'm a trustfunder. 

I wish! Especially after seeing how they live up close and personal. But, their money came from destroying the world, literally. Now they use it to go to the lake. Live in beautiful nature. Dress much more nicely than the rest of us. Be philanthropists.

I've done nothing since I lost my job in a painful way two months ago. 

It's been hell. Not earning. Cutting, cutting, cutting back. Mentally. Because I feel forced into this. I'm not choosing it. I'd like to have a bike (both of mine were stolen). Charity is humbling. A little scary.

Definitely a constricted time.

So, anyway, how does that relate to being single?

I think I'm in survival mode! And, people in this town are geriatric... and getting older. My friends are thirty years older, married or undateable.

Sorry, my phone hurts my wrists, and it's affecting my writing. 

Hmmmm...

I'm getting older, and I want to have a family...  I want to spend my time well, and making the most out of my body is important. Dancing, cuddling, sex, having fun, etc. using this gift. 

I'm spinning my wheels a bit. Between worlds. 

I spend my time on Reddit (shocker), babysitting (1x/week covers my expenses), watching The Office, walking and socializing. Not exactly a beneficial or full life. 

Damn, huh? 

The last thing I'll mention is going out last night.  Trivia at the bar with a friend who invited people from the Brewery. Fucking drunks. Idiots. Loud, obnoxious and stupid. Really the trashiest, dumbest, most unattractive group... and I'm like, okay, how am I supposed to find my husband in this? What's so great about this place? And, won't I feel this way everywhere?

And, what am I working toward?? Anything? Shit.

Anyways, I'm still quiet as a mouse, and it's caused some issues at work. One guy can not stand it, and he's sort of a bully. One day last week I was walking down the hall reading a report on my way to a meeting, I noticed two people in front of me but they were a bit off from me. They stopped and I did as well, then the bully turned around and snapped at me about being a sneaky fuck and told me to go to hell. I shrugged it off, stepped around them and went to my meeting.

Early this week a similar thing happened, I was walking down the hall and the same guy come out of a cross hall. He saw me out of the corner of his eye and jumped, then cocked his arm back like he was going to punch me. When he shifted forward, I flinched back, and he missed me with the punch. His arm however did not miss the corner of the hallwall, and I heard is snap. He's screaming now and people are coming into the hallway, I'm standing there white as a ghost (so I was told) and this guy is on the ground, hold his arm and bawling like a baby.

An exec tells everyone to go back to their offices and the first aid guy comes by to see whats going on with all the noise. I'm still standing there not believing what just happened. 

The first aid guy decides he needs to go to the ER, so they bundle him up and take him away. The Bully is now saying I broke his fucking arm. The Exec turns on me, and it looks like he's going to swing away.

&gt; Exec: What happened?

&gt; Me: He came out of the cross hall, jumped, then took a swing at me. He missed and hit the corner of the hallway.

&gt; Exec: You didn't do anything to him? Say anything to him?

&gt; Me: No, I was just walking to the break room, he came form there (I point down the cross hallway), he jumped, cocked his arm back and swung at me, then he hit the corner and started screaming.

&gt; Me: How is my name on this when I didn't give any statement for a resolution. And it says apology tendered and accepted.

&gt; HRH: Just sign it, we don't want to go through all that stuff over an accident.

&gt; Me: He swung at me, he's used abusive language directly to my face, he's used derogatory language about me to other people. This isn't an accident...

&gt; HRH: Did you file any comments about his language?

*No I didn't because you're a waste of space on your good days*

I mean, I don't know much people, don't really want casual sex so I'm not meeting guys in clubs, my college is mostly girls.. I guess the not knowing much people could be the problem but still there's facebook and the only guys that hit on me there are under my standards, and most of them just want to fuck anyway, they don't want a relationship.",01Aug2018,1

Alfred: You crossed the line first, sir. You squeezed them, you hammered them to the point of desperation. And in their desperation, they turned to a man they didn't fully understand.

This statement by Alfred Pennyworth, and the Joker's rise to power in The Dark Knight,  seems to fit the situation more and more each week. 

I do not align myself with any particular party, and have never before engaged in political speech, nor do I plan to do so again;  but I must make this statement, for it eats at my soul to not say it.

Hopefully we do not have to take it to this conclusion: 

Wayne: That bandit, in the forest in Burma... Did you catch him? 
(Alfred nods) 

How? 

Alfred:

54,"I started a job in a big city a few months back that I commute to from the suburbs. I’ve never really dealt with traffic at all hours and the kinds of dumb things you see people do when they’re in cars. So to deal with it 5 days a week and then some more on the weekend if I want to go out with my family... whoa. It’s been crushing my soul just a little. 

For a minute there I was beginning to think I was just losing my patience with everyone. “Fuck this person, fuck that person, damn why is this person so slow?!” Until today when I was almost back home. 

Sure it’s just Wednesday, and I had a lighter workday, but I’m keeping track of everything that needs done at home, getting over a cold. Just exhausted. I stop at a four-way stop after driving through some utility work. Not thinking too long I go into the intersection after a brief pause behind the car in front of me. It didn’t register that the oncoming lane had a driver making a left turn. Car speeds to take a left as I’m starting into the intersection and what do I think to do? Flip the guy off! Where the hell did that come from? Who have I become? That was totally my mistake. 

That’s my “aha! I’m an asshole” moment. ",01Aug2018,2
55,"I'm so conflicted right now.

It seems every week there is something crazy happening in the world, a lot of it is in America but that is also just due to the fact that there's gonna be more people on reddit then third world countries + camera footage for these outrages things.

When I see videos of police shooting an unarmed person on the ground who is visibly scared for his life and is following every order, or opening fire when there is clearly an innocent person in the path and multiple police open fire, not just the one with the best shot. I can't stand it, it makes me so angry, I don't know how to deal with it and don't know what I can do. It's just not police either, it's just an easy thing to criticize as it's a government entity and should be held to higher expectations. 

I'm not American, I don't know if that makes it better or worse, I never had negative thoughts on America and I still don't as the videos and posts are obviously only select groups and there are so many great Americans.

  
Then I see all this stuff with Donald Trump, like the immigration centers or literally anything with Donald, but as I said I'm not American and I don't know US Politics that well, I only know what I read on reddit and articles which could easily manipulate my views on it due to everyone else agreeing on something. Maybe a lot of the things done by Trump is not as bad as it seems and it's the reddit hivemind that is making me think this way, I really hope so.

I've never really thought about suicide, but I understand why people do it now, I feel so powerless, and I look on reddit and see all these fucked up things like police shootings or school shootings and nothing changes, if reddit can't change it as a collective, then how can I change anything.

This isn't an attack on America, it's just easy to pick that country because a lot of the content on reddit comes from America, and people don't care as much about fucked up shit in third world countries, it's more emotionally affecting when we see these things going on in places like America, I'm just using America as an example because I know I can provide sources for countless incidents I think shouldn't even be an issue in a first world country, there are so many things I just can't believe is even a thing we have to think about in a first world country, it really makes me question are we really as first world as we believe. 

The world we live in today is not near what it could be, we are so far from peace.

I don't understand how a country like America or where I'm from Australia, can't look at something a different country implements effectively and then after seeing results of it, begin to trial and see if it can be effective in their country.   
Such things as Portugal, that country was struggling with addicts, like America and Australia, but the leaders got together, they put a lot of effort into it, and they produced a system. Now many years later there has been a constant decline of drug deaths and drug users.  
It's not just drugs, the Nordic region handles prison so much better than America and Australia, rehabilitation has been proven to work significantly, why do private prisons exist at all in America?

How can you not look at policies that Norway or Portugal implement, see how it's proven to be a better system, and not try and implement this into your own country? I'm so angry that my country has the same issues and refuses to look at statistics. If I was making a phone, and I saw another phone add a feature that everyone loved, guess what I'm gonna fucking do, add that feature to my phone.

I don't even know what I'm trying to get out of this post, I just need to vent.

56,"So I’ve been working for my grandpa,who builds houses for a living. I’ve been working with him every chance I could get(summer break,spring break,etc, and I am really just there to help out, doing things such as retrieving tools, throwing all the trash away, occasionally cutting/nailing wood,etc, and he pays me probably too much for what I do.

I’ve helped him on about 4 houses so far, and I’d say the absolute worse part is doing the yard work, such as leveling out the dirt,picking weeds, among other things. After about an hour or 2 I begin to get blisters, but thankfully that’s pretty much the last part of the house that I have to work on, so it’s not so bad if I just focus on that thought.

In the 30 or so years my grandpa has been building houses, not once has he ever did any of the garden work. But a few days ago, he decided that he need to save some money, so he just figured he’d do it himself(how hard could it be right?) and it was Honestly right in between how hard I was expecting and how easy Easy I wanted it to be, but something just struck me while I was out in that heat, digging holes,dropping plants in them, fertilizing the soil, and putting pea gravel in, while working right alongside my grandpa. I just felt like this was what I wanted to do. I almost enjoyed working on it. Usually my grandpa has to direct me to do stuff, but after the first few plants I pretty much fell right in sync and was just nearly doing my own thing with the plants.

After about 2 days of nearly non stop working, we were done. I can’t remember exactly what he said, but it was something along the lines of “well Aiden, looks like we did a pretty good job.” I really can’t describe the feeling that washed over me, but it felt good. And I am finding myself slightly looking forward to the next time he decides to “save some money on the yard”.


Man I don’t usually talk about this type of stuff, but it feels sorta weird. I just had to tell someone about this, so sorry for the mildy long read. ",01Aug2018,3
57,"My husband is depressed and can't handle it at all. He is steadly turning angry and projecting his problems onto me.  I'm a sick person, he knew this when he met me and it's just now a problem. I'm getting over a real bad kidney infection and so I didn't do any housework. He threw a fit today because his shorts were dirty. They weren't since he wore them for an hour but he threw them in the dirty clothes. He was so loud and angry. He was just mad about everything. The cup in the sink, why I haven't made dinner in days (I'm sick and we have no food) his clothes being unwashed. He accused me of cheating on him with a friend that came over last week. I didn't.

I don't know how much more I can take of this. It's been weeks of him snapping over the smallest things. He took off somewhere with the car and there's no food here. I have no money until Friday anyway so I guess it doesn't matter. He's been gone for hours and honestly I hope he stays gone for a few days. I just want to sleep and maybe find some dollars to get some gas station food.",01Aug2018,8
