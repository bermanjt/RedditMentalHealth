2,"I’ve never liked sharing food or utensils or anything that goes in my mouth that other people have touched. Even with family. People around me find this annoying and I claim it’s because I’m a germaphobe. 

However, I’m not afraid to eat food or use items that have fallen onto dirty surfaces like a table or the ground. What could be the problem here? ",16Jul2018,1
3,"I'm so fucking tired. I don't have any friends. I'm not exaggerating. I have none. I was in an abusive relationship for so long that they all left before I realized what was happening. Now I'm living alone in a city where I know no one, I can't find a job worth a damn because I have PTSD and freak out at the smallest thing, and I can't even afford food because rent is so expensive here but if I leave I'll be homeless again. I'm stuck in this loop and I don't know what the fuck to do. I'm currently slumped against a dumpster in an alley after having a severe panic attack while looking for something to eat. Completely breakdown for a good hour before I could even stop crying. I don't know why the fuck I continue to try when everyday it's a failure in one way or another. Nothing moves forward in my life. I'm stuck in the same place I have been for so long and I'm running out of energy to even try. Every day is a fight to not up and kill myself. I usually have to go hunting for something to eat on a daily basis which drains the life out of you to start with. Throw in everything else and I'm a train wreck. I don't know why I'm posting this and I know no one is going to give a fuck. I'm just sick of crying alone in an alley. If I end up dead tonight I'd like at least someone to get why. ",16Jul2018,5

5,"I assume relatives/friends of my neighbor are visiting. I can hear them all talking in the parking lot. Well, one guy walks away from them, looks around and then walks over to another neighbor's vehicle (which is right next to mine) and then takes a good long look inside it. Holding his hands up to shield outside light from his eyes so he could see better inside. Then he walks away and back to the group (I assume it is only three people in the group). 

Was VERY strange. And creeped me the fuck out. I was about to set off my car alarm if he had turned to look into my vehicle. Just to warn him off  and to give him a fright. ",16Jul2018,3
6,"There must be cultural propaganda about the value of youth because age is undervalued. When I was a kid I thought being 30
Meant time for bed. But turning 30 was the best! Now I’m 39 and yes I’m starting to look 35,  but so is everyone else and it’s awesome! I’m having amazing sex all the time on my terms, I feel confident in my self outlook, I don’t fuck with idiots, compromise or capitulate to stupid. I’m hoping the 40s are even better because there’s no comparison between how I feel compared to how I felt in my youth (and youth wasn’t too terrible). ",16Jul2018,1
7,"Atleast it feels like it. 22, haven’t been to college yet due to so many obstacles I have come face to face with. Haven’t been able to find a stable, consistent and solid foundation for me to grow and settle in so haven’t really been able to focus on furthering my education. I’m surrounded by so many people graduating, knowing what they want out of life, accomplishing so many things, getting engaged and creating their lives with significant others and I’m just stuck here feeling like yo, what the fuck am I doing wrong here. 

My head is a broken record telling me that I am going nowhere in life because I haven’t been to college. I feel like others look at that and don’t want to associate themselves with someone not on similar pages as them so they just don’t. I just moved to a different state to, so that does not help in the slightest.

9,"I'm so tired of being angry and sad over you.

I don't want you to fill my thoughts anymore. What you did to me is the worst thing anyone has ever done to me. You led me on for nearly half a year, manipulating and gas lighting me. You said I was your best friend. you said you loved me. We we're together for 3 years. Why did you do this to me? 

I hate not being able to return home because the whole city  reminds me of you. I feel in exile.


I wish I could cut out any memory of you. You don't even think what you did was wrong. Part of me wishes I never met you. Why did you have to make me feel so good and then hurt me so bad. I feel so stupid ignoring the signs. I wish I listened to everyone else.

Why do I have to love you and hate you at the same time? I still feel like you're my other half. I want this pain to go away.",16Jul2018,1
10,"All my life I’ve been a slacker, scraping by doing the least amount possible. I’m lazy and unashamed. I’ve never put real effort into anything, I’ve never seen anything through, I never finish what I start, I never work hard. That’s the pattern of my life so far. 

I’m at university and right now I’m doing literally nothing at home because it’s summer. At uni I had piss poor attendance, I’d do very little work and literally scraped passing grades. At home, I have no job and do literally nothing all day. 

Recently I’ve been wanting to change that. Now I want to be committed and hard working and dedicated and tired. I want to work towards something I can be proud of, something honest and real. 

From now on, I’m making it my goal to work harder. I’m going to get a part-time job (I’m taking it slow here, Rome wasn’t built in a day) and when I go back to university I’m going to promise myself to have good attendance, a better work ethic and just do more work in general. 

I want be a what they call a “closer”, someone who doesn’t give up, I want to have patience and commitment. It’ll take a long time to build up this new work ethic, but I need to do it. My attitude at the moment is very unhealthy and I’ll never make it anywhere at this rate. One day I hope to thrive off hard work, and actually enjoy putting in effort.

I’ve deleted Facebook and a majority of social media, which has helped but I still see myself not being good enough and comparing myself to others. I’m in an amazing relationship but I can’t help but think that I’m boring and that he’ll leave me any day for it. I suffer from anxiety as well as depression.

12,"Am I the only one who gets super stressed out when I have plans with my friends to go somewhere? My friends invited me to the local fair next weekend to go to a concert and I said yes but now I'm just thinking of ways to get out of it.

I stress out over everything when it comes to going places like: how will we get there? How will we get home? What am I going to wear? What if something bad happens? What if I spend too much money? What if I get lost on the way there? (Its super far from my house) and I always feel like I can be spending that money on Bills or groceries instead of going out. 


 It drives me CRAZY because I never used to be this way. I used to be able to just go anywhere without any worry. Now that I'm older (25yo)  I can just never go with the flow. I just stress over everything. 

I feel way less stressed when  im at home watching movies or something , i dont want to live a sheltered life though. I know I shouldn't be this way because I need to hang out with my friends more . I feel like I will lose my friends if I dont because whenever they invite me anywhere I always make an excuse not to go because it just stresses me out to the max!!

13,"I normally dont talk about this because I am shameful and guilty of my addiction, but, for the last 10 years or so I have been a functioning closet opiate addict. I hate it. I have tried to quit so many times and actually have for different periods of time....each time. As in, I have quit before but the longest period of time I was sober was for maybe 8 to 10 months....but even then I wasnt completely sober because I was smoking bud. Usually when I quit the anxiety ALWAYS seems to get to me and all these emotions come out that I guess I must have been suppressing. My mental state becomes to weird and hard for me to deal with that I always end up relapsing. Or something may happen that makes it hard for me to deal with so I relapse...

I self medicate from the street because I have no health insurance what so ever. Ive never done heroine or injected amything in my veins before. Pain killers are what got my by accident a long time ago but that is incredibly expensive on the street now-a-days and 10 a pop in my area...so ive been going through this tiring loop that is killing me softly especially emotionally. Which is paying for pain pills until I reach a point that is not only un-affordable, but my tolerance  builds and I can feel myself slipping. So ill purchase suboxone.

My intention is always the same. To get clean and stat clean. But it never fails. Ill take it for 5 days and try to stop, but my blood pressure rises through the roof and my anxiety comes back and my daily life duties become unbearable...And mind you that I keep thid from EVERYONE. I hid this attrocity. My family and loved ones know ive had problems and they have helped me while I go through the withdrawels but I never get financial help to get real help like medication or rehab help. I try so hard but I never really feel at ease for so long that I always end up relapsing...I really want to be free of this sickness. I hate it. ",16Jul2018,1

19,"I have an issue that in real life I care too much about what people think. It hinders me in that I will censor myself, speak quietly if I say something that might offend somebody, and not act out in anyway in fear of rejection or conflict. I have a fear that people won't like me for who I am so I hide it behind this boring persona that's safe.

* Meditate
* Read books

21,"Whenever I look in the mirror it reminds me that this face he called “cute” attracted his attention but it’s not beautiful enough to capture his heart. He was repulsed by those acne scars and I’d undergone several laser treatments to correct the flaw, the last time minor surgeries cuts on my face worked wonders and my skin healed with minor scars now. I’m going to see the dermatologist again next year for the same surgery procedures, needles for anesthesia and then small knives to cut those wounds for it to heal.

Plastic surgery is what I’m thinking chin implants and double-eyelid surgery after both I’ll look more like Angelababy the Chinese actress. I’ll be unrecognizable if I undergo both changes, I was pressured to get chin implants but ultimately the decision is mine. I’m afraid of going under the knife but I don’t like my face anymore, it reminds me of him.

I'm 17, and I unfortunately don't much to look forward to in life because well, my habits are getting the best of me. I hate to admit this 100%, but I currently abuse prescription drugs and Cannabis often. I hate myself for it. It's giving me a depression and turning me down in life.

This all started when my girlfriend of 8 months decided to leave me after a remark I made about her, jokingly but she took it serious. This whole year has been ass. I was once a happy person, with good grades and good motives, and physically fit, but due to the recent mishaps in my life they've taken a turn for the worse.

I need to stay an extra year in high school because of my decisions, and I should have graduated. I wasnt accepted into the college I was aiming for, and not even the job I wanted to work. I decided to quit my current job, which was my first job that I've had since grade 10. All because I take pills and I smoke. It's fucking me up.

Also, she fucked me up so bad. I quit smoking weed for the time we were together but recently I've grown back into it. I can't even explain how much I hate myself, doing things like Xanax used to be a state of euphoria and calamity, now its just an addiction. Im crying as I make this post.

34,"Hi everyone. Before you read my story, I’d like to warn anyone who is uncomfortable with rape/abuse by family members to not read this post. I am merely here to share my experience and give some hope out there to anyone who might have gone through similar.

I’m an 18 year old girl. At the ages 9-11, I was raped by my own brother who was 12-14 at the time on a nightly basis. I remember it happened nightly but I don’t remember if it was for months at a time, how long it truly lasted, but I do know it happened during those ages and it happened on at least 20 different nights.

He used to sneak into my room late at night and talk to me because he “couldn’t sleep”. I remember feeling like something was wrong, but I was so young and scared that I never did anything when he started touching me. I remember figuring it was too late to stop him when he started actually doing more, but I was mainly scared of what would happen if I said something, so I just pretended to be asleep and pretended it wasn’t happening.

I never came to accept what happened until I was about 16 years old. At ages 12-13 I was beginning to have a lot of anxiety attacks at school but I thought I was just having some bad days. At age 14 I fell into a deep depression before entering high school. I had a tendency to blame myself. I had a tendency to be interested in older guys but never did. 

But this is for you people out there who reach out and make someone smile. I remember being 14 on the verge of taking my life because I felt so lost and I felt like everything that happened to me was my fault. But I remember meeting a regular old waiter while I was out for dinner with my mom and he had the most positive energy I had ever seen and I remember telling myself I wanted to be that happy someday and if he could, then I probably could too. So I hung on and I kept living.

People like him, and I know there are a lot of you out there, thank you for being the way that you are. Thank you for being a stranger that someone like myself can look up to and be inspired by. I would not be here today if it were not for that man.

From ages 14-16 I went through an abusive relationship that left me feeling unwanted and worthless. It was never an actual relationship, I was lied to the entire time. I was just someone to cure their boredom. Thankfully, I never even kissed this guy, but after a year and a half of being naive and falling for his lies, I fell into an even deeper depression. At age 15 my father was diagnosed with cancer, alongside my mother who has had cancer since I was 6. At age 16 I spent my entire junior year of high school alone because I had pushed everyone away. I ate lunch in an empty classroom. I spoke a total of probably 10 words a day, even at home.

I remember being 16 and waking up one morning and going to school and I knew it was going to be the day I finally gave up. I remember coming home and sitting at my desk staring at my blank computer screen and doing nothing like I had done for the last year. And then I remembered that happy waiter and I did some research and I FOUND him. And I reached out to him to just make a friend, one final hope, and I got an answer that same night I was going to give up. 

Today, I am 18 years old and that happy waiter is still one of my best friends to this day. Today, I have officially been depression free for exactly 2 years and 2 months. 2 years and 2 months since I haven’t had those kinds of thoughts on ending it. I still struggle with what happened to me when I was young, but I no longer let it bring me down. I struggled with being lost for so many years. For years I wished for awful things every day until I felt so empty I was just breathing and days were flying by. But it has been 2 years and 2 months and I can say that I am kicking life’s ass with the happiest smile on my face no matter what it tries to knock me down with.

So this is my story, and this is a thank you for you people out there that spread as much positivity as you can. Even if you’re a stranger to them the entire time, it is the mere memory of your happiness that keeps some of us holding on. I am so thankful for people like you because today I am still here, because of people like you. Today I am truly okay. Today, I can be that person that the happy waiter was for me, hopefully for someone else.

To anyone out there who needs a sign to hang on, whatever it is that you’re going through, this is the sign. There is always hope and it is not impossible. Please reach out to me if you need help. I",16Jul2018,343
35,"There are whole chunks of my life I have no memory of. I'm not talking a day or two or even a few weeks. But years. Gaps. Gulfs of inky blackness where there are only things people have told me and I have concocted into 'memories'.

There is nothing before five, and then only a few moments here and there until ten, usually involving physical damage to myself. A sledding accident, a big wheel accident, countless motorcycle accidents. Nothing happy or good. Just blank spaces and pain. Then through the rest of my life only flickering images. Car accidents. The feeling of anxiety I would experience as as a teen laying in bed waiting to hear the roar of his Harley coming from miles, I was always more afraid of him not coming home then what he would say or do once he was home. Later... Heartbreak. Abandonment. Fear.

My Crazy Doctor told me I have depersonalized off and on since I was a boy and any time I go numb like that I tend not to remember things unless there's something that reconnects me to me. Or I make myself remember through iterations, you know, telling myself the story of what happened. I have lots of those, anecdotes of my life that I honestly don't remember so much as remember the stories of the events I've spoken countless times over my life.

People in my life never truly grasp how fucked up my memories are, I can't pick what I remember. There are only memories when I feel something. Happiness, sadness, pain, love, lust... something. Anything. Otherwise there tends to be numbness and nothing.

Those moments crystalize and turn into little snow globes I can shake and look at from the outside sometimes, and smile. Or cry. Or grieve. Or laugh.

I don't remember the day I got married, not really. I remember the anger and frustration that she was late and we nearly lost our spot at the Justice of the Peace and I had to talk and persuade the Justice to rearrange her schedule. I remember the first words out of my mouth when she pulled up weren't that she was beautiful or that I was happy, but 'It's about time, where have you been?' There are photos of that day. And there are no memories with them, just the anxiety and anger and frustration from that moment looking down at her from the top of the stairs as she got out of the yellow convertable.

I can't tell you much from the day we buried my father... other than that of an image of them pushing the cardboard box into the incinerator, I asked to be present for the cremation. Then some time later the sharp sound of the guns from the 21 gun salute that snapped me into my body enough to realise I had tears on my cheeks. I couldn't tell you what I felt when they handed me the flag. Or what was in my brain when I passed it to my Sister later because I didn't want it. No memories of after at all. Holes.

But... I could tell you all about when my sister and I nearly came to blows over my mother and father remarrying on his deathbed and Theresa having to get between two broken siblings who were both grieving their own broken ways, it was the first time I had ever been really angry my whole life, I was mid 30s. So of course, that I can remember. The boiling hot rage, being in each other's faces screaming and shoving. The feel of my now ex-wife's hand on my chest as she pushed and shouldered and shoved and bulldozed me out the door and locked it behind me. Of me beating on the door till I ended on the floor with my back to the metal door, the chill of it cold on my back as I held my face in my hands and screamed and wept.

Those strong emotions get me crammed back into me.

I remember being so disgusted at my father when he would burn himself with his lighter after my mother left... I didn't feel anything after all. How could he be so fucked up over it that he would burn his arm? I wonder, looking back now, if his brain worked like mine does... and he just wanted to remember something. And pain was his door to making those memories. Or was he numb and wanted to feel something...? Anything?

Either way, I sometimes wonder how much of my moods and behaviours have been inherited from the man. How much am I really like him? It keeps me up at night sometimes. I used to stay up in fear of him not coming home, now I stay up in fear of him never having left me.",16Jul2018,8

I was insecure and had lost my way in  1st year of hs,and i remember after a fight with my mother,she obviosly knew that i wasnt talking with girls,and she insulted me that i was ''shaking and trembling like a pussy infront of girls,but i  had the courage to stand up to her''.That hurts like hell  still,i dont know if i ever forgive her,but i can see that she is a human  too and has issues.I was still depressed and anxious in my 2nd year,and my high school best mate pushed me from the stairs,so he could make the girls behind us laugh and caught the attention  of his crush.I would  broke my legs if i wasnt 1.92cm,fit,soccer player,but i was mentally weak and he dared to do that,and he didnt even apologise and just ran off.I think he is a psychopath,he has all the traits.I had bad grades and teachers were shaming me on ocassions because of my stupidity,but i can see that i was just depressed and made me look like a complete retard.3rd year, i was doing good.Everyone who had done me wrong,was ashamed and avoided me.Around May,we played a semi final with my soccer team and we lost 7-1.After that i gave up on my life.Whole summer at home,and senior year started and i was extremely depressed,i was playing video games and sitting at home all 24/7.Around may again,i took some pills and thought it would kill myself,watched watch people die on reddit and went to sleep.When i woke up,i just had my mouth swolle and i was in shock.The next week was hell.I could barely move and was just laying in my bed,listening to rain sounds on youtube.Then i went to school on Monday.Step by step,i got out of depression,like a small child,relearning life . Now i feel complete with my self ,im rebulding my life and i love it.But i just cant get it,how is possible that some of my proffesors,30-40 year olds,couldn't see that i was depressed and had issues,or they just didnt care ? My coaches,the older people i know,when i was hopeless,everyone would have something bad to say . Do some people really ever mature ? Are there humans in this world or something is wrong with me,everyone seems so shallow,pathetic,fake like its some joke.This is more like rant,but i had to get it out of my self.",16Jul2018,1
37,"I and BF went into a corner shop to get some water, I got two bottles of sparkling water from the fridge. The man at the till said, ""You do know they're sparkling"", I replied, ""Yeah"". He said, ""I'm sorry I'm not being rude, it's just that people often get them mixed up"". So I apologised to him and said not to worry, I knew he wasn't being rude (just stupid).

Later we went to the bus rally at Whitley Bay. I asked one of the bus drivers when the bus to Tynemouth would be setting off, as their website said there was a bus from Tynemouth to their location (which they were running) and I assumed they'd also be returning people back. The woman said she had no idea what I was talking about. Said there's excursions but not to Tynemouth and certainly not as transport and no stopping. She'd never read the website advertising their event. Later BF spoke to someone else and they said it has been cancelled.

The plan was to go to Cafe 19 on the seafront which is apparently the best cafe in Whitley Bay. I felt it would be an improvement to the horrid one I'd been to the day before which served me overcooked, split, scrambled eggs on toast (with soggy toast) and a pot of tea which spilled over the table when you poured it, along with a jug of milk covered in tea-towel lint and dust. This cost £6. It costs about 45p to make far better scrambled eggs on toast and a cup of tea at home.

So we went to this Cafe 19, a group of pensioners walked slowly in front of us in such a way that we couldn't walk around and had to crawl behind them. They then stood at the entrance and stopped still blocking access. Eventually I got sick and just said excuse me. They moved about an inch, enough for us to get past. The place was full, the outside area had no seats, which was fine, so we went indoors. I found one of the servers and asked if they took cards, he said they did but there was a £5 minimum. I said this was fine. He then said, but if you're ordering breakfast we're ending the breakfast now. I said fine. I asked if they had a menu. He said yes but it's last orders you need to do it now if you want any breakfast. I said I didn't want breakfast, I wanted a menu, “Don't you sell anything else other than breakfast?”. “Coffee, tea and cakes”. “Don't you have a lunch menu?”. “No we don't have a lunch menu yet”. I took this to mean they didn't serve lunch. I thanked him and left. I asked BF why it was so difficult to get a simple answer to a simple question. He didn't know, he never does.

When we were standing looking at the buses, a man came along in a high vis jacket and said in a half loud voice right beside me, ""Everyone, can you just...!"", I assumed he meant that he wanted me to move, but I said to myself out loud, ""Proper English would be nice"", then I turned to him and said, ""Can I just what?"", he was lost for words, I assumed he must have been an idiot and walked off to lay down on the grass while my partner looked at old buses. I noticed when looking around that the event seemed mostly aimed at the people who owned the buses and that they'd rather the public weren't there at all. The constantly wanted people to move out of the way.

When I was laying on the grass a man came over and said to another man, ""Do you know if the toilets over there are open today?"", the other man said, ""I think so yes."", then he asked, “well, weren't you here last Sunday?”. The other man said “yes I was, and they were open”. To which the man replied, ""Oh, well, in that case yes, I think they probably will be open then"". None of this meant anything, why didn't the man just say, ""I don't know if they're open, sorry”.

BF came back and told me the bus to Tynemouth definitely wasn't running and that it was cancelled at short notice. But there was a bus station close by and there was a bus to Tynemouth due in 10 minutes. By this point I was already sick of people. But I agreed that we would go, as we were both very hungry and my doctor told me I needed to make an effort to get out and have exercise.

We missed the stop in Tynemouth centre and had to walk back from the bus stop. It was very busy and I wasn't anxious so much as annoyed that people walked and stood in the middle of the path. We got to a cash machine and stood in line. The woman at the front told the man behind her, ""The cash machine is out of £10 notes"", he said yes and then he used the machine, then before he left he turned and said, ""I don't know if you heard, but the machine has no £10 notes, you can only get multiples of £20s"". I and BF thanked him. Then I took out £40 and when I got my money I turned to BF and said, ""I don't know if you heard, but this machine has run out of £10 notes, you can only withdraw multiples of £20s"". Then he took his money out. I said, “are you not going to tell the gentlemen behind you what the woman said to the man, the man said to me, and what I said to you?”. He said the man was just being friendly and that no, he wasn't because the people behind him probably heard what he said. Which was my point, we'd all heard what the woman at the front said, there was no reason for anyone to tell anyone else this inane fact.

After this we went and found a pub, by this point I was almost shaking with rage and disgust at the levels of stupidity I'd encountered already that day. When we walked in we found that all of the downstairs area was made into a restaurant with numbered tables, food menus and a Sunday carvery. I just wanted a drink, so I said to the server, ""Please could you tell me where the bar area is?”. He pointed to the bar in the restaurant then asked if I wanted food. I said, “no, don't you have a real bar, where we can just order drinks, and not food. You know, like, with stools?”. He said, “upstairs”. I thanked him.

We went upstairs and ordered our drinks, BF asked for his drink, the bartender said “yes”, but then turned back and said, “no sorry, we don't have any”. I figured seeing that his job was a bartender it would be reasonable for him to know what drinks he did, and did not have in stock in his bar. BF ordered something else. After we got our drinks the man said, ""Would you like to order any food?"", I said no. Why can people not assume that if I wanted food I would have asked for it? Indeed we'd come upstairs away from the restaurant for this exact reason. We sat down, I drank my pint and asked BF this. He said the bartender was just being friendly. I didn't think so. It felt like the whole place had a kind of ""Would you like fries with that?"", culture. I sat and stewed and wondered if I'd just gotten old. Why was everything so pretentious, lacking quality, value and necessity?

I'd had enough, I longed for a time when I could get a decent cup of tea for 60p in a polystyrene cup, excellent chips for 80p with batter and salt and vinegar and a buttered roll for 20p, and sit on a bench enjoying my meal in the sun. When we sat I looked at the website for the local chip shop on my phone, there was a job advert, ""Exciting career opportunity, Fish Fryer"". Even job adverts had succumbed to the pretentiousness of the place. Working in a chippy is now an exciting career opportunity in 2018. So that you can earn a wage, pay too much money for everything then die.

We left and decided to go to the market because BF wanted a burger. We got there and they had burgers, they were £4.50 each and nothing particularly special about them. It was too busy and the market has been selling the same tat to tourists for the past two years. Rarely is there anything of novelty or quality to be found there, which is why we stopped going on weekends. We occasionally go to car boots but most decent items are sold on ebay and don't make it to the traditional markets any-more.

I wondered if this was the point of work. To work a pointless job, to earn money to overspend on pointless frivolities on my weekends, pay people far more for a product than it's worth for 'the experience' of eating standing up in a crowded market, or sitting down in a pretentious bar. We only wanted to go out and have a nice cheap fry up and a cup of tea, which in the past was never such a difficulty.

Before we went back to the flat we went to Herons and bought bacon, beans and black pudding. We went back and made a breakfast of Scrambled Egg, Toast, Beans, Bacon, Black Pudding with ketchup and a mug of tea. I still can't quite figure out where I've gone wrong. I've made an appointment with a Psychiatrist to see if there's any way for me to go back and blindly go about life in blissful ignorance again. I'm not hopeful of this.",16Jul2018,0
38,"My boyfriend is the most amazing and caring person in the world. He is understanding, sweet, smart, helpful, caring and he has the worst luck on the planet. 

During this year a series of unfortunate events happened to him and because of that both of us had to make an effort to get him out of the bad situation he was in. 

I have a problem with stress, which means that I simply fear and panic too much, over too many things. All of those situations stressed me out a lot and I'm seriously feeling powerless at the moment. 

I am trying to help him the best I can, but for some reason it doesn't really work all the time. Lately my partner started stressing out, which is weird for him, because he's a very calm lad. Now both of us stress and it's just one big mess. We argue, we make bad decisions and we just can't seem to agree like we did before. I know it's because of all of the stress we feel.

39,"I don’t know if I’ll ever forgive myself for putting my own self in this situation. This is the dumbest thing I’ve done. 

I had been depressed, lost, and lonely for a while. One day, I guy that I would have NEVER gone for before (player, bad reputation, asshole to everyone, should be in jail for certain things) showed interest in me and I was so bored in life that I decided to give it a shot. I figured being involved with him would add some excitement to my days for a short while and snap me out of my depression limbo (temporarily). I know, I was an idiot. 

We hung out and slept together. I’d never had casual sex before so I didn’t know what to expect. I had no idea if it was right for me or if I’d be able to “handle” it. Needless to say, I wasn’t. I got attached to him pretty quickly. We talked and I realized how truly damaged he was and that there was a good guy beneath all of that brokenness. We formed a connection off of shared traumatic experiences and that’s when I started falling hard. 

We were involved for a year. As expected, he didn’t treat me very well. It was clear that I was just another notch on his bedpost no matter how many times he said he loved me. I knew I didn’t have the right to be upset (I knew who he was from the beginning) so I just stuck around. Also, the sex was absolutely incredible. We had some good times and a lot of bad times. My self esteem went from zero to in the negatives. Ultimately, it ended. 

It’s been a while (almost a year) since we last saw each other and I still think about him daily. Every single part of him. I hate myself for this because I know he isn’t right for me and isn’t even a good guy but my heart won’t let up. I’ve tried to move on but ended up comparing the guys to him and they always came up short. I’m afraid that he’s the guy I’ll love forever.

I’m conflicted because my heart wants him so bad while my mind doesn’t. As a person, I don’t like him. I think he has a lot of issues, doesn’t treat people well and I was often even embarrassed to be seen with him. But he’s all I want and can imagine wanting.

40,"Hi guys,

We’ve been together for 3 years.

My girlfriend has this pretty toxic girlfriend and she keeps seeing her.

She’s an awful person all-around and a few months ago my girlfriend even went to the country her friend was staying to be with her for a week.

When she arrived there, her friend did everything she can to not stay with her and left her alone all the time (she basically preferred to going out with other people). After 2 days my girlfriend calls me and said she needs an excuse to get out of there, so we found an excuse and I’ve bought the flight back for the day after (which costed a lot of money).

Between the apartment my girlfriend booked for a week + all the flights, I think the costs was around £1000.

At the time I’ve thought “well, this will teach her something”. Especially because I did tell her in advance to NOT go where her friends was staying, because I knew what kind of person she is.

Now this girl is back in town and she texted my girlfriend because she wanted to see her. My girlfriend accepted to see her like nothing bad ever happened.

I honestly don’t know what to do. It’s even pointless to keep worrying about it at this point. I’ve said to my girlfriend “I’m speechless” and ended the conversation there.

What should I do? Thank you!

TL;DR: My girlfriend keeps seeing a toxic girlfriend and I don’t know what to do anymore.",16Jul2018,16
41,"I love my girlfriend. She is smart, caring and beautiful. Most importantly we just seem to click in the most stereotypical romcom kind of way. I cannot imagine her not being in my life and I can genuinely see myself spending the rest of my life with her. I have no intentions of ever leaving her let alone ever doing anything to hurt her. 

However, she is my first for everything physically and emotionally. We got together when we were both 18 and now we are 21. I feel like I have changed so much in that time. I am more confident, I look after myself better, I dress better, I have a career which I am doing well in. In general my life has come together in the past 3 years, which in a huge part is thanks to her. 

Before we got together I was always to shy and unconfident to approach girls and no matter how obvious girls advances towards me were I never acted on them. In general I was awful around girls and to be honest people in general. A lot of that has got a lot better now, working in a professional environment has really helped my confidence and my social skills as well as having a girlfriend. I sometimes wonder how successful I would be should I be single now. I am not saying that I think I could do better than my girlfriend, she is already way out of my league. I just can’t help but wonder, I was always a bit jealous of my mates who were constantly meeting with different girls. It’s not even about the sex, more just the casual flirting stages of a relationship as I kind of skipped over that with my Girlfriend. 

My GF often asks me if it bothers me that she is my first of everything, do I want to play the field a bit more. And I can honestly tell her that it doesn’t bother me. Its more just a curiosity, one which I would never act on. 

I don't know if there needs to be a point to post on r/self because there isn't one to this post. Just been thinking about it and wanted to put in into words, and put it out there. Not really looking for advice or anything just felt like putting it out there for no one or everyone to see. Peoples opinions are appreciated, but its a bit of a nothing subject so not sure what you could say.

It hinders me in that I will censor myself, speak quietly if I say something that might offend somebody, and not act out in anyway in fear of rejection or conflict. I have a fear that people won't like me for who I am so I hide it behind this boring persona that's safe.

Sometimes I'm able to act like myself when I'm in a really good mood or stay positive and outside of my head - but these times usually don't last long and I revert to being the same old persona I was acting as after a little while. I'm scared that if I be myself people won't like me. This has gotten to the point where I hide myself from my sister and family in fear that they won't love me anymore.

* Exercise

54,"Hi to everyone who is reading this post. I want to say that English isn't my native language, so please don't pay much attention to my grammar. 

I'm 25 years old, i live in Kazakhstan and my job sucks dick. But its not about that, its about how i missed my chances, and i wish i could have a time machine...So i was born here in Kazakhstan, my father left me when i was 2 or 3 years old, at least this is what my mom told me. At the age of 13 i left Kazakhstan and moved to Thailand. So basically this is where i grew up. I lived there up to 19 years, studied there and worked. When i got there i didn't really appreciated it at first, i thought this is how people are supposed to live, most of the people were nice and mentality there was so much different from Kazakhstan. At first i fucked up my study in university, i was selfish and naive. Went to the night clubs, gaming clubs and at that same time i was doing drugs, nothing serious just weed. I'm not blaming weed for what happened,but it surely had a part in my development as a person. After i got transferred to the second university and got a degree, i stared working everywhere i could, modeling, insurance company, tourism. I've never worked at the same place for more than 3-4 months. By the time i was 19 i've finished my degree, but i couldn't find any work. Maybe because i didn't want to, maybe i was too lazy, i don't know...So i had to leave the county because my family couldn't support me anymore. I came back to Kazakhstan. First moths was great, because i never came here in those years while i was living in Thailand. So yea i was great, but after some time i started to understand, that this is not my country, the people are not the same, the language is not the same, mentality is so fucking much different from what i got used to. It was so hard and it still is...Anyway this is not the end. After i came back i worked for a year in Beauty Salon as an Administrator. Then i had a chance to go back to Thailand and try once again, find job or something that can help me stay there. My close friend offered me a job there in real estate. At first i thought it's okay and i'll look for something else. I was wrong, i declined his offer and went back with nothing. Such an idiot. This was the last time i went there. Now  i work with my brother and helping my mom with her business. They got i lot on their shoulders, mortgages are the biggest problems of all. My brother have two kids one 2 and another 7 years old. Deep inside i really want to go away from here as much as i can, but at the same time i feel that i can't just leave them, im the youngest and i feel i have to help them. This puts me in a lot of pressure...Mom understands me and she says you should go and try your luck somewhere, where you belong. This is not the place for you, she says. So here i am typing this, just want to talk out to someone,maybe an advice, support, i don't know, maybe just a respond.

I'm sure though that this is just the first of many assbackwards things I'll experience with the American medical system... but still. ",16Jul2018,0
62,"But the actual people of the Stuart dynasty shouldn't be conflated with the people that they represent: the Gaelic clans of Scotland who were most active in fighting for them and also had the most direct racial kinship with the people of Ireland. The Stuarts themselves were originally Bretons, and the people that were sent to the plantation were Northumbrian half-breeds, not the more purely Gaelic Highlanders and Islanders.

Scotland was colonized like Ireland (and in fact old Britain) was, by the Saxons. The main difference between the three was that Britain was colonized first, and was completely destroyed by the Saxon, Scotland was colonized second, and Ireland last. Because of that, Scotland is not as Germanified as ""England"" but more Germanified than Eire, and thus has long been caught between its ancient kinship with fellow Gaels and it's more recent inclination towards the easterlings who ravaged its borders in 653.

Basically, the more purely Scottish you get, the more pro Irish you get, which makes sense given what it actually means to be Scottish.",16Jul2018,1

I've seen too many talking heads on TV today saying ""Gee, I thought Trump was going to be tough on Putin, I'm totally surprised at how submissive he was.""  It's only a matter of time before it becomes natural to drop the pretense that Trump is in any way free of Putin's influence, or in any position at all to confront him on anything.

Hello fellow humans. I haven't been here in a while so its a bit strange being back in Reddit. So to the point. 
This chapter of my life, let us call it Suffering. Nothing much really, I'm doing just fine. But to give you a small part of what that my suffering consists of: Back around in November, I was in the hospital for a total of three weeks and a couple of more weeks to recover from surgery. Then back in April, I developed a friendship in a couple of days that stopped the person from committing suicide and again like a month and a half later. My god-brother did something..... with his girlfriend and got caught so they are both suffering consequences, and in turn, everybody is mad and emotionally hurt. Last week my grandma also had surgery, just when I'm doing my yearly vacation to see them. (Note: I know that some may be suffering more than others)

So where do I stand emotionally? Well to tell you a truth, I am holding up just fine. I believe it is okay to cry for the first day(s). But after that, I just get up. How? Well, its because I find it a bit easy to forgive people. Why? Because I just love humans, sure we are simple minded creatures, but we are equal, we are persistent and curious creatures. It's really a change in perspective. It is combining pitty and motherly-care. Seeing we the humans as an additional species in an ecosystem.

So whats my point? Well, suffering is okay once you come to understand it. I've begun to see things as ""they need to happen"". I may not know the end result, but I know it can be worth it. But at times, life can also be random because life is not always a mathematical equation. My few points for you to interpret: 1) Good things come in pairs 2) ""Everything in its time is beautiful, but if it happens before, it may be a curse"" 3)There is a purpose for those who continue to wait 4) Always come to understand the humans around you....

72,"I've noticed this growing a lot in the past few years. Both with random people online as well as well-known figures with large followings. Just earlier I saw somebody on reddit insist that they weren't right-wing and cited them being a libertarian as evidence. 

It seems to be related to e-celebs like Dave Rubin and Sargon who use the terms libertarian and classical liberal interchangeably while insisting that they are in now way right-wing. Sargon describes himself as a ""center left liberal"" despite being a member of UKIP. 

Some of these people obviously have some left-wing beliefs (pro gay marriage, legalization, abortion), however they for some reason believe that accepting incredibly mainstream left liberal policies somehow makes them more left-wing than their rather radical economic beliefs make them right-wing. This is of course assuming that these people actually believe in traditional libertarian economic thought. From what I've seen with people like Dave Rubin is he makes rather broad statements on economics and if somebody pushes him to be more specific he starts walking back his ""abolish all regulations"" rhetoric. 

This was just something I've been thinking about. From what I understand libertarians didn't have much of a problem with being considered right-wing until very recently, especially considering they find themselves allying with Republicans waaaaay more than Democrats. ",16Jul2018,2
73,"Disclaimer: The purpose of this post is not to doubt or judge people/redditors currently on meds or diagnosed with ADD/ADHD.

Lately, I have been reading posts about ADD/ADHD on reddit (definitely not because of me procrastinating from writing my Master's thesis). I found a lot of common symptoms that I share with people experiencing ADD, without the Hyperactive part. My mind sometimes fade out when I'm watching videos, listening to talks etc. I procrastinate a lot, it became a lot more significant than a couple years ago. And I have difficulty focusing when doing boring activity or carrying out responsibility.  


However, there are instances where I can be perfectly focused for hours, like when gaming or reading something I am interested. I once saw someone mentioning listening to music can minimise the distraction ADD people experience. And maybe its a placebo effect, I found that was kinda useful. I think it's my mind trying to find excuses for my laziness and tried to relate to the ADD/ADHD posts. And the fact that I can be perfectly focus on things I enjoy for hours may prove that I am indeed not an person with ADD.

Anyway, just want to put this out there. The ADD/ADHD posts are definitely interesting to read though. Not to discourage people to seek help, if you do think you may have ADD/ADHD symptoms, you should definitely seek professionals. Have a good day everyone. :)",16Jul2018,1
74,"So, someone had questions in AskReddit about why pro-life people think a certain way, and so I answered as clearly and calmly as I could and people LASHED THE FUCK OUT. Like, the OP specifically asked for my opinion on abortion and birth control. Go get fucked with a spiked dildo (I didn't say that).

I'm not throwing paint on women who go get abortions or anything, I just quietly keep my views to myself unless someone asks. Apparently that means ""I should go die in a fire and then burn in hell.""",16Jul2018,0
75,"This consumes my mind all the time. I try to keep the fantasy at bay, but sometimes I find myself messaging a girl who's not single on snapchat or instagram. So far I've stopped myself from going through with it because I know it's morally reprehensible.

76,"So there's this light fixture in my bathroom over my shower.  It's one of those recessed fixtures that you have to like pull the whole assembly out to change the light so I never wanted to change it because I was intimidated by its complexity.  Anyways the light went out back when I was in like 10th grade in highschool around 2012/13.  My family is downsizing to a house down the street and I realized I had to change this lightbulb.  I put off changing this lightbulb for 5 goddamn years.  

So, today I destroyed the thing that was a constant reminder that I was a lazy fuck.  I changed the lightbulb.  It took like 45 minutes because of the complexity of the fixture but I defeated one of my innermost demons.  I feel like the rest of my life is gonna be great knowing that light works now.

77,"Before I get into this, I know how stupid this all sounds. If it was one of my friends telling me this I’d tell them to move on and that they’re just hurting themselves in the long run. Logically I know every argument for why I shouldn’t be hung up for this girl and how I should be able to move on. And for the most part I am. I don’t think about her all day everyday, my whole life isn’t based around how much I like her. I’m in a much better position that I was. The whole all-encompassing, full hearted and non-stop barrage of feelings for her isn’t there anymore. But there’s still a small part of me that can just never quite get over her fully, I can’t help but compare every girl I meet to her in some way. 

Basically, to cut a very long story kinda short, we were best friends for about a year, and have known each other for like 2 now. We clicked instantly. She was single when we first met and there was quite a bit of flirting, but by the time I realised just how deep it went for me she was in a relationship. But we just kept talking and getting closer and closer, which I realise now I shouldn’t have done and should have just left it alone. You learn from your mistakes I suppose. I thought I could just be friends with her, but it got to the point where if we weren’t hanging out we’d be messaging each other every minute of every day. And every time I talked to her I fell for her more.

After months of this I reached a breaking point and realised I couldn’t keep this shit up, so I came clean. She told me her boyfriend has to be her priority, and that she thinks it’s for the best if we both took a step back and didn’t talk. I agreed it was for the best. I felt fucking hollow not talking to her, like some big part of me was just missing. But at the same time I knew I had to give myself time away from her, I knew it was the right thing.

So a few months pass. I start to heal. After about a month or two of just feeling sorry for myself I start to feel a bit better. I start doing shit to take my mind off things. I go out with my friends more. I download Tinder. I hit the gym. I start reading again. And for the most part it works. I don’t spend every waking moment thinking about her. I can feel myself moving on little by little.

One day she messages me out of the blue telling me how much she misses me, that she hates having to live her life without me there and that she thinks she’s gonna split up with her boyfriend. I tell her I’ve missed her too, and that I’m always there for her if she really does need me, and that I’m really sorry about her and her boyfriend. I won’t lie, a little part of me got excited thinking she hit me up thinking about dating me after her break up.

But the argument with her boyfriend blew over, and so I decided that for the sake of my own heart that I’d make minimal contact with her. We maybe have like a conversation every few days, which I suppose is a bit weird given our recent history, but it hasn’t really affected me too much. I try not to think too hard about what any of it means or whatever, I can handle it. I just keep her at arm’s length and push on. By the time she messaged me I was in a much better place. Like I said, I’ve got all this other shit I’m trying to focus on, the gym, reading, Tinder, socialising, etc.

But through all of this there’s just that little bit that I feel like will never get over her, you know? I don’t even feel like I like her in that way anymore. It’s something else. Like I don’t get butterflies thinking about her anymore, I don’t want to spend every single waking moment with her. I’ve actually started to see a lot of her flaws since this all happened, but at the same time I still want her to be part of my life for as long as possible. I never want to lose her. It’s a weird feeling, I really don’t know how to explain it. In that time not talking to her I never once regretted ‘wasting time on her’ or anything like you usually do getting over someone. I’m still thankful for every minute we had together. I wouldn’t change it for anything, despite how it all ended.

It just feels like I’m always gonna have a small thing for her, but also that we connected so much that I can never kick her out of my life completely. I really think my life is better for having her in it, no matter in what capacity. At the same time though there’s been times where I’m flirting with another girl or whatever and I’ve realised she’s still in the back of my mind, you know? I feel like most guys in life meet a girl who they just never quite get over completely, even if they don’t end up together. It doesn’t mean they’re ‘the one’ or whatever, but I think most people have ‘the one that got away’ or whatever, and I feel like she’s always gonna be that for me. She’s the first girl I ever felt that strongly about, the girl I’ve been closest to in my entire life, and I just feel like she’s always gonna be a part of me. I can go the gym, read, date other people, but I feel like I’ll just never fully move on from her completely. Does anyone get what I’m talking about here?
