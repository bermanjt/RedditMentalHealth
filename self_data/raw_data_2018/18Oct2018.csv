0,"This might be a common problem but here goes... I’m a recent college graduate who now works a part time job on the weekends with a lot of free time during the week but no hobbies or available friends around. I inadvertently spend a lot of alone time. I spent my college years being super busy, having fun, having a social life and things to keep me busy. Now that I’ve graduated and so have my college friends, I’ve been super bored very often. I realized I didn’t really have any hobbies and I haven’t  been able to find things to do by myself that I can enjoy. Most of my days are spent going to the gym, eating and obsessingly trying to find something to do with my time. I literally have no friends now because they all have moved away and have full time jobs. 
I get a bit depressed at times because of the boredom and really not having a social life. Also the fact that I can’t find things to do in my area or in my own company that I look forward to doing. 
Looking for advice on how to truly enjoy being alone, finding new things to do, how to make new friends and essentially begin to enjoy my life again and escape the boredom. I also want to know how to not be a clingy person since I am super bored most of the time, when I do get the opportunity to hang out with someone I want to spend a lot of time with them because of the lack of social life.  
Please help ! 
Thanks ",18Oct2018,1

3,"Too much is going on to put in a short post/the issues are probably not interesting to people anyways or you'd judge me for them, but my world is falling apart pretty badly, and I quit smoking about six months ago after multiple failed attempts over the last four years. I really want this to be the last time I quit, but I was always a stress smoker, and the sources of stress in my life cannot be addressed in any meaningful way for the foreseeable future as they are out of my control/addressing any one source of stress would make the others worse because of how they are linked. I used to just smoke a cigarette when I felt this way, and it's been hell to not be able to. I'd had cravings throughout this quitting attempt before, but they'd come and go for like an hour at a time every few days, but I've been obsessively thinking about having a smoke for the last couple weeks because every stressor in my life just got a lot worse all at once, and not one of them looks like it can let up any time in the next year or two. I'm currently working to improve my situation by going back to school, but that is a source of stress in and of itself and will take longer than I think I can hold out.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was an undergrad, I minored in Spanish so I decided to do a study abroad program in Costa Rica for a month. I chose to room with a family without another American student because I was fairly confident in my language abilities (enough to hold a simple conversation). I placed three tags on my luggage with the address I was provided of the home-stay family. Even so, I arrived and was informed my luggage was lost. I got through the first day with the essentials in my carry-on bag. On the second or third day, my home-stay mother and I got in touch with the airport informing me my bag was located. She refused to speak English with me unless I was really struggling to understand, but helped on the phone when we were trying to get my things. Unfortunately, she was unable to give me a ride to the airport to pick up my bag. I got in touch with someone at the University who told me there was a man with another international program going to the airport around 4 or 5 PM to pick up two more students and I could go with him. He didn't speak English, which was fine, I am just emphasizing this is all happening with my mediocre second language skills. I get a ride to the San Jose airport and find out he is picking up the people from downstairs, while i have to go upstairs to the check-in area to get my lost luggage. He tells me to go upstairs and that he will be downstairs once I get my stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I go to the counter and tell them: Mi equipaje esta perdido y yo recibe una llamada para recogerlo \[or something along those lines, it's been 11 years\].  They tell me to wait... I wait. I ask about it again about 30 minutes later. They tell me to wait... I wait... It has now been an hour... I wait... I see a couple in about their 40's go to the counter and they appear to be Costa Ricans, who were also told to pick up their luggage and were told to wait by the airport clerk. They sit nearby me and I think about how to translate and ask them if they are there for the same reason. Once I do, they agree and we both are a bit discouraged by the lack of communication about where our luggage is now located. We make some small talk and I try to explain that I am newly on a study abroad and they say they live in San Jose. After we wait for over another 1.5 hours, we are told to follow a clerk to get our luggage. 

&amp;#x200B;

We all get to claim our bags, and when I receive mine, it is no longer the three-tagged large duffel I left the U.S. with; it is now a black garbage bag with holes and duct-tape holding it together. *Great. Whatever, I lost some cheap jewelry, I have my clothing for the next month, I just need to find that man downstairs and get back to the home-stay.* It is now about 8 PM and I have had no way of communicating with the man who gave me a ride to the airport, nor with the home-stay family to let them know the situation. The couple I met while upstairs asks me on the way out of the airport how I am returning to my home-stay. I told them there was a man waiting for me from the University. They decide to wait until I find the man from the University to ensure I have a ride home. Well, he is nowhere to be found. Straight up ditched me at the airport. At this point the couple asks how I will get back and I tell them I have some money for a taxi, which I know we were warned to be weary of in San Jose, but how else would I get back? The couple tells me that taking a taxi would be dangerous, that they're all ""piratas"" and instead, they will give me a ride back to the home-stay which they know where it is near the University. So I did the quick math of dangerous outcomes: *Pirate taxi drivers vs. random strangers I met while waiting for my luggage*, and decided to accept the ride from the strangers.

&amp;#x200B;

Heading back toward the University, I was able to adequately relay the direction in Spanish back to the home-stay. The man helped me get my luggage, aka broke-ass garbage bag, out of the SUV and he gave me a business card with his name and writes his cell phone number on it. He tells me that he and his wife have two children about my age and they would never want their kids to be alone in a foreign country without any help. He told me to call them if I ever needed any help while I was studying in Costa Rica. I thanked them and headed into the house. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never had to use that phone number while on my trip, but to this day, it was one of the nicest gestures I experienced with strangers. I only wish I could tell this story to more people because I still think about what happened and wonder how things could have turned out if they weren't around.

5,"It's been a pretty good day, too! 

Like sure, I went to work on the boat this morning until about 4, but I managed to get a shit ton of work done, I felt good waking up, and I've been in an awesome mood today! The boat looks awesome, my dress blues look great, and my crew is the best. 

I managed to afford myself a slice of my favorite carrot cake today, and although I'm spending it by myself I don't even mind. I heard from all my friends from home today, and even talked on the phone with some during my two hour break. Not only that but I got two tickets from the boat to watch Hunter Killer on base Saturday evening with the cast and producer. I did get ghosted from a girl I liked two days ago for no reason, but it's all good because I think I can find someone to go with in time! Even then, I'll still enjoy myself. 

I woke up this morning to all these messages and texts from friends and old friends wishing me a happy birthday and wanting to catch up - the first good morning texts I've gotten in ages, and I realized that life doesn't suck. Life is actually pretty good, because even though I don't have anything, and I'm not really able to do much, I still have my mom, friends, and my crew who is my new family, and that's more than what a lot of people do have.

Often I get text messages and phone calls asking me to come in the following day or the day of, a few hours early. I used to say yes but I ignore them now because I am usually exhausted and I don’t feel like coming in early when I specifically make my schedule a certain amount of hours for a reason. 

A lot of people I work with do the same thing.

I don’t think I should feel guilty for not answering. ",18Oct2018,1
10,"Sorry, I know it's a stupid problem and that I shouldn't really be complaining. I feel upset and I'm hoping that putting my thoughts here for public viewing might offer up some insight. Or maybe I'll be so embarrassed by how dumb I'm being and just stop it.



We're currently exploring non-monogamy to see if it's for us. Well, I know for a fact that I love group sex and swinging. I deeply enjoy the physical connection, the fun, and the casual distance. I like seeing my husband with others. It honestly and truly is something I can see myself happily doing! But I want to as well. I want him to look at me with a mix of pride and lust when he's having fun with another person. Obviously, he doesn't feel the same. It's a large element of my sexual identity and it's not something I can make disappear but I know that when it comes up he doesn't like to hear it. He seems insecure about it so I don't want to bring it up basically at all ever. It's not healthy.



I just feel like I got my cake but can't eat it, and it's a beautiful fucking cake. My favorite flavor in fact. I keep telling myself that he can't help it, to give him time, that it's not his fault but rather his super-conservative upbringing. But at the end of the day there is a sexual imbalance that I don't think I can accept. He says that he may be able to one day. I know that's not true. We've had conversations that go nowhere because he doesn't want to even think about it. I feel like, if the thought is unbearable then why say with time? He can't even talk about it hypothetically.



I even feel guilty for not being able to accept these terms. I should be able to be happy that he's *finally* taking the initiative! But now? Seriously? I give him a hall pass to flirt with others and stuff and suddenly he's engaged! He's excited! He's taking initiative and sharing and telling me his weird fantasies! I love this element but I don't love that this is what it takes- telling him he doesn't have to have sexual chemistry with just me while knowing that there's no ""risk"" in me doing the same. I honestly have no interest in other men which makes regret telling him that I'm bisexual. He seems to fear that anyone can snatch me away, which is also an insult.


I'd almost rather just going back to once-a-week vanilla sex at this rate. I know I won't because I'm a god damn weirdo but I'm exhausted just thinking this whole predicament. Especially since, in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter.


I guess I wish I had explored just a teensy bit more when I was single. I feel like if I had done that then I wouldn't be feeling this way. I could accept my husband's wishes and fulfill my own without thinking that he's getting ""more"". Nothing too crazy. Just something I can say ""yeah, I did it!"" 


I guess it might be important to say that he's had a hand full of sexual partners whereas I've only had two, and the first one was AWFUL. I'm also the stereotype of discovering my sexuality AFTER marriage. I understand why he's insecure but... am I really so fickle? Does he consider me  so weak-willed that I'll go with anyone who shows me a good time?


I'm so fascinated by swinging and we're even going to a club this weekend! Fucking lucky, right?! Except... he's made it clear that he doesn't want to go with his attitude. He doesn't want to talk about it and even told me that it makes him uncomfortable. Why do it then? I don't have fun unless he is too. He's my partner and I want to share the things I like. I want him to like them to. He just doesn't though.


It's hard to accept but I've also decided that I don't consider my sexuality as a significant part of my identity. It never really was before so there's little reason for it to be significant now. I'm happy for the short exploration. I only regret not doing just a few things that I like. Turns out, when you indulge a fetish it feels fantastic! It's not my reason for living though. It's not my end all, be all, you know?

Recently they had a big fight and she was sad as shit so I did what i normally did and tried to help her out (mind you this was like at 2am). Afterwards, she sent me a video saying she had feelings for me and i wont lie i sort of always liked her so i did something i never thought i could fucking do in my life, show my feelings too (weird shit huh). She started saying that im nice and make her happy and we kept talking to each other for about 2 hours more and it seemed like she really liked what i wad saying. 
The next day, she starts avoiding her bf and her friend said that if he loves her he better show it now or never. Now i dont know if it had to do with me but i got embarrassed and tried to hide my face when she was talking. To not seem suspicious i took his side about the fight but i knew that his gf was the one that was right. Later that night he said how he cant take these fights anymore and how he wants to break up with her. I felt a bit guilty but i didnt want to put my opinion on this shit. 
And today, oh glorious fucking today, they are both in student council so they took a field trip. Expecting him to break up, i was anxious as to wtf was gonna happen. Well they come back and they are back together. Not thinking much about it, i go along with my day. When i get home, i get a message from her saying how she is sorry. Confused, i respond with a question mark and she started saying how she did think about me dating her but she was sad as shit the night she sent me those messages and drank lean with her cousin to help her (ik this is a dumb decision and its bad). She also admitted that her cousin dared her to send messages like the one she sent me to someone she cared about a lot. Unsurprised (something like that has happened to me like 5 times before), i tell her its ok and that its not the first time it’s happened to me. She starts feeling guilty and says how she feels like she fucked some shit up between us. I didnt want her to start feeling bad so i started complimenting her. She started calling me cute again and how anyone would be lucky to have me and said that she didnt want me to have problems with my friend. I told her that im used to things like this happening and how ive become desensitized to shit like this happening. She started saying how she should kill herself and how she shouldn’t be alive. Concerned, i told her to not do anything stupid and how its not her fault. At this point i started crying a bit too because when i was 13 i was considering suicide so that brought flashbacks. I started getting emotional too and well we both kept putting ourselves down and helped each other up again. She ended the conversation saying how if she could, she would date me but there are just too many things that would be affected if we dated. She said she was going to cry and talk to me later. She responded but i didnt see the message in time for her to see it since i was watching a movie. Now u might think what do i want since im posting this here. Well to put it simply, i want to know what u think i should do. If it helps my friend aka her boyfriend  is moving to a different school next year and i think we all know that long distance relationships dont really work out that well most of the time.",18Oct2018,1

Im sorry if this post is jumbled or doesn’t make sense. I’m posting screenshots of my conversation with my (ex?) boyfriend, I think that will sum it up. I’m sorry it’s long. I don’t expect anyone to respond really. Im just doing this out of desperation. I just want feedback, any sort of feedback, it doesn’t have to be advice. I feel like I’m screaming so loud but no one is hearing me. I know I have a voice, why aren’t I being heard? 

I just want someone, anyone to tell me that my feelings matter, even if they are trivial and dumb. 

I just poured my heart out to the man I love about my inner tormenting caused by my relationship. I thought being completely open would elicit a response from him. Maybe that would change something inside him. Maybe seeing my pain would help him understand. He never really lets me talk about my feelings, he immediately shuts it down with “I don’t want to fight right now”. 

I don’t want to break up with him. I know we aren’t a good match, but that doesn’t stop me from being in love with him. I don’t think he loves me back, even though we’ve been together a year and he tells me he loves me. 

I’m scared of being alone. Im in therapy to fix this. I feel like my friends don’t care enough to listen and I’m 2,000 miles away from my family, who have much bigger problems than this.

I have opinions and glance to the passenger seat to empty air to which I can express my thoughts. Nothing comes out. A disdainful smirk takes place before other fading and changing emotions only seen in a barely visible reflection of my windshield. The conversation plays out in my head as it has every night home. The questions tendril across my brain leaving kool aid stains on my minds marble surface. What's for dinner? Do we need to do laundry? How was work? Do your feet feel good today? Do I need to buy you new shoes? What show do you want to watch tonight? Do you think the cat behaved? What's on your mind?

Opening the door successfully on the first try doesn't have the same charm as watching her struggle like a stubborn child always forgetting which way to unlock the door. Closing and locking the door in one fluid motion practised. Taking my first step inside with no barrier to hit and exclaim that we shouldn't pause as soon as we enter. Others want to come in too. Excuse me please. Emptying my pockets without thinking of a half dozen questions saved from the car only now being asked. Having the answer to dinner planned out and executed silently in quick steps. Sitting down with the show I knew I would watch while I ate exactly what I prepared. My stomach fills as the show unfolds without the reliable extra 10% from another plate that always ""just happens"" to be left. I understand the show and have no audience to show my enthusiasm to. A void is all I have to point out the tiny nuances and hidden clues and easter eggs to. The void stays silent. 

I find a stopping place without objection and begin to turn in. I take the motions of a machine slowing one part at a time until everything has been folded in a compact and organized shape. I hate it. The shower retains heat longer because I'm the only one using it. The tower is nearby because no one took it for silly reasons. No one checks on me on the toilet and my reminder is left to the lost feeling in my legs. The toothpaste is kept in a reliable place and I pause in habit but no one is brushing their hair using the mirror or lost in rapture at an attention seeker on youtube using a fake accent to describe overly priced pallettes of pigment and the precise methods used to put on a gaudy display. I finish my ritual with record time.

Laying down next to a pile of clothes I can only reassure myself I will put them away tomorrow. I am not greeted with squinting eyes and remarks of doubt but I smile and shrug the same. I stretch across the bed without complaint finding freedom amd new land to spread across. It's foreign and somehow sacred and I hesitate to enjoy it. I try but it is just not my mold and it goes unused as I take my usual spot. Nothing stips me from using the blanket to myself but my back is cold. Turning over doesn't help because my arms are empty. The room is too quiet and the rythmatic snores never come that lulled me asleep. It's too quiet. I have too much time.

30,"I honestly want to quit out on this life.

So far I’m being bogged down by so many bad habits that suck the life out of all that I do and all I dream of doing.

Masturbation - I can’t keep that out of my life - to some fetishy shit as well that I’m super closed off about and hate myself for having.

YouTube, Social Media in general - it’s a fucking time-waster but it holds attention so fucking well so I will easily eat away alot of fucking time on it.

Whenever I’m on social media I’ll also compare my own life with other people’s and then just get myself into a really shit headspace because of all the things other people are and all the things they have remind me about what I have (or rather don’t have) and what I’m not in my character and personality.

So frequently I just want to switch out my personality for someone elses, my life for someone elses, or just get rid of my existence in general. Like, if there’s someone out there who is younger than you and better than you at doing something, pursuing a dream, contributing to the world then what is the fucking point in my existence? Why should I even continue if the firm I want to work at will hire someone else instead of me? Why should I bother pursuing a passion and doing what I love when theres so many other people who are more passionate, have grown up more aligned with this dream and are thus programmed to have a better time accomplishing it?

The other side is equally as bad. Sure everything that’s worth doing in life is uphill, but I can’t fucking make it up that hill no matter how hard I try to. And everything and everyone around me is the same fucking way as well. 

Or maybe they’re not, in which case it’s my own fucking perspective and thought patterns and habits that continue to churn in the stimulus I receive from all my senses in this distorted negative fucking way.

If I try to change myself, then it’s like I’ll get a lil better but then by the time I hit checkpoint A, everybody around me is already at checkpoint D, and people years younger than me are already at checkpoint B in their lives.

To top it all off, no one wants to care about people who self-pity, thats the most toxic shit, “HOW ABOUT YOU JUST GET UP AND DO SOME WORK, JUST WORK AT IT AND STOP BEING A LITTLE BITCH, NO ONE CARES, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT PUNK ASS BITCH”

I can feel my dreams getting devoured by my bad habits, behavioural patterns or ‘personality’. The actions I take day to day aren’t controlled by me: they’re filtered by my brain who feeds me all this garbage telling me to go the other way; im controlled by the programming, the habits that take me in that direction.

Why bother getting anywhere? Once I get to that place, other people will be ahead. It’s not an achievement, it’s a pre-cursory criteria - every fucking thing doesn’t deserve recognition or accolade - you’re garbage - i tell myself. 

I’ve lived these emotions, gone through this same day over and over and over and over again. I just turned 20 but if I have to live another one of these days again I might just end this shit. It’s too fucking difficult and no one cares.

Then my girlfriend calls wanting to talk. I keep playing but I focus on talking to her, my friends didnt like it but I decided to keep her happy. After awhile of talking (roughly 10pm) she wants me to ""lay down"" with her. (Go lay in bed and talk to her while she watches youtube).

I was stupid and responded with the fully wromg response apparently. ""Not right now"" I tried to explain that I just wanted to relax and play games with some close af friends but she hung up. So I'm stressing that I pissed her off and my friends try to calm me a bit. After half a hour we get done and I text her and tell her. 

She calls and we talk for a bit but not much is said, shes upset and I'm emotionally exhausted. She ends up hanging up after telling me to go to bed. Instead I laid here staring at the ceiling for the last few hours thinking, crying, wondering why I'm in the position that I am.",18Oct2018,1

42,"Hey guys and girls,

&amp;#x200B;

So a little more detailed explanation; I broke up with my girlfriend about a week or two ago because it just wasn't working, I could not see a future with her. We were each others first REAL relationship, sure we both had other relationships, but neither of us went above 3rd base with our ""exes"". Anyways, the reason the relationship didn't work was because of many reasons: 

&amp;#x200B;

1) She was ""too nice"" to everyone, she never stood up for herself or me, and it got to a point where she was trying to please everyone except me.

2) She never admitted her mistakes even though it was obvious; she never apologized unless I beg her to, and, 

3) She LOVED arguing. My family background isn't so great, I live at home with my parents and one sister, and no one gets along for more than an hour, there's never peace at home. I grew up in a very dysfunctional and mentally abusive family, thus, peace is an essential characteristic I look for in a relationship, which this didn't have. 

&amp;#x200B;

We'd been dating for two and a half years with a lot of ups and downs; it was going great throughout the first year and a half until I found out that she wasn't loyal at the beginning of the relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, there was this guy, this fling of hers who in my point of view kept messaging and harassing her (she didn't feel harassed and still tried being friends with him until I said that I wasn't comfortable with it). He kept asking to meet her and instead of her saying no, she would be like ""sorry I cannot right now, I'm busy, maybe next time."" Her response would hurt me because he wasn't the only guy interested in banging her, she's a gorgeous woman who had her fair share of looks from every other guy. I never spoke my heart because I'm not as secure as I'd like to be about my self, and I didn't want to show that to her. Eventually, she'd say this to every guy, and I told her that it made me uncomfortable, justified it as being kind to these guys and then it didn't happen AS OFTEN as it did before, which I still appreciated. Flash forward a year and a half into the relationship this guy messages her again, and we were in a perfect place at that point of time, we both were really happy in general and times were good. So I started fucking around with the guy using her phone, trying to bait him and play a prank on him, I sent him on a 4-hour drive ""for a good time"" and it was funny, we laughed it off although she felt bad for the guy and I didn't understand why. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) The guy was a jerk, only interested in flinging with her.

2) He said disgusting shit like ""he's your boyfriend, not your husband, so its fine to cheat on him.""

3) He asked her for nudes - TO WHICH SHE GAVE A VERY POLITE ANSWER - NOT DECLINING - NOT GIVING - INSTEAD OF BLOCKING THIS FUCK WIT. (Beginning of the relationship, say first 3 months?). After I told her what the fuck I don't like this, she blocked him.

&amp;#x200B;

I understood that she was the kind of person who wants to please everyone and I accepted it. Anyways, we had access to each other's phones since it was a very open and trustworthy relationship, I used the WhatsApp web feature after he messaged to talk and lure him, she was obviously with me then. After the whole thing finished, I wondered why she felt bad to give this jackass what he deserves, I've read all her chats before, vice versa, and from my point of view it only looked like he was harassing her. So I went back on WhatsApp web to read the chat again to figure out why could she feel bad for him, everything was one way right? Wrong, upon looking at the history, THINGS SHE HAD DELETED FROM THE START OF THE RELATIONSHIP RECOVERED AND APPEARED THERE, she was as much as a party as he was, and this gutted me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I read the chats from the start again and again because I couldn't believe my eyes, it was shit like ""We'll meet after my college ends"" ""I'm horny are you free right now"" ""I prefer doing stuff in the car"" blah blah blah, it hurts even to type this now. I called her right away this was 7 AM, I stayed up all night reading the chats again and again and then moved on to other chats to find possible similarities, there was a lot of flirting with other guys but nothing as serious. I told her what I found and broke up with her straight up, she was sleepy and confused and was trying to calm me down. She then proceeded to come over and calm me down and explain things, and this is what made it worse, ""I don't remember what happened it doesn't sound like me"". She apologized, she said she might have been in a bad place blah blah and how I made her a better person, and she doesn't want to lose me. It wasn't enough for me, I told her that it's over, but she was persistent over the days to follow and eventually we got back together. Again, then what followed was more fucked up, she started acting like the victim whenever I tried to talk to her about it to console myself. All I wanted to hear was ""I'm sorry; I did attempt to cheat on you"" (She said nothing happened after the relationship, only a month before the relationship begun). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways more fights about that, back and forth then we were okay then we were not, and it's not been stable for the year the followed that. There was also another huge incident which was her fault (This happened before all of the above happened) which of course she didn't apologize until it was too late. In the final year, stuff was good sometimes, stuff was horrible other times, and I started feeling like it was more bad than good. Finally, a tiny fight where again she didn't admit her mistake and didn't apologize ticked me off and I went to her and broke it off face to face 100% serious. I ""broke up"" with her multiple times after the WhatsApp incident but it never lasted, this one will. Now what the problem is that she ""doesn't want to lose me"", she still has deep feelings for me, but I lost a good chunk of my feelings in the past two-three months. She tried getting me back into the relationship again but I know it's just going to end up back here, so better late than never. Also, she still doesn't think that the last fight which ticked me off was her fault, which it clearly was. I know when I'm wrong I do apologize whenever I feel like I've made a mistake. The breakup is now finally mutual because I helped her realize that this would never work, she's always wanted a Romeo which is far opposite of what I am. Our core principles are also very different; I'm really practical when it comes to everything, money, relationships, and my career. She's more like ""live for now"", cabs everywhere, fancy restaurants, fuck saving money. Which I do respect but it's obviously not a compatible relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

She said if not a relationship, she doesn't want to lose me as a friend, to which I agree, but I know that it's not healthy. I am still attracted to her, sexually and emotionally. I would hate to see her with other guys and I won't be able to move on. Funny story, we went to a bar after the breakup ""as friends"" with her group of friends, and a truth or dare question was ""What do you regret the most"", she said ""Including my mom so much into my life"" (Brown parents, curfews and stuff) which is fine, it kind of hurt that it wasn't fucking this relationship over but no problem. Few questions later ""What have you done to someone who didn't deserve it"".. Answer? Sent an ex-fling far away. Boom, I'm fuming, I didn't create a scene but I casually got the fuck out of there. REALLY? IT WASN'T CHEATING/ALMOST CHEATING/BETRAYING ME?...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, she actually apologized for that, surprising.. We met a couple of times after that as friends and it was okay, kind of fun. I do want to stay as friends a little bit because I lost all my friends when I started dating, it was my fault because I neglected them, honestly, they weren't ""FRIENDS"" more like a hang-out group, so no regrets there. I'm yet to find a best friend I can really hit it off with. I'm not social and lean toward the introverted side. I'm lonely, and I have nowhere else to turn, work is full of people much older to me (I'm a full-time intern 9:00-6:30), college (I attend once a week, sometimes..) is full of fuckwits who aren't ambitious and only want to party 24 7.

&amp;#x200B;

This is more of a rant thread than seeking advice, but advice would really be appreciated. What do I do regarding her? Should I cut all ties? I remember things sometimes, and it drives me nuts! I honestly just want to say fuck it, cut all ties with everyone, go to the gym, get the magic body (I'm a little healthy, probably a big factor of my insecurity) (I'm lazy AFFF). Save up for braces to fix my fuckall teeth which my fucking parents are busy neglecting because ""we can't afford it"", even though the latest gadgets and useless waste of money things are okay. My sister, 30 years old still fucking feeds off my parents, and she is a waste of life, I might sound like a complete fucking tool but I can assure you that I have nothing but hate in my heart for her. A completely different story, won't fall into that, but let's just say that if she, the major source of hatred in the house, wasn't in the picture, I might have had a functional family, she drives both my parents crazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to forget my upbringing, my past, be the most confident person I can, and I then think everything will fall into place. What do you guys think?

They were there the day I was born, we had a room at their house, we spent almost every weekend with them throughout my entire childhood. I loved my grandpa so much. He was my papa, and the closest thing to an actual father I had in my life.

I was with him when he took his final breath, along with my mom, my grandma and his two daughters (he was my step-grandpa, techically). 

I just remember saying goodbye to him, touching his arm knowing he wasn't there anymore. It was just a shell. It really got to me. I've lost plenty of people in my life. But I was never there with them in their final moment. 

I was really sad about it last week, obviously. I couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't breathe. I just kept crying. Today I'm doing better. I feel like this grief created a new me.

46,"And no, this is not me self diagnosing myself because I think it looks cool or edgy to have mental health issues. This is embarrassing for me and a quality that I truly dislike about myself. 

I’m not even really sure what all quite constitutes social anxiety, but I think my issues may fall into the category. My main issue is bathrooms, especially at work. I will not leave the stall or make my existence known by making noise (getting tp, flushing, getting back dressed) if anyone else is in there. I just sit still, most of the time scrolling through something on my phone until they leave, and then I will allow myself to finish up and leave. This hinders me at work, because sometimes people will be in and out for like an hour and I will have no privacy and I will wait there until everyone is gone. 


Another issue is just doing *anything* in front of anyone else. I feel embarrassed or guilty if someone sees me doing something even though it’s not bad or wrong. Some examples of this would be: 

•Taking the elevator. I usually will literally go hide around the corner if I see someone in the same space and then wait until they leave to use the elevator. 


•Getting drinks from a vending machine. I feel exposed or like I need to hide the fact that I’m doing a normal thing such as getting a drink. I sometimes avoid getting a drink altogether if other people are around. 


•Just existing. I get frightened super easy by someone “coming out of nowhere” or being around a corner. Stuff like that normally doesn’t make people jump. If I walk around a corner in the office, and someone is standing in the hallway within any sort of fairly close range, it will cause me to jump from being scared. I don’t even get that scared in haunted houses. 


Getting out of my car and going into places requires me to muster up some confidence before I get out. Most of the time, my boyfriend goes in for me if we are needing to go to a gas station or quick Walmart run. Idk. I don’t want to make this too too long. Do these issues seem fairly normal to some extent..? Really weird? Traits of anxiety? ",18Oct2018,1
47,"Throwaway because some of my classmates are on Reddit, plus my username is well known to my classmates and friends.

Hello everyone,

I am currently struggling with low self-esteem and anxiety. Every time I see somebody gets an award for best achievement (in terms of grades), it makes me feel bad to myself, as I have yet to achieve the best student award (although to be fair, in terms of grades, I am performing well, yet some of my friends get higher grades than me). I sometimes wish those people who get higher grades than me complimented me about my achievement. I also have a tendency to say sorry excessively, like when I ate together with my friend; to the point that she said that I did not do anything wrong.

I also have anxiety when it comes to socializing, fearing that others view me boring, weird, etc. This is why I have fears when I am asked to play games together, fearing that again, I am boring to play with.

Regarding my past, my relationship with my brother has not always been good recently. Here are just a few things that he did to me:

- Forcing me to do things together like football, even though I said no. If I dared to say ""no"", he will threathen to erase my game's save file. 
- Humiliating me when I can't do something.
- Once, I posted video games stuffs too often on Instagram. While we had gathering with my cousins, out of nowhere he mockingly announced my video games-related posts to my cousins. This actually broke me down to tears.
- Blaming me when the internet speed drops.
- Always asking me to pick up stuffs for him.
- Told me I am boring because I do not know the actor that plays a character in a film.

Also, I don't think my parents are supportive to me either. Everytime I tried to tell my problems to my mother, instead of supportively listen, she instead got mad at me, pointing out what I did wrong to make the problem happened. She also often called me weird, and compared me to my friends.

So, does these things warrant a therapist? I am heavily considering to have a therapist, as I am in  final year of my university study, and the density of projects have overwhelmed me to make these two issues magnified.

I literally have no idea what a healthy relationship is like. 
I kind of had this epiphany because I was so devastated when the guy I was involved with  blew right back out of my life for the the third time. I couldn’t think Of much else besides how much I missed him, and how I hoped I would hear from him soon. 
It occurred to me that he was having a great old time living his life and if he gave a shit about my feelings he wouldn’t keep coming back only to leave my life again In the first place. I let people treat me like shit and I don’t even realize it until much later. All of my relationships are some variant of the last one. 

I don’t bother trying to put myself out there because of how I am and the type of person that I attract. I am scared I’ll meet someone that will seem like they’re great , but would actually turn out to be a psychopath that would hurt me physically and or ruin me mentally.

52,"My [27/F] best friend [also 27/F] of over 10 years doesn’t listen.

My best friend successfully works in the mental health/psychology field. I’m sure her working life is very different from her personal and social life. She’s most likely a different person at home and besides, who wants to keep on their professionalism outside of work? She is human, and does have flaws as we all do. She doesn’t like that just because she works in that field, people treat her as if she needs be a therapist 24/7 and it’s as if she’s not allowed to have her own feelings and thoughts. I don’t treat her as such—but I do question some of her behaviors and choices.

I’ve realized years ago my friend has a listening problem. Particularly to me, and sometimes others as she’ll re-tell an experience she’s had with someone and her husband has called her out on it, “No...that’s not what happened.”

My friend has always been a big talker and can go on for quite a bit. I’ve been more of the listener/receiver. I honestly don’t know if she likes to hear herself talk but I always listen and make small comments back to show I care. But when I share some information about myself, I don’t think she chooses to store it in her memory. It can be about anything from interests, my aesthetic for art and design, to events, to even mentioning it’s my wedding anniversary when she was visiting my household without so much of a “congrats!” And instead “So what do you have planned for us today out on the town (on her visitation)?” She even looks surprised when after I’ve past-expressed something about me and later on in life that same sudden-said-moment actually, physically, happens before her with me while she responds with a, “I love this thing too! Wow, I had no clue you felt so strongly about this thing!” (But.. you did have a clue, if you’d listened to me before?) 

Recently, I’ve told her countless times over the span of two days that I will not be available this weekend to spend time together while her husband is away—on the phone, over text messages, and even to her face when she was over for dinner and wine. She texted me again yesterday asking if we could get together on Saturday. I really don’t know how else to make it clear that not only am I unavailable, but to also remind her I that I am indeed not available this weekend because I have family coming into town. I don’t want to sound like a bitch. It’s hard because I love her, and I don’t want to upset her when I say ‘no’ because she doesn’t do well with separation, but I also find myself impatient at times like these when a person fails to listen and understand my needs/boundaries or simple instructions. I feel like it isn’t hard to know this stuff. At the same time, I’m no better as I tend to have selective hearing or even feel myself dissociating if my sensory is overloaded with processing information—but I looked her dead in the eye about my family coming over on Saturday! We even discussed relatives! I can’t find the words to correct someone without sounding like a bitch. I want to sound more affirmative and confident. I don’t like being mean or spiteful which is why I just sometimes put up with it instead of saying, “Well, you know I’ve mentioned I won’t be available this time around, so how about next weekend?” I just don’t want to let her down, y’know? I think she’s sensitive to being blown off even if plans are already made.

Addition to story:
-After much discussion of my relatives and their craziness lately, I’ve offered my friend that if she really, truly, wants to spend time with me this weekend...then does she want to hang around me and my family? I say this truthfully, but also sarcastically because I already knew her response and it was a clear, “No.” No, she does not want to spend time with my family. I didn’t think so, haha. I joked with her on this. 

-I always express interest in her talks and stories. I give her feedback. She doesn’t always acknowledge it or interrupts me mid-sentence to elaborate on her story and her feelings even more. It’s honestly not even unsolicited advice I’m giving her but I’m trying to relate to the subject. I get to the point where I say few worded sentences back because I’ve either already heard the incorrectly-spoken story before a hundred times or I know I’ll just be interrupted before my thoughts on the subject come to a conclusion.

-I only give advice and truthful beliefs of mine if I’m personally asked for the advice or what I feel is right in a given situation. Even if it means telling my friend she’s in the wrong for wanting to do x, y, z for herself feeling bad over a flakey person. She doesn’t always take my advice and will go the opposite direction but that is completely her choice to make.

-I will never put her up on the pedestal for this, but I would believe that if you’re in the mental health field...wouldn’t you be a good listener?

TL;DR: Best friend lacks listening skills to my boundaries, interests, and needs. Asks to spend time together on days in unavailable, often, even after I’ve countlessly said I can’t or have already made plans. She’ll ask again the next day before said-plans. This is a continuous cycle and has been for years.",18Oct2018,1
53,"I am currently inside of my car at college waiting for my mom to help me find out why my car won’t start. i feel like one bad things after another keeps happening. First, i am having problems with my tuition. I still owe 700 dollars to them. I was in the hospital about 2 months ago so I have about 800 dollars in medical bills. I am not doing so good in my match class. I had to pick up 40 hours for the rest of this semester to pay off tuition and bills and save for next semester. Today, I was determined to forget that and just have a regular productive day. I studied for my math class. Studied for my anthropology class. I was going to go home and finish my essay, read, and then go to work, shower, and sleep. But no, of course my car won’t start. It’s cranking but it won’t start and the brakes are hard to push down. So now i have to figure out how i am going to fix my car because i have to be at class by 8am tomorrow. AND i probably won’t be able to work tonight which is shitty because i’m broke and i’m going to probably have to pay money to get my car repaired. I just need all of this to stop. I am seriously considering taking next semester off just to get back on my feet. Life sucks. ",18Oct2018,1
54,"I had a pretty serious infection a month ago and needed IV antibiotics.  The doctor said it will kill a good chunk of my gut bacteria and to expect changes in my bowel movements.  That was the understatement of the year because I haven't had a remotely solid shit for three weeks.  I can't trust my farts, and have started carrying a spare set of underwear in my car. 


I'm not the anti-vax, antibiotics are poison, MRSA will wipe out humanity kind of person, and I did bring this on myself by not going to the doctor when I knew something was wrong, but this is miserable.  I miss regular poop.",18Oct2018,1

59,"First year of college, I have no idea what I want to do, and I am not enjoying any of it so far. 

I get up, go through class, and go home to play games.. I usually don't do my work until the day before or after and take a late grade just because I hate doing it. 

I've applied to a few jobs but got rejected. So now I just play games until I go to sleep. It's sad but it gives me something to do and I enjoy it.

60,"Im an ingenuous guy, simple minded, child-like, naive, confiding, chasing approval/affection/attention. Its really annoying and frustrating
Im very arrogant also. 

I try to much to say what others want to hear. But never say what i want because i dont know and in fear of others not liking me. Today a guy said i liked you more last year then i asked why. I ask the longest question just to a yes or no. I cant close to people... when i change my self from being nice i become an asshole. I say passive aggressive jokes. I try to hurt people its all hate inside me. I get jealous of people having good friends and wish i was like them. Maybe its a porn fap addiction problem... i give too many fucks. I dont know how to give less. 

I live in fucking iraq/kurdistan in a small town. There is no swimming pool here. No therapist. No cinema, one bad gym place. And i dont have money for it. Im 17 in 11th grade. Happily i dont suck at school as much. Im kind of chubby guy last year i was 85KGs now 72KGs...",18Oct2018,1
61,"When we got together she told me that she easily gets jealous like if I look at other girls and stuff like that. Thing is I’m not very popular the only girls I talk to are in school about whatever assignment we have and on social media I literally have no contact with women I only send memes to friends 
And she knows this she has used my phone several times 

And I don’t want to be emotional or annoying but she is still friends with her ex who she was together with just like 3 months ago and she has plenty of friends and people to talk with

Yet SHE is the jealous one
Idunno It just feels weird 

I’m not very jealous and I’ve met her ex and he is a nice guy not toxic towards us or me but it still doesn’t feel good knowing that he is her best friend and they hang out frequently ",18Oct2018,1

65,"Throughout the course of this last while of my life, the course of my journey of self-rediscovery, I feel that I've had an opportunity to learn many important, insightful, and valuable things. Unfortunately, I feel as if I haven't learned all that that I could've, if only I'd been ever more diligent in my observations of myself and the world around me. Regardless, with the observations I've been able to make thus far, I still feel as if I've learned an incredible amount in a short span of time. And further, some of the things that I feel that I've learned, I believe very strongly that they are important enough to share with others.

The below linked writing is one of these understandings that I personally believe is one of the most important observations that I've discovered, or rather rediscovered in my own way, with my own personal variation, or addition, to how I'd been introduced to the concept prior.

Because I know that it's sometimes difficult to find the time to read through lengthy writings, and most of my writings are quite lengthy, I took the time with this writing to create an audio rendition of it.

And finally, before providing a link to the reading, and the writing that goes along with it, I'd like to put forth a quick disclaimer: I'd like to point out that all of these things which I feel that I've learned, deal directly with myself and my own capacity to view the world as only I've been able to see it, from my own limited perspective that I have available unto myself. And further, that I believe that I'm only able to observe, learn, and appreciate these things contingent upon myself first being a small individual part of a larger whole. Simply put, I just mean that I'm aware that I do not know the whole picture and that my perspective is incomplete, as I only have the bits and pieces of it that I personally have had the opportunity to perceive of.

With that being said, I feel very strongly in the truth of many of the things that I've come to understand. And with this particular writing, I hope that I've captured my understanding well enough to accurately get across what it is that I'm attempting to convey.

67,"Today I was in a store and I smelled cigarette smoke. It was strong like someone just lit up, I wasn’t by the door to catch a draft. I instantly thought “did my grandma just die”? For some reason. It wasn’t old, stale smoke. It was so crisp. 

While in class, I had two missed calls from a strange number and I called back. It was my grandma’s nursing home asking if I can come in because she’s been refusing to shower and has had lots of diarrhea. They were concerned,

First things first, my mom is the one who handles these things. I don’t. I haven’t seen or spoke to my grandmother in a long time. She’s been shitty to my mom. I can’t stand her shit. It’s so dark. And she’s got dementia now. Newly diagnosed. 

So, my mom can’t come in because she’s busy on a first date. I’m going to talk to my grandma about getting to take a shower. She listens to me. But we butt heads and we’re both so stubborn. Hence why I’ve avoided her after a particularly nasty argument on Christmas a couple years ago where she was degrading my mom while my mom was doing everything to make sure we had a good Christmas. 

She recently moved to a nursing home because we can’t take care of her and she was unable to live alone. She’s depressed and staying in her room. I really don’t want to see her, but now I’ve got to go convince her not give up life at 88 years old while in a nursing home after living her life independent before. When obviously, I would never want someone to live miserably. I don’t even know how to approach this!",18Oct2018,1

70,"So I'm having a decent day, being real, meaning what I say and generally enjoying myself. It is really about this vision of being this higher version of myself I guess honestly. Then this friend (which is making me rant and make another post about him) hits me up about a problem he has. Now, he made a promise he wouldn't call me this week so he could focus on his studys, I did not mind that at all, as it was something positive for me as well. He ends up hitting me up and as he is faced with this problem, it's totally fine and I accept to help him out, that being a thing that friends do. 


So we grab coffee to discuss how I can help him out, I can't really explain but I just lose all focus. Like what I say has no bearing and it is mainly me trying to get some form of validation from this guy. He won't contribute to the conversation and me being unsure of myself (which I was not earlier in the day) leaves me just questioning my worth. Most of the time when I go meet him this happens. It's like he sees me being there always and maybe he thinks I am simple, so simple in fact and easy to read that I am below him. I just don't like how he brings me to smoke which past me would think it's cool (just my experience - obviously not trying to imply anything), while this guy I am talking about is hooked and openly says he doesn't care. Pretty sure he has no respect for me(?), that's the conclusion I get judging by the way I feel while with him. I'm focusing on my well being here and this guy brings very little to no value to my life - if I were to think so directly. But see, I am not sure. 



There is also a possibility that maybe deep down my subcioncious rejects him completely, I am not sure but everytime I come to a level to understand him and connect with him, my way of thinking becomes corrupted (as in I become someone trying to get some form of validation from him) OR I realize just how much our perspectives are different - we are two very much different people.

71,"A few weeks or days ago I saw this meme on r/funny where aliens were in a room and humans were on the other side of the room playing cards. A glass wall was separating them. 

The aliens were saying “these are humans. Usually, they’re calm and you can touch them but if you question their religion or question what they know they become very aggressive” 

I found this post funny and so sad at the same time because it’s so true. 

I have never seen someone who has been able to remain unbiased or just having an open mind because as soon as you question what they already know they turn so aggressive. It’s why people who comment actual facts (or links to studies) get downvoted..
