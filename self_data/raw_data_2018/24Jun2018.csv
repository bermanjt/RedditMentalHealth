0,"This is more of a rant because I just need to say it, maybe it will prevent other people of acting like I did and avoid the same situation. 

Yesterday I was feeling down, stressed and sad for reasons that I don’t really know. I was just down. My SO tried the whole day to cheer me up, talking to me about other things but I just didn’t listen, I was acting like an asshole due to my own emotional state at the time. 

We had a fight, a big one. I said things that I didn’t believed (I want to be left alone, I want to isolate myself), I was angry and it happened that she was the one I directed that anger into. 

I love her, to death. At the end of the night the situation wasn’t fully solved and she went to work with all that situation on her head, I don’t know how she felt at that time but I know that it wasn’t a pleasant night for her. 

I texted her, said that I loved her and went to sleep. I woke up this morning with a long text, it took me half an hour to take the courage to read it because I really thought it was a break up text due to my own stupidity the night before, all of that because I was being jealous of various things. Hopefully it wasn’t a break up text, quite the contrary. She said that she loved me and that we will work this through. I was relieved. 

A few hours ago, thinking about all that I’ve said: “i don’t want you staying after work with your colleagues” “I don’t you taking to this guy” etc etc. I realised how stupid it was, how insensitive and egoistic I was being by saying that to her. I realised that when we got together at the beginning those things were already happening and it didn’t bother me the least, only after a few months that it did, without any reason at all. 

It took me a moment of being an asshole, an idiot and risking to lose the est relationship I have ever had to realise that it was out of this world what I said and done yesterday. 

Don’t be like me, if you’re feeling jealous or angry at your SO.... TAKE THE TIME TO THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK or you’ll risk loosing everything because you acted with a hot head. 
If I did took the time to analyse the situation and what I was feeling beforehand, this wouldn’t have happened, I wouldn’t have said anything that stupid and wouldn’t have spent the day feeling miserable. 

Take the time to think before you say something while sad, angry or stressed to those you love.

Sorry that this is too long ; Also i didn't know in where exactly to post this on. I'm still kind of new here

Tl;Dr:  I grew up without a father and now as an 28 year old female adult I  still sometimes wish I had a father figure in my life. Am I weird and  creepy?

I'm a 28 year old woman and like  many people out there, I grew up without a father. My dad passed away  when I was 5 years old. He was a very doting father and provided lots of  love and care for the family until he fell ill. My mom did a really good job in raising us and I am forever grateful.

But I always felt that longing for a father. Since childhood I always fantasized about having a father figure and it kinda got worse during my teenage years where I was desperate for male attention.

I'm an adult now and for the most part I got over the obsession. I'm happy and capable of being independent and just doing things myself...but I still have some days where I still wish I had a father figure and then I get really sad knowing that now its way too late for me to even hope for one since I am no longer a child.

 ...I feel so stupid and abmornal about this. I mean it's one thing to  have such desires as a kid...but as an adult??? Am I sick in the mind??  Am I really...weird or mentally unstable? ",24Jun2018,1

During the summer, since I'm basically stuck around the house alone (overprotective parents) I'm easily bored and waste my day doing something useless (like watching youtube and tv shows). The internet is a good resource for catching up on school work, learning new stuff, etc. but I just don't feel motivated to do anything. Today I almost fell asleep 4 times cause I was not doing anything. Is there a way I can stay motivated throughout the day and be productive? Also, I find myself very energetic at night and wanting to do things and lament about how I wasted a whole day :( thanks in advance",24Jun2018,3

Right now I'm stuck in that hole. Actually, I've been stuck there for almost a year now. I wasn't even with her for that long, but it was my first and only relationship despite being college aged.

I just can't help but feel like an absolute failure when I compare myself to her. She's attending a better school. Has a better job. Already has a new relationship and is feels like she's just an all around better person than me.

We both struggle with depression. Even in that area she seems to be doing far better than me.

11,"My first best friend was Matt. Childhood friends. Did everything together. After highschool, he bought a house, I moved in. We were basically brothers. One day we decided it was time to get a cat. We made it clear that the cat would belong to Matt, as he had his shit together way more than I did. We adopted a 1 year old pure black  cat and named him Ziggy. Ziggy was fucking awesome. A year later, Matt got in a car accident and died. I inherited Ziggy. Ziggy was my rock as I mounted the passing of my brother Matt. Aside from great memories, Ziggy was my last piece of Matt. Me and Ziggy were BEST pals. Honestly, he was more loyal than a dog. He was amazing. He slept nestled into me every single night, for the past 7 years. Last week, out of nowhere, Ziggy's liver failed. I had to put him down yesterday. I know he's just a cat, but I'm absolutely broken. I feel now how I felt when Matt passed away.

Then when I woke up from my nap in the living room when it was daylight out I noticed the old tree out my window had fallen down (the top half or so). 

It has taken out part of the clothesline, was laying on some of the others, and part of it was (well, is) sitting in the roof above where my bed is. If it had broken through the roof I could be typing this from the hospital. But I'm thankful it didn't :D

The owner of the house knows about it and hopefully will get it cut down by a pro soon. Half the clothes that were drying were in the ground, and some I can't get to because the tree landed on them.

22,"Tonight a friend of mine was talking in a group chat about driving home tired. She said it was a bit dangerous and I started lecturing her. I realized that I was upset because I kept remembering the deadly car accident my classmate had been in.

It was my junior year of highschool and he had taken the same bus as me since middle school. I hadn’t liked him much and thought he was a bit of a dick. (They say don’t speak ill of the dead but I say fuck em). 

He crashed his car a few hundred feet from my house, hitting guardrails, flipping it and apparently drowning. 

However, the afternoon it occurred I had been doing my homework when I heard my stepdad open the front door so I asked him where he was going. He was going to check out the crash. So the curious person I am, I followed. They had already take him away, and they were pulling the car from the water. 

I was barefoot, thinking I wasn’t going to be out long. I stayed, morbidly interested. They’d said he survived, but my step father said that there were no sirens so he most likely perished. 

I stayed out until dark, directing traffic in my driveway. I talked to the news anchor. I was so curious and entertained by it all. 

Next morning. The school was quiet. I’ve heard stories like this. I just never thought it would be like that. My teacher told me who it was and if he’d been friends with any classmates. I told her names. I was in shock. I didn’t know him well. One of the girls told me he drowned and that he hadn’t died on impact. I felt sick at that point.

I didn’t make it to my second (third period. My first class was double period) class. It hit me. My classmate had died in what was basically my backyard. I had been entertained by his death. I told the teacher and walked to the counselor. On my way the announcement was made. 

Once I made it to the safety of closed doors I cried. I held it back the best I could. I felt like an asshole for crying. I didn’t know him well enough to be crying, certainly his real friends needed a counselor more. (We have multiple in the school) I felt selfish. I felt so terribly bad for the family. My counselor knew where I lived, so when he’d found out about the news he’d been awaiting my arrival. I called my mom. I dried my tears the best I could. 

As soon as I saw her car and was inside I sobbed. I sobbed so hard. I just felt like a dick. I couldn’t imagine. 

Weeks later. When I was getting off the bus. I thought I heard him say goodbye to me. I had thought he was a bit of an ass but there had been days when all he did was smile, and wave. I started second guessing whether he’d actually just been trying to be friendly.

28,"I've been friends with this girl for a very long time, we actually went to primary school together. That's how far back we go! She's an absolute gorgeous soul, I can say this with 100% certainty that she is a saint. She had a horrible childhood, she comes from Africa and was adopted after her parents and brother were killed by AIDS. Despite that, her 'mother' adopted her and another girl and raised them here. 

She hasn't been shy in telling me that she's had an interest in me for a very long time, one time in high school she asked for me to come over to her house to watch a movie. I can't remember why, but I brought my brother over and we all watched movies together. Looking back on it now, I cringe at the look she gave me when she saw I had brought him. She even outright said that she liked me at one point. 

I myself was a piece of shit as a teenager, I stomped on girls hearts without a care in the world until it caught up to me in the end and I realised that my actions have consequences. It took losing someone who meant the world to me when it was too late. Since that day, I took a journey of growth that continues to this day. I've been single for 7 months and just starting to learn to love myself, when out of the blue, she asks to see me and I arrange a time to see her.

When I arrive at her house, she looks fantastic. More so than anytime I've ever seen her before, she really put a lot of effort into looking good. We talked and she was staring deep into my eyes the whole time, as well as getting close to me. She was basically asking for me to kiss her, but the truth is, I just don't find her attractive/have any interest. I didn't kiss her and left.

College finished 3 days ago now and I’ve been trying to organise a trip somewhere but have been met with no response or at best ambiguous replies. Bearing in mind these are the same people who I’ve gotten to know really well over the past couple of years, it doesn’t make sense to me. Communication has almost ceased and while I try my best to start a conversation it seems like they have become strangers once again. 

I’m worried I’m going to completely lose contact with them soon. I have tried talking about this topic with one of my close friends and they didn’t really acknowledge it, so I don’t know if what I’m thinking is accurate. I guess all I want is some human connection, as I have noticed that when i spend a lot of time by myself my ability to communicate drops significantly. What I mean by this is I stutter, doubt myself and talk quietly to the point where it’s hard to hear me. I don’t do it on purpose and only realise when someone asks me to repeat what I’ve said multiple times.

I feel isolated and I’m trying to reach out. My family lives in a different country and I know they are busy too. I don’t know what to do. I maybe average a few sentences a day - is this healthy? I’ve googled how much you should talk daily and everything that comes up assumes a romantic relationship whereas I’m talking about general communication. I don’t know how it went from losing friends to losing all communication but I’m constantly worrying about this. I should be happy that exams are done and it’s the summer holidays but the beauty of a scheduled day was that I got to see familiar faces frequently.

34,"I think the best word for how I've been feeling lately is melancholic. I think a lot about the way the world is. I think about all of the people I've known in my life and how much I miss them and the way my life used to be at different points in time. I think about all of the things I could do or want to do. I think about the things I like to do and constantly wonder if I should be doing something else instead. I try to decide if I should give meaning to life or let it be meaningless. I think about how short life really is and I wish more than anything that it didn't have to end or that I could live as many times as I wanted to, as many ways as I wanted to live it. It moves so fast and I just want it to slow down. (I guess that means I'm enjoying it?) It's infinitely complex and I want time to process it all. But there's never enough time to think about everything you want to and do everything you want to because you always want more. And to know that you'll never get everything that you want is the most unsatisfying thing ever, yet at the same time if we had everything we wanted life would be pointless. It's full of paradoxes and concepts that are meant to leave you thinking about them forever, and even though we don't have forever to think about them they can't be ignored. It's frustratingly beautiful. 

And it just makes me really sad to know that one day I won't be able to experience it at all, even if trying to figure it all out tears me apart and makes me want to die. And the uncertainty of what happens after death, if anything at all, is almost compelling enough to make me want to find out. But not quite.",24Jun2018,5
35,"Thinking about deleting some people on my Facebook friend list.

I'm realising my facebook is just filled with unsatisfying people who I never talk to, most of these being primary school and high school ""friends"" or acquaintances. I added these people when I was like 12 or 13 when adding everyone was a cool thing. Some have been pretty toxic school peers in the past, others are mediocre friends, many were actual bullies who no longer pick on me.  I made better friends towards the end of high school but I was picked on during a majority of my schooling (since like K-10) and this influences me as a young adult. I had terrible self-esteem and always felt like I needed people or friends and this is something I want to move on from.

As a result, I want to delete people but something tells me I shouldn't. These people share news, memes and it lets me lurk into their lives, stay relevant, connected, and see what they're up to for a bit of gossip and drama, they don't add value or happiness to my life, they're just extra information or drama to me. However unfriending them is really awkward and I would feel discnnected.

The way I use my facebook is really something I've thought about on my own for so long, that I've done nothing and need some fresh thoughts.

For context, I'm in 3rd year of university, I've got 2 years left and I haven't made that many friends in general nor do I belong to a ""group"" because I don't live on campus. Bonding with people at this stage is really hard so I am considering joining a society to see how that goes.",24Jun2018,1
36,"So, I feel compelled to type this before I finally go to bed because today has been a good day. Recently at my job I was promoted to a person in charge or also known as a shift leader.

This past month has been one of the most interesting times of my life. At the beginning of June, maybe late May I began to spiral into the deepest depression. I made several posts on this account to different subreddits just ranting and basically not helping my situation. So eventually, one thing lead to another and I had the worst breakdown of my life; contemplated suicide, almost went through with it, I was truly a mess. 

But then, I couldn’t cry anymore. I was numb to every feeling imaginable except pain. I began to open up, to my family, coworkers, and friends. I am blessed to have the support system I have and the many many great people in my life. These past few weeks I’ve began to turn my life around.

For awhile now I was being trained for this position all whilst feeling like each day could literally be my last. I was nervous. I was experiencing the worst anxiety during this time and man was it hard to hide it. I didn’t trust my decision making. I doubted my self constantly. What if I just fuck it all up? But then I realized, I didn’t, nor will I. I am incredible at my job. I work at jimmy johns big woop, but if I may say; we are amongst the top 10 stores in the nation and we absolutely kill it throughout the year. 

I was hired at jimmy johns in late April of 2017. I thankfully got the job through my sister. During my first spring break at home, freshman year of college, she let me know that they were hiring. Night shifts, 6pm-2am. I was ready to join the work force. I filled out my application and forwarded it to the hiring manager at the time. From that moment on my anxiety began to grow. I went back to school after the break ended and walked in for my interview. Long sleeve button up maroon shirt, black dress pants, dress shoes, you know the whole first job starter pack. I approached the register saying I was here for an interview. My stomach was turning, I was so incredibly nervous. I was brought to the back, was sat down and the interview began. Long story short, I’d like to say I killed it. I was charismatic, funny, intelligible, she loved me, and I loved that. I was asked to take a sandwich test a couple days later but stopped her and asked if it was possible to take it the next day. I knew I needed to show that initiative from the start. 

I come in the next day and ace the menu test I spent countless hour studying for. After that, I started working at jimmy johns. I was trained very well. I showed determination. I struggled at the start but got better. I actually got really good pretty quickly. Sandwiches were a breeze, I got a lot better at cleaning and learned a lot. Life was great. 

Until life caught up to me and I realized that I was going to school. I enjoyed working at jimmy johns so much. I was appreciated very early on and was always dependable. My grades dropped. Severely. I found excuses to not show up to class, reasons to not do certain assignments. I’ll admit, I was simply being lazy with my work. I loved ‘learning’ at my job more than information systems. For the first time in my life I was confident, sociable, and actually liked in a lot of ways. 

I knew I couldn’t go to school anymore. I will shamefully say that I essentially dropped out. When my mom learned this, it crushed her. We fought, cried, and debated constantly about it. I’m a whole 8 hour drive or 1 hour flight away. “What could she possibly do?” I was such an idiot. I regret and feel guilty how I went about it. Nothing really mattered but working now. I paid for my own rent, internet, food, I thought I was the fucking man. But then I began to struggle. 

I was irresponsible with my money. Gambled, or spent it all on useless shit. I ran to my siblings for money to the point they couldn’t help me nor could I keep up paying back the debts. The only one that could help at this point was my mom. We talked for a long time. Where my life is headed, what I’m doing, what I should be doing. She really opened my eyes. Eventually we were able to land on the same page about everything. I love her more than words and I know she feels the same. I wake up thankful to be her son. 

So. I worked harder. 

I learned fast, I asked questions, and I became confident in every thing I did. These past 2 weeks, I’ve said the right things to the right people, and have done the right things when I needed to do them. 

Friday night was my first shift alone. I did very well with the team I had, but knew tomorrow or tonight rather would be better. Tonight was great to say the least. I woke up at around 2 pm, knowing I need to go in at 4. The previous night, one of my coworkers, a good friend, and an incredibly smart and generous person gave me a 20mg pill of Adderall. I stared at the pill at around 2:30 feeling incredibly anxious. I did some shitty research on it and it basically came down to me taking half. I smoked a bowl, cigarette, and drank a coffee to get my mind right. And then I looked at the other half. 

It’s about 3:00 and I’m feeling pretty good, the addict in me tells me to take the other half so I do. I shower, eat, smoke again and begin to walk to work. I’d like to say my tolerance for weed, nicotine, and caffeine are all really high right now. I understand and realize the reality of my shitty addictions, but I continue to do it to start my day. I arrive at work at around 3:57 and boy was it busy. Late deliveries began to pile up. It was go time at this point. Without going into a million details about tonight, I absolutely killed it. I picked up where the morning manager left off and just honestly didn’t miss a beat. I felt incredible and was incredible. After the store was closed in stunning fashion, I went home and sat down in my chair still pretty up off the Adderall. I talked to my best friend for hours about life. Eventually 6am rolled around and I jumped into bed. 

And now I’m here, finishing typing this long ass post on my phone. If you actually read all of this, thank you.

I’ll end it with, my brain is screaming for it now. Adderall. Good night. ",24Jun2018,0
37,"and that is something I am coming to terms with. I seldom make lasting friendships. All the friends I made throughout college have all moved on, hurt me, or forgot me. The one high school friend I had, I haven't talked to in almost a year now. The girl, which is the first girl I've grown close to in well over a year now, that I am talking to is already growing distant and seems to be losing feelings for me. 

I'm so tired of being alone. I went to a festival yesterday by myself. It was fun, I met some nice people. Ultimately, I left. alone. Went back to my room, alone. Fell asleep, alone. 

I'm so tired of it all. Life just isn't worth living like this. I can only endure so much solitude before I start going mad. I don't know who my best man will be in marriage. I don't even know if I'll ever get married. I do know that I am sick of being alive. ",24Jun2018,15

Blew through every dime we had. We lost everything. I moved home. I developed a drug habit when I picked up my abusive (mentally, physically, and emotionally ) boyfriend.  I lost my 2 boys. Well,  willingly.  I  sent them to their grandparents bc I was failing as a mother. I got sober. Relapsed. Now I'm pregnant. Sober. I'm supposed to leave for my new job soon. I keep thinking about what I have done to myself and my kids. This is not me. I hate myself more than anyone understands. I don't know if anyone understands that I'm so close to the edge of ending it all. I'm not this person. I hate this person.  I don't look in the mirror much anymore bc I do not know who it is looking back at me. It's scary. I just want to get better.",24Jun2018,2

I do something like this nearly every day and it keeps me from doing things sometimes because all I can do after consuming that much is lay down. I have no idea how I haven’t died yet or why I’m not 400 pounds. I want to control myself, but I just can’t for some reason. ",24Jun2018,3
42,"I never tell this story. It's a crazy story, but absolutely true. I won't tell it to anybody in real life. Not to Hannah, who inspired it. Not to any friends. So I'm telling it here.

I am a 22 year old geek.

Last year I was a 21 year old, glasses-wearing geek who was a senior in college with nearly a 4.0 GPA. And I'm still (blush) admittedly a virgin. I'm only about 5'7, a ""studies-while-eating Doritos"" belly on an otherwise normal frame.

I told my friend Hannah about how I like to wake up very early on some days and head to the local nature preserve before class. I'm always alone, and it's beautiful.

She told me that her and her boyfriend used to go, and sometimes, she would strip to the nude.

My eyes bulged. She giggled and said it was not sexual at all. It allowed her to be ""one with nature"".

She said ""You should try it sometime, if you ever got the balls. Literally haha"".

Yeah right. I never even take my shirt off at the beach.

Then, one Tuesday morning at 6:30 am on a bright, sunny, only slightly brisk early Spring Tuesday morning...I got the itch.

I don't EVER do anything out of character. Why not just try it out? Nobody will ever know.

I actually undressed. I took off my heavy boots and long socks. My sweater. My pants. My undershirt.

There I was, shivering (it wasn't THAT cold, just a tad chilly, but the nerves got to me) in nothing but my light blue boxers.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and slid them down and kicked them off into the pile.

Now, clad in only my glasses and as bare as a newborn baby, I cupped my package with my hands, and I timidly walked towards the lake, about 50 yards from where I left my clothes, and I looked up at the gorgeous view.

The trees. The mountains. The beautiful, clear, blue lake.

Without even thinking, I placed my hands at my sides.

And there I was. Martin the virgin geek.

Naked.

Buck naked, in fact.

More naked than the trees, which were ""clothed"" in leaves.

More naked than Adam in the Garden of Eden, who at least had a fig leaf.

I was exposed. Not just physically, but exposed to new excitement and beauty.

Inspired, I even walked around the entire lake, as naked as the day I was born.

My round, bare belly shaking. My white-as-a-ghost ""bubble butt"" that Hannah would also make me blush over that she said I was always ""hiding"" under my nerdy khakis jiggling behind me. And my small package (hey, it's a throwaway!) bobbing in the brisk air.

I walked around the entire lake.

The crisp breeze occasionally startling me by caressing my bare butt. The tickle of a few flowers on my belly and package as I walked. The feel of the fresh grass through my bare feet as I walked.

Standing there, basking in the view, it was then that I heard it.

""Oh my God, you RUINED my shot!!!""

It was a woman. About 43 years old. Pretty, with a slight hard-to-pinpoint foreign accent.

""I've been planning this since 4:00 am, and this nude boy stumbles in and ruins it.""

She had a GIGANTIC, expensive, HD camera.

She then said ""Or...did he?"" And then started taking photos again. Of me!!!

""Beautiful, simply beautiful.""

I stood there frozen in shock, eyes wide, mouth open, as naked as a newborn baby with my hands at my sides in the bright sunshine for about 5 full seconds.

Then in a panic, I cupped my package with my hands and I ran behind a tree as she giggled and kept snapping photos of the scenery.

I poked my head out from behind the large tree, hiding my vulnerable, naked body behind it, with the now colder breeze attacking my bald, defenseless white buttcheeks behind me.

""You can't take those pictures!""

She said ""I sure can, sweetie. We're out in a public space. Nobody forced you to go traipsing around in your birthday suit.""

I replied: ""You can't share those photos!!""

She said ""Relax, and don't be so embarrassed. I've seen many men in the nude over the years. I'm no virgin here.""

That made me blush beat red.

She said ""For ruining my carefully planned shoot, I'm going to use these photos to create a painting.""

As I spoke up, I felt my naked, white butt-cheeks jiggling as I was shaking in panic and anger.

I said: ""A painting?! Of what?"" as I clung desperately to the tree shielding my body from her gaze.

She smirked. ""A painting showcasing true bravery and vulnerability.""

I said ""I'm no model for a painting.""

She replied: ""Oh, but you are, nude boy. It's one thing for some confident, viking man to walk around here. You're not one of those types, with some big, silly penis flopping around to show off.""

I subconsciously placed a single hand over my package, even from behind the tree.

She said: ""But you. You're the true picture of vulnerability. Your lily-white skin. Your adorable chubby belly. A hint of a bosom on you, even with hard nipples in the cool air.""

She giggled. And I subconsciously used my other hand to hide my nipples like a damsel in distress.

""And your little penis exposed for the world to see. Standing fearlessly, without cover, in the open. Clothed by nothing but your smattering of body hair, and a slight, endearing pink blush across your cheeks. I'm going to paint you.""

My ""pink"" blush turning RED as I cried: ""But you can't!!""

She said ""I can, and I will. Google me."" She gave me her name.

""Your bare body will be in my gallery in a few months.""

Defeated, I said ""Well I'm going back around the lake, the least you can do is give my dignity and avert your eyes.""

She said ""I'll do no such thing. I have more photos to take. Now go run along, naked boy. Get that cute tushie running around the lake and get dressed, it's getting cold.""

A few months later, sure enough, there I was.

A sight that a girl had never seen before, my naked body. It was expertly painting I must say, with unfortunately exquisite detail. A lush greenery set against beautiful mountains, with my blushing, eyes wide, mouth open, naked spectacle, arms at my sides, standing in front.

With 2,000 favorites on her website. She displayed it in a gallery. Somebody bought it for $5,600.

There was even a second painting. My round, plump bare ass jogging as I ran retreating to my clothes.",24Jun2018,0
43,"In the beginning of the year, I went into a stationary depression therapie, where I met a girl with whom I really got along well. We spent a lot of time together and talked about everything possible.  
At one point I, of course, started to feel something for her. Later we talked even about that, cleared the situation and everything was cool. Near the end of the therapy I learned that she liked me, too.  
After the therapy we held contact, talking via whatsapp mostly, but we couldn't meet, though there's not too much distance between us, but the situation with her family and the place where she lives are really complicated. We made plans etc.  

Than, suddenly silence. Our chat normally had no beginnings and no endings, but would go on and on for days and at one point, she just didn't answer. At first I just waited, and hoped for easy reasons, but it has been a few weeks since a sign of her.

Now I would like to search the contact, but don't know what I should do. I don't know where she lives exactely but I even wouldn't want to suddenly stand in front of her door and I don't want to meet her family at the moment, since there's so much trouble.  
I met her best friend once, searched her on facebook (my friend herself isn't) and think I've found her. I wrote her a message to clearify wether she's the right one and to tell her that I need to talk to her about her best friend, but she didn't answer until now.  
  
  
  
At the moment, I really don't know what to do. I miss her. But I can't let her magically appear. Up to this point, I'm even afraid, because all possible scenarious went throught my head - Including death etc.

45,"Hi. I’m a very sad person almost all the time. I’m just gonna rant for a while about my life, and if anyone would want to give some advice or just talk to me, it’d be very appreciated. I’ve posted about myself before. 

I am a high schooler, I volunteer at my old middle school, and I have a part- time job. I walk my dogs every day for almost two miles, and I drink a lot of water. Basically, what I’m saying is that I’m not very unhealthy, I guess. I don’t have many friends, and only one is close to me because we were childhood friends. I don’t like to leave the house, and I don’t really like going out with friends. A lot of the time, I don’t even like talking to people just because I’m not enthusiastic or excited about anything. 

Except for video games. I don’t really know why, but video games are the only thing I really like. Not even multiplayer games, I just like playing a game by myself. It might be because I’m put into the shoes of someone who isn’t me, or maybe it’s something else. Anyway, my mom hates my video game addiction, and has banned them from me multiple times. Then she gets mad at me for not being happy. 

More on my mom: she’s one of those people who believe suicidal people are selfish. I am scared to tell her about my suicidal thoughts because of how strongly she feels about suicidal people. About my dad, he’s a chronic alcoholic who gets drunk before noon every day and doesn’t remember most of the things I talk to him about. I’m scared of my teachers and dont want to approach my guidance counselor at school, half because of the school telling my mom, half because I’m just really scared of talking to teachers, or authority figures in general. 

I think about dying every day. Without fail, whether it’s a passing thought or a long, drawn out fantasy. I don’t know if I’ll ever actually kill myself, but I’ve gotten pretty close before. I also put myself in dangerous situations often, just to see if it’ll be the thing that kills me. I don’t want to keep doing these things to myself, but I can’t seem to stop. I don’t know what to do. 

Sometimes I don’t even want to be happy. Like, I’ll feel like I don’t want to take the actions to make myself feel better. 

I hope someone can give me some advice, but if you can’t, I’d still be extremely grateful just to talk to someone. Also sorry if this isn’t the most well written thing ever, or if they’re lots of mistakes. I’m very tired and not very eloquent anyway. Thanks.

55,"I know my life is not as bad as anyone else's but even so, the mental anguish and emotional toll it took on me has made me contemplate suicide more times than I would like. 

My mother is dying of an illness that shouldn't even exist. The doctors can't help her, because they don't know how to cure it. She's had surgeries to alleviate the pain that she is experience on a daily basis from her illness, but after every one, she's in more pain than before and she can barely walk now. She's just turned 51 yet my 79 year old grandma can navigate better than her. Her memory is shot, and she asks the same questions over and over again, and I know in the future, it will only get worse. I'm sure that if it progresses into her elderly years (that is, if she makes it there), she will forget who I am at some point. During the summer, after college, I'm her primary caretaker and seeing her like this at this stage of her life breaks my heart. I tried to commit suicide last summer because I was sick of seeing her always in pain. But now, she gets so mad at me for the little things and sometimes I feel worthless and think that maybe, I should just kick the bucket.

My dad is an abusive man, and he's the reason I'm the person I am today. As a kid, he would yell at me and beat me for showing certain emotions that made men 'weak'. My mom wouldn't intervene or tell me after that that's not true. This wasn't frequent but often where it damaged me psychologically. I began to internalized my emotions and became ashamed to express my opinions, feelings for others, and I didn't know my own judgement. I was considered a passive kid and I let kids walk all over me, even through my kindness. As I grew older, he isolated himself from our family in a room he made specifically for him. He would stay in that room for hours and hours on end and wouldn't  come out unless he had to leave for work or get something to eat. The room reeked of tobacco smoke so I would never talk to him. I found out what fear and isolation does to a person: hatred is born. This continued until igh school, when my parents got divorced but it didn't stop there. He would come over everyday at random times and I can't predict when. I didn't want my friends to meet him so I wouldn't have them over, so friendships became one-sided very quickly. Even when I would meet up with friends elsewhere, he would find out their names and get mad that I was hanging out with them. He would get mad when I would go to hang out with friends over him, and even today, at 20 years old, he tries to find ways to 'punish' me for not hanging out with him. Because of him, I don't have many friends because of the fear of him judging them and offending them because he's a racist and a narcissist. Because of him, I never dated and it's hard for me to even like someone enough to date them. 

And on the topic of dating, this next person I met was/is a light in darkness and I had finally thought my time of being unhappy was iver. But even the light comes with an unexpected outcome. 

I have a friend named Alex, and she has been my friend for four years now. I consider her a good friend. She is the only girl I've ever liked in my entire life, and I honestly thought I would finally find a form of happiness outside of my family. Everytime we met, she would treat me like her best friend (if her brother wasn't there) and her social awkwardness made me like her more because I could relate to her more. 

A year ago, I reconnected with her and I found we shared a lot of common interests such as anime, cartoons, etc. Long story short: I lied to her about my feelings and said that I just kinda liked her instead of telling ehr that I had feelings for her. Of course, she didn't reciprocate but because she is on the asexual spectrum and that she's never been interested in anyone. She said it wasn't me but that she just didn't feel that way.  She however told me that it wasn't me and that she she doesn't know where she lands but she likes the ideas of sex and romance. 

This gave me hope because I really like her and I want her to be my girlfriend. But I made so many mistakes that I feel like I ruined it: though I didn't tell her about my family situation, I did confide to her about my depression. I told her my thoughts about myself and a lot of things that comes off as unattractive. I even told her about my suicide attempt (the one from my mom) but I never mentioned my mom because I didn't want into my family life as well. But from a far away view, it looks like I was trying to manipulate her. She never mentioned it or brought it up but she accepted my apology before I even apologzie for telling about my depression. 

But I didn't want to lose hope, so I kept talking to her. Our friendship blossomed. Our text conversations grew longer and her intercations became more personal. She told me a lot about her family situation, and her personal life: her childhood, her school life, and her college life. So much so that her brother has to nudge her indicating that she's saying too much about her family. 

This summer, we hung out many times and I enjoyed everyone. She's proven to be one of my best friends (but I never say that because I fear that will be unrequited too). She has shown that she cares about me and my feelings, and she's become more thoughtful and considerate since we've been talking. I noticed that she does certain things with just me and it makes me happy because it makes me feel unique, and she's always smiling and laughing with me when we talk. 

But every night, I cry because I feel like she'll never see me in the light that could procreate a relationship between us. She vaguely mentioned that she would date men but she had already rejected me. I can't help but feelings jealous about her friends. Her decade - old friends from middle schools and I can't help but feel like she'll fall for one of them before me. Because she tells me that they used to stay up until 2AM laughing and chatting, and because her parents trust their friends enough where she can be gone for days at a time and her parents won't care. With me, we've neeve hung out one-on-one, much or less stayed up to 2AM. Everytime I hang with her, her mom is textung her saying first she's okay. 

My best friend is also my unrequited love, and though I don't show it, I want to be my girlfriend one day, because she's the only person I know that actually gives a fuck about me and shows that she cares about me. She helped me with my depression, and that's something no one has done for me. They would decline and say ""get over yourself."" She apologizes if she hurt my feelings and shows that she cares about my feelings yet my other friends would say ""Stop being so fucking soft, it's a joke."" None of my other friends have showed that they cared about me except her. I manifested certain emotions from her that I want but never the one closest to my heart. I feel like I die loveless in this world because of my internalization of feelings and how they don't go away. 

I want to die. Everytime I am driving, if I cross a bridge, I gravitate towards it. Everytime I'm alone, I lock my door to my room so that I won't get the urge to go into the kitchen. I'm broke, I can't buy an apartment, I can't escape the pain I'm feeling. I feel numb. 

I just want my friend to love me and we can be a happy couple, I just want my mom to get put into a nursing home, and I just want my dad to leave my life for good. 

But I feel like I'll never get any of them.",24Jun2018,1
56,I’ve spent the last 9 years thinking he was alive. Now I don’t know how to process this news! Anyone else have a story where they found out about a celebrities death years later?,24Jun2018,1
57,"A few years ago a person from Oregon told me about how there was a case in the local newspaper where a 17 year old was found strangled in his car. He was last seen alive at a Denny's with three boys described as nerds (who were described as looking like nerds because of the conservative manner in which they dressed and their glasses + skinny bodies).

He was found strangled in his car the next morning with bruises on his neck. The coroner concluded from the bruising he'd been strangled between a set of thighs.

I'm sorry but if you're so pathetically weak that you can't get a nerd's legs off of your throat then you kind of deserve your death for being so weak. I know people say that legs are stronger than arms blah blah blah but that's not referring to the sideways motion of the legs and the abductor muscles of the inner thighs are actually pretty weak, most normal guys can only do about 50 lbs on the hip abduction machine which is squeezing your legs together. And even then that's not squeezing for 5+ minutes straight while a person is suffocating to death and panicking for their life. If you cannot lift at most 50 lbs worth of pressure off of your neck in a life or death situation and you die I won't feel sympathy for you.

By the way, this isn't the only time I've heard about a nerd killing someone this way, there was a case in 2013 I can link a news article to, and it was just one nerd and the guy still managed to suffocate to death over the course of 10 minutes. wtf

59,"I’ve always thought it is better to be humble, but as of late, I wonder how much of me being modest is choice, or a consequential action to me having low confidence. 

So an example would be, this woman who I have been talking to keeps telling me I’m pretty hot, and it’s hard for me to process because I don’t really see myself as attractive. (Having an extremely slender build and acne during my teenage years took a major toll on how I see myself.)  Anyways we keep having conversations about having sex the next time we see each other, and it makes me a nervous as hell, so much so that I almost want to back out (at that point I feel really anxious and can feel my heart rate go up) I am just overwhelmed with thoughts wondering what she’ll think of me after we have sex, like am I attractive and do I have what it takes to satisfy her.

63,"Hi yall. Ohh where to start? I met what i would come to think of as the love of my life back when i was 19. He lived in another city so we took things nice and slow and developed this truely amazing ralationhip, the kind i once would have considered a myth. We geniunely loved, trused and cared for oneanother. We where happy. 6 years later we got married. During all this time i was struggling with depression and general anxiety disorder but he was my rock. Funny thing is, i am the natrual extrovert, and he was an introvert. My friends laughed hard whenever he told them what a prude i was at heart. Little did they know how right he was. Flash forward 2 years and my life went from marital bliss to him filing for a divorce, with me locked up in the psyche ward, over the course of 2 weeks. Yes, weeks. 

Needless to say, it was a rather rough divorce. I genuinely wanted to die. Not only had i lost the one thing that had made my life worth living, i had no job, suffered from regular anxciety attacks, social phobia, agora phobia, and ohhh, i was also homeless. 

Flash forward another 6 years and we find ourselves today. I cant say its been easy, but step by step i rebuilt myself. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes im now feeling better than ever before. I found a way to stop all that self hate that had been burning inside me for all my life and am now happy with who i am.

During all this time i have remained single. By choice, mind you. Ive come to view myself as an relationship anarchist, or RA for short. (If youre unsure of what this means, check out https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_anarchy ). When it comes to romantic or casual sexual relationships i havent really been intrested in, or looking for something new in years. That might be comming to a change... atleast the romantic part. I think im currently asexual, which really helps when youre not intrested in dating, but complicates things a whole lot if you are. 

So i find myself at this turning point. In desperate need of advice and support.
