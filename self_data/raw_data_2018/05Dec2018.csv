1,"My mom has recently gotten the idea that vaccines are a direct cause of autism. Normally I wouldn’t really care because I already got my vaccinations and I’m the youngest in the family. However, my sister is now pregnant and she keeps getting into arguments with my mom about the issue. It causes unnecessary tension in the family and I’m getting tired of it. 

I’ve already tried discussing the topic with my mom, but every study or paper I provide is apparently funded by Big Pharma. 

How can I make progress with someone who won’t accept any scientific evidence?",05Dec2018,1
3,"My gf (24) and I (27) have been living together for almost a year after 5 years of dating before that. For the last 6 months or so she's been very distant and belittling, making me feel like I'm not wanted. She will go out when she wants and doesn't seem interested in spending time with me. A few months ago a family member had a horrible accident. She decided that was the time to tell me she wanted to break up, but by the morning after she had changed her mind. I said things had to change and told her exactly what I needed to happen. Spoiler alert: nothing changed. 

She remained distant and always on her phone, still belittling me or being agitated/moody around me. She also didn't want to be intimate. Now she has again decided that she doesn't feel the same about me any more. She's also told me that the reason she is always on her phone is because she has become 'interested' in someone else (who works in her building) and 'close' to them, despite them not being single either. As far as I know nothing has actually happened between them. I told her she clearly didn't feel the same way and asked her to move out, even though it killed me to do it. 

She packed her bags and left me heartbroken. Less than a day later she rings in tears and says she wants to come back. She promises to change this time.

I do love her, but I'm hurt and scared and skeptical that she would change anything. I'm also worried there would be trust issues. I just don't know what to do- does someone you've been with so long deserve unlimited chances, or am just a glutton for punishment and need to muster some self respect and try and move past this?

6,"I found a woman collapsed and unresponsive on the bathroom floor at work today; I ran to get help and call 911. There was about 10 minutes of panic but she regained consciousness, and then emergency responders arrived and checked her out. Turns out she was feeling ill, vomited and then passed out, but she'll be fine. The paramedics said it was okay for her to just go home if someone picked her up.

Even after the paramedics left, I was shaking and crying for maybe 20 minutes and everyone saw. I don't really know the woman and a bunch of coworkers were comforting me and trying to calm me down, but now I'm just morbidly embarrassed now. Even after I learned the situation was not serious I couldn't calm down, and I think my reaction was really disproportionate to the situation.

7,About 7 months ago i met someone who i completely clicked with. we talk all the time and are extremely close. the problem is she has a boyfriend and has been in the relationship for 3 years now. the relationship doesn’t always seem good but it’s none of my business. is it selfish to tell her how i feel? ,05Dec2018,1
9,"Its so hard to explain how I feel. 

I always feel I'm an empty shell of a human being. I don't know where I fit in in life? People tell me spirtuality is the answer, or change your thoughts. I get freaked out that what if im inherently a bad person or what if im not. I've taken online tests for mental health issues, OCD, BPD, Sociopath etc.

I just had a panic attack a minute ago when I woke up....because I woke of feeling like a dark cloud was looming over me... 

What the he'll am I going through? I feel like I need constant reassurance that I'm not an evil person. I feel distraught and alone....i have so many xonflicting thoughts about myself.....and doubts.

Like what if I read and try to change my rhought processes through something like CBT therapy, how do I know I'm not just trying to fake my way through these practices of trying to be happy?  

I just wish I could be happy and content like everyone else.

I feel so fake all the time.

16,"Making friends at uni has sucked so far. 

Essentially what happened is during Fresher's Week, which is more or less a giant welcoming party for all the first years, I took the whole 'try new things' idea a bit far and didn't really check out many societies that were relevant to my interests. I went to the cycling one, and quickly realized I was wasting my time; these were all people who'd spent thousands on their bikes and I was more of a 'hey, I went cycling once or twice and it was cool' guy. The other tasters I went to were quite similar - the only one I ended up joining besides the physics society (which is what I study, so it was sort of mandatory) was Muay Thai, which is like kick boxing. I rarely ever go to that anymore, though--I just don't seem to have the energy for it as of late.

So, by the end of Fresher's I'd made about two friends from my course. I don't really consider them friends anymore. Friend #1, I don't know if she just didn't like me from the start, but whenever I tried to speak to her, her body language was just dreadful. She really did not like being around me. Maybe I was misreading things, but nonetheless I felt like whenever I was around her I had to walk on edge, because even the slightest faux pas would have her staring at me with daggers in her eyes. I would say her and her group of friends was my main group, but I don't really bother trying to insert myself in their conversations anymore. It feels like I'm just so unwelcome.   
Friend #2 was perfectly nice but she gravitated more towards the group of popular girls and rugby players which had begun to form on the course. Which is fine, I don't judge, but later I learned that these people *hated* me. When I went to one of the socials, one of them who I thought was nice came up to me. She proceeded to pick apart every aspect of my behaviour and explain what they disliked about it and how they took the piss out of it. To be fair, some of it was reasonable criticism. Apparently they took the piss out of me for weeks because when I went up to the front of a lecture to do a problem for our Indian professor who's a bit of a meme, I thought that due to the atmosphere of the class it'd be funny to do a bow. It wasn't, and it's stuff like that which has got me a reputation. The other things I did were like: 

- one of the girls in their group I knew because we walked to the first social together and we live in the same block of flats. Also I had a slight crush on one of the other girls that didn't go anywhere. So sometimes I'd sit with them. But I was quite shy, especially around a group of the opposite sex that I barely knew, so I didn't say much. This lead to them thinking I was just eavesdropping. She said something along the lines of, if you sit with us you have to talk, otherwise fuck off. Which, to be fair, I can understand if only to a certain extent.

- apparently me answering questions in the course group chat and during lectures constituted 'flexing my knowledge' and made me dickhead

- posting semi-frequently in the course group chat with sometimes scarcely related stuff caused them to believe that I thought I owned it. I definitely understood them when they basically said I was abusing the group chat, I spent far too much time there and didn't consider the fact everyone on the course was seeing what I was typing

 I don't cry often, but I left the pub on the verge of tears after that. On the walk home, all I could think about was killing and/or harming myself. I didn't, thankfully. But the fact that I came out of that night physically unharmed doesn't change the fact that I was still a big name on campus for all the wrong reasons. This popular group has just made me their enemy, and it's like sixth form all over again. Their influence is everywhere and honestly I don't think I have a chance at making friends on my course. 

So I went to a few more societies. To my credit I made some decent friends there. There's this one girl who I talked to from the video games society who I just clicked with instantly, and I'd describe her as my only real friend as of now. We just got back from watching a movie together, which was nice. Still my experience doesn't compare to my friends who are going out every night and having 'the time of their lives'

I literally just don't know what to do. My home friends are getting sick of me being over reliant on them because they already have so many new friendships to deal with. I don't think I'll be able to rely on them for company much longer. At that same time, with term ending soon it's a bit late to go to any societies and try them out. So I think this Christmas break will be a lonely one for me. 

I want to fix my situation so badly and have a fulfilling social life, but I don't know if it's possible for someone like me. What do you guys think?

17,"I am not against the Mueller investigation at all. If Trump did commit illegal actions then he needs to be held accountable for those actions. However what bothers me is that I see plenty of Redditors worship Mueller like he is some kind of God. 

Completing ignoring the fact that Mueller is a neo-con from the Bush era and was one of the biggest supporters of the Iraq war. Same for the guy who just got on the Supreme Court. Everyone was focused on a suppose sexual assault that happened 30 years ago (I say suppose because innocent until proven guilty in a court of law) and not bringing up the fact that he was a Bush era neo-con willing to rule against the 4th amendment. 

I dont understand Reddit at all. I see a lot of hate towards people who even lean to the right but people support a guy who supported a war in the middle east that most of us agree never should have happened? I feel like I'm living in The Twilight Zone at times. ",05Dec2018,1

20,"Coming from someone who has met some cool people on tinder, bumble, and her (dating app for, primarily, queer women) (idk about paid dating sites/apps). 

In my experiences, the girls on these apps are nice, and not all of them have these unrealistic standards but there are a lot of biphobes (I’m bi) and too many of them are radical SJWs. (Also, I can’t comment on the behavior of straight women.)

I’m a big proponent of social rights for oppressed people, including my own people (in terms of my race, my sexuality, and my gender) but I know when to draw the line. I know when one goes from being socially conscious to participating in a race to see who can be the most progressive. 

The biphobes are pretty self explanatory.

The straight dude decks are too full of guys who are flexing. A lot of them just have pictures of partying with attractive women or their kabajillion-pack abs. A chunk of them are also basically *anti*-SJWs, which I don’t like either.

I also really, really, really am not a big fan of a lot of muscle definition. I like medium sized dudes, if possible with some muscle definition on their pecks, but otherwise I’m not a fan of the gym scene or 6 packs, and I think guys who think “going to the gym,” and “being an alpha,” are personality traits are boring and usually predictably sexist creeps. Like, if you go to the gym, I do think that’s great, but if the gym is your personality, I absolutely think you’re boring. 

I also really like video games and nerd stuff, and weirdly enough it feels like I can’t really find someone who likes video games or comic books, but I DEFINITELY have met PLENTY of people like that in real life. I’m not sure if it’s my luck, or if apps like that just genuinely don’t attract people like that. 

But THIS IS ALL ONLINE. And it doesn’t reflect all of the real world, and it makes me wish I went out more often. 

My best relationships have seriously come from people I know in my daily life, and I really miss college and going out all the time. 

I work from home now (lucky me) and I don’t have as much time to go out as I used to. As it’s the winter, I also really don’t ever feel like leaving the house at 5 in the afternoon when it’s cold and dark. 

Anyway, I don’t know what my point is.

I guess I feel like I squandered the relationships I had, both because I didn’t always feel like I was at a point in my life where I was ready to commit to someone, and now when I actually feel like I’m mentally prepared to be committed to another person, the dating game feels really frustrating because I’ve turned to online outlets. 

When I wasn’t looking for a relationship, it always felt like people were throwing themselves at me. Now when I am, everyone is gone lol

I recently just told someone from bumble we should stop seeing each other (wasn’t a relationship, just like a month of dating). Thought they had some potential, but it took like a week or two for me to really realize they had a huge alcohol problem and like, it was pretty sad.

So I noped out and now I’m back to square one lol.

Anyway, I’m just whining. Wish me luck! I’m gonna try and leave the house more. Starting to feel like a hermit. ",05Dec2018,1

24,"I’m alone most of the time and only really talk to 2 people and I’m sure they’re tired of the same narrative, so I thought I’d post something. I apologize if this is long and convoluted, I just really need to get these thoughts out.

The last 6 months have been really hard. I’d been working at my previous place of employment and it caused me a lot of stress. The CEO had no boundaries and believed to have a closer relationship to me than what was appropriate and/or real. He imposed these impossible expectations on me, constantly telling me who I was and who I wasn’t, acting like my best friend but knowing nothing about me and pulling the boss card when he felt like it. He was the kind of person that made you feel like you were nothing until he blessed you. When I got into my Masters program (which was online and after work hours only), he told me he didn’t value higher education and sort of put me in an impossible position of making me choose between a future with the company (meaning keeping my job) or choosing a different route and being let go. It was all incredibly unhealthy and it drained me.

The day after my birthday I found out I have a reproductive issue, which isn’t too bad but shook me, since it could impede my ability to have children.

A week before that I was planning on turning in a 1 month notice at work due to moving out of state with my SO so he could attend school. I was actually excited, because I was leaving. The CEO accepted it just fine but my direct supervisor was horrible to me. She straight up ignored me and started delegating my job to other people, all without even speaking to me; within days I had nothing to do. While the CEO wasn’t happy with my decision, he understood and was accepting. Due to my supervisor’s behavior, instead of working for the rest of the month the CEO offered to give me my salary and let me leave early. I was happy for this, but it felt like I had done something wrong, almost like I had gotten fired but I was never anything but good at my job.

We moved 2000 miles away and started a new life in a new city and it’s been really hard. My SO is in school 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, and I don’t know anyone here. We don’t have money to go out and even if we did, he has no free time anyway. This has made me really lonely.

I’ve tried really hard to find a job but things haven’t been going super well. I realized that I may not want to pursue a job in the field I’ve been in. This sent me panicking a little, because I don’t like the industry and I don’t like the jobs but it’s the only thing I’ve ever done. I tried to power through though, and continued applying. I even had 2 interviews last month that I was actually excited about. 

Unfortunately, one of them rejected me last week and it feels like I’m starting at zero. It’s a weird conflicted feeling because I didn’t even want the job but figured getting one might get the ball rolling for me, get me out of the house and start making money to give me freedom and purpose.

I’ve been really really depressed being away from my friends, my family, and being here alone. I love my SO with my whole heart and he has been nothing but supportive through everything. I’ve started considering moving back home by myself with my SO to follow next summer. Our deal was that if I didn’t like the new city after a year, we’d move back. 

If I stay here, I’m incredibly lonely and I simply don’t like this city. It’s gritty and a little tougher than I’m used to. Also, I grew up in a state that has poor public transit and this new city has a fantastic public transit but it’s not something I’m comfortable with or used to using. I feel trapped in our apartment, not really comfortable going out, especially since I’m a small girl. The industry out here is also just...really boring. No jobs have stood out to me and it’s been hard to feel motivated.

If I leave, I have to shell out a lot of money to cover a new apartment and my expenses with no job. As of now, my SO has the apartment paid for since he is in school, so I haven’t had to pay for anything until I got a job. The money has me stressed out of my mind. I’ll also be away from my SO, my best friend. But being back home will allow me to explore the industry I’m interested in.

I am so sad. I feel so lost in my life. I don’t know where I’m going, I don’t know what to do. It feels like any decision I make, I lose something. I don’t even know if making a decision one way or the other will make me happy. I’ve tried being positive through it all, I really have, but I’m starting to lose faith that things will ever be ok again.

I’m sorry this is long, I’m sure I sound like a brat and I’m sure no one will want to read this giant mess. I’m just tired of it being in my head. ",05Dec2018,1
25," So, I'm sorry for this long post, and for it being on a throw-away account, but I'm a bit of a private person when it comes to my identity on the internet after I was Doxxed about a year ago due to a disagreement with some people online.Basically, I want to try and start dating/looking for a relationship and I don't know where to really start. I'm 33 and I've only have 1 semi-serious relationship.

I haven't had any romantic relationship at all since my last break-up then. I've messaged a few people with dating apps, but only if they messaged me first. Even in high school I never really ""clicked"" with anyone on a romantic level, and right out of high school, I joined the Army and spent 4 years in (with deployments overseas). During my time in, people frequently tried to get me to go have one-night stands or random meetups, but I was never too interested in meaningless random sex (which is very prevalent in the Army, along with STDs, so there was a bit of a ""fear"" component to it as well).   In fact, my last relationship was basically being introduced to her and we hit it off and had similar interests (musicals and the singer Meat Loaf).

For awhile, I was fine with how things were going with myself and content that I wasn't really the type person for a ""relationship"", but I'm getting older now (at least, older than I was) and I've got a steady job (I'm a teacher at the high school level) and I'm more thinking I want to have a relationship, settle down, and maybe have some kids. My problem, is that I've got literally 0 clue where to start, and I'm concerned that people won't want to waste their time with me because of my inexperience in pretty much all facets of a relationship. At the same time, I see what a number of my friends have with their SOs and I realize that I kinda want that now. I just don't know what to do or how to improve this part of my life. A small part of it, is probably that I get to enjoy some occasional bouts of anxiety (thanks to my mild PTSD from the Army which presents as anxiety and depression) so I always over-think and get overly concerned about the little things.

Anyway, long story short, I'm just looking for any advice to help me move forward and become a bit more happy overall.  I just, don't know how to get started talking with someone over a dating app or online message, it just feels very... awkward.",05Dec2018,1

How I’ve literally had to teach my boyfriend how to do the DISHES! And he still doesn’t know how. I don’t get it?!? I DOO NOT GET IT! How men can sit there and be completely okay with not knowing how to do normal shit, or they do but think they deserve praise every time they do them? 

Okay the argument can be made, “men work”, “men make money” they look after their families financially. Maybe that argument could’ve been valid 40-50 years ago but these days women are expected to work and know how to do fucking everything, if I didn’t have to stress about work, maybe I’d be fine with doing everything else, but no.

however it took me a bit to finish writing just that. why? i keep thinking to myself why do i care so much about trying to make a ‘difference’? 

i was hoping to write something that could help somehody or the other. thats the point of reddit right? sharing and caring and all?. i started this post with the hope that i can try and sound meaningful but i guess thats not happening now. it seems as tho whatevers in my head just comes out differently when I try and write it, it’s kind of silly really 

lets try and change gears for a bit. 

I constantly struggling with mood swings, with being kinda of happy, and by happy i mean not misreable. then straight to misreable. I figured something healthy to try and do was when arguing or debating somebody, is to not care about winning. now that may seem obvious to all of you and honestly writing this now makes me feel silly a little bit. but when arguing about say politcs, he and i tend to have opposing views. but just yesterday, i realized something. i realized that when debating my friend, i cared more about ‘winning’ some hypothetical social points or social standing. i didn’t care about whether he was right or what his thought process was behind his points. i decided to try and look through his points and see what he was really trying to say. i wont get into them because i dont want to provoke anyone but lets just say they werent exactly the most pleasant. after talking to him through it, i explained to him that this is what I think is going behind his thought process. I explained that his fears of about certain things happening are justified because Im not going to make him feel invalid. 

do you know what happens when you make someone feel a little more invalid? they move in the opposite direction. they might have more extreme views. they’ll gravitate to rationalizing how they feel is justified because they wouldn’t want to let you win that argument. why? because thats a shitty feeling. feeling like what you say doesnt matter. 

anyway im getting slightly off track. 

when having an argument with somebody you truly care about, take this into consideration: it isn’t about you. its about ‘us’. us in this case being the parties involved. when you are having an argument you shouldn’t try to protect yourself(depeing on the situation ofcourse, please dont take that the wrong way). they aren’t arguing with *you* they’re arguing about something specific that has happened or will happen or whatever. feel? 

feel. 

I can go on and on about various things. tho none of this probably matters, im just a stranger on the internet talking about himself or something like that for some reason. 

stay safe. remember, shit happens.

Since physical therapy, they don't happen often, but when they do, it's very painful and things like walking or driving become difficult. Now, I've developed a new problem, pain in my beltline, and everything I do is painful, i cant even take notes in class while sitting and have to stand up. This has been happening 24/7 since Sunday and i won't be seeing a doctor about it for another 10 days.

Started in 9th grade. Woke up one day with a leg I couldn't move and horrible knee pain. I went on crutches. While I was on crutches my left knee started hurting too, and I developed back problems.

There was no diagnosis from the MRIs. I went to physical therapy and it helped.

I've learned to live with on/off again knee and back pain. At most I'll limp every once in a while or be in pain, but it's manageable and not to the point that it's disturbing my life. I.e. last week my knees were fine and then on Friday my right knee was hurting like hell, and it was painful to drive, I almost thought about pulling over and giving my knee time to relax.

But recently I've developed a new problem.

For the last 2 months, I have on/off pain where your belt line would be. Above the tailbone, but under the lower back. When it happened I couldn't bend down. I shrugged it off because it wasn't bad enough to affect my daily living, and I just considered it to be another on/off thing I have to deal with.

But, my worst experience, ever, from my physical problems has been in the past week.

It started off as my beltline area making it slightly uncomfortable when I'm sitting down at college or when I need to sit down to study.

Now, since about Sunday, it hurts 24/7. It hurts when I'm standing, and it especially hurts when I sit or try to sleep. In class today I had to stand up and go to the back of the class (to not distract others) while taking notes. I can't sit, it's just so painful. Sleeping on my back, painful. Sleeping on the side, painful. Sleeping on my stomach, unmanageable.

I've been having to study and do homework while sitting in really awkward positions to try and lessen the pain as much as possible.

I have finals next week so I'm going to suck it up until then, but right afterwards I'm going to see an orthopedic and go to physical therapy again.

I'd understand if I had a disease, etc (although I'm glad i don't) but I hate that my body randomly does shit like this. Shit that makes me cry of frustration that no matter what I do, the pain doesn't go away. That it just happens randomly, and there's no way to expect it. I.e. in the past, I've had random shoulder pain that was really bad and would last a month before going away. Once, I was laying down on my bed and when I got up, I couldn't walk because my right thigh would stab me every time my foot hit the ground; my leg went back to normal after about 4 days.

If I'm 18 and this happens to me, it really stresses me out what my future will be like. I feel like I'd be the type of person to be bedridden during pregnancy or be bedridden after I hit my late 40s. 

I was going to be working 20 hours next semester while at college, but now I'm going to have to go down to 14 hours because I'll likely be doing physical therapy.

This is one of the reasons I decided to work as a medical assistant instead of an EMT (in preparation for PA school). If something like this happened to me as an EMT, I'd have to take time off work completely.

It sucks that I have undiagnosable pain that directly impacts my life when it happens. To the point that it affects what my job is, whether u can sit down on a desk and take notes like a normal student, how painful it is to drive, how mentally healthy I am, etc.",05Dec2018,1

I have really low self worth, esteem, and confidence. I dont have hobbies or really enjoy doing anything. I constantly berate myself with negative thoughts about myself.

44,"""*What did I do to deserve this?*""

I ask myself, everyday when I wake up in pain or every night, laying down to sleep. Pain free day? No, pain waited and won. Sometimes, having a great day at work or just a nice day-off, eating breakfast... A snake enters my home and my day is ruined.

This painful condition developed slowly, then suddenly. Overtime I developed a relationship with it, I tried to make a win-win alliance with it. *Maybe we could get yummy pills?* Oh, fool I was. I used to enjoy opioids now and then, now I pretty much hate them. I don't know precisely why, possible reasons: 

1. I must save the pills for the terrible pain crisis yet to come;
2. When I take a pill, I can't be sure the pain is gonna go away completely. Sometimes it just vanishes enough so I can focus and not be angry all the time. 
3. Absolutely no enjoyable feelings. Just transitioning from angry and sad while in pain to neutral or slightly off.

It plays tricks with my mind. Sometimes I can go through an full week with a tolerable level of pain/discomfort, without the need of anything but acetaminophen/paracetamol now and then, or a muscle relaxer. Then I start thinking ""*hey, maybe this condition is finally resolving on its own! No need to get a MRI and make several appointments with different specialties.""* Hah. It doesn't take long after that for me to find myself surround by the snakes of hell, **unable to think, unable to sleep, unable to smile.** 

And of course, sometimes I question my own sanity: *is this a real thing or it's my mind creating pain in the absence of severe or any painful stimulus? Am I going to make a fool of myself going through expensive imaging tests that I'm not paying for and won't reveal a thing? It is real, but my doctor is going to see my depression history and judge by that, dismissing my complaints and delaying intervention while I'm suffering, until it's too late to recover function.""*

Thank you for reading. I'll try to rest after another night lost to pain. I took instant release morphine for the first time in years (usual doses of codeine were my go-to, but I ran out and didn't refill because, guess what, I thought I was getting better). It was almost completely useless, I'm feeling awful. Afraid of dangerous CNS depression I avoided taking a muscle relaxer on top of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is corrupting my body, my mind, turning me into a person who is either experiencing suffering or expecting it. My entire outlook in life is changing. I can see how pain is changing me, my personality, my plans for the future, my interpersonal relationships. There's no hoping for a better day. This is my nightmare, this is the sweat on my bed sheets.

47,"I am born with a genetic disorder called - achromatopsia. This means that I can't see colors, can't drive, I have a very bad vision, my eyes are so sensitive to light that I am blind in daylight without sunglasses. This prevents me from getting majority of jobs. Few months ago I was excited, I thought I got a decent job. I went over 40 minute interview, later they called me and told me that I will be getting the job and that they only need to sort out some small details, so they need to know my disability %. After I told them my % (which is 80 %) they told me they will contact me and they never contacted me again. The job was customer support over the phone, so I don't know how my eyes could have been a huge problem in that since windows ( they are using windows) has built in zoom features.  

Besides that I am short, I am in my early twenties but I look like a 16-18 years old. I was never invited to parties or other stuff even thought everyone was ""friendly"" to me. 

Since I am short and I look childish, people instantly devalue me not even including my eyes into the formula. Just yesterday I was in a group conversation with few of my friends and one friend's landlord. Landlord offered my friends(not me) to go fishing and made fun of me because I look like a 16 years old, don't have a real hobby like fishing, etc. 

I tried dating in my 18-22 years period. I went probably to 15-25 dates. Everyone was friendly to me but everyone politely instantly pushed me away, was weirded out by me, was not interested in me. I talked to some girls over that time. They would say ""why can't you find a date, you are so nice"" those same girls would never date me, I tried asking them out. It was depressing, we don't talk no more. 

All of this leads me to introvertism, anxiety, periods of mild depression. 

I don't know, I think I really really tried in life. Tried to be a normal person, tried to do normal things. It's like I am a second class citizen. An outcast that is always devalued. Things just don't work. I lost hope in everything. I stopped searching for jobs (trying to finish last year in college which is free in my country. Dealing with constant rejection would be too hard at this time), I stopped trying to date. 

Over the time I have encountered few people that would tell me that it was all my fault, that I am a loser, that I have not tried hard enough. Like life was so damn easy. 

Rarely someone understands me or wants to understand me. It's always the same old "" Oh, things will get better, you will just do X and things will be fine, you will find a nice girl when the right one comes, you have nothing to worry about"". 

I get it, people are nice. People are trying to help. That comes with a cost. I can't be honest about my real problems if people will just wave they hand and say that I have nothing to worry about. All I would like to hear is "" oh, that sucks man, I feel you"". THAT WOULD BE SO AMAZING. 

Besides that, I don't know any people that have a problem like I do. I have never encountered a person with same disability in real life. Few months ago I decided to find people like me online. I managed to find a facebook group. 

What I found didn't make me feel better. Turns out I have a severe condition of achromatopsia. A lot of people with achromatopsia can still see pretty decently compare to me, can still drive with special aids technologies - I can't, I am fucked, my condition is severe. 

In the end I did talked to one person in that group that I could relate too. That person experienced same problems: lack of social life, horrible experience when dating, hardness of finding a job, anxiety, periods of mild depression. 

If you are still reading this. Thanks. I wish you a nice day. I hope you are doing better than me. My life may be hard but I only wish the best for others.

I wish it was that easy for one to put into action.

Or do you think anyone willingly wants their lives to be tied to the control and direction of others?

That they become a shadow of themselves, constantly wondering what their existence is about.

Who doesn't want to feel ALIVE and live FREE?

Yesterday I had to see that quote three good times on my twitter feed.

While it is beautiful and freeing, there’s something it is MISSING OUT.

Let me paraphrase one of the quote here “Stop caring about what others think, live your life your way.”

BACK IN SCHOOL  
About 6 years back, whilst in school and on a windy evening, I was barely dragging my feet that day after a tedious class. I was unwell too.

When I got to the door of the room (school hostel) which was slightly open, I saw one of my roommates covered in a wrapper, lying still as his skin radiates the heat from his blood.

On further questioning, I discovered that he was ill. The most handsome in the room with well-trimmed beards. Tall and dark complexioned, with the usual six packs. A basketball player. One celebrity on that block.

It was another time to do something good for him even though he barely recognised the ones I did earlier on numerous occasions.

Chai! Here was I, who desired the same treatment I was offering to another.

Just to gain favour. To gain acceptance. To belong. To feel valued.

The ache I felt in my head was knocking me off, yet I mustered the strength to walk to where I could get the soft drink he takes the drugs with.

Regardless of the number of times I wanted to focus on myself and recognize I matter without others' opinion, I found that I could not.

I did not want them to think I was selfish, uncaring, untouched by their infirmities. Whereas all I wanted was the recognition.

No wonder, people in an abusive relationship cannot leave their abusers. It is not necessarily physical. It could be mental or emotional too.

This ranges also from religious belief to a romantic relationship &amp; even in the family (guardian or parent).

Then the inspirational push-ups. They hardly work in these instances as it is likened to pouring water into a basket. Sometimes it hurts. Something these motivators won't understand.

They have not dealt with the foundational root of such actions.

These are issues that need UNDERSTANDING.

The root cause needs to be uncovered. The thought pattern addressed and the underline reality brought to light.

Without this, such a person might remain stuck or is likely to take one step forward and ten steps backwards.

MY DISCOVERY  
I had to discover for myself that back then I was seeking relevance.

Growing up, I felt I was scarcely making any meaningful contribution. It was a silent battle. I wanted to ensure that my life was of meaning and not entirely useless.

It was the reason saying NO was difficult to requests from friends then.

When I discovered what the exact issue was, it was easy to resolve.

Majority, if not all, my friends are long distance. In different countries and it had been for a couple years. Hearing friends that live near each other and all make plans is excellent. It gets me excited too. Just, that I can't go. And it hurts then. They don't mean any harm at all, they're just, in the same discord and happen to talk about their plans.

My dad has always had issues managing money, and I don't know all of the specifics, but he got a second mortgage on the house and we ended up being kicked out. Obviously, this was heartbreaking. That house was a representation of everything my grandma had worked for in life. As an immigrant from Japan in the 1940s who worked as a maid in a hotel for years on end, owning a house worth as much as hers did was an amazing accomplishment. Obviously I'm upset at my dad for losing it. 

My brother and I grew up in that house. We had a nice childhood, and most of our memories of our grandma reside there. Today, I decided to look up that house and see what's changed, and according to the pictures on realtor.com, essentially everything is different. It was strangely painful seeing these changes. There was new furniture, new paint, and new tiles, and it honestly doesn't even resemble our old house. It was almost unnerving, not being able to find any familiarity. 

 I don't know what the point of this post is, but if you've read this far, thank you. I didn't want to bring this up to my brother, because I'm sure it would upset him as well, but I felt like I needed to get it out somehow. 

As an aside, something that I find kind of hilarious and sad is that the property value (according to this website) literally doubled at the exact moment we were all kicked out. I hope that whoever ends up living there enjoys their life in that house- it treated my family well.

This was a fairly typical experience and didn't differ from government transportation I've experienced while incarcerated. We were made to wear ankle cuffs and handcuffs, and took a several hours long bus journey there. When we arrived, we were immediately placed in a holding room while waiting to be booked in and assigned housing. 

_____________


This holding room was about the size of a house living room, and had absolutely no furniture except for a bench that that was attached to the walls. There was one toilet in it out in the open. There were about *forty* of us in this room. Most county jails I've been to take anywhere from thirty minutes to a few hours to get booked in. However, it took this facility around **eighteen hours** to book us in, and all forty of us were locked in this holding room the entire time. 


_____________

We ended up spending most of the day and the entire night in this holding room. During the evening they brought us mats so we could lay down and try to sleep. The room was so crowded that we struggled to find a spot to lay down our mat and get some rest. They did have a TV in the room, which was the only source of occupation we had. I don't know why they took so long to get us booked in compared to government facilities. The process of getting booked into this place was brutal compared to other experiences I've had. 


_____________

After sitting in the crowded holding room for eighteen hours, I was given a bag full of supplies and led to my cell in the general population unit. The housing unit I was sent to was fairly clean, had natural lighting, was fairly big, and wasn't overcrowded at all (in contrast to every government managed jail I've been in, which were all overcrowded). The bag of supplies I received had either two or three sets of clothes, undershirts, socks, as well as a sweatshirt. This is way better than every government jail I've been to, as they tend to only give you two sets of clothes, and you have to purchase any additional clothing. Some jails I've been to wouldn't even give me underwear or socks! Meanwhile this facility handed me everything I needed and even a sweatshirt. After the horrid experience of getting booked in this was a pleasant surprise. 


____________

My bag of supplies also had a notepad, flexible pens, a stamped envelope, and toiletries. No other facility I've been to gave me a stationary for free while getting booked in. In addition, we had $10 worth of free phone time credited to our phone accounts while booked in. This is another thing no other facility had provided me. 


_____________

The food was actually fairly decent here compared to other facilities I've been in. My only complaint is that they served breakfast so early in the morning, around 4:30 if I remember correctly, that a lot of people would sleep through it and miss breakfast, including me. Dinner was at 5:00, and people would get pretty hungry during the night. They took us out to a small yard every evening, which had a basketball hoop and a pull-up bar, fairly standard stuff.

______________

Once a week, we would be allowed to visit the facility library where we could borrow books, and also take photocopies if we needed. You could photocopy a certain number of pages for free if you're an indigent inmate. No county jail I've been to had an actual library you could borrow books from, so this was quite a treat. Overall this facility had better infrastructure than every state jail I've been to and seemed well maintained. The only sketchy thing I encountered is that the staff would apparently pressure you against sending a grievance to the U.S. marshals when you tried doing so. I didn't try sending a grievance so I didn't see this personally, but this is what I heard. 

**tl;dr: The private prison I was in had a brutal process of getting us booked in, but other than that it was better than state jails in pretty much every way.**

67,"I’m a very shy person, I’m afraid of talking to people. In the past 2 months I’ve had a sort of silent breakdown where I’ve stopped going to all my classes, doing no homework, and lying to my family and friends about it. There’s a lot of reasons why I can’t go to class, and I don’t know how to explain all of it to a therapist.

I’m really scared of not being able to describe what’s going on, does anyone have any tips on how to express their problems to a therapist? I know that question is pretty vague and open, but I guess that’s kind of an example of what I’m scared of happening when I talk to the therapist: I’m not gonna get the points across.",05Dec2018,1
68,"It is my first year at college and I got a 79% in a class that was not difficult at all.  This was an amalgamation of previously conquered bad habits that surfaced back up due to poor discipline, diet, schedule maintenance, and another bout with depression. I might need to go back on anti-depressants so that they can aid me to get a grip and not spiral into another episode. I might be sounding overdramatic but this is just how I feel at this moment.  Hope you all are doing well.",05Dec2018,1
69,"When I was 11, my family and I took to our vacation home, a little house far from the city we live in currently. While in the vacation home, my mother's sister, aka my aunt and my cousins came to visit. 

Often when they did this, one of my cousins and my brother would switch, meaning my brother went with my aunt and my cousin stayed with us for the remainder of the holiday.

At the time, I was very eager to go instead of my brother, and I got my wish, which I was very excited about.

When they picked me up, it was around 10 AM. It was a long and tiring drive, but it was fun nevertheless. When we arrived, at around 12:00 AM. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had exited the car and followed my other cousin to the room I would be staying in. I dropped my things off and were introduced to the first part of the trip, which involved cycling to a harbor nearby.

The bicycle I was given to ride was way too big for me, and the bicycle helmet as well, almost falling off several times.

I had to waste a bit of time getting onto the bicycle, as well as getting my short legs to the pedals. 

When we first began cycling, I was enticed by the scenery and fresh air. Keep in mind, I had only really been to my Aunt's place one or two times. Other than that, I have always loved nature and history, which made it all the more interesting.

It was only a few seconds before we went from the newly laid asphalt road that my Aunt's house was located on, to an old road that leads to the harbor. 

My cousin was riding a bit ahead of me, but in view. She made a point of warning me of several potholes, as well as small cracks in the road. She had clearly been on this road many times. And she had a good reason too - I was always a clumsy kid, and all too well distracted.

 

I remember looking to the left, at a big, lush, blooming bush and hearing my cousin loudly saying ''Watch out for the pothole in the middle of the road'' It took me a few seconds to realize what she had said, and when I did, I had no time to react, given the fact she had warned me around five seconds before the pothole actually came. After the pothole was only a little bit of road before a hill going down to the harbor.

&amp;#x200B;

I distinctly remember riding my bike right down the hole, and it flipping forward, sending me forward, scraping my left elbow hard against the asphalt, as I soon reached the end of the road and began tumbling down the hill.

&amp;#x200B;

I was feeling incredibly dizzy and light headed as I stood up, feeling immense pain in my left elbow. On instinct, I looked to my elbow, seeing the tip completely gone and what I can only describe as a waterfall of blood pouring out. In what must have been horror, I remember turning my arm so i could look into the hole, seeing what I still believe today was bone. 

&amp;#x200B;

My aunt, in complete shock, shouted something at my cousin I either didn't hear and quickly helped me get to the harbor, where I dipped my arm in the water. Here I must have blacked out, because the only other thing I can remember is a few images of being on the way back, following the same road of which I came from.

&amp;#x200B;

I was quickly taken to a hospital, as far as I know, and here I awoke after a period of time I had no idea of. I later found out I had been out cold for a day. The nurse had some candy, which she gave me a peace of as I was barely awake, soon going back to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, I wake up, my mother is in the room, arguing with my aunt. She saw me wake and comforted me. I could see she was incredibly distressed, though I was unsure of why, as I was still not aware of the full situation. Here afterward we drove home, where my cousin had to end his holiday at our house early.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that still enrages me to this day, and makes me unable to forgive my aunt, is the whole story which I heard when I was around fifteen. Beforehand I had not questioned what happened, though I am unaware of why. 

&amp;#x200B;

After I had passed out, my Aunt had taken me home, and when my mother had called in the afternoon, my Aunt explained the event as ''Minor'' and when my mother asked if she should come, my Aunt replied she had it under control and it was not needed.

&amp;#x200B;

In the aftermath of the event, I was diagnosed with Epilepsy, caused by severe head injury, most likely due to the bicycle helmet being too big for my head. As well as that, to this day, my left elbow is completely grey, because of the hard contact with the concrete. Lastly, my left elbow has not completely healed, and looks partly disfigured.  

&amp;#x200B;

After the accident and the aftermath, my mother has never had the same relationship with my Aunt. She blames her for not telling her to come sooner, as well as giving me unsafe equipment. Though I personally know that it was partially my fault for not being observant, I understand, as the troubles, it has given me will stay with me my whole life.

By troubles, I mean that the epilepsy caused me to be placed in a handicap class, which caused the school system to fail me. Simply put, it's a long story I might write about one day.

&amp;#x200B;

That's it. I am sorry if it sounded like an overreaction from a minor event, but I am completely confused if I should forgive my Aunt. Nevertheless, I wasn't the only one she failed, as one of my cousins are on alcohol and tobacco abuse, and the other recovering from intense drug, alcohol and tobacco abuse.

&amp;#x200B;

If you took the time to read even a word of my post, thank you. I'm glad I could finally write down this story, as it's been hard to explain.

71,"I am a freshman geek in college. About 5'7. ""Studies while eating Doritos"" Freshman 15 belly.

I have been playing poker for years. Always known as the best among my friends.

This weekend, a cute, very tall senior girl (maybe 5'11? Possibly 6'0?) stumbled into our small party. She heard me brag about how I've won 11 tournaments in a row.

She challenged me to a heads-up game. I said sure, let's do it.

Only 30 minutes later, she took every penny I had. $330. Which was my textbook money. I asked for a shot to win it back.

She said ""Well, I already have all your money. How about your clothes? But when I take those little panties too, you go home without them.""

That admittedly intimidated me a little, but maybe she liked me and this was a chance to finally get laid.

30 minutes later, I handed her my boxers, which she swung around her head yelling ""WOOOO!""

I was as naked as a newborn baby.

Totally untanned from the neck down as everyone giggled to their ultimate amusement.

""Finders keepers, losers weepers"" she said as I shuffled to the door wearing nothing but my glasses and a pink blush on my face, pathetically covering my package with my hands.

Towering over me from behind, she said ""Now RUN HOME, BIRTHDAY SUIT BOYYYY!"" and leaned back and SMACKED my round, plump white bubble butt and I gasped, let out a yelp of pain, and ran through the door, gasping as my bald buttcheeks felt the 35 degree weather, down the steps, across the quad, and across the football field, 2 miles back to my dorm, as naked as the day I was pulled screaming from my mother. Hiding behind dumpsters and trees the whole way. Desperately clutching my little dorm key-card in my hand.

I was caught on security camera running buck naked into my dorm and kicked out of my dorm. Now I have to commute from home.

I didn't have the heart to tell my parents the real reason, so I pretended it was excessive drinking. Which really pissed them off.

Can someone please answer the following questions?

    How old are you and male or female?

    Are you more geeky or outgoing?

    What parts of the story were funniest for you to imagine and why?

    What parts made you cringe most to imagine yourself in, and why?

    Why is the single funniest mental image you have in the story and why?

    Do you feel the humiliation? If so, when?

Thanks!!",05Dec2018,1
73,"I'm a big fitness enthusiast. I run long distances, lift weights, do calisthenics. Like most guys I also have that competitive blood. I've trained for and won several calisthenics and running competitions.

So when I heard about a local armwrestling tournament I got interested and registered.

I spent weeks researching and reading up about the sport. About the big names in the scene, the techniques, the training required. I modified my training to become armwrestling-focused. For a while, armwrestling was all that occupied my mind.

Eventually I came to the conclusion that this is just not for me. I don't enjoy the potential for injuries, the hyper intensity and pressure on the muscles, the lack of fight (a match can be over in 2 seconds), the inevitable feeling of indignation as you lose.

There's also a massive factor of genetics at play. It's not unheard of that a skinny and relatively untrained guy, blessed with crazy rotator cuff and wrist strength, can defeat guys who have spent years lifting in the gym.

82,"My uncle's funeral was today last month. It was the first time I actually cried over his death since he passed from cancer on the 26th. I'll admit, I did come close a few times, especially on the night while everyone else was talking about him, but I've always felt a certain disconnect over the whole situation. One month on, I've realised I grieve more over some fictional man from my favourite webcomic in his forties who probably was shot rather than a middle-aged uncle who passed from cancer.

And its always been the worst part - I felt left out by the whole affair. I thought back to him after he passed and during the funeral... but nothing came up. The man leading the funeral (I forgot the title) said that he had lived a good life, and that it was best to cherish what good memories I had of him... but I drew a complete blank. That had to be the worst part of it all. After that, while my grandparents are now constantly checked on to see how they are coping since the funeral, while the disputes over plaques and shunned family members have died down, I haven't even shed a tear for my uncle since. Yet I still come close to tears over this damn man.

Maybe it was because I never saw him at all in recent years. Maybe its because I always tended to sit myself upstairs on my laptop whenever he was around, lately. Maybe its because I was in school or college when he came down. Maybe its because I never really spoke to him at all. The only significant things I remember of him is that he supported Liverpool FC and that he still smoked after my grandmother quit. Whenever it crosses my mind again - just like it has, today - I just feel really bad that I don't remember much about him, so much so that I felt a real disconnect on the days leading to the funeral.

I'll never forget his name and the little things I know about him. But I feel like I've forgotten everything else without knowing until it was too late.",05Dec2018,1

Then when I asked why one of them thought it was funny to ask me these types of questions, she answered ""it's funnier when it's you because you always ask 'why do you think \_\_\_ about me'"". I didn't say anything at the time because I was an anxious stewing mess inside at this point and I couldn't get the words out.

This whole thing which most people wouldn't think twice about has left me emotionally shattered.

I haven't been good at establishing boundaries and asserting myself in the past, and now I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown because I feel I've been a doormat but am also worried about telling others not to tease me in case I get called 'sensitive' and they just continue to do so.

87,"I work in an office that is a subsection of a tech company. We don't personally do any of the techie stuff, we mostly just deal with the people who do. I had a low level job here for over two years, and in that time, the office manager has rotated in and out every 3-6 months. They always started off eager and excited and left drained and defeated. Originally, I didn't even want the job. It seemed like a death sentence for working here at all.

But, when the last manager was fired for ""medical reasons"" (drinking), they asked me to step up on an interim basis. I said yes because the money was good. Interim is paid slightly less than the permanent manager would be, but it was still a big leap from where I was. I didn't realize how much better my life would be with that money until I was earning it. My wife was so happy, she could finally make improvements around the house.

After a couple of weeks I got a feel for the job, and they encouraged me to throw my hat into the ring to have the job permanently. It really wasn't as hard as everyone had made it seem. I submitted my resume and expressed my interest, and then went about doing the best job I could for months without hearing an update. I only received positive feedback. Everyone at the company seemed to like me, and they all expected me to get the job. 

I finally mustered the courage to ask what was going on with that, and was told we would have a meeting to discuss it. You already know how that went. They let me know that they ""fought for me"" but the higher ups had someone else in mind, so they went and hired someone else. They let me know last Friday, but I'm still fulfilling the duties until the new manager arrives.

96,"I will sign off Reddit for good today.  In the past two years, I have enjoyed much of what Reddit has to offer.  I’ve enjoyed the conversation at r/cfb, r/self, r/economics, and many others.  I have found the answer to questions and met really nice people.  

But there is also a lot of disagreement, to put it nicely, and outright hateful vitriol, to put it more bluntly.  Places like r/politics can devolve into a cauldron of hatefulness and personal attacks.  

It isn’t The fault of Reddit and certainly not it’s mods or creators.  It simply is a condition of living in America, even the world, now.  It’s a condition of being able to say nearly anything, in an anonymous world, behind the disguise of our computer and smartphone screens.  There is no transparency to be found in this world we have created in the internet age.  It is not a place for someone like me, though it’s a perfect environment for many.  I have erased past user names, only to come back and attempt to find a great use for my time on Reddit, and indeed, have found a lot to be useful.

But, for the good of my belief in people, and for the health of my positive outlook for the rest of my own life, and the good of my faith in country, I need to step away and be gone.  Good luck and good fortune to all of you.  ",05Dec2018,1
