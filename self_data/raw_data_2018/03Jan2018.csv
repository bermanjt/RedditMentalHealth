1,"Im a weak 26 year old man. I don’t feel like a man, I feel more like a woman, a child, or a dumb idiot. I was raised mostly by aggressive women and my father, an absent drug addict is also extremely sensitive and passive like me. I was never taught to control emotions but I was raised introverted rather than aggressive because of the women in my life. My condition is so extreme that I’m about to be fired from work because I’m unable to think proactively and work efficiently. I have to be told what to do, I’m not a self starter. In addition this anxiety has made me extremely dumb. I’ve experienced so much shame and now I’m extremely insecure and unable to care for myself. Yes, I grew up in the ghetto and was bullied thru middle school and high school. Despite this, I was able to graduate college with a masters degree, worked at prestigious firms and made a good living the past few years. I worked hard to better myself, but I grew up to become extremely antisocial and have yet to fulfill myself romantically. I’ve never bonded with anyone and I’ve isolated myself even more. But I get older, people are expecting more of me. I not longer get a pass at being passive and introverted because I’m expected to know more.  I can’t take care of another person tho if I can’t take care of myself. I’m low right now and it’s either get a kick in the ass to man up or die a wimp that was unable to man up. ",03Jan2018,2
2,"Been through the classic mental health issues through the years, starting at secondary high school (Am now early twenties male). Been a hell of a lot better for the past 5 months or so due to some active self help but the past week I've just crumbled. 

I've gotten to the point where I've just given up and stopped trying. I don't even want to get better. I want to cry all the time but I feel like my medication inhibits me being able to because of how it levels out your emotions. I couldn't bring myself to suicide or self harm because I couldn't stand to do that to my friends and family, but I just don't want to be here anymore, I just want to run away and keep going. In about 15 minutes I'm probably going to feel so pathetic and embarrassed for writing this.  

The trigger for all this is a girl. We slept together after a night of drinking, but it meant a lot more to me than it did to her. No one in our circle of friends knows and we don't want them to, there is way too much context to explain here but let's just say I feel like I've betrayed one of my close friends. So there isn't anyone I can talk to who knows all this context because I can't have them finding out. I have no one to talk to about my whole situation and my flurry of feelings. I'm just fucked. I feel as bad as I did in high school.

Edit: Another paragraph of context.",03Jan2018,1
3,"I ended the year with the tragedy. I know- things could be worse, i could've been on an accident, killed somebody, lost somebody, be sick. A lot of people have it worse (so then it's not correct for me to feel bad, right? I should just move on). But I feel like I'm on a thin line from not making it anymore. My sister is getting married around this time next year or at the end of this year. For her own good and not wanting to ruin her happiness I will try to make it for a year. But god I want to end it so bad. 

I don't know how to go on. I don't have a regular job, I don't have a boyfriend (and haven't had one in ages), all of my friends are doing so good and my family I just seem to make them miserable. I fantasize daily about getting killed in an accident, so people won't call me selfish. 

Do things get better? If they don't, after the wedding I'll end things for good. It's a card for myself to remind and rewind the year once this has passed. If this is going to be the last year I hope it ends quickly because I can't go on like this anymore.  ",03Jan2018,2
4,"I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing wrong, but this is like a 72 hour panic attack and I hate it, I want off this ride, and I feel so hopeless that I don’t even know what to say. ",03Jan2018,73
5,"It’s like there’s some fucking hole in me I can’t ever permanently fill. I feel like a hollow shell. Sure I can do shit to distract myself from it, but when I’m alone with my thoughts and nothing else, I just feel so lonely and empty. Distractions temporarily fill up that stupid hole. I can watch TV all day and not think about it too much. I can go out and get drunk. I can listen to music. But the minute the distractions are gone I’m just stuck with myself, and I’m just there. Just existing. None of it actually matters; I don’t actually have any passion or will to live. I’m just scraping by and trying to forget about how shitty I feel.

There’s one thing I’ve found makes me feel completely fine, if only temporarily; infatuation. I fall head over heels for girls, and I think it’s definitely linked to how shitty I feel. The thing is though I’m a virgin. All these crushes go unrequited, and they only get worse. In high school they were pretty tame, but since leaving I’ve had 2 massive ones that basically took over my life for their duration, one that’s still going on right now. The first one the girl wasn’t ever really interested in me. She was friendly enough, and we clicked a little, but it was always this forced awkwardness to it. I barely knew her, not really. We never had anything but surface level conversations. It didn’t go anywhere at all, but I built the whole thing up so much in my head that it took me months and months to get over her.

Then I became friends with this other girl. Real, genuine friends, which is rare for me. I found someone I have a genuine connection with. It made me feel amazing that I’m capable of that deep connection. And instead of being able to just enjoy that, my stupid fucking brain makes me fall for her. She’s literally my best friend man, and I’m hopelessly into her. She’s the only one I ever open up to, even if it’s just a little. But she has a boyfriend, and while sure we get along great and support each other and shit, I know somewhere deep down she just doesn’t see me that way. But it doesn’t matter. Cause that hole’s there. And while she’s in my life, it’s filled. And as pathetic as it sounds, it’s kind of worth the pain of seeing the girl you’re so into being with someone else, because at least I’m not alone. I have someone to message all day. Someone who cares whether I’m actually alive. Someone who depends on me. It means the world.

But it’s just not healthy. It’s a temporary solution to a permanent problem.  The problem is that I’m just fucking broken somehow. I’m just empty inside. And even though being around her makes me feel like I’m someone worth a damn, someone that I could grow to like, really deep down I’m still hollow man. And seeing her with someone else kills me, just in a different way. But it’s either that or go back to feeling completely alone. And the thing is, no girl wants a guy who’s this down on himself and lacking in self-confidence.

People always say that you need to love yourself before you can love someone else, but it feels like my flaw as a person is that I can’t love myself unless I feel like someone else does. But nobody ever truly does. So I take the closest I can get and cling to it desperately, because if I don’t I’m just alone with myself. Why the fuck am I like this? I feel like my full life I’m gonna go through this cycle over and over. It just sucks. I hate myself even more for being that asshole who’s hopelessly into a girl with a boyfriend. I feel like one of those stupid ‘nice guys’ for even complaining about her not feeling the same. But I just wish that once somebody would feel for me the same way I feel for them. I look for that love thinking it will fix me, but honestly I don’t think it would. I don’t know how to fix myself in all honesty. ",03Jan2018,18

14,"It's 1 am and my heart is beating so fast and I'm so sad. I really wanted to make it work but it just isn't gonna happen. We're both so young and it's really clicking that we want different things out of life. I was always hoping that our differences would balance us out but it's just making me resent her.

And I really do want to be her friend. We get along so well and I love talking to her and hanging out with her. She's one of my best friends. I told her I wanted to marry her one day. But after really thinking about spending the rest of my life with her, I don't think I can depend on her like I need or want her to.

It's so fucked up. This is really the first relationship I've had where I've thought that we were never breaking up. But we are and it sucks. I feel like I lied to her. I feel like I'm gonna break her heart, which is magnified by the fact that she goes back to college in a week, where she already doesn't like it. And I feel so bad for her mom, who I consider to be my second mom. I'm more worried about breaking it to her than my girlfriend. I don't want to say goodbye to her if my girlfriend doesn't want to see me again. Or her dogs, that I've taken care of and love as much as my own.

I'm so worried about what's gonna happen in the future and if I'm just shitting away an awesome relationship. I know we could always get back together, but I'm going to be snipping the very first rope that we created in two. We can mend it but it'll never be the same.

I think the worst part is that I'm kind of excited. One of my coworkers is interested me, and I can try out the dating game again. I'm so much more confident in myself and happy with who I am now. I've really learned how to talk to girls, in large part due to my current girlfriend helping me. I feel like I look better and am a better guy, and I can have fun like a bachelor now.

But that's so shitty. I have a girlfriend that I completely trust that I can always talk to. And I completely trust her.

This is so fucked. But I don't feel my heart breaking. It feels like it's been over for a while. I saw her today, and I barely touched her. I didn't feel very close to her. I just gave her a Christmas gift from her mom and left after a half hour. I don't think she knows that it's all about to end. Fucking fuck. I hate this. I'm just rambling at this point. I want to get it out of my head. If you've read this far, congrats. I wonder if anyone could pick this out and identify me? Please don't, I'm using my porn account and don't want anyone to find out what I wank to.

I want to ramble. Sometimes I feel like I'm so close to perfect and I could have anything I wanted to. But that's such bullshit. No one's perfect, much less me. Everyone keeps telling me I've got shit figured out, especially for my age, but I don't feel that way. Especially now. But still, I feel like there's a maturity gap between me and my girlfriend, and I just get so frustrated with her. That she won't tell me how she feels, even when I tell her that I just want to know the answer, whether I like it or not. She sugar coats everything, beats around the bush, or just ignores the question or problem. Don't ask a question of you're not prepared for every answer. So if I asked the question, give me the answer. Is that lying, if I ask her how she's feeling and she won't tell me how she really feels? There's such a barrier between us and it's so irritating. I want to be a therapist, so I'm okay with dealing with someone who isn't entirely comfortable with divulging their deepest darkest secrets with me, but this is supposed to be my partner and equal for life. I shouldn't have to grind away after 3 years just to find out if she REALLY doesn't want pasta for dinner.

Is it wrong to go on a date a few days after you end a multi-year relationship? While all of this has been going on, one of my coworkers has been showing me a lot of interest and attention of her own accord and it's so refreshing. I can't stop thinking about asking her out. I know that it probably wouldn't go very far, but I just want to be desired again. I want to feel tingly and uncertain again. I'm so bored and I want to feel the rush of dating. Maybe give Tinder a spin. I'm gonna have to delete so much shit off of my phone and computer of the two of us. That's gonna suck. Okay I'm tired now I'm gonna go to bed.

sometimes I miss having an SO bc hey, i’m a pretty cool person and I have things to share.  so sometimes when I go to bed I wish it was with someone I could whisper to in the dark, and touch, sometimes I’m so happy to have my bed to myself.

so sometimes I get the feeling almost like I’m wasting something by being by myself, because what’s a great thought if you don’t share it, something makes you laugh, that’s great, how much greater if you can make someone else laugh too, and I want someone I really like to touch my boobz let’s be real.  I want connection in multiple senses.

but it’s been two years bc I want someone I’m really with,
I mean I want first to arrive at a place with myself where I’m happy with me, and I am mostly, but I don’t want to feel like I need someone else to complete me.  why is there so much pressure all the time to be with somebody all the time?  i’m starting to do it to myself.  like i’ll just be me.  and if/when somebody comes along who’s doing what he does, and we line up, that’s what i want to work.

24,"First of all - My life=stinking mess. I have no idea if this is the place to post such a thing but be warned it is a long and boring story. Ill try to keep it short and simple but I really do need an advice from someone who has been trough something similar.

So I moved to the US 3 years ago. First year all great. I was getting used to my work which is a ton of stress but its good money. Now I know ""work what you love"" but I have grown really fond of my work and I enjoy it to the bone, just not the people I work with. 2017 though totally different story. I worked for 11 months straight in a isolated area. Hard work did NOT pay off at the end. I ended up with 12k which is less than nothing for 11 months but hey. I was promised more money by the end of the year yet no one came trough. And it seems I won't get my money soon. I knew that was coming so I started working in the big city. Vegas. Its new to me and have not got used to this kind of work. But as all things you have to start from somewhere. It was going nice, then slow. I found a girlfriend spent my Christmas in LA. Everything perfect. Except she told me on the 1st of this year she cheated on me. Like we are dating for ONE MONTH for crying out loud. I'm used to those kind of relationships so I ended it pretty fast.I spent New Years eve by myself. I already sold some stuff just to keep me somewhat OK.I eat once a day. Maybe twice if I can afford it.  I have a vehicle that I use for work. Im doing delivery here in the city. That is the only thing I have left here. ( I have no family in this country whatsoever.) This evening while I was doing delivery I man approached me and held a gun to my head for money. I gave him my last 20$. I explained what happened to my boss, and he told me to take several days off which I cannot afford. Im selling my car now, ebay,craigs,carmax even facebook. I already own money to my rent. The only choice I see and don't like is to go back to my previous job (the one I didn't get payed for) but at a different employer. I see no alternative to it.
I am doing my best. I really do. I work hard and fast. Im always kind to people but my life has been a total shit show for the past 2 years. Cliche, and i HATE it but I am starting to wonder why is this happening to Me. I am 23 years of age fyi. I know I am young and have a lot more shit to take trough my life but I don't know how much longer can I take all of this.

25,"When I was still a kid, I had close to zero problem relating to my hearing. If anything, I would say my hearing was better than most of my peers. However, as I grew up my hearing is getting worse and worse, which many people seem to think is pretty normal.

I'm still young - not even 20, yet whenever someone speaks to me in English, it sometimes just sounds like complete gibberish to me. This doesn't just happen once or twice a day; it happens at least once every few minutes of the conversation. This makes it extremely frustrating and annoying for both me and the person I hold a conversation with. 

Many of my friends agree that having to repeat a sentence over and over again just because of me is just irritating. Even my closest seems to despise the idea of having to do it all the time, as she eventually exploded and shouted at me for it .

27,"My boyfriend (the only person I've considered the love of my life) recently started renting out a room from a family with two little children. He(boyfriend) spends a lot of time with the little girl and its gotten to the point where she is completely obsessed with him. I expressed my concern to him that young girls are extremely impressionable and I was insecure that he was willing to devote so much time to her and willingly get her completely attached. I asked him to keep his distance and not to let her get attached because he is a 25 year old male and she is a young girl. He says that its not in his nature to be anything but nice and hes telling the truth. He's one of the kindest people I've ever met, but it makes me unconfortable to know he wants her to get completely attached(she already is to him more than to her father). He says he finds nothing wrong with her and him being attached with one another and expressed to her parents that he(my bf) will always be there for that little girl for the rest of her life. This was after a month of meeting them.

Its not my business to control my partners life, but once being a little girl myself I know how i felt when older non-family males payed attention to me. If anyone had acted the way my bf treats that little girl i would have completely fallen for them amongst other feelings. In that regards i'm completely uncomfortable with my bf and that little girls relationship..he even says that he feels a connection with her..

Recently he came to me and said that sometimes when they're playing she touches herself sexually (hes already told her parents).The little girl has also expressed to him that she loves him. He discourages her when she does that and tries changing the activity, but refuses to stop playing with her. At this point she is more attached to him that anyone else and i belive its all my bfs doing because hes opened himself up to her that way.

I do not think anything is wrong with the little girl and she is exploring herself at this age, but I believe my boyfriend should stop allowing them to become so close. We've been fighting over it for months and i gave him an ultimatum(never a good idea) to which he did not choose us.

I need someone to speak some sense into me because there is nothing thats driven me crazier than this situation. I wish someone would tell me that its all in my head and that its harmless but i truly do not view it that way. I know my bf would never do anything to the girl but I fear that the relationship between them will become really unhealthy. I feel it already is because no little girl should be this attached to a 25 year old man and its the adults responsibilty to make sure that it does not happen. I belive my boyfriend has good intentions, but does not always take reponsible actions...and i think the responsible thing to do is be kind to her and still break off ties gently. He will never do it he tells me because he doesn't agree with me and is willing to risk our relationship over it.

Thank you for reading my rant. I want to stay with my boyfriend as i do believe he is the love of my life, but our relationship will not continue if he continues to willingly become so attached to her.",03Jan2018,0
29,"Okay so, a brief bulleted list of what I hate her boyfriend (followed by my reasons later on don't worry):

1.) He's possessive asshole

Why:
-He once barged into my friend's apartment complex because of some fight they had a day before or something. (note that the my parent's family lives there too.)
-He blackmailed her into giving her a condition that if she wanted to break up with him, she'd have to pay him 1k.

2.) He's a creep.

Why:
-The guy literally roamed around the city to buy time while we were at our girl's night.
-We recently had a girl's night in our other friend's house. The three of us gals were having fun playing games, watching sappy movies, and drinking cocktails when suddenly, my friend let the guy inside the apartment. My other friend and I were shook. But we shoved our murderous thoughts aside and welcomed him. 

What really infuriated me about everything is that on our way to our friend's house (after stopping by 7/11 to buy some snacks) they were all lovey-dovey which I'm fine with but it still confused the hell out of me. I decided to prevent myself from lashing out at them by shoving fistful of chips in my mouth. What's more is that how dare she let that guy him inside our friend's apartment? Our friend doesn't know about the bf personally and just knew him as a topic in our convos from time to time. Beside, my best friend letting him in was not her choice to make. It's disrespectful to the actual owner of the house. 

And lastly, she just said ""I'm real sorry guys. I'll do better on our next hangout."" That made my mind explode because I'm worried that she didn't get why I was angry in the first place. I'm also worried that for her, it was enough to say that she's sorry. Which she really is. But in this case, we (especially our other friend) deserve more than ""sorry"".

I swear to god, I'll pull a Strangers on Train act on that guy any time now.

32,"Isn't it weird that flaws actually help me strengthening my own opinion on self love and self confidence? Showing compassion to yourself in this world is the only way to be grateful and to stay mindful. The world's mindset is mostly built upon an unbelievable standard of super models, and when anyone really does what they want, and wears what they want, is considered the rebel among the society. And we are surely not the only one, my bravest friend.

A skin break-out happened to me several months ago after the sudden change of accommodation. I have acne on my back. My belly rolls seem to be not welcomed by crop tops. Jersey pieces will not do any favor to my look because of those wide shoulders. All of these flaws suddenly break down into pieces when I read these lines of Fit Lan Anh talking about her fashion taste and imperfect skin: "" I was born this way, though. Being self-deprecated at first, but then screw opinions, I wear whatever I want."" She inspired me to say no to discouraged judgement towards me, my look, and even my mind. 

This mental healthy state of being might start off right since the day you were born; however, to some, it is a real struggle with obstacles along the way. There's a line from The Help (2011), that I would never forget, a preschooler utterly repeats these words with her beloved nanny after being scolded by her mother: ""You is kind. You is smart. You is important."" The girl is taught by such a precious soul that - encouraging herself to believe in her own being is crucial, anytime and anywhere. As we get more and more mature, the stressful life is no longer about battling with the world, it is about battling within our self.

""I will not let the world make me hate my look, my soul, my everything. And yes, I am responsible for my own happiness."" Life is full of options, and I choose to say this, to write this down, to remember this by heart. I do have trust in attitude and this statement emphasizes how much it will affect my experiences if I decide to title my perspective to events in life. It is a combat between pampering the drowning negative thoughts and nurturing seeds of thrive, thrive to live on.

Life is full of options, and it is crucial that we distant our self from the situation to actually see that rainbow after the storm. 21, I do not dare to say I have experienced it all, but I have seen enough to start living, not surviving. 

To Mondays, I decided to take it as a fresh start to everything. 

To the despair of being heart broken, I chose to love, to forgive and to let go all of the hatred. 

To madness and anxiety, I viewed and perceived others' reaction with patience and show sympathy.

To death, I live wholeheartedly.",03Jan2018,5
34,"TL;DR: I feel like I’m letting dead strangers down

Follow me in this shitty train of thought. 

I’ve had a pretty privileged life so far but just never felt motivated to reach any of the goals I had set. That makes me feel like I’m just a burden to my family while they could be better off not having to support an extra child in college who can’t focus on classes to save his life. Then I start to think about just ending it and consider how I’d try my best to not make it look like a suicide because I know they would feel as though it was their fault. Then I start to think about how they are such great people and don’t deserve to have one of their sons taken away while he was doing so well in school. The thought of all the people who have died or been murdered crosses my mind now and how they did not deserve to have had their lives taken away from them because they had something to live for. I start to think that I should do what they wanted to do and experience what they wanted to experience in the sense that I should not be another life wasted with no experiences or goals achieved. So now the thought of how I’m letting them down by not achieving my own goals even though I’ve had a great life so far comes in and I just start to feel like shit for not even being able to do something for someone I never knew or is even alive.

I've come to this realization recently. I've gotten hints for awhile, and probably did feel it intuitively, but finally someone came out and said I was ""draining."" And I really paid attention and went over some past behaviour and realised they were right. 


Now I don't think I'm severely emotionally draining, but I could be wrong. And I know looking back I've been a lot worse in the past, but somehow just became less so. I'm not sure how.  


You don't' need to tell me I was/am a horrible person, toxic etc. etc. because I realise it can't change the past (besides apologising if possible or necessary to anyone). 


I'm trying to look toward the future and be better from now on.


One last question, is it better to just change if I'm still ""hanging on"" with friendship, even though I'm not being a good enough friend? Or should I tell that person/those people first and then do it? 


Thanks :) ",03Jan2018,14
37,"These next few days (and this winter) will, as always, be rough. The forecast is dangerously low temps, lots of snow, and heavy wind.  But while us humans get stay indoors with heat, there are countless stray animals suffering in this winter weather!


If you see a stray animal, call your local animal control, but please make sure they do NOT go to a kill shelter. Many stray animals are brought to shelters in healthy condition but then euthanized for lack of space! If you can, get them tested and bring them home. A warm, loving home is what every animal deserves.

So please, while you are inside warm and safe, think of the stray animals who are in this weather and if possible, help them out!

Until i found myself pregnant living in a shitty back room apartment infested with rats, and .... i was on the verge of a mental breakdown. Now that i've had the baby, i'm living with my mother in law, who doesn't like me. I've decided that I am ready to transform my life and get out of these awful situations. I want to have a full transformation on my life. I don't want to ever need anything from anyone, which means I want to have stronger financial security. I want to have more fulfilling relationships. I know that a lot of what is happening is because of my own inability to make changes in my life. I've always felt like i was meant to do great things, but at age 32, I'm disappointed in myself honestly, i feel like I failed myself. But i know that i still have time to make things right. And I don't want to wait 3 or 4 or 5 years.. i want to change my life right now. 

On my way to the store, i decided to record myself and hold myself accountable with what i'm going to do. i think i want to do a vlog about my journey. its really a way to be completely open and honest and if people are watching me, maybe i will actually do what i'm supposed to do.

41,"Hello,

I think I'm depressed, but I'm trying to get better. I have a few problems, though, and would like some advice.

My mood seems to cycle. Sometimes, I get motivated to improve my life. I exercise, clean the house, read a book, practice drawing, and so on. The more straightforward tasks like exercise and housecleaning are relatively easy to do, but they only go so far. The more complicated and rewarding tasks like reading a book or drawing tend to cause more issues. Whenever I hit a snag, such as not retaining what I read or realizing that my drawing sucks, I spiral into a depression that lasts for a few days. Then, the cycle repeats.

Often, I wonder if I can change. I'm twenty-two years old now, but I have no accomplishments. I haven't even achieved some of the more basic things that most people have. I've never gone to school, I have crippling social anxiety, I don't have a driver's license, and I have no skills. Now, I fear that I'm too old and my neural pathways have hardened up too much for me to really master anything. I fear that I'll never develop social skills, become good at math, learn a foreign language, and so on because I didn't start young. *This fear is probably the biggest demotivator in my life.*

I am making *some* progress, but it's incredibly slow. I'm better at drawing than I used to be—I seemed to cram about six months of progress into five years. I exercise a little bit and go outside in my backyard sometimes. (It took a few months to overcome my fear of going out there by myself though.) I got a GED not too long ago with an acceptable score. But at this rate, I might start being good at something by the time I'm 80.

Is there any way to move a little faster? To improve my motivation-depression cycle? To have more confidence that I *can* really improve? What am I doing wrong?",03Jan2018,2

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_presentism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_block_universe

I want to say that I'm instinctually a presentist, but then I think, why do I think that WWII was ""real"" and the Trojan war ""wasn't real?"" What is ""was?"" I dunno man. They're even saying that time is an illusion. 

https://www.space.com/29859-the-illusion-of-time.html

&gt;Fotini Markopoulou-Kalamara, a theoretical physicist at the Perimeter Institute, said, ""I have the distressing experience of physicists telling me that time is not real. … It confuses me, because time seems to be real. Things happen. When I clap my hands, it happened. … I would prefer to say that general relativity is not the final theory than to say that time does not exist.""

46," I don't normally go to the dentist for anything but teeth cleanings. But today I had to get 2 wisdom teeth removed, but they decided to take ALL 4 out. I read that you don't feel anything but I could literally FEEL them coming out and hear the cracking like sounds DX

To make it worse I had to go by myself and, to my horror and embarrassment, had to talk to the pharmacist with a swollen, bloody mouth!

 Has anyone had multiple wisdom teeth taken out? Was it as bad for you? I'm just hoping it doesn't hurt badly after the numbness wears off.

50,"It's amazing how in a couple short months, I can go from being on top of the world to just absolutely done.

I lent a friend $200 to start his own business. He's doing really well, like $6000 a month now, and is now ghosting me. Nice.

My dad is struggling with massive debt, has no food, etc. In turn I gave him the $1000 I had in my bank account to help. All was spent well, but he's still screwed. Wages garnished isn't helping.

I have a new job, and love it. Couple Co workers make my life hell, and it's clear across the city. But I'm generally happy. Going to get a raise soon hopefully.

Thing is. I'm broke. Not adult broke. Broke broke. I can't feed myself, so all food goes to my kid to make sure she's okay. I can't pay my CC even $10. I can't afford to get more contacts for my eyes. I don't have any close friends. Bills are coming. Can't afford kiddos school shit. Can't afford to literally do anything. The city just decided to make living here even more expensive from water to transit. Plus carbon tax being implemented.

Grandfather died, so my dad's grief is something we are watching. Friend murdered and cops aren't doin squat about that. 

I'm beyond depressed. There hasn't been a day in weeks I haven't woken up in tears, or gone to bed in tears. Tired of being told to ""stop being grumpy"". Fuck off. 

I needed new winter boots as the ones I had were filled with holes and duct taped. Feet got frostbite in - 40. In turn I got 100 bucks for new boots, but felt so guilty, I cried all the way back home.

All programs in this city are filled. I can't even find a ride to the food bank. Even though I think I'm over my times allowed.

Im fed up. I don't know what to do anymore. Having roommates isn't helping either as they are in the same position.

I'm lost. I'm feeling alone. I'm tired of feeling so God damn depressed. I hate it. I FUCKING HATE IT.

I just want to disappear.

Half the time, going g over the stars doesn't seem too bad. But for 3 people, that cannot happen. So I won't. 

Thanks for reading if you bothered. I know I'm nothing compared to a lot. I'm thankful I have a roof for now.",03Jan2018,1
