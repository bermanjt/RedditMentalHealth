1,"I want to apologize in advance I know this is probably hard to read. I'm not very good at writing. 

background 

I'm 20 years old, and live in a small town where there isn't much opportunity. I had just graduated the 5th grade and regretfully changed schools for the start of 6th grade. I wasn't up to date with their curriculum and they were far ahead of the public school I had been attending. I began to be bullied very often at my new school. Up until that point I was an AB student, but it quickly turned into Fs and Ds and really made me fall behind. 

 The school I transferred to was a private Christian school. Everyone in my town knows everyone and I attribute that to them somehow pushing me threw the 7th and 8th grade even tho I was failing. With my word that I would attend the summer program. (No curriculum just activities) 

 After summer I decided I would go to public school to begin the 9th grade. (Highschool) 
At this point I couldn't even do division and I still cannot. It's something I never learned. I became very frustrated and rebellious. I skipped class everyday and payed zero attention in class. I basically cheated my way through high school up until the 12th grade. At the beginning of my twelfth grade year I had a severe health problem  so I got my ged and dropped out my senior year. (I basically guessed on the tests and passed)

  So here I am with my ged and barely any education, not to sound arrogant but I feel I am a pretty intelligent person, I just missed out on the school curriculums. I easily pick up things that interest me, self improvement, psychology, philosophy, politics, war, computers, graphic design, etc.. 
I didn't know what to do so I began to read a lot about all the above subjects and a few more that interest me and now I'm quite knowledgeable in all of the above. 

 90% of the people around me in my town get a job at a factory working 12 hour shifts and drinking their days away when they have time off. I've became quite intelligent on my own but I still know nothing about curriculums and I've tried to teach myself but it's so hard for me to do, I feel like i can't. I sometimes entertain the idea of college but I don't know how that would be possible.  

 It wouldn't be possible to pass my core classes. You can probably tell my writing skills that I wouldn't pass English, I have little to no knowledge in math and I have now been out of school for two years...so now I've already forgot the majority of things that I did learn. 

 I don't really know what I'm asking, but I guess I'm asking for advice. I'm very ambitious and I know that there is more out there for me. I'm one of the few people in my town who have dreams and want to leave this place. I want to become the best possible version of myself and learn everything there is to learn. I want to start my life but I don't know where to start. Id love to find something I'm passionate about. 


Tl;dr
I cheated all the way threw middle and high school I barely know anything about core subjects. I decided to change when it was to late, and now I don't know what to do or where to start. Id love to find my passion.",06Feb2018,0
5,"I've never really considered myself as someone suffering from anxiety but now that I'm significantly older I have started to notice certain things about myself and am able to link them with my past and current personality.

I hate drawing attention to myself. If I see a friend or acquaintance in the distance, there's no way I'm going to call out to them. Even waving is kinda embarrassing. Same can be said for speaking on the phone in trains. I try to keep it down as much as possible. I fumble with my phone too whenever it suddenly rings in public.

Thanks to technology, most of my food ordering is done online. Back then, I would hold the phone in my hand for a good 10 to 15 minutes before I finally dialed the number. Similarly, I pace back and forth many times before knocking on someone's door. If I want to say or ask something, it usually lingers in my mind for a long time before I can muster enough courage to say something. It can be something as simple as ""Hey how was your day?""

Funny thing is I'm not that guy who's outcasted and shit. That being said, I'm not popular either. Still, I consider myself to be bad at social interactions and usually don't make the first move.

I also believe a huge part of why I mumble/speak softly is cause I'm so insecure. I feel like I don't amount to much and I don't think I'm much of a looker. I think I dress decently and have fixed parts of my looks that I hated. Still, I find it really hard to talk to people. Most importantly, I can't maintain eye contact so I make myself and others feel sorta uncomfortable/awkward. I really hate how ridiculously difficult it is for me to say simple things like 'Hello' or 'Happy birthday'. My heart just races every time I try to talk to people. It's no surprise I'm single too. Women would rather a suave guy who can speak well. I, on the other hand, seem preoccupied, uninterested and dull. Truth is, I'm just overthinking a lot which makes it hard for me to speak properly.

I have tried reading self-help books, watched videos and reflect from time to time but I'm still the same. No confidence, insecure and awkward. I tend to sweat easily as well because so much goes through my head at times it makes me illogically nervous. I wish I could stop being so self-conscious. Will this ever end? Doesn't help that my anxiety and being a closet atheist is making my depression worse :/ I'm so tired of wearing myself down with all the 'what ifs'.

Do you think you have anxiety? What are the tell-tale signs? What shitty situations have you been in and what opportunities have you missed cause of it?

P.S: Sorry if this post is long",06Feb2018,3
7," I really like this woman. She was the first person in his family to make me feel welcomed. She was born in 1924. Back then, most women were housewives and the men were head of the house. She climbed her way up the ladder in an insurance company, going from receptionist to someone in charge of a few people. Women were delicate flowers who shouldn't get dirty back then. She played sports with the boys. She had a husband who loved that she was different. He had no issue with her wanting to work in a world where that wasn't common. They watched sports together.

 Right now she's lying comfortably in a bed in a nice apartment in a nice senior home. There's a Portland Blazers poster on the wall that was a gift from her grandson. She has family coming to see her and staying with her. She's 94. She's lived a long happy life. She had 2 daughters and 3 grandkids who all love her.

 I'm happy I met her.",06Feb2018,409
9,"For the past several years I don't really feel like I'm living, just not dying. I'm in college currently but only because I really feel like I SHOULD be. 

I have no real ambitions, low self-esteem and the only things that distract me from the pointlessness of existence are TV and video games. I'm trying to turn myself around by finding something that I enjoy, and want to live to do.  

I enjoy working with my hands, and building, for example, I like origami, and legos (especially Mindstorms). I like to read books ranging from sci-fi, and fantasy, to xianxia/wuxia light novels.

Does anyone have any ideas of things that I could do that could be fun, or tips to help find some sort of meaning?

I haven't had food in a while because I have no appetite at all even though I have bacon and ribs in my fridge. Now I'm just eating shitty junk food and drinking juice because otherwise I wouldn't get the number of calories I need to sustain basic functions. It would be bad if I got too weak to open food packages or open the fridge.

15,"This feels like the right place to post?

I just need to vent. I feel like a dick.

Tldr: my boyfriend tried to surprise me with an impromptu basketball game then 15 mins before we were supposed to leave he said something mean as a joke. Wouldn’t acknowledge that he hurt me, it ended up with me crying and us arguing for a couple hours. 

So if you’re planning on sticking around I’ll go back to last weekend to set up. 

*flashback*
BF has told me he wanted to hangout with me Saturday. Sat rolls around and he lets me know he’s hanging out with his bro during the day while I am at work, alright cool, I’m all about family bonding time. Evening rolls around and I receive no mention of us hanging out so I ask if we’re still on. He replies he’s still hanging out with his bro and some friends. I assume this means we are not hanging out... which I’m ok with, would have been nice to give me a heads up but whatever I’m not trippin out. He then replies with “should be home in a few hours.” Okay so we are hanging out. He tells me to park my car at his house and meet him at a bar twenty mins over and come hang out with his friends and bro. I like his friends, never met the bro, but if that’s what I have to do to see him, alright. 

Let me just add right here he’s about a 45 min drive away from me. And we only hang out about once a week. 

He ends up taking me to some kickback and I spend the next two hours watching boys play beer pong. His friends are cool so it’s not a bad time but I thought we’d have a quieter more personal setting. I let him know this. He seems sorry that he wasn’t able to give me proper quality attention. It’s all fine, I’m not angry just slightly disappointed. 
*end flashback*

This brings us to this last weekend. The surprise. My boyfriend is not a planner. He is a let’s see what happens when we get there-er. So when he told me what the plans were I was ecstatic! My first basketball game! He PLANNED something special! A day outing! Awesome. 15 mins before we leave, I’m questioning my outfit. 

Me: Do I look ok?

Him: Yeah, you look fine. 

Me: ah you have to say that. 

Him: yeah but sometimes I don’t mean it. 

*HOLD UP EXCUSE ME??*

We do rib on each other but this one was kind of low. I told him I thought that was really mean to say and he annoyedly says “it was a joke”. CUE TEARS. Then he’s confused and annoyed “Why are you crying??” Now I’m angry. It escalates. We eventually talk like adults and I’ve now realized how much effort he put in to give me a very special weekend, I did profusely apologize for ruining his efforts of procuring tickets last minute and planning which restaurant to go to and how excited he was to have this experience with me. And we missed it because I couldn’t just put my feelings aside and discuss it at a later time when neither of us were emotionally charged. 

I feel like such a shit. Yeah we made up and we left with a kiss and a hug and reassurance that we are ok for now. But I can tell he’s still really sore about it. He’s been short with his texts and minimal affection. Which I deserve. Just trying to give him his space to cool off. I am also planning a trip across the country as a I’m sorry/Valentine’s Day trip to atone for my actions. 

Just comment something please I’m just- omg I messed up bad. ",06Feb2018,1

18,"It feels like I wake up one day and I can't put on shoes anymore to go to work. Today, no shoes. There's no more shoes, it's not the way your life works anymore, you have to learn to live with a life without shoes. 

As is now that I have no more ""good mornings"" or ""good nights"". No one tells me anymore. I don't have anyone to say it to. I'm single for the first time in my (23) adult life. It's been a ritual every day for years. 

Good morning. Good night. 

It's like my way to sign on and off during the day. My way of reaching out to someone to acknowledge to each other that we're here with each other. 

Good morning. Good night.

But the lack of a good night has been a bit surreal. It's not the end of the world or anything. But it's literally like going out without shoes. It doesn't feel right going out without it. Doesn't feel right going to sleep without acknowledging someone. It's a habit that I didn't realize I would even have to break.

19,"Pretty much what the title says. I don't consider myself someone with any marketable skills. The things that I consider myself to be good at are not things that society needs/wants to move forward, and therefore aren't things that people would want to pay me for.

I like being on the road. The last time I remember being ""happy"" is when I took a 1000 mile motorcycle trip, stopping at towns along the way and only spending a few days there. When I think about it, the ONLY times I am really happy are when I am traveling in some foreign country staying at hostels or on a road trip. Other than that I am miserable.

I'm in college on the IT track. I've had 3 internships and I don't think it's what I want to do. The sound of getting certifications makes me sick. I'd rather off myself than spend the next 45 years slaving away at some company that will have no issue replacing me in an instant. I have no idea what to do, with a year left in school.

Basically all of my interests consume, rather than provide to society. I wish I actually liked coding, or networking, or something that could be useful but all I want to pursue are things that are personal. I chose my major because I thought it will help me make the money I need to do what I want, but the jobs I've had are just not suited for me. Nothing that I am passionate about is useful to the world.",06Feb2018,3
20,"The purpose of this post is to hopefully gain some outsiders perspective on the situation. Okay I'll start with a bit of information:
My parents are from different countries. They married and had me and we lived on my dad's country until I was five. He got sick and died from cancer and my mom and I moved to another country with my maternal family. More specifically, to my grandma's house. So, in the house there were my mom and I, grandma and an aunt which I'll refer to as Aunt X. My family is very catholic.

From that point, my mom had to start working again, so she left me with my grandmother and my aunt. I have vague memories of my childhood.  I started attending a private catholic school, my mom couldn't pick me up, so her sister, Aunt B, would pick me up and take me to her house. I was there everyday with my cousins, which were older than me (the youngest being 6 years older). I've always been considered a weird kid. I was bullied at school and also at aunt B's house. With one of her daughters being specially mean. She would mock me over my looks, my weight and other things, almost daily. On the afternoons, aunt B would drive me and her daughters to grandma's house to get dinner. There I was also treated differently. The bullying cousin would be highly preferred and get special treatment, aunt X and grandma where actually interested in what she had to say. I remember always trying to please them. It didn't work so I just ate with them in silence. Also, aunt B and aunt X got along really well, they used to tell my grandma that I listened to their conversations (which I didn't). Which got me into trouble. I told my mom about the bullying and those things but she never did anything. 

I've struggled all my life with poor self esteem. Also, in my grandma's house, they enforced very strict rules. Partly because of my mom, and partly because of my grandma. I wasn't allowed to watch tv before 5 pm, we didn't have internet, I wasn't allowed to speak when adults were talking, or to tell my opinion of things. As a result, I grew up somewhat secluded and naive, since I was the only kid without an online social life. We also almost never went out, while all the other kids went on vacations or to the movies with their parents. I always felt odd. Many times, I felt that I was being treated unfairly at home, at family events mom would always get mad at something I did. I used to be a very expressive kid, I felt that I had a right to express what I was thinking. That's why everyone was mad at me most of the time. While saying I was ""angry all the time"" or ""that I was ungrateful because my mom always gave me everything I wanted"". I'm very, very confused by this because I don't remember actually getting anything I wanted as a kid. Mom sometimes would bring me candy, toys or clothes that I didn't ask for or didn't like. But I had to wear.

This is another thing, my mom is very controlling.
Things continued this way as I grew up. When I got a little bit older (11-13) my mom made an extra effort to pick me up from school, so I didn't go to aunt B's house anymore. Still, aunt B came to my grandma's house daily, sometimes with her cousins. (I don't like them, specially aunt B). Grandma, aunt X and B started this ""tradition"" to pray the rosary for an hour daily. I hated it but I was forced to participate. I got into a fight with Aunt B when she insulted me and threatened to hit me because I joked with my grandma and she got offended. I don't talk to her since then. I told my mom and she went crying to my grandma for an explanation. Some years later my grandma told me it's my fault her daughters don't talk to each other.

I also started taking a liking to ""emo"" music, later to develop into a liking for metal and hardcore music. I liked dark clothes and many things people label as ""just being a phase"". My family took that to label me as being weird, ""satanic"", ""rebellious"", etc, etc. 
My mother was always controlling, so she got really mad when I put on my music. I had no money so I couldn't dress the way I liked. On the rare occasions that I could buy something, she threatened me to stop driving me to school (which was quite far away) if I kept wearing it. Her threats always worked. She also always told me that ""no one would love me if I dressed that way/liked that stuff/talked that way"", etc. My mom would get really mad if I expressed any opinion that she didn't like. For example: ""I hate doing homework"". And she would tell me to stop using the word ""hate"" because it was a very strong word and I ""didn't understand it"". I've always been treated like I'm incapable or naive. Or ""I find men with beard attractive"" and she would tell me how ""disgusting that was"" and how ""she didn't like it"". She still does that until now. When I expressed myself and she disapproved, she would restore to threats or to ignoring me. 

I also wasn't allowed to go out, the first time I went to a sleepover I had to have my friend's mom talk to her. My mom didn't want that so when the phone call was over she told me that ""I was an embarrassment and that I should apologize to my friend's mother"". I called my friend's mom in tears and told her I was sorry, she then freaked out and told me I didn't do anything wrong. 

I was a pretty isolated kid, I didn't drink or do drugs, I didn't party or go out. I always felt left behind and weird because while my classmates were partying and going out, my family had this control over me. Sometimes later my mom was pretty okay with me having sleepovers with this friend, until my grandma told her that it ""was wrong"", and she stopped letting me. I asked her why and she just told me ""it was wrong"". I didn't understood why. When I went to my friend's we just binge watched movies and ate junk. For that and other stuff, I stopped talking to my grandma and aunt X for two years at least. My mom would rage over that and threaten me so I would talk to them. 

The last straw was when I was 16 I think, maybe older. And she told me that if I didn't talk to them she would ""quit her job and that it would be my fault if she did."" and that we would ""go to live in a one room apartment"". I was always terrified of her threats so I complied of begged but this time I told her to do it, that her choices were not my fault. Then she stopped threatening me a lot. 

The thing is, I always felt weird and isolated. While my cousins of the same age could go out, had cars and could express themselves through their appearance. I was always shamed for my clothing and music tastes, was told I was ""too irresponsible to learn how to drive"" all because I didn't like waking up early in the morning. (I asked and mom told me that was the reason). While those cousins could talk to their parents about their interests. I was always distrusted and treated like a child. Those cousins were allowed to drink at family parties since we were 15. I'm 21 and my mother still gets mad if I want to drink a beer. All of her sisters (my aunts) are accomplices on this, and even my other cousins don't let me drink because of her. 

This was only in my family, but it still makes me feel bad that my friends and boyfriend have been travelling alone, drinking at parties, using drugs, having sex and dressing themselves how they want since their early teens. Everytime I wanted to do something like go to a club or go camping with my friends I would get told it was ""dangerous"". People stopped inviting me to things since I was never allowed to go. 
I grew up thinking many things were dangerous, risky or bad.

When I finished high school I was very tired and wanted to rest, I didn't know which degree I wanted so I tried to take a time for myself. I was planning to get a job in the mean time. I was always discouraged to work because it was ""too hard"" and ""I wouldn't be able to handle it"". Of course, I wasn't allowed to rest, my mother forced me to enter school in a degree I was slightly more interested in, she went to the university and filled the papers I was supposed to fill.  

At 18, I asserted my independence a little bit and stopped asking for permission when going out. I got my ID and got a bunch of piercings I always wanted. My mother went all up into telling me I looked awful, that I would get HIV, cancer, that no one would love me, etc, etc. I dated a guy who made parties every weekend, I always got home safe. One day I wanted to stay over with him so I told my mother I was staying with a friend (the same friend I stayed over at 13). The second time I wanted to stay with the guy I told the same lie and i got caught. The police were called and my mother and two cousins went looking for me into his apartment. 

I felt so embarrassed and sad. 
A while later we broke up for unrelated reasons. 
The next year, when I was 19, I got in an abusive relationship with a controlling partner. By that point, I had given up in trying to dress how I liked and wear my piercings and defy my mother. That guy always told me that my family should accept me for how I was, not how they wanted me to be. So I got courage and started dressing how I wanted again. My mom, of course, didn't like that. Seven months later I broke up with the guy because of the emotional abuse he inflicted on me. 

A little while later I started going out with my now boyfriend, he's kind of a goth and had a troubled childhood. With him I started partying more, drinking more and trying to do all the things I wanted to do. Mom doesn't like him, of course. He gifted me some of his old goth clothes and taught me how to make wire jewerly. I think this relationship is the healthiest I've been in and we get along quite well. While we don't drink a lot anymore and i do quite well in school, mom is still mad. Once in a month bf and I stay at an hotel and I don't get home. Mom freaks and doesn't sleep, she calls me all night and sends awful texts about how I don't respect myself or her and that I have no self control and that I'm irresponsible. Aunt X and grandma get mad too, sometimes they reprimand me but now they just verbally ignore me.
They also seem to want my boyfriend to tell me what to do. Another cousin who is a lot older always tells me that my bf should tell me to get home early and if he doesn't he doesn't care about me. My bf tells me that staying together all night is a mutual choice and that he won't tell me what to do, it conflicts me.

I almost finish school, bf and I are quite happy, I don't drink a lot or do drugs and I'm still finding out who I am. I have told my mom countless times that my childhood was hard, and that I always felt that I couldn't express myself and that I had no control over anything. She constantly tells me to just ""get over it"", that it's in the past and that I should move on. Other times she acts like a victim and tells me that she knows I think she's a shitty mother (I have told her that over the years). I've been cruel to her, verbally, I know. But she also has. So I don't know what she bitchs about.
 Also, she constantly tells me that my perception is wrong or that I have it all wrong. That I remember things differently, etc etc.

The thing is, I wanna know if she's right. I wanna know if I'm an entitled ungrateful brat, and if my family was right treating me that way. Or if I'm somehow in the right and I was treated unfairly. Please help.

It definitely was a specific applicable comment and not an accident like a friend tried to brush it off as. He also blocked me. I dont understand why, he unfriended me off everything months ago but i guess something happened yesterday that he felt the need to reread our conversation and then block me. 

I highly doubt any of our mutual friends has even said anything about me to him. The only person i could imagine saying anything would be a manipulative bitch who has a victim complex a mile wide. 

I dont think i did anything either. I dont talk to him when we’re at parties, i dont even interact with his comments on facebook (while he will follow my comment threads and ‚like‘ everyones comments but mine). Hell, recently he made a joke in a comment thread i was in and i thought maybe he was getting over the past. But i guess not. 

And because of him i feel like our mutual friends will slowly start leaving me out. One already has (largely because of the afformentioned manipulative bitch). I tried voicing this before but they just brush it off as me being paranoid but in reality i havent exactly been invited out to anything in a long while (ive even been the one to suggest going out but they always say no). 

Im just really tired of all this. I want him to just grow up and move on from this. Not make some passive aggressive  side-eye. Im already depressed and angry about being rejected by one guy and partially ignored by another. I dont need this. I dont need to feel like im lying or the bad guy.

30,"Hey. So me and this girl had been together officially for 8 months. (I say official because we've been together for 2 years but we didn't have the proper relationship status). Anywayy, the past couple months we were having some issues where she had been losing spark and she had no idea why. She felt horrible for it and wanted to make it work. I've been trying so hard to make it work and so has she but she struggles to get feelings back. We've been long distance suddenly for a little while because of things that came up. I believe this is the reason due to her loss of spark and so does she. I also don't fault that, LDR's are hard. Although short, still tough. Losing attraction to someone when you can't physically see them is very likely.

She goes out to poolbars with her brother and a few of their friends fairly often. I hate when she does this. I hate when she drinks. Before we got together she got drunk to the point of making a regretful decision and having sex with a random guy in a park which was when she first lost her virginity. She hated herself for it and this is what always made me cautious about going in to a relationship with her, uncontrollable when drinking. For the longest time she'd monitor her drinking and was fine. I knew there was multiple guys in the group that wanted to fuck her. I wasn't capable of being there to go out with her or anything. They all knew we were together though.

2 days ago she went out again. Told me she'd be back around 2am. She messaged me at around 7 and I asked what she got up to, she said just chilling and pool. Sounded rather fishy to me. Turned out the friend I ""shouldn't worry about"" took her to her house and they ""talked, messed about and blown him for 3 hours"". She said it wasn't an actual 3 hours of blowing, more like 20 minutes. Guy couldn't cum as he has an issue with that and can only cum PIV. She denied sex as that was her ""limit"". During the conversation I stayed civil to atleast get myself some closure. She tells me she doesn't know why but she doesn't regret it.

She didn't enjoy the eating/fingering (Lastest a very short time) but did enjoy blowing). They just kissed/talked for 3 hours with 20 minutes of blowing. I know she's not hiding anything further. She has always been honest and she has nothing to hide now as we're over. I'm just not sure where to go with this. I love this girl and I'd love to be with her. (This will not happen. I will not put myself through that toxicness and have it occur again, I am aware being with her would be completely idiotic and I've already made sure that we will never be getting back together).

I do love her in my life though, everything we had was perfect up until the distance causing issues. No excuse though, cheating is cheating. 2 years ago we used to be FWB. It was the peak of our relationship but we decided to push it in to an actual relationship. That was obviously a mistake as feelings were then gained and now crushed. I'd enjoy going back to being FWB with her as I don't want her completely out my life but that's probably the best thing to do? I'm really not sure, I've never went through something like this before. I also don't know how that would be initiated.

Another problem is we're both on a trip to Amsterdam in 10 days... It can't be cancelled and I'm struggling to know what to do about that. I want to say again. I am not with her or considering staying with her. I do love her. I wish none of this ever happened but it is what it is. I'm dealing with it ""well"". I've felt sick for the past 5 hours or so but I've remained calm with short bursts of anger. I did kind of prepare myself for this though so it isn't as hard hitting as it would be.

I know this isn't really a question but I just don't know what to do. A lot of people recommend no contact but I don't know if that's something I can bring myself to do. We used to be amazing together and had parts of our future planned and she threw it all away. She ""still loves me, just not in the same way I love her"". If you have any questions or anything just let me know. Won't be sleeping for a while!",06Feb2018,5

The short of it is I found my wifes Tinder account and she updated it yesterday (5 Feb 2018). :'(

I want to search what account, servers, websites, etc on the web that her emails are associated with.

I've tried a ton of reverse whois searches, but that came up with nothing. I'm most likely hiring a PI to track and follow her to see if I catch her in the act, but I want to find out as much as I can first since a PI is so expensive. The terrible thing is we have two kids.

God I can't stop crying.

Can any one help me dig into this more or do you know someone who can?

44," IDK what's going through her mind. Why she acts mad at me. She said she wasn't feeling like a friend no more after I helped her through a bad domestic situation with her room mate. She became homeless for a month. Luckily a friend stepped in and let her stay. I helped her move her things  to storage and drove her places and move them to her new place.

 A week later she wants to part ways. Pointed out that I was being awkward and made her feel uncomfortable. If I was, it was because a girl I knew for a while ghosted on me. So I was depressed. She asked me not to hold it against  her as  she wasn't gonna hold anything against me. So for the next few months I completely ignored her.

 She got upset when I tried to talk to her. I stepped back. Now everytime I see her I can't even look at her. And it's killing me. A friend told me that she did feel bad for falling out. 


 IDK if she thinks I was holding a grudge so she feels she has to do the same.

46,"♩ *I said they always got me working, got me working all day long*. ♩ 

Let's start by expanding on a status I posted earlier regarding your “work ethic.”

I find it funny that there are terms so duplicitous in their ability to sound and function explicitly while retaining a world's worth of a hidden underbelly. Don't we all know what is meant by work ethic? It's how hard you're willing to work in order to achieve your ends. It's the extent to which you push your body and mind. It's the amount of respect you carry for yourself and those who are also putting in the time. It's as striking an entire code of ethics as it is common parlance regarding something we're all expected to do in order to earn our place in society.

Given my complicated relationship to work, I'm frankly aghast I haven't explored this in great detail already. If, and you might as well for this digression, you take the above paragraph as more or less true regarding our conception of work ethic, there seems to be a gigantic story involved with how we get there. Rarely does it seem people are keen to discuss “ethics” at all until they're nodding along at the punishments bestowed from cops or a judge on TV, but one can only strike the bell of our cultural folly once again and move on.

Personally, I used to work a lot. I say that after my last 6 months of working primarily 11+ hour days and taking 5 or 6 off a month, usually only because my car died. Before that I had 3 jobs I worked most of the day and night on. Before that was 2 years of needing to stay basically sedentary to refrain from screwing up my blood work to get into drug studies. I've experienced prolonged periods of both extremes. I tend to function in extremes for reasons I don't have the best explanation of. Increasingly, I feel the imposed conditions of my experience have taught me lessons you only get from suffering through them. Patience becomes a virtue when the alternative is to be driven mad. A naive full-throttle go-getter spirit is not an endless well of energy.

My ideas about work came from stories about my grandparents and seeing what my dad has been through iron-working. Mind you, it wasn't until relatively recently that my stories and molding got to interact with what I was learning about the world and the diminishing power of the dollar. If my grandparents could work 9-5 closer to home and raise four kids in a nice house in a safe neighborhood, my parents had to commute an hour away, one gone a good portion of when I was younger, in a modest house in a neighborhood on the verge of white-flight. My brother an I either lived with roommates, or still do, or had to move back home, only in our late 20s flirting with distorted versions of the kinds of things a newbie family in the 60s or 70s might get right out of high school, and definitely with a degree.

As the times changed, as the pressures became varied and the dialogue about how to understand it flooded from the internet, we never took the time to examine where we were going or why. We never bothered to ask anymore what “the good life” or what “middle class” stood for. We let the people born into wealth scheme to keep it from “trickling down.” We adopted self-destructive narratives of self-sufficiency. I'm telling you, read the comments on facebook under plans for a universal basic income or articles about the minimum wage. Without fail you'll get the nastiest judgmental, “WELL WHY SHOULD *I PAY* FOR *YOU* FOR ANY REASON!?” Somewhere along the way we forgot that we're beholden and rely on each other. More than that, we built up an entirely new working ethos that appears to be aimed at destroying even the memory of empathy.

If there's anything my work ethic has taught me, it's that I'm not shit. It truly is worth mentioning, a lot, that you can work yourself to literal death or passed out exhaustion, and you can still live in poverty. You can still go hungry. You can humble yourself and take the “lowest of the low” positions, you can take 3 of them, and people will balk and call you lazy and entitled and smug as you explain to them why freezing your account over back taxes might as well drive you to suicide. The situation is **dark**. But the only dialogue you tend to hear is the most ridiculous shit about the stock market or one-off company raising wages while pretending they're not laying off thousands or destroying the environment.

Consider, I still feel guilty about taking days off. I wait until several points on my body are throbbing and I've gained an extra 10 pounds before I think it's okay for me to cook for myself for a week and take a walk on the climate change induced spring day in February. That's a bad work ethic. I don't want to die of a heart attack delivering idiot children their food.  I didn't want the majority of my memories from my last year as a 20-something to be of TV shows I watched while driving my car.

I posted an article this morning about how neoliberal ideas presenting “gig economy” jobs as a “lifestyle choice” are robbing people of the ability to recognize the power of organizing and being members of their society when they're not working. I've never felt so understood. I genuinely can't remember the last time I was a person. I don't recall when I was doing something fun or immersive for me, and not as a desperate escape to masquerade as someone more free than he feels. That scares me. I'm not making this sacrifice for kids. I'm not seeing some humanitarian effort manifest at the end of each exhausted day. I'm trying to stem the bleeding of payments set up in exploitative interest schemes for my tiny house garage. I'm trying to break even with back taxes. I'm trying to keep my car running. I'm trying to start more work with entrepreneurial gigs I hope can net equal or more without me needing to spend every waking hour doing them.

Every dollar that stems the tied of the poverty plague speaks to what the land represents. Really, truly, by the numbers, even if I'm throwing the IRS $95 a month to leave me alone, I'll be able to be as “bill free” as you can reasonably hope to be in life. And for all of the hell that it took to get there, I'm afraid it's going to feel like a cheap imitation. I'm still going to be doing things alone. I'm still going to have to circle round and round or make bets in trying to work out something that grows large enough to compensate for the ongoing cultural decay. I'm still going to cross my fingers I can mentally exhaust myself enough to mock my anxiety to death in order to get back into studies, after I stick to salads and a treadmill for a month. I'm still going to be obligated to the cultural work ethic that keeps me as tied down as everybody feels and despotically praises.

Right now was when I was supposed to be “living it up.” I was supposed to take my brain and work ethic to the top of something and revel in the glory. What am I doing repairing a car every month and delivering food 11 hours a day? It's the incidental “lifestyle choice” I'm making to try and put out fires I never started in the most efficient way. It's a job that at least allows me the option to dip into protecting my mental health verses forcing me to sit through a 6 hour presentation on how to organize cans. It doesn't promise the world and then expect free labor. It's a new kind of exploitation. It's an algorithm that has a number for your psychological breaking point. You see, the ethic evolves to meet the pathology of the times.

The difficult part is feeling stuck either way. I like feeling like I can progress on my house. The immediacy of my, in some form or another, perpetually suffered moment is pressing. When I can black out and wake up to a dollar amount high enough to accomplish something, it's a nice higher ride in a period of otherwise self-immolating wretchedness. I realized that I've been trying to trick my brain into tying what I'm doing that day to something happening on the land. I'll try to plan for when he's going to pick up supplies before I leave, so that while I'm working I can connect in real time each dropped off order with a pipe installed or hammered nail. If I take time off, what am I doing? Hanging out and talking with you? Seeing a movie by myself? Spending too much on restaurant food? I don't have a life any way you slice it. Explicitly, I don't have a reason to live that isn't on credit. To the extent I believe my own hype about what I can accomplish or who I want to be for the people in my life I care about is it.

In being forced to sit and save with studies, I started to feel a certain sensibility take hold that speaks to what I'm feeling now. It's summed up in the phrase, “It's all part of the plan.” I had to start couching the “shit years” in a larger context of the story of my life. When a comedian gets on Colbert and exclaims, “Do you have any idea how long it took to get here? 25 years! I've been doing comedy.” What's 2 years of being poked and prodded and a year delivering food in the face of that? What's a few extra pounds and assorted pains if you spend 30-31 actually going to the gym consistently and eating better? You'll be able to afford it, after all. Why am I stressed out I can only drum so fast and barely play my first scale on a trumpet? A good weekend's wages will pay for lessons for a year. “The moment” of your suffered circumstances becomes next level compelling, and the boss battle at the end is your capacity to accept it.

That's perhaps a funny and horrendously sad thing as well. I can feel myself accepting it. I don't work as often or hard as I do because I accept anything less than all of the shit I'll need to drag into the future I desire. What I struggle with is knowing what any form of balance looks like. Again, I can see friends taking off on trips or seeing shows, certainly having saved up during the same months I have. Is it back to the grind when they return? Does it ever really get “better” or does the shit just stir in more or less shitty configurations? If I saw all the shows I wanted and took all the trips I flirted with, I might not have my land. Were they worth the sacrifice if every other week from 31-32 I can travel nearly anywhere in the world? My standards, my comfort levels, and my goals are apparently fundamentally different. The only people I engage with at length about them have the ignorance and arrogance to disregard waking up an hour early to even bother discussing making something work.

47,"As a man who grew up in American culture, sex seemed like this perpetual prize that you'd never tire to strive for. All the plucky movies from the 80s to 90s would leave you to believe that unless you're rich or famous, a man would never get to have enough sex. 


I started having sex at 17. But I'm a serial monogomist. At 20, I got into a 7 year relationship, only having sex with her. After the end of that relationship, I went on a run of sex with multiple women, not tied down to a relationship. To end the year, I ended up in a relationship with someone that wants sex, perhaps, more than me. 


One thing, I think I've discovered is that there *is* enough sex. I think I finally reached a maturity level where more marginal sex with more marginal partners doesn't yield any more return. The thought of more sex with more partners almost seems like a chore. This is remarkable to me as I remember being that 17 year old who constantly thought about the chance to find someone to have sex with. 


I also think, I've learned what women learn very early. That once sex is pretty freely available to you, the appeal of it erodes to a point approaching zero. Just because you *can* have sex doesn't mean you *want* to. 


For some this is a pretty obvious post. But for me, this was a revelation as there seems to be a physical inflection point where sex loses its marginal appeal.",06Feb2018,19
48,"It still seems that, in this day in age, male victims of abuse or sexual harassment aren't taken as seriously as they should be.  It goes without saying that abuse/harassment against anyone (male or female) is a serious crime and should be treated as such.  But I've noticed that a lot of the sitcoms and movies we watch, we treat female on male abuse as comedy.  Most of the time, it's verbal abuse, but occasionally you'll see TV wives/girlfriends hitting their partners as a form of comedy.  It's always portrayed in a playful manner where the male isn't actually in danger or being hurt, but I think it's definitely sending the wrong message.  There seems to be a large number of people who have taken that message seriously and just don't believe that a female could seriously endanger a male in any way.

I should also add that it is common to say acts of male on male acts of comedy violence as well as female on female.  I just can't think of many examples of a male abusing a female in a comedic manner (physically or verbally).",06Feb2018,11

58,"So he lives with his grandparents, and as far as I know his grandma barely cleans. They have two dogs who both have obvious skin issues as they're constantly itching, and from what I can smell and what he's told me, they don't get bathed that frequently. 


So that alone is enough to disgust me as I come from a house with an extreme clean freak mentality. However, about a month ago he complained to me that he felt like he was getting bit around his ankles at night and when I told him he needs to change his sheets (he couldn't tell me the last time he washed them) and call an exterminator and he kind of just brushed it off. He thinks changing the sheets is enough, even though he really only did it once. 


Today he was at school and his grandparents are on vacation so I figured I'd go over and clean up some to surprise him so he didn't have to do it when he got home. I washed the pile of dishes he's let accumulate over a few days and dried them, cleaned the counters, reorganized his room, and then did two loads of laundry. 


While I was waiting for the dryer to go off I went up to his room to lay on his bed and watch a film for school. I glance down at one point to see a small yellow bug running across the mattress, and then I see one on my jacket and arm. Cue disgusted spazzy freak out session. I ran downstairs and stripped my clothes off and shook them out, and then ran home and chucked them in the washing machine and hopped in the shower. But like, now I'm thinking about all the times I laid in his bed and those bugs were probably crawling all over me and I've probably infested my own house. And he obviously knew he had something.

Hi, I'm 18/M and I need help. I don't know what's wrong with me. I posted this here because I don't know where else to talk about this if anyone can link me somewhere I will post there too.

I'm not talking mental issues I'm talking real physical illness that has been tearing my life apart over the last month.

In the first week of January I had what I thought was the flu- cold sweats, fever, being really hot then a second later freezing, and was nauseous. These are really the only symptoms I experienced. Oh, and I also had a cough. Along with that I started to have sleeping problems, not getting to sleep after hours of laying in bed and some nights not getting sleep at all. (Which I saw a doctor about and he prescribed L-Tryptophan)

The last 3 weeks of January I visited the ER 5-6 times (being seen by a doctor 4 of the times). The first time I went there was about a week after the first symptoms(flu) started. I went there because my chest felt painful and tight, I felt I could not breathe, and overall I felt just realllly strange, state of mind speaking. I never ended up getting seen because after awhile of waiting I ended up feeling not as terrible as I was, and thought that it could have been a reaction to antibiotics that I started that day(Azithromycin), so I went home. The next morning I still had chest pain, and felt just kind of- off. Albeit not as much as the previous day. I shrug it off. 

Exactly one week later I am no longer suffering from the 'flu' however the same thing happens. Except this time it is much, much worse. Chest pain is through the roof, I can feel my heart beating out of my chest, am barely able to breathe. This time I am taken into the hospital and triaged immediately. My immediate results were bp 50/40 and 50bpm. A few seconds later my heart rate skyrockets to 180bpm at which point the triage nurse immediately does an EKG on my heart and places me into the ICU. My heart rate stayed around 180bpm and never dropped below 150 for well over an hour. I am given drugs to slow my heart rate as well as the doctor trying different techniques(lifting my legs high, making me blow hard into something) to slow it and over a long night slowly and eventually my heart rate comes down to ~110 at which point I have another EKG, and am deemed safe to leave the hospital. This experience was almost traumatizing.

The next morning I had constant chest pain, however this chest pain wasn't in one spot. It moved around my chest, and at any given time it could be on my lower left rib cage, upper right chest, in the middle, or anywhere in between. It also wasn't sharp, it was dull and achey in nature. A 4/10 in intensity of pain. Accompanying this was difficulty to breathe.

The symptoms don't go away and we return a week later, put on most-urgent, and seen within the hour. 

I am given two naproxen(unsure what doseage), have my blood taken, given a chest X-ray, an EKG, and an ultrasound of my heart to check for fluid around it. 

I wait for two hours for results and everything comes up as looking perfect. I notice the naproxen seemed to have stopped my symptoms and mention it to the doctor- she prescribes naproxen and tells me she believes it may just be an inflamed chest wall.

Two days later I am experiencing chest pain and I am trying to go to sleep and notice my heart rate is unusually fast and hard. I try to ignore it thinking I am worrying for no reason however after laying in bed for 4 hours and seeing no change in heart rate or ability to sleep I head to the hospital at 4am.

Once again I am given an ECG, fine, heart rate is in the 80s and everything looks good but I am placed in a room to be seen. I am kept overnight for monitoring. After 2-3 hours of sitting there they have done an ecg and drawn blood work, and I figure this was going to be another pointless visit when I feel a sudden numbness and cramp that shoots down the inside of my arm. I thought I hit a nerve so I didn't think much. Happens again a few seconds later, and I decide to look at the heart rate monitor and notice that when it happens the trace on the screen looks like a heart beat but is sporadic/fuzzy. Hard to explain but I knew something was wrong so I called for a nurse. By the time they got in my heart rate was up to 130 and climbing fast. They run to get an ekg machine which only took seconds and when they got back my heart rate was 160 but it started dropping before they could do the test and by the time the test was done I was sitting in the low 90s. 

My heart rate throughout the rest of the night would sit in the 90s but very often raise to 120-130 and go back down. If I yawned it raised, if I breathed deep it raised, if I moved it raised. Needless to say I layed in the hospital bed motionless trying to breathe as shallow as I can and stopping every yawn to try to stop my heart rate from climbing as much as possible. 

Eventually they ask for a urine sample and at around 11am I leave the hospital as every test came back perfect and my doctor suggested I stop taking the tryptophan to see if my condition improves.

I go back again literally 12 hours later because my condition hadn't improved and I was once again feeling really bad and I was told that I should go back and get an ecg if that is the case. This nurse is arrogant and doesn't give me one, after waiting hours I get into a room(they don't hook me up to anything) and before the doctor can come in I feel the arm pain thing again and notify the doctor (because I am worried- as they don't have me on a heart monitor). He comes in, we talk about my symptoms, he gives me a heart ultrasound, tells me it's anxiety and then says I can leave. (Hands down the worst experience in a hospital- but anyway.)

**This is what is most important to me right now**

3 days pass, I don't have constant chest pain anymore. Possibly fixed by not taking tryptophan and I notice my heart rate hasn't been unusually high or pounding or anything. A sigh of relief. 

I wake up the next morning to a ringing in my left ear, and my left leg feeling sharp cramp-like pain in the inner back side of my calf. Also notice that when I touch the left side of my face there is a lasting sensation(only way I can explain it) for 5-10 seconds. I think nothing of it and most of it subsides after an hour.

The rest of the day my left ear rings on and off and I experience the same cramp-like pain in other specific parts of my body on both sides, however on and off. It seems to only effect one spot at a time, and happens intermittent. 

I book an appointment with my doctor and see him a few days later, over this time I notice the ringing in my ear is more often, and the pain on my body is more often however I notice no chest pain like before, just the new pain that happens in various places, which can sometimes be my chest. I notice that I have a heavy chest when laying down, I notice that I have had headaches the past few days(this could just be from caffeine withdrawal), and I notice I have been nauseous.

Every single symptom is intermittent and can be with or without the other ones.

I mention to my doctor my ringing ear, he checks it out and says it looks fine, I mention my nauseousness and headaches and that whenever I take anti-inflammatories they seem to help with all symptoms. He tells me to wait the few days for a heart monitor and take Advil as needed since it helps. 

Since that visit the pain has remained the same, I have learned the specific locations of where it occurs. My ringing in the ear has spread to both ears- and it can hurt, my headaches have disappeared, I have nausea and stomach pain.

**Where I am right now**

I get a heart monitor in two days, however I feel that is not gonna give me any results as I don't think this is a heart problem anymore.

Today, I left school because the ringing in both my ears suddenly got overwhelmingly loud to the point I couldn't hear people in the class, accompanying this I immediately felt like I was going to pass out and also felt more nauseous than I have ever felt but didn't throw up. 

I have laid in my bed since then and am writing this. The ringing is just my left one right now but it can be both, and it can be quiet or become very loud. Honestly I would rather be deaf than experience this. 

**My Symptoms as of right now**

The only symptoms I experience is pain in certain parts of my body one at a time intermittently. 

Almost constant unbearable ringing in mostly my left but occasionally both(for some reason never just my right) and occasionally pain like a quick earache that lasts a few seconds.

And occasionally feeling nauseous and having stomach pains. 

**TLDR

My heart has been very inconsistent, have had chest pain and shortness of breath that lasted weeks. Those symptoms subsided and now I experience intermittent pain in certain parts of my body, an almost constant ringing in one or both of my ears which can accompany pain, occasional nausea, and feeling like I'm not 'all there' like I'm not sober even though I am. **

Any help is appreciated as I have no idea what to do.

63,"I never tell this story. Not to anybody. I haven't even told Hannah, who inspired it. Not to any friends. So I'm telling it here.

I am a 22 year old geek. 

Last year I was a 21 year old, glasses-wearing geek who was a senior in college with nearly a 4.0 GPA. And I'm still (blush) admittedly a virgin. I'm only about 5'7, a ""studies-while-eating Doritos"" belly on an otherwise normal frame.

I told my friend Hannah about how I like to wake up very early on some days and head to the local nature preserve before class. I'm always alone, and it's beautiful.

She told me that her and her boyfriend used to go, and sometimes, she would strip to the nude. 

My eyes bulged. She giggled and said it was not sexual at all. It allowed her to be ""one with nature"".

She said ""You should try it sometime, if you ever got the balls. Literally haha"".

Yeah right. I never even take my shirt off at the beach.

Then, one Tuesday morning at 7:00 am on a bright, sunny, only slightly brisk autumn Tuesday morning...I got the itch.

I don't EVER do anything out of character. Why not just try it out? Nobody will ever know. 

I actually undressed. I took off my heavy boots and long socks. My sweater. My pants. My undershirt.

There I was, shivering (it wasn't THAT cold, just a tad chilly, but the nerves got to me) in nothing but my light blue boxers.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and slid them down and kicked them off into the pile.

Now, clad in only my glasses and as bare as a newborn baby, I cupped my package with my hands, and I timidly walked towards the lake, about 50 yards from where I left my clothes, and I looked up at the gorgeous view.

The trees. The mountains. The beautiful, clear, blue lake.

Without even thinking, I placed my hands at my sides.

And there I was. Martin the virgin geek.

Naked.

Buck naked, in fact.

More naked than the trees, which were ""clothed"" in leaves.

More naked than Adam in the Garden of Eden, who at least had a fig leaf.

I was exposed. Not just physically, but exposed to new excitement and beauty.

Inspired, I even walked around the entire lake, as naked as the day I was born.

My round, bare belly shaking. My white-as-a-ghost ""bubble butt"" that Hannah would also make me blush over that she said I was always ""hiding"" under my nerdy khakis jiggling behind me. And my small package (hey, it's a throwaway!) bobbing in the brisk air.

I walked around the entire lake. 

The crisp breeze occasionally startling me by caressing my bare butt. The tickle of a few flowers on my belly and package as I walked. The feel of the fresh grass through my bare feet as I walked.

I truly was one with nature.

Then I returned...and everything was gone.

My clothes. My backpack. My wallet. My money. My credit cards. My ID!!!

Suddenly, I went from a newly-confident naturist to a butt-ass naked and shivering geek boy, timidly jogging/tip-toeing behind a tree for cover.

Now I was hiding my body shamefully from behind a tree, nervously poking my head out from behind it, eyes darting back and forth, looking for the thief who stripped me somehow even more naked than I already was. I could feel my big, bare, white butt behind me shaking even with that subtle movement.

Now I cringed  defenselessly when the stiff, cold breeze attacked my bald, hairless butt-cheeks behind me.

There I was. I had nothing on my body except the smattering of hair on my chest, stomach, arms and legs. And my (blush) pubic hair.

Reduced to being protected only by my own body hair like an animal.

At one point, shielding myself behind the large oak tree, in a futile attempt to reason with my robber who obvoiusly was most likely long gone, I even managed to lower myself to poke my head out and squeak out:

""If you're out there, can I please have my clothes back? Can you please give me back my underwear at least? I'm---I'm NAKED!""

After staying there in a panic for 10 minutes, I knew what my only humiliating option was.

I took off running, butt-naked, through the bright, sunny woods. More like a slightly advanced jog, because I couldn't risk my glasses falling off.

I was now robbed not just of my possessions and clothing, but of my dignity.

Wearing nothing but the glasses and a pink blush on my face. My small penis and balls flapping freely for the world to see. And my goodness, my bare butt must have been a sight behind me.

Along the way, I had to dart behind trees for cover at the very slightest sound.

For a few minutes, I had to hide in the bushes like a scared, exposed bunny as about 5 college kids (including one absolutely, positively gorgeous girl) stopped on a trail to talk, with no idea that my shivering, naked spectacle was hidden just about 30 feet away.

I then made a final break for the ranger station, hearing a 40+ year old female camper yell ""Oh baby, nice ASS!!!"" as I tried to pathetically cover my butt-crack with one hand, palm outwards behind me.

I finally made it to a park ranger, who laughed his ass off, asked me why I didn't stay out there and get a tan, and eventually got me a ride home wearing a towel around my waist and a blanket around my shoulders, where my giggling landlady let me inside after I had to tell her what happened.

Thanks for the tip, Hannah.

I sure got one with nature, alright.

Should I tell her, or should I expect some teasing if I do? If it were you, are you male or female, and what kind of teasing would I expect from you? What are a few things you would say to make me blush over it?",06Feb2018,0
