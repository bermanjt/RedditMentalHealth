2,"I’ve known this guy for around 5 years now, this only started happening within the last 2 years. For some background info we go to a very competitive high school, I’m white and he’s Asian. He is better than me at school, especially in math and science. 

Basically he started verbally attacking me pretty much everyday about school, usually about how dumb I am for not taking advanced math/science courses, or about how I am supposedly bad at video games. He’ll also make fun of me for being white. Pretty much every day now he’ll weave any of these into the conversation. 

Playing fortnite? “Dragonlionthing you suck lmao 0 kills buy a pc” or he’ll rant about how shitty my Xbox is and how trash console players are (not to mention bringing up how his PC costed $2000). 

At school? You know he’d love to talk about how my 4.00 gpa is soooo bad compared to his 4.2 or how I’m taking geometry instead of algebra 2.  

Then there’s how he teases about me being white. This one is less common but makes me the most mad. We both take the same chinese class (which is funny considering his parents are Chinese immigrants and he supposedly grew up speaking Chinese, while I have British parents who speak only English) and he’ll always say the teacher is nicer to me/easier on me because I’m white. Probably just mad that my grade is higher than him in it. Or if I go to any Asian restaurant he has to mention how it wasn’t *really* Asian because he can’t comprehend “a white person like you (me) enjoying *real* Asian things”. I went to a pho place last week and sent a picture of it to a group chat with him in it. He immediately started talking about how this isn’t real pho because there’s... broccoli in it. Fucking broccoli. A Vietnamese friend in the group chat told him broccoli is normal in pho and he shut up then, but he still rants about how the boba store or Chinese restaurant  near my house sucks “because it’s ran by whites”.

So many people tell me to drop him and how I shouldn’t be friends with him but he’s the only person I can play video games with and I feel like I’d just overall be lonely if I fell out with him.",07Dec2018,1

4,"I keep asking that to myself. 
I keep reminding myself that I'm tired of being in my comfortable bubble.
That I have few ties here now, so it is easy to let go.

But I don't know if it's worth bursting that bubble.

I know if I can't grow as a person here, I have too many bad memories and too many regrets.
I feel that I do not belong.
So I need go somewhere, to be with someone. 

But I don't know if I'm worth it.

These feelings come and go, like a vicious cycle.
I'll be comfortable with the busyness and banality.
And then I'll long for change, for happiness and contentment.

I don't want to waste anymore of my life.

I would risk it all. 
But I keep doubting myself.
How much would you risk?",07Dec2018,1
5,"So i have some anger issues, and now i'm being kicked out of the one stable place in my life. i'm neutral at best with most of my family, and the extended family i do get along with are 10 hours away, and in a secluded area so i can't see them very often. my sleep schedule is fucked (go to sleep at 4am, wake up at 12 noon), and i can't remember the last time i've hugged somebody. i had a worrying moment walking home yesterday where my mind went blank and i just felt like i wasn't in control of myself, and i was only operating on muscle memory. i just need to vent this somewhere and i can't think of a good way to end this so bye",07Dec2018,1
6,"Lately I’ve been drinking more than usual. Perhaps the last month or two. I’ve noticed that I just like being buzzed.  But I hate being drunk. That whole feeling of being wobbly and then a cloudy memory is stupid. I rarely drink that much. Maybe once a month.  Historically I’ve just smoked weed. I still smoke weed. I really like being high and I’m functional. I’ve smoked for the last 20 years. But it makes my sinuses congested and I HATE that more than I hate drinking. I hate drinking because of the calories (I drink liquor, not beer) and because of my somewhat rapid tolerance increase. 

I know I have the power to stop. But when I get bored at home, eh, I want to get that buzz. I still don’t get drunk. But I love that lightened feeling. 

All that said, I don’t want to drink any more. I need to figure out how to keep my sinuses clear so I can just smoke instead. ",07Dec2018,1

8,"Hello! So this morning I woke up to hear my college room mate freaking out in my group chat on Snapchat with friends from my dorm building. They received an anonymous call from our group chat that sounded weird, and displayed no name. They were talking about what happened, and by the time I woke up, the weird call ended leaving only my friends on the call. This happened at around 11:30 MDT. My room mate was simply studying for an exam when he saw the chat calling, which is interesting considering it would typically show a specific username from the chat calling. The person calling did not display a username, and resembled a robocall type voice talking about birth control. I went through the chat to see if I could find any usernames, but it just showed that everyone joined the chat to listen in and that no one from our group initiated a call.

10,"I’m stressed about so many things man.

1- school, I keep getting my tests back and they’re never above 65 and i know I could try harder if I put my mind to it but I can’t bc I’m stressed and life is just so draining.

2- I keep thinking my friends don’t like me and that I’m annoying but then people go on and call me their best friend and I just get so confused bc if they were my best friend they’d actually listen to my problems 

3- My parents fight and it’s never serious to the point they abuse eachother but my dad doesn’t have much respect for my mom sometimes and it makes me sad bc she becomes sad and god lets not start about money they always talk about money and it makes me feel bad bc I consume so much of their money with my school fees, clothes, shoes, electricity, and food like if I wasn’t here my parents would be able to afford much more stuff.

4- I have this weird stress over my looks and it’s the most draining thing in life like I hear from my friends I’m pretty, beautiful and sh*t but I don’t feel that way like I used to have such a good body but I stopped working out for a month and everything just failed on me and when I continuously work out now everything still looks ugly to me ESPECIALLY my nose it looks like a birds beak but a small one and I feel like if I didn’t have this ugly nose ppl would like me more.

13,"Usually, music critics and fans themselves dismiss early AC/DC and run straight to put two albums as their best, a description of AC/DC at the peak of their career and music legacy: Highway To Hell (1979) and Back In Black (1980). Me? Ha—I love those albums, but there is an underrated and unjustly ignored album from Bon Scott's era (1974-1980) which puts those previously mentioned AC/DC classics to the ground: Powerage.

&amp;#x200B;

Released in 1978, AC/DC's fifth studio album Powerage rocked everybody's socks off with a powerful bluesy-hard rock amalgam sound. Bon Scott's electrifying vocals, Angus Young's crazy god-like lead guitar, Malcolm Young's solid rhythm guitar, Cliff William's debut album as the bass player, and at last (but not least) Phil Rudd's perfect groove. It was with this album where AC/DC's classic and most memorable line up was born. Oh, but that's not all. The track list is just perfect. Raw-bluesy energetic songs that you cannot get bored of.

&amp;#x200B;

Music is art, and art is subjective. That is the fun part. Personally, I feel that all the tracks from the album listened in listing order tell a story about the life of a  broke twenty-something rock musician that is trying to find his place at the '70's music business, describing all that he has been going through on this not-so-joyful ""ride"" with his band. Just as I give the songs—and the album itself—a full meaning, anybody can give their own meaning to them, a way to feel related to the song they are listening to.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, AC/DC's Powerage is my personal favorite and best album of all. To anybody that is getting started with AC/DC or rock genre in general, this is a perfect album to begin with. Perhaps you will get to like it the way I do.",07Dec2018,1
14,"Sorry if this is a rant. My therapist cant meet with me so I figured id post this here. Maybe someone can relate or make sense of it thanks


Im dissatisfied with life
Im not doing what I want to do
Im not who I want to be
Im not where I want to be
Im stuck in this shitty place doing stuff I don’t want to do
What can i do about it?
I feel like I am some weird outside child and my family is five people and then me. 
I feel like my ambitions always fall short, I can never do what I want and what I envision happening never happens
For instance, I wanted to redecorate my room and I had a lot of interest in it but it wasn’t good when I finished. It was awkward and untasteful. 
Wtf
Im just angry about where I am at
What am I suppose to do?

I have all these goals and dreams and visions of what I want but I can never get it or if I do its never what I wanted.. I just feel like I’m chasing smoke and when I finally catch up to it, it slips through my fingers like always 

Why am I never satisfied, why am I never happy?
Am I just chasing smoke?
Am I just a selfish stupid person?
Am I just naive?
Am I just missing something?
I always feel so stupid and behind, like I’m just living in my head and not really here. 
Thinking about all this makes me want to kill myself. I haven’t felt this way in a while. 
I hate that. 
I dont know if I could make it if my family wasn’t around, as much as I feel so disconnected and alone. 

I always feel like I just choose the wrong things, always without failing. Its like I dont have a personality but just latch onto someone else’s because I have no idea who I am. The bare things I did know I’m not sure about anymore: my heart, my kindness, my ability to be a good person. Im not sure if I can even rely on that anymore
Maybe I should kill myself, stop all this worrying and misdirection. Maybe. 
Am I just missing something so obvious about life?
What is it?
I feel like I am just heading in the wrong direction all the time and maybe I should just give up, give in, end it. 
Ive felt this way all my life
Out of place
Turned around
Misdirected 
Unaware 
Blind

I think about what I want out of life and what kind of life I want then slowly think that things like that aren’t meant for me, they’re meant for people who will know what to do if they get them

I try not to and sometimes I can block it out but sometimes I really hate my life
Im so blessed but I feel so trapped and crushed by my own self

15,"Not sure this is where I should put this - 

My friend and I have jokingly fought about politics for always. He is super conservative and I am very liberal. The only time we came near to really having a serious breakdown in relations was on a woman’s right to choose.

In July this past year we were texting about gun control and he said something about ‘haha anything to get you into the conservative agenda’. I flipped. I was feeling sensitive about rumored attempts to plot to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges. (Oh FYI. I’m a woman married to a woman). I wrote a long message to him about how offensive I felt the ‘conservative agenda’ to be. 

A little while later he wrote back apologizing. I don’t know why, but I was floored. I didn’t say anything back - and haven’t. I feel bad and have thought about this at least once a week. I am part of the problem aren’t I? I am part of the divide of the U.S. I am the hot mess problem. He is a decent human - and I let the political climate influence me to drive my friend away.

So - how do I make it back? What do I say? ",07Dec2018,1
16,"Alright, so I'm a 20 yr M. Living with single mother that works all day, shes a good mother but a bad one too. Only in the part where she doesn't really try to hard to try and get me to change my situation, just the occasional "" have you looked for a job yet?"". To which the piece of shit me gets mad at and just do what I do best and ignore life.

I've been doing nothing for 3 years straight after highschool. I got a job during last year of highschool (at 17) then stayed for about 7 months and quit after deciding the pay wasn't worth it and applied to somewhere else with a bit more pay but did not get the job. Since then, I've been stuck at home doing nothing but watching TV and on my phone. I pushed away my friends because you can't hang out without money after highschool so instead of joining them and being embarrassed about not being able to pay for something I shut them out. Slowly and slowly over the years I've been building up anxiety inside me about life and the road I was going but been ignoring it by watching TV or on my phone. This year I finally just can't handle it anymore, my head hurts because of it, I  feel like I just want to stop existing. I want to get a job  but at the same time I'm just to unmotivated to apply for I job that to me, does not make me feel fulfilled. I applied somewhere last month after a year of not even trying and got rejected, hurt to be honest.

So, I need someone to help me, if they can, dig myself out of this hole I sunk myself into. Ideas, advice, tips, cheat codes, anything. I'm going crazy here.

This son is disabled, he sits in a chair watching TV all day.  She was sitting off to the side facing the kitchen, he wouldn't be able to see into the kitchen.  I went into the kitchen with only a towel around my waist.  She looked hard so I put on a very light show.  She didn't look away.  I went back and changed, then came out, sat next to her and helped her with her Facebook baloney on her tablet.  She was shaking.  Jaw and all.  She left and her son was wanting me to help her down the stairs it was so overkill.

Debt repaid.

No she didn't die on the way home.  She showed up two days later and when she greeted me she smiled and put her hand on my waist.  Then she went back to all business and that's how it's been ever since.

I recently moved to a new city and I'm working on meeting people. So I met a guy at the gym, he's a professor with a phd and he lives an interesting lifestyle. We end up exchanging info and planning to meet up again later as we share some interests and I figure I could learn a bit from him.

We meet up and I learn a lot about him, his back story and he asks me about mine. We both have had some tragedy in our lives so we can relate

He told me about how he had mentored people in the past. He has a lot of interest and asks me lots of questions about myself and exploring who I am.

He was really kind and I ended up crying across the table from this stranger after I had just eaten a pork enchilada and tamale. He held my hand and gave me a hug and at this point I began questioning the motivations.

Wait is he trying to mentor me?

Or is he gay and I'm just lonely and sad?

30,"Background: I’m a 17 year old, senior in high school. I work about 16-20 hours a week (most of the hours are weekend mornings to night shifts), and spend about 4 hours after school almost every day doing extra curricular activities (I’m editor in chief of yearbook, president of drama, president of business club, managing editor of newspaper etc.) I’m also in the middle of college applications.

Tonight I kind of broke down and cried for a long time.

My brother (16M) approached me when I got home from work and told me he needed to talk to me (on weekdays I Occasionally work closing shifts). I was thinking he wanted to talk about orchestra or something, but it was different.

He told me that he was worried about me. He told me that my best friend had approached him in tears because apparently I’ve been so “checked out” lately. He also told me that everyone that I’m close to has approached him at a different  point in time within the past two months and said they were worried about me. He also broke down in tears saying he missed me, that I never talked to him anymore and that I was never present. I was too busy. 

I knew that I was growing apart from my friends, I felt it. But I didn’t know I was affecting people this much. I kind of broke down at this point and wondered what I could do to fix this. How I can fix my friendships with everyone, mend my relationship with my family I didn’t even know I was tearing apart.

I started off by texting everyone and apologizing for not being a good friend, and for not being around for them anymore. I told my brother I was sorry, and my mom and dad as well.

My only problem is I don’t know where to go from here. I know logically I need to reduce my workload, so I can focus and prioritize friends and family who need it. 

I could quit my job, which would free up my weekends for the most part (until the spring play). But I feel apprehensive about it. I know I’m at a good place with the job, on track for a pay raise. 

Quitting my job really seems like the most logical option though. My other activities do take up a lot of my time, but my job would free up time I could spend with my family. I also can’t quit my other activities since I am in positions of leadership. 

I’m also worried how that will look on my resume later.  I’ve only worked at the job for 4 months. I’m also in the middle of college applications 

If I stick it out I would still be busy but I would have to communicate with others better. I admit I’m tired (my weekend shifts are early morning), 

I just don’t know where to go from here but I know I want something to change.

TL;DR: I’ve broken some relationships because I’m too busy, and I want to fix it.

31,"I was in Berlin, for the first time ever, a few days ago. Now I'm back home, and it's been nagging me that I should write something. When something impacts you emotionally so strongly, chances are it'll have that effect on someone else... so I'm sharing my experience... and, it's this:

I took my last day in Berlin to ""tourist around"" -- I'd been there for 2 days of meetings, but stayed an extra day. Not like you can see everything Berlin has to offer in one day, but the idea was to touch the highlights, and the very first stop of the day was the area around the Brandenburg Gate.

And, what did I see when I came around the corner? Right in front of the Gate, a massive Hanukkiah (special Menorah used for Hanukkah). I don't need to post a picture; feel free to Google -- there are plenty of pictures and news stories documenting Hanukkah in Berlin this year.

I didn't know anything about that, and certainly wasn't expecting it. The impact it had on me was profound. 

The only pictures I'd ever really seen of the Brandenburg Gate are those WWII ones, with Hitler and swastikas and tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of people in huge, screaming, scary rallies. And here I was, from the exact same camera angle where many of those pictures were taken -- staring at a Hanukkiah.

I actually froze, and stared at it. I couldn't move, with all the thoughts running through my head. I thought of my dad and grandparents, the only survivors in a family that was completely decimated by the war. None of them are with us anymore, but I wonder what they would think of this.

Neither my grandparents nor my father ever wanted to talk about any of it. All three spoke perfectly fluent German, but I never heard a word of it. They refused to speak it their entire lives after emigrating. And they never wanted to talk about what went on.

Well, over the years, I heard little stories. There was the time that this happened, that happened... a tapestry of isolated events which, woven together, resulted in their survival. They had many stories like that, and, indeed, they're the only possible stories that exist. Anyone who survived all of that was lucky. Very lucky. They called 20 coin tosses in a row and came out alive. And we will never hear from those who called 14 coin tosses but things didn't go so well on that 15th one. The population of Jews in Europe was 9,000,000 in 1933. It was 3,000,000 in 1945. There are 6,000,000 stories of survival that will never be told because their luck ran out. Heads. No, tails. Oh.

That's how it was with my entire family from my dad's side, except those three.

That's what was running through my mind as I stood there staring at that thing, which couldn't possibly have looked more out of place.

I realized I was sobbing, but didn't really care... a 50-year-old man, trying to hold it together among a large crowd of bustling tourists. I stood there, and stared, and cried.

At some point, a woman appeared next to me and spoke with a pretty thick German accent.

""Are you OK"", she asked.

""Thank you, I'm fine, just overwhelmed""

""Ya"", she said.

And after a moment, she asked me, ""You are \_Juden\_?""

Holy shit, that word. Instant images of yellow star armbands and the sounds of rattling train cars.

I am standing in front of the Brandenburg Gate, a short walk away form the Reichstag itself... Ground Zero of Nazi-ism... and there's a German person asking me if I'm Jewish. I looked around and saw tourists and buses. I saw a Starbucks. I saw the Hotel Adlon, from where Michael Jackson hung out his baby out the window many years ago.

I tried to imagine what it would've felt like, this same experience, 80 years ago, because that's exactly the situation my dad found himself in, in Budapest. One of those coin tosses that went the right way. A scared little boy, whose defiant mother refused to wear the armbands -- neither her, her husband of their son. And here was a Nazi official asking this scared little boy that exact question. He'd been taught to say no, but he got rounded up anyway. And someone who saw it happening ran to my grandmother's home and told her, and she came running out and, as I've been told, angrily busted through the containment area, grabbed my dad by arm, and hauled him out of there, throwing some choice words (in German) at the guards, how dare they round-up a young man of the Republic or whatever. Miraculously, they let her by. Nobody stopped them, and they made it home. And then they went into hiding for 9 weeks, hidden by a Christian family whose grandkids I'm still in touch with today. And when they emerged from hiding, after the Russians liberated Budapest, they made their way home and found they'd lost everything... their stuff, their family. All gone.

But 80 years later, I get to tell the truth.

""Yes"", I answered.

""I am sorry"", she said.

""Thank you"", I said.

And after a brief pause, she said,

""My grandfather was Nazi""

What are you supposed to reply to that? Not that I could've said anything more at that moment because I totally lost it. Warm flowing relentless tears, thinking about it. 

My grandparents and dad dealt with some serious ""survivor guilt"" their entire lives. The nightmares chased them for the rest of their lives. My dad once told me, there isn't a day that goes by that he doesn't think back on that time in his life and what went on. And now, here's this lady. What guilt has she been carrying? She herself didn't do anything, of course, but if the lingering emotional impact of my grandparents and father can have this sort of effect on me, I guess it can work the other way too.

At some point, she sort of put her arm around me, gave me a side-hug of some sort and, before walking away, said something that sounded like, ""You are a good persons""

I'm pretty sure I heard her say the plural of 'person' -- but not sure. I was trying to figure out what she was trying to say. That I'm a good person? That all Jews are good people? One small step for (a) man? Mankind? What did she mean? Doesn't really matter -- I like the plural implication anyway. Sure, Jews, for the most part, are good people. Resilient, if nothing else. Standing here at the Brandburg Gate with a giant Hanukkiah. What a tremendously empowering ""Fuck You"" to Hitler and his grand ideas. Nice try, you monster. But we're still here.

tldr; I saw a Hanukkah Menorah at the Brandenburg Gate, and was flooded with thoughts of my family

I got the PS4 bundle for $199 and it was marked as delivered the day before Thanksgiving. It wasn't. I called GameStop waited on hold for an hour and they said they'd begin an investigation.

I also reached out to UPS and spoke with them last Saturday. They sent me a GPS Picture showing the package was delivered to the wrong address. Now that I'm calling GameStop once more they're saying that UPS notified them it was delivered correctly and confirmed. I've been on hold for almost 3 hours waiting to get help and nothing has happened. I just want my $200 back. I'm told they insure all their deliveries, and this wasn't my fault.

Is there anything I can do? I just called UPS back and he agreed with me once more.

39,"Hello.

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Chelsea McKee and I am a 26 year old female living in South Texas. I have recently experienced a lot of things that have made me question the very nature of my own reality. 

Growing up, I was an only child. During a walk that I was disinterested in around the age of 8, I met my friend Kaitlin. We became rather good friends with the other children in the neighborhood as well and would spend a lot of time together. There were a pair of twin girls who lived next door to her and some ""bad kids"" who lived across the street. Overall we all got along, but there were some fights here and there. Shortly after I turned 13, my parents got a divorce. As a family we decided it would be best for me to stay with my mother, Leslie Meyer. While we moved to Kingsville with Joyce and Ed Meyer, My father, Jeremy McKee, then moved out to San Antonio or somewhere in Austin - I can't say for sure. My mother ended up returning to college and receiving her degree in Sociology - or so she says. She Eventually earned her Ph.D and is proudly hanging it up in her living room now but its something that I have always questioned. Regardless, reading portions of the dissertation was more than enough to bore me to sleep. During my teenage years, I was shuffled between mainstreamed in a brick and mortar academic environment as well as being homeschooled. While being homeschooled did offer a lot of flexibility, we moved from city to city which I found to be quite exhausting. Unfortunately, I didn't do well academically in either environment but still enjoyed specific aspects of each. For example, it was fun being able to interact with my peers even if it was limited and under constant supervision. While homeschooled we came up with creative ways for me to learn; For gym, we joined a gym, for biology I volunteered at the Texas State Aquarium, I would also wake up early and watch Xena: Warrior Princess and occasionally ""hack"" into the administrative system in order to give myself A's and B's when she wasn't looking. To be fair, it wasn't hacking in the least - it was a simple Username and Password set up. 

&amp;#x200B;

After her graduation, We had the option of moving to either Brownsville, Tx or Juneau Alaska and decided to stay in Texas. My ex, Emmanuelle Trevino, even attended her graduation and all seemed well. We had an interesting drive up to College Station with my Grandparents who chose not to believe or trust in GPS. It took them a while, but they finally came around to their cell phones. I don't have a problem with using a physical map but you can't sit there and pretend that it isn't real. While in Brownsville, my mother ""graduated"" me from high school and I had my first attempt at college. I wasn't ready, but gave it my best shot. When I noticed that it wasn't going to work out, I got my first job at the age of 18 at Johnny Carino's and my then boyfriend joined me. It was a lot of work but we had fun. There were struggles and I was absolutely terrified of everything and everyone. The people were great, the working environment was amazing, but having to be financially responsible was a lot of stress. I made a list of the required items and bills that would be asked of us and we decided that an apartment would be reasonable. We signed our first lease which would last for the duration of one year at Brandywyne apartment complexes. While they weren't the most luxurious, we were comfortable and happy. We had fun in our home. We would smoke a little bit of weed, go to work, have friends over, and play video games. I even burnt a pizza on one of our first nights there. We ended up moving to Corpus Christi and living with his father. While there, my boyfriend returned to school and I stayed at home. We ended up moving out into another apartment complex and I got my second job at Luby's. Having more experience made me feel a bit more comfortable, but I started to notice a disconnect between me and my fellow workers on a personal level. I even tried my hand at Bartending but it didn't go so well. :-)

&amp;#x200B;

My then boyfriend and I ended moving back to Brownsville into an adorable little one bedroom apartment with an in-unit washer and dryer. I felt on top of the world, it had tile floors, brown cabinetry, and plenty of space for us and our little dog Archibald. We would frequently take him to the soccer / football field across the way and play fetch and I would also walk him around the complex - it was nice. Manny told me that I needed to go back to work, which I did. I ended up working at Lowe's for well over a year. It was fair, the working environment again was rather pleasant and I enjoyed learning about the various positions and responsibilities of a retail store.  I went from Cashier to Pricing and Signage. I even applied to become one of the lower-level managers / head cashier but was unfortunately denied. I then started talking to my ex more because I felt like I wanted something more out of life - like something was missing. We discsussed school thoroughly because at this point I was 23 and had a shitty GPA, a few F's, a few W's, and other signs or marks of being a poor student. Regardless, I registered and selected the Psychology program. My biggest fear in life was mathematics but the professor (yum) made the learning process a lot easier. At this point, I had been attempting to pass Pre-Algebra for many years and employed the help of several people across many cities from Kingsville to Austin. I went to every class, attended office hours beforehand, and went to tutoring afterwards. I worked hard and was able to earn an A. This gave me the confidence to continue my academic career. Unbeknownst to me, this would land me right in the middle of something spectacular - Behavioral Neurosience. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up working with my professor rather well and was encouraged to apply to various Research based positions and opportunities. At first I was petrified; The Engaged Scholarship Symposium (ES\^2) was my first taste of participating in science. Before this, my only experience with biology and science outside of the aquarium was a book that I hardly cracked. This position was unpaid but well loved. We had the opportunity to work with a new laboratory animal called the Monodelphis Domestica and were responsible for categorizing its behavior in order to determine a baseline. I made a poster and presented my findings and was even able to present a workshop at the university. I invited a few peers from the lab as well as trusted professors to witness me awkwardly fumble through what was essentially my first science experiment. It went alright, but admittedly I was terrified. I never spent a lot of time in front of crowds and being home schooled and kept me in a position of being in smaller groups. You know, a group of 1. Afterwards my next project was for the UTRGV School of Medicine inaugural   Research Symposium and it was fully funded. We discussed how social experience influences behavior over time. I never thought that as an undergraduate \*I\* would have one of my projects be selected and paid for. It was a lot of hard work, but it was enjoyable and I was having fun.  Unfortunately the fun was short lived, as my mother (or the woman I was raised by, still fairly known as my mother) got into an argument. We were never really on the same page, but her behavior really through me for a loop. I don't want to get into it too much, I'm trying to stay focused on moving forward, but it's hard to not revisit. Anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently under the impression that I may have been wrong about a lot of things in life, with Neuroscience not being one of them. I feel a huge disconnect between my neighbors and myself - it's almost as if they're from a different planet - they simply don't make sense. It should be simple, right? $650/month all bills paid, included Wifi, Water, Sweage, Trash, etc but it just doesn't seem right. The people within the building all seem to be doing something entirely different. I know it may sound strange, but I am fairly sure that me and one other individual are the only ones paying to stay here. I'm starting to feel as if everyone is floating along and I am alone struggling. I've never lived in solitude before and it's something I am still attempting to adjust to. At this point, my mother still has custody of my dog despite my better judgement. It's lonely, I'm single, and being here by myself has made me a more fearful person.  I attempt to socialize and interact with others but it isn't well received - or doesn't seem that way. I feel as if I am living somebody elses life. I never saw myself being 26, having recently dropped out of school (again), living alone, being without my beloved dog, and having no friends. I think the hardest part of this is being single. I never wanted to be an independent woman and appreciate the guidance and support of others. I've already proved to myself that I'm smart - Straight A's, President's list, Dean's List, experience with research, etc. But that doesn't mean it's my entirety. I never even wanted to go to school and always envisioned myself married with children in a small and modest home. I like to clean - clorox wipes and windex are the shit. I love seeing Vacuum lines in the carpet. I'm a terrible cook but can make a mean pan of bacon. I like to stay at home and care for others. Even when I was living with my mother, I took the lawn as my responsibility. When I lived with Manny, I did work on my cooking skills and was able to provide him with some reasonable meals. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry this is so lengthy, but I just realized how little of my life I actually carry with me and began to feel discouraged. I enjoy being able to open up my laptop or cellphone and have visual aids to remind me of my time in school or to re-read little moments of my life. I've never really taken the time to sit down and think about my life because I've just been so busy living it. Now I stay mostly in my room and am attempting to make the correct choices but need help in doing so. I'm tired of working and can not even imagine having to try that again - I feel as if I have put in my fair share. I want to live my life in a warm and loving environment surrounded by people who love and care for both me and eachother. I'm a people pleaser and am looking for the same. This may sound lame and sappy but my needs and wants in life are very simple:

\*Cute PJs.

\*Pot

\*Cigarettes

\*Warm and cozy home.

\*People

I enjoy spending time with others and am easily saddened when not in the company of those who respect that. I'm all for people who want to kick ass and take names but that isn't my style. Sure, in academia it was rather rewarding, especially considering my past, but when it comes to interpersonal communication I have no interest in argument. I want to sit, discuss, and share stories. I want to laugh and talk with others. I want to feel as if I am being understood and listened to. There are so many things I haven't experienced in life because I've been tied down to Texas working, going to school, and paying bills. I'm ready and still am attempting to live my life to the fullest but can't seem to figure it out. In the mean time, I'm trying to stay positive but I'm at a loss at what to say beyond this.

45,"Hi Reddit, this is a new account because my old username wasn’t ‘anonymous’ enough and I’m a bit embarrassed about this. 

So as title suggests, I’m pretty low on friends. At school I was part of a medium sized group but I only really got along well with a few of the members, I had a few other friends from classes so I never felt like a ‘loner’. I’m usually quite quiet until I start to feel comfortable with someone, or if there’s an instant ‘click’ and I’m not great in groups, but I am fine at making one on one friendships.  

I drifted apart from most people from school as usually happens I suppose, but stayed in contact with my best friend of 6 years until something happened that caused us to fall out about 4 years ago in college, I had one friend from college whom I got along well with and we’d spend breaks together, but when she changed classes we didn’t keep in contact. At the time I also worked and got along very well with most of my colleagues, I would hang out with them from time to time and there was a girl that I became close with and we used to see each other once a week, until life got busy and it became once or twice per year. We still keep in contact now, but lately I’ve realised that we only really came together because neither of us really had a group of friends, and it’s not really an organic friendship, we don’t really have a ‘connection’ in terms of friendship and she’s not someone I would be able to confide in. 

My previous relationship lasted nearly 2.5 years, and during this time is when I started to realise I was running out of friends, I wouldn’t say this was anything to do with him as I met him around the time I had that one close friend from work, but we would do everything together so I kind of justified this in my mind as a substitute for not having friendships. Just for reference, the relationship was not healthy and ended very badly.

Fast forward to now, I have been with my current boyfriend for nearly a year and a half, he is amazing and we’ve always got along well as friends before we stared dating. I class him as my best friend and most of the time I feel okay, I’m grateful to have him as a best friend and partner, but it’s times like today I really wish I had a group of friends or at least a few friends. It was recently my birthday and I was planning on going out drinking on Saturday, at my current work I get along well with most of the people, but there is a girl that I have a really good friendship with, we’ve been out outside of work and we get a long so well it’s nice to have a ‘proper’ friend after so long. So someone at my place of work is having a leaving do, so I suggested to said friend that we go to that/ as a celebration for my birthday, I think she assumed this would mean I had other friends there, I did tell her that there probably wouldn’t be many people (really I knew there would be 0) but she said it was okay and she had my back basically, she seemed really up for it but now she’s flaking. She has been having some problems with her mental health, so I would never pressure her or anything. But now it means I can’t really go out for my birthday, I could still go to the leaving do but the thing is I’m not close to the person whose leaving or really anyone whose going and I wouldn’t feel comfortable going alone. I also invited my boyfriend, and said he could invite some friends *side note: he doesn’t really have many friends either but he stayed close with someone from our work (we used to work at the same place, he left I still work there) who has a bigger friendship group that my boyfriend is sort of a part-time member of*, he hasn’t invited them yet as I have been unsure of the plan, but I know he wouldn’t really want to come to this work do with me if it was just that, as he doesn’t really enjoy the company of some of his ex-colleagues. Im hoping my friend gets back to me and it will work itself out, but she’s currently ignoring my last message saying about where to meet if she did go, so I think it’s a no go. 

On another note, I tried to reach out to my best friend from school but she shot me down. I know the situation could be a lot worse and some people have absolutely no one, but sometimes it just feels like I am the only person out here that doesn’t have friends and I don’t know how to remedy it at this point. I even saw a post on r/relationships a while ago where someone was considering breaking up with someone because they found out they had no friends and it was weird :/

Thanks for reading, this turned out pretty long.

TLDR; don’t really have friends, have one person I’m close to whom I could go out with for my birthday, but now that’s she flaking it means I can’t go out. Wishing I had a group of friends like everyone else seems to. ",07Dec2018,1

55,"In late 2016, after my nth failed attempt at being an ""entrepreneur."" I fell into a deep slump.

I thought I was so smart, the people around me liked my ideas, and if they didn't? Well, they just didn't get it.

I'd wriggle out of any critique and always have an excuse for why something hadn't worked—I'd tell myself I was learning as I went along—I wasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, thankfully, I was humbled and realized why I had been failing all this time: I had no fucking clue what I was talking about. (about anything)

So I quit everything and bummed around for a year—I watched every episode of Frasier—it was a dark time.

&amp;#x200B;

I had this pile of books I'd meant to read, a pile I hadn't touched in over a year. (It's late 2017 now) But something compelled me to pick one up—maybe my wifi stopped working—I can't remember.

That book was Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. It's about traps in our thinking, biases, and how to be happy. It's excellent—every other page contains some revelation about our stupid brains—it exposed so many flaws in my thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

I read many more similar books and the number one lesson I learned was: to stop relying on willpower and to start tricking myself into getting things done. For instance:

* My apartment was a mess. So I'd invite friends round for dinner. That way I'd have to clean up or face the shame of them seeing how gross I am.  

* I got a dog. I was now responsible for the life of an innocent—the ultimate commitment device (and alarm clock)  

* Then three weeks ago I set myself a public challenge. Make a website in 21 days that makes enough money to feed my dog. A challenge I'd have to complete or else prove the nay-sayers right. (Just random people on Reddit, but still.)  


That gets us to today. The three weeks is up, and I've completed the challenge. Here's what I did:

This whole thing started from reading—something I still don't do enough of—so I started a book club, forcing me to read more and helping others do the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Reading is a great habit—one that's practically universal among great thinkers—and yet it so hard to get done. It  requires focus and an environment free from distraction—both increasingly hard to obtain.

So, every two weeks, starting in 2019, we'll read one of the books most recommended by tech entrepreneurs and startup founders. We'll discuss, keep each other on track, and probably have some competitions too.

Here's the website: [https://thestartupbook.club](https://thestartupbook.club)

I'm still pretty clueless, but two years ago I would have ignored help; I wouldn't have accepted any critique, and it would have taken me months longer.

Now, if it fails, I'll be able to sit down and work out exactly why—and try again.

**OP STARTS HERE**

I  think the best example of this is this feeling I get whenever the issue  of smoking weed comes up.... I don't smoke any weed, at all, I find the  idea utterly abhorrent. For the record I'm 100% in favour of it being  legalised but I just think its really not a good thing to do on a  personal level.

But  the issue is, I find myself having an incredibly hard time taking  people I meet who smoke weed. To me, its an instant sign of someone I do  not wish to associate myself with and its insanely offputting.

To  me, I aspire to be the sort of image of a ""clean and successful""  type... maybe its not an actual stereotype that exists, but I have this  image in my head of a man who doesn't smoke weed at all, maybe only  drinks occasionally, can have fun without any of that stuff, and has a  calm mind and uses it to be successful... and when I imagine this guy, I  imagine him associating and respecting other people who act like him,  and him rejecting people who make poor personal health choices.

I  just don't know what to do. I feel like this mindset I have is kinda  elitist and snobby, but simultaneously I don't think my opinion on weed  is going to budge. I want to get a mindset where I instantly don't write  off anyone who smokes weed.

It feels like its hard to meet people who DON'T smoke weed these days too, so its really inhibiting my ability to socialise.

TLDR:  I instantly dismiss people who smoke weed and its not the right thing  to do, I think, but overall I'm just lost and don't know how to handle  these feelings.

Also had severe depression and anxiety his entire life and was bullied throughout grade school because of aspergers. A troubled person that could've done well in life

So this day he bought a live feeder mouse from a reptile store for like $2 or $3. Hard to believe you can buy a sentient animal for pocket change. First he tormented the mouse by poking it with a pencil, then held it by the tail and swung it around, he obviously took pleasure in watching it squirm around. He would taunt it by holding objects in front of it while holding it by the tail, watching the mouse try to grab on, then pulling the object away. It's obvious from mouse behavior that they are sentient and make conscious decisions. They hate being held by the tail and look around for something to grab on to. Once he got tired of that, he started mashing its feet and then cut off all 4 arms and legs, then laughed watching it frantically try to get away by flailing around its stubs. The mouse squeaked really loud in pain with every cut, I think he enjoyed that too ""music to his ears"" according to him. Then after a few minutes of letting it suffer unable to move, he smashed its backside with a blunt object into a bloody mess, the mouse squeaked extremely loud with every mash and flailed around, died of blood loss or shock in 30 seconds. Looked like a crime scene, gory blood and guts everywhere. Then he flushed the dead mouse down the toilet. I dont know how many times he did this without me there.

61,"I am a freshman geek in college. About 5'7. ""Studies while eating Doritos"" Freshman 15 belly.

I have been playing poker for years. Always known as the best among my friends.

This weekend, a cute, very tall senior girl (maybe 5'11? Possibly 6'0?) stumbled into our small party. She heard me brag about how I've won 11 tournaments in a row.

She challenged me to a heads-up game. I said sure, let's do it.

Only 30 minutes later, she took every penny I had. $330. Which was my textbook money. I asked for a shot to win it back.

She said ""Well, I already have all your money. How about your clothes? But when I take those little panties too, you go home without them.""

That admittedly intimidated me a little, but maybe she liked me and this was a chance to finally get laid.

30 minutes later, I handed her my boxers, which she swung around her head yelling ""WOOOO!""

I was as naked as a newborn baby.

Totally untanned from the neck down as everyone giggled to their ultimate amusement.

""Finders keepers, losers weepers"" she said as I shuffled to the door wearing nothing but my glasses and a pink blush on my face, pathetically covering my package with my hands.

Towering over me from behind, she said ""Now RUN HOME, BIRTHDAY SUIT BOYYYY!"" and leaned back and SMACKED my round, plump white bubble butt and I gasped, let out a yelp of pain, and ran through the door, gasping as my bald buttcheeks felt the 35 degree weather, down the steps, across the quad, and across the football field, 2 miles back to my dorm, as naked as the day I was pulled screaming from my mother. Hiding behind dumpsters and trees the whole way. Desperately clutching my little dorm key-card in my hand.

I was caught on security camera running buck naked into my dorm and kicked out of my dorm. Now I have to commute from home.

I didn't have the heart to tell my parents the real reason, so I pretended it was excessive drinking. Which really pissed them off.

Can someone please answer the following questions?

    How old are you and male or female?

    Are you more geeky or outgoing?

    What parts of the story were funniest for you to imagine and why?

    What parts made you cringe most to imagine yourself in, and why?

    Why is the single funniest mental image you have in the story and why?

63,"I'm a Filipino man, and I was in my early twenties at the time. I lived in a relatively small town and my family was, by local standards, well-to-do. There was this asshole living in our town. Typical 'white sexpat in Asia' type of guy. Beer gut. Flip-flops. Much younger wife. He spoke our language and a local dialect of it (Ilokano) but very broken and primarily curse words.

He was a drunkard. And he was racist as hell. It was obvious from our every interaction that he looked down on me and all of us for our race. In some ways I would even say he likely looked down on his own wife. At the same time he would always talk about how as a white man he was superior to us, how he was better in bed, had better genes and how his ""Mestizo offspring would be moviestars in Manila one day while we would still rot in our rice fields"". A very, very nasty character flip-flopping through our muddy streets on a daily basis, swigging back cheap San Miguel gin and shouting at people in words he barely understood.

Now his wife, let's call her Mary Beth, I knew her quite well. She was my high school batch mate before and I had courted/dated her briefly at one point, but nothing ever happened besides some making out. To cut a long story short... I grew tired of this asshole acting like some sort of cheap knock-off of that guy in Apocalypse Now, pretending to be a big deal and looking down on us for no apparent reason other then the fact this his dollars had more value there then they do back home for him.

In the afternoons and evenings when the old shitbag would pass out, I'd go over to their shack and talk to Mary Beth. We'd hang out. Rekindle the flame, so to speak. She seemed pretty eager, too. Like she missed out on real intimacy and who could blame her, being with a man so repulsive and old enough to be her father. The whole town saw me sneaking in and out of her house. I'm pretty sure even some of her relatives spotted me but no one ever told on me, to my knowledge. Not to guy anyway. About one week in, I made a move on Mary Beth. She reciprocated.

We had sex that evening. Three times. It was rough, animalistic hate fucking on my part. Doing it I felt vindicated. Afterwards, weirded out. I snuck out in the early hours of the morning, feeling sort of disgusted with myself. I didn't even like her, I wasn't even so attracted to her. I just used her to get back at a man I hated. Which makes me an asshole.

Things pretty much stopped there. I pretended to be heartbroken over ""having to let her go"" and cried the necessary tears to make it believable. I never told the guy what I did. But the next time he gave me his usual rant on his own perceived superiority and my inferiority, I gave him the widest fucking grin and winked at him. He looked a little paranoid or maybe that's just my imagination talking. In the end I felt like I restored my pride by cucking the guy and making him the town's laughing stock more than he already was. I ended up moving away for college to a big city. The guy moved away somewhere else too, taking Mary Beth with him. Last I saw, they have two kids now, two very unhappy looking boys who resemble the men he looks down on so much to a T.

**TL;DR:** I slept with a man's wife because he insulted my race all the time, I used his wife to get back at him and I feel this makes me a major asshole but on some level I don't still regret it because I feel that he had it coming.",07Dec2018,1
65,"Today I received a call in my office. At first, it sounded like a standard-issue cold call from an employment agency, offering temporary bookkeepers in case I need to hire any in the upcoming busy season. And then...the guy started complimenting my name and my voice. And then he said ""wow, that's a nice little title you have"" (like, my job title. I'm a department head, so ""little title"" is really fucking insulting). AND THEN, he told me I looked beautiful in my linkedin picture. Angrily, I said ""I'm going to hang up now"" and did just that.

Does it ever end? I'm really asking. At what point in my career do I no longer have to deal with this kind of shit? Is it never?

70,"**Backstory:** So, I meet this guy in May, through a common acquaintance. We hit it off well from the beginning. We start hanging out with common friends throughout the summer, up until September. After that, every single one of our common friends either got a job in a city far away, or went to college. So, out of the whole group, we're the only ones left, so we keep hanging out every so often, but definitely scarcely compared with the rest of the group.

Fast forward to a **Thursday** this November, I had some serious issues with my health so I hadn't been out of the house for fun, for at least a month. We talk, I tell him that I'm available to go out that weekend. We make arrangements for that Saturday. He texts me Saturday afternoon that a couple girl-friends of his will be joining us. 

He then follows up to explain that one of them, let's call her '**A**', is his best friend for many years. But, *he's secretly in love with her*, for the past 5 years at least. He never expressed that to her, never hinted at it. She never saw him that way either. Yet still he insists in an aggressive manner that I **(and everyone who meets her)** stay away from her, that I don't talk much to her that night, that I don't flirt or hint at anything around her. Even after the night, he warned me not to ask for her number, not look her up on Facebook or Instagram, not text her, not reply to any texts if she texts me first, not do anything at all. Act like she doesn't exist.

We go out that night. I was prepared to be just kind and just have a cool night out after a long time.  
He tells me that just before we met, 'A' asked him to go to her place to zip up her dress, although he lives quite far away from her (he's that deep into the friendzone).   
'A' is absolutely stunning, and has one of the most fun personalities I've ever met. We hit it off super well from the first few moments. She sure as hell seems to like me as well. She goes ahead to ask me if I'm single in the first half an hour since we met. That left me speechless (being quite shy, and an introvert I don't get asked that very often, probably cause people just assume I'm single). I froze. All of us did. I tell her I am single quite a few months now. After that she became quite more handsy and fun, more jokes and giggles and more or less spent the whole night talking solely to me. My friend looked pissed off with me talking to her all night because despite seeing me being quite formal and as distant as possible with her. Close to the end of the night, having in mind that she's wearing a dress that needs help to be unzipped my friend went out of his way (literally miles away) to not leave me alone with her, not even for a moment. All ended well, we took her to her from door, and he proceeded to help her with the zipper before we left.

Come **Monday**, I wake up to her having added me on Facebook. I ask him If I should accept. He, although frustrated, tells me to accept her, so that 'A' doesn't ask him why I would not add her on Facebook. Anyway, Monday night my friend told me that he counts that as *strike 1,* and I should be careful not to text her, not like anything she posts, and definitely not answer back if she takes the initiative and texts first. 

Sure as hell, 'A' text me a ""hi"" gif on **Tuesday morning**. I reply back. I never tell my friend that she started talking to me.  
We go on to have super fun conversations, with a ton of hints and winks from her side, lots of hearts and a couple suggestions to go out for coffee together or a beer sometime soon. I reject those two politely, but she keeps talking me and admittedly I'm having the time of my life talking to her as well. We keep the conversation going for two days straight, **until Wednesday night.**

On **Thursday** night we go out with my friend for a beer. Conversation brings her up, and I tell him that she texted me, but I kept it super formal, and avoided hitting on her or accepting any invitation to go out with her (although I'm dying to).  He grabs my phone off the table and angrily goes outside, sits on the bench, hands shaking, and starts reading the conversation line by line. After he's done, he's fuming that she texted and I didn't alert him first, angrily walks around without talking at all. Ten minutes later he bursts out:  ""You're not a real friend. You're not a man. Real men don't         
back-stab their friends. I told you that I loved her, and to stay away from her from the first moment and you went and did exactly what I told you not to!"", and keeps on going for an hour. I stay there listening to him, and explaining that I did nothing wrong, I was absolutely cold and just plain friendly with her, but he wants to here none of it.

I let him have his ""alpha male"" moment and let the fumes out, knowing I didn't start the conversation, I didn't leave any hints or hit on her. He proceeds to tell me to stay away from her, block her on Facebook, if she texts to ignore her completely, and not try to do anything with her, and leaves cursing and punching streetlights in his way.

Now, I feel like shit. He isn't talking to me, and I'm starting to blame myself for the whole situation, although I believe I didn't do anything wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**:  Friend of mine tells me not to stay away from his best (girl) friend for years, because he's in love with her for many years, although never expressing that and being deep into the friendzone.  Girl hits on me, I'm just friendly and typical. Now he's angry at me and not talking to me, and made me feel like I'm the one at fault in this mess.

I’ve already started to fix my sleep schedule and just relax and taking things one at a time. 

However I still don’t know what to do about my hair which mainly I’ve noticed from my hairline receding which I want to know is there any chance I could still recover as I’m still young. The only thing I got from online is some onion remedy and possibly a site from Hims which people are complaining about delivery issues.

78,"I have been with my wife and the mother of our kids for 11 years. The relationship has always been unstable. I'm an alcoholic and abusive. 

I never thought we would ever be finish though. It's dumb because I think about how I've treated her for years and she should have left me a long time ago. But I always thought we were each other's right hand. 

We've been separated for a while now. But we still text. There's good and bad in those conversations, mostly bad. We even visit and go on vacations together but we don't co-habilitate. 

Well more recently I found out she's been talking to someone else. It's possibly a relationship or it could just be sexual. I have no idea. It could be nothing. But she won't tell me anything about it and I'm losing my mind over it. But sometimes in moments of clarity I see the big picture. But then it goes away just like that. 

I'm in denial I guess. I never thought the love of my life would find happiness with someone else. And I'm so distraught over it. But she still texts me and does other things to let me know she still thinks of me but all the evidence is there that she is done with me but I just can't accept it.

It would be one thing if I knew for a fact it was over. Then it would written and I'd know what she's thinking. But she doesn't tell me what she's thinking. She won't say anything about how our future is looking or if she even sees one anymore. 

I just wish she would not even talk to me or about me (on Reddit) if she wants me out of her life. I know I have to do the same and I think I can eventually get there. But it doesn't seem I'll do that anytime soon. 

It should be obvious that she doesn't want me but I won't accept it because for one she doesn't really talk to me anymore. She won't convey any feelings if we even have a relationship. And even though I got all into her business with the other guy and texted him and called him, she's still keeping on with whatever she's doing with him. So when I think about it like that, then it's almost painfully obvious I am no longer the one. I guess maybe I'm just in my denial phase and I wish it would end already and I could come to terms. I read in a ask Reddit thread that some dude still thinks about his ex 6 years later. And Jesus the way I love her I think I could be thinking of her for the rest of my life. And I constantly see posts here where people talk about the one that's no longer around months and years later. I just wish I was living in the time where I have accepted it. I don't know when it's coming but I need it real bad cause I'm drinking myself into self destruction almost nightly about it. 

And to curb some responses before they come. I know I'm a domestic abuser it's wrong and obviously I know it's a horrible thing of me, but I don't advocate it. I'm not in the mindset to where, well the bitch deserved it. It just happens and I don't like it and I believe in my heart of hearts that I can overcome it and overcome my drinking but it's so hard especially in the time it is now.

I would plan to do something, and then get distracted, or bored, or depressed and then it wouldn't happen, and I'd feel bad. I would tell myself I was lazy, or that I didn't have willpower.

Well, forget willpower and good intentions. They don't work.

Instead, if you want to change your behavior, make practical changes.

Here's some that have helped me in the past:

* If my apartment were a mess, which was most of the time, I would invite friends round for dinner. That way I'd have to clean up before they arrived.  

* I had zero responsibility or accountability in my life; I would wake up at 2 pm, it was bad. So I got a dog—the ultimate alarm clock. Now I am responsible for the life of an innocent.  

* I publicly challenged myself to make a website that would make enough money to pay for my dog's food. That was three weeks ago. The fear of letting myself and others down made me work almost non-stop. (Also my   desire to silence the nay-sayers of Reddit)

The site I started is a [book club](https://thestartupbook.club/), forcing me—and it's members—to read one book every two weeks.

Fear and shame are generally not considered good motivators, but these less severe versions seem to do the trick very well, and when you combine it with how good you feel when you finish a book, a project, or a tidy—it's excellent. My life is still a bit of a mess, but it's definitely on track.

Either way, we'd go out and even after she quit our job we'd still stay connected.

She was mentioning this dude at my job. I was speaking to this other girl at mine. I thought about asking her out, but I started to see some red flags. Eventually I realized I didn't even want this girl. I didn't wanna stop seeing my friend. I wanted to tell her, but she hooked up, and I was like ""damn"".

After a few months, she broke up because he turned out to be an ass.

She eventually got rehired at our job, and we'd go out from time to time. Only thing is I wasn't sure she broke up because she'd just speak on not feeling it anymore. Later she starts talking about this 20yr old guy at our job. He's apparently cute and really nice. She was sketched out about it because she's like 27.

I felt I needed to tell her. So I asked her out on a date, and she said she only saw me as a friend. Told her I initially saw her the same way because I wasn't too into her style. She's beautiful but she had sort of a rocker style to her. But at one point not too long ago, I just saw her in a different light and realized how beautiful she really was. And with everyone that came and went in my life, she's the only person who'd still reach out to me.

So I told her that, ya, I basically friendzoned her too because I was too blind by someone else, and I regretted it.

I told her she should talk to the guy, he seems cool, even though I hate hearing about him. I didn't wanna be bitter towards her, or even him. She doesn't deserve that.

Truth is I'm in love with the only woman that ever seemed to give a damn, but her heart is belonging to someone else.

I've been depressed many times, usually due to loneliness, and she's the only person whom I felt a real deep connection with, and now I realize I gotta eventually give her up.

It didn't hit me til the next morning where I just wake up with a feeling of emptiness. Been waking up like that for the past few days.

Last night she text me to go get some coffee with her. When we left the place she told me about him and how she wanted to take it slow, I told her just focus on herself and don’t just know one side of that person because I made that mistake.

I admit i hated hearing it but I wanted to still be the same friend. She went out  with many guys, but this one just bugged me for some  reason. I guess because I just realized how much she really meant to me.

We just sat there not saying a word. Me wondering why she asked me to go with her. I didn’t think Shed ever invite me to go out again after asking her out on a date.

I asked if she was tired she said no and we just went for a drive. We’d talk it but was mostly silence. Not awkward. I was mostly just happy to have her with me.
