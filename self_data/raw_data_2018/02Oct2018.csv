A new treatment has come out in my country (it's been available elsewhere but only recently approved here) and it's expensive.  But holy moly.  TMI I know but it's at least working in some capacity.  I've had five orgasms today and I want to keep going, I've had sex function and a high sex drive before but this is insanity.  I want so badly to have someone to feed but it's going to take a while to get to that point, it's frustrating.  I just want to find somebody and take a month off to fill them up constantly.",02Oct2018,1

Well this is a real bummer, I feel like life just wants to fuck with me at this point. There are a number of reasons I've never had the courage to have a partner or reveal my feelings. Firstly I was told by a therapist that I am likely what is known as a ""highly sensitive person"" which means I feel and process emotions stronger than others (apparently my temperament since I was a baby is consistent with this, so I guess this is just the way I am).

So I'm probably already prone to depression, but on top of that I developed social anxiety because I was bullied relentlessly from elementary school to high school for being ""ugly"", because I ""don't know how to walk cripple"", ""you sound like a r\*\*\*\*\*"". And I lived in three different states, so I couldn't dismiss it as a group of kids being dicks, if that many kids in that many areas said it then it must be true. What made it worse is that believe it or not a few teachers would make fun of me in front of the entire class lmao, and you can imagine the emboldened other children. The verbal insults weren't even the worst of it, it was when I was ostracized from groups silently that fucked me up the most, like I was so below them that I wasn't worth being dignified a reason as to why they hated me. I was raised by a traditional family from the old world, and although I love my family the concept of dating is absolutely foreign unless you're intending to get married., so even if the bullying never happened I would have internalized that having a girlfriend is wrong.

Flash forward now, I've been in therapy for almost a year and I take medication so I'm able to manage a lot of my anxiety symptoms. I find out this girl I'm working with in a university position has been single for a little while, but because of all of my problems it took me a bit to work up the courage to tell her I like her. Not even asking her out because I was preparing for rejection, literally just telling her I like her. I finally worked up the courage to tell myself the next time we're alone together (which is pretty often since we're in the same subgroup) I was going to tell her. But before that happens I hear her telling other girls about a crush she was seeing and it felt like a fucking stab in the heart. Apparently he's training to be a chiropractor (there's no way I could fucking compete with that) and she was speaking euphorically about how they hung out at her place the other night. One comment that really stung was him saying that she was the ""cutest thing"" (that's literally what I imagine telling her) and she was talking about how she was in a ""tizzy"" after he gave a free chiropracty session and they watched netflix. What killed me is that I realized even if we did go out that there is nothing I could do to make her or anyone that happy, there's nothing I could provide.

I know I'm not entitled to anyone, I hope she's happy even though it stings the fuck out of me. And I've heard the typical comments, ""there other fish in the sea"" and ""just be confident and everything will follow.""

I can't be fucking confident, I am socially stunted because I was robbed of a good childhood. Think about never going to a friends house as a kid when you see literally every kid do it, not having romantic relationships in high school and college when you see everyone else have one. Imagine staying locked in your fucking dorm room every Friday and Saturday night when you know literally thousands of your peers are out there having fun.

Now imagine for the first time in your life you feel like you can achieve a little bit of normalcy and right before you can even attempt that life slaps you across the face once again. Fuck, I don't know how I haven't had a mental breakdown yet.

\*\*TL;DR;

\-I struggled with mental health my entire life and I didn't have a partner.

\- I finally get the courage to tell a girl I like her.

\- I find out she just started seeing someone who sounds better than me in every way and I'm having an existential crisis.\*\*",02Oct2018,1

6,"After working my ass off this first semester college, I realized that I have some type of ... boredom? depression? I am hesitant to describe it as depression, although my symptoms do line up with this.

Some habits i want to adjust:

1. Dedicate time every day to working on school rather than cramming it all in the last 2-3 days it's due

2. Workout consistently again

3. Stop nicotine vape

4. blah blah blah

Now, I am not looking for advice on how to deal with these individual goals, hence ""blah blah blah"". What I am looking for, however, is advice for how to stay consistent and change. I have tried quitting a few things many, many times. I have tried building better habits many, many times.

7,"This tooth #30 has been bugging for the last ten years or so, but it never gave me a real toothache problem. That was until last Friday when it started to act up, making my lower gum completely swollen. I couldn’t go to the dentist over the weekend, so I just Advil’d up until I could see the dentists. Bear in mind I’ve only went to the dentist once 9 or 10 years ago. 

The dentist told me that I had two options: 1) take anti-biotics and comeback later for extraction, or 2) take that mothafucka out right there. I said fuck it and and they started messing with my teeth.

I would say this is the most pain I’ve ever felt, like ever. However, the swelling is less now and the pain is gone.

8," 

not sure where to post this. im looking for solutions and/or advice. heres the gist of it

* i am insecure but only about my looks
* i get triggered when i see people i believe to be hotter than me
* i see myself as a 7/10 and desperately want to be a 9/10 (i know, stupid. but it is what it is)
* when im in a relationship and the other person talks about someone attractive, even as a joke, i instantly get depressed or jealous or angry
* i feel that i will not be able to make my future partner happy unless i look insanely hot
* when i get triggered, i go into this hyper-focused mode where i compare myself to the other person, trying to find their flaws, and then i keep researching ways to become hotter (plastic surgery, exercise, etc). every single time, i end up wasting an average of 6 hours of my day. YES ITS THAT EXTREME.
* i get frustrated that i cant do anything about my looks because of lack of money, genetics, whatever reason, and i have severe temper tantrums and get depressed and cry. The whole day ends up being wasted. When im in this emotional/distressed state, i dont remember what my responsibilities are, what i have to do today (to do list, what work i have), i cant will myself to get up to eat or shower. It's like im frozen and cant bring myself out of this emotional blackhole.

i know ill never be accepting of how i look until i fix my flaws with plastic surgery. theres no cure for that dissatisfaction and i DO NOT want any advice on ""loving yourself"" and ""accepting yourself"". **i just want to know how i can stop getting triggered, or if i do, how i can manage my extreme emotional distress, and just feel better.** Im sick of wasting 6 hours every time i see or hear about someone hotter than me.",02Oct2018,1
9,"Hey everyone! Just want to start by saying that if you think there is a better subreddit to cross post this on, let me know. I really want to get as many perspectives on this as possible. There are many paths and points of detail I could go down, and I am talking to professionals about this kind of stuff too, but I'm posting here to get opinions from a fantastic community I've loved for years. (I've made a new profile today since my last one is known to a lot of people now.)

So for the first 22 years of my life (I'm 25 now) I was a total people pleaser. I laughed at every joke, I did every favor, I listened to every bad day. Especially for the people I loved, I would bend over backwards. I was the person you would bring home to mom and dad. Always joking around and being happy go lucky. It got to the point where I would come home and when I closed the door behind me I would literally slide to the floor exhausted and feel like I could finally take off a mask.

My senior year of college I had a mental breakdown. I experienced some pretty big trauma that truly shook me up. I was shuffled between programs, doctors, diagnoses, and medicines. I barely graduated, but with the support of my parents I made it through. Coming out of the depressive episode was pretty typical, slowly reintegrating myself into society, responsibilities, and relationships. I can truly say now that I am 100% grateful to be alive and happy more days than not. 

About 2 months ago, I started a new graduate program and am meeting a lot of people. I also have roommates again. And here's the thing, I've been getting a lot of comments that feel really foreign to me and don't know how to feel about it. My roommates think I'm kind of antisocial. They say ""Oh pokeyluvsgumby has such little patience for things,"" ""PLG hates everyone,"" ""PLG doesn't care what anyone thinks about her,"" ""PLG doesn't like being around other people,"" ""I was getting annoyed at people the other day and walked away, now I know how PLG feels all the time."" 

They are trying to say it in a lighthearted way most of the time, but it is starting to rub me the wrong way. I hadn't thought that my change had been in a negative direction. I saw it as maturing and as being more true to myself, my introverted nature, and my need for self care. I did wonder sometimes if the blunted affect of my depressive episode was still lingering, but I do still truly love people. I just don't ooze ""love me"" vibes anymore. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar? How would you feel and act? I'm not really at the point of explaining my past to them, and I don't think I should have to, but if I really am coming across as ""unapproachable"" should I do something differently? 

Thanks for your thoughts!

I tried texting him, but got no response. I brushed it off as he didn’t want to continue talking to me and I moved on. Then, about a week ago, I tried to call an international number and got a cryptic error message. Turns out I don’t understand the complexities of phone plans and I might not have international texting after all... which means he might have never got my messages, and I might not have gotten any from him.

13,"Sometimes life sucks. Sometimes life is so amazing you cant help but think it's a dream.  Sometimes a person can look like their life is the most incredible thing in the world. Yet on the inside they are battling demons that others may never know about.  
  A comedian who brightened lives of so many. Couldn't feel the warmth of his own light.  A guy covered in tattoos, looks like he doesn't have a care in the world and can rip your head off just by looking at you.  Depression and Anxiety has him so distressed he might not make it until tomorrow.  The woman who looks like she has it all. Perfect body. Perfect attitude. Perfect personality. She sees an overweight, ugly, sad excuse of a human.  She fights daily with eating disorders that completely control her life. 
  Everyone can change. Everyone can get help. Sometimes all it takes is that one person to ask how your day is going. Sometimes it takes an army of therapists and doctors and it's still a struggle.  Sometimes the person doesnt even recognize there is a problem and lives a very long time in the dark, maybe to never see the light. 
  Everyone has issues.  Some worse than others. While it can be tough for those near them to deal with the person having the struggles, try to always be strong for them.  If they are getting help, ask them if they want to talk about it. Even a small step is still a step.  
  If you are a person going through something, find that one thing that allows you to BREATHE.  Find something that isnt based on another person.  People can leave you feeling deserted.  Turn to something that helps you relax. Music. Art. Funny videos. Literally anything that calms the mind. 
  I am definitely no expert. I have a very long way to go.  I've just been spending every waking hour trying to beat my brain into submission. And these are a few thoughts I've had.

I think shes ded up with who I am. She knows I'm broken. She knows shes my crutch now. I would leave, but it hurts too much to even think about.

However, the way to repair the loss is to improve the future time. I trust, that with your dispositions, even the acquisition of science is a pleasing employment.

I can assure you, that the possession of it is, what (next to an honest heart) will above all things render you dear to your friends, and give you fame and promotion in your own country. When your mind shall be well improved with science, nothing will be necessary to place you in the highest points of view, but to pursue the interests of your country, the interests of your friends, and your own interests also, with the purest integrity, the most chaste honor.

The defect of these virtues can never be made up by all the other acquirements of body and mind. Make these then your first object. Give up money, give up fame, give up science, give the earth itself and all it contains, rather than do an immoral act. And never suppose, that in any possible situation, or under any circumstances, it is best for you to do a dishonorable thing, however slightly so it may appear to you. Whenever you are to do a thing, though it can never be known but to yourself, ask yourself how you would act were all the world looking at you, and act accordingly.

Encourage all your virtuous dispositions, and exercise them whenever an opportunity arises; being assured that they will gain strength by exercise, as a limb of the body does, and that exercise will make them habitual. From the practice of the purest virtue, you may be assured you will derive the most sublime comforts in every moment of life, and in the moment of death. If ever you find yourself environed with difficulties and perplexing circumstances, out of which you are at a loss how to extricate yourself, do what is right, and be assured that that will extricate you the best out of the worst situations.

Though you cannot see, when you take one step, what will be the next, yet follow truth, justice, and plain dealing, and never fear their leading you out of the labyrinth, in the easiest manner possible. The knot which you thought a Gordian one, will untie itself before you. Nothing is so mistaken as the supposition, that a person is to extricate himself from a difficulty, by intrigue, by chicanery, by dissimulation, by trimming, by an untruth, by an injustice. This increases the difficulties ten fold; and those who pursue these methods, get themselves so involved at length, that they can turn no way but their infamy becomes more exposed. It is of great importance to set a resolution, not to be shaken, never to tell an untruth.

There is no vice so mean, so pitiful, so contemptible; and he who permits himself to tell a lie once, finds it much easier to do it a second and third time, till at length it becomes habitual; he tells lies without attending to it, and truths without the world's believing him. This falsehood of the tongue leads to that of the heart, and in time depraves all its good dispositions.",02Oct2018,1

They weren’t like rude or anything but i was feeling like i was distancing them with my behavior.

42,"I frequent a park with my dogs, I like to spend my mornings there and relax, it's a lovely way to start the day. Three weeks ago I obtained a follower, a 19 year old girl with a small dog (I have big dogs, so am in the big dog park), this girl will NOT leave me alone and I'm getting close to snapping.

She seems nice enough but I'm not there to make friends, I don't want to talk to anyone I just want to be alone. I have hinted towards this quite frequently to no avail. She honestly seems to be somewhat simple. I had initially put it down to her age but recent events tell me there isn't a lot going on in her head.

I walk a circuit around the park and stop to water the dogs occasionally, and she follows me everywhere I go. I have changed the time I go (still in the mornings, as it gets too warm for my dogs in the afternoons), she will arrive early and wait in her car for me to arrive. It's honestly not safe for her dog to be in that park, I have pointed this out to her numerous times, the thing is 14 years old and the size of my dogs' left foot, it's only a matter of time before it gets hurt, I suppose that would sort out my issue though..

Every single day she follows me around, talking about absolute nonsense that I really could not give two shits about. If I hear the phrase, ""well I'm a vet nurse so I know these things"" again, I will probably snap. It doesn't help that she's not a fucking vet nurse..
I don't want to be rude, I would feel horrible (I wish I could do away with empathy and just get it done), but I need her gone. before I do snap and say something horrible to her.

I've looked to going elsewhere but there is nowhere else that is this large and fenced in in my area, I'd have to drive a fair way out. I've tried walking away when she engages in conversation with other people, she will stop talking and follow me. Today I made it quite obvious I was trying to outpace her, then when she caught up I would walk in the opposite direction... The silly fool would continue her babble and be following close behind. People think she is with me and I'm honestly embarrassed..

I know, I'm an asshole, I don't know how to deal with most social situations so I stay the hell away from them, I've never had one follow me before... Any suggestions would be appreciated..",02Oct2018,1
43," 

I'm 17, I've been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression quite some time ago, but now i'm beginning to think i may also be apathetic.

When I say apathetic, I mean I have real trouble feeling strong emotions towards anything at all.

I don't feel that sense of excitement I know I once did and still should have about certain things. I don't feel a strong emotional bond between my friends like I used to, but I still know I care about them and would drop my problems to help them, it's not a lack of empathy, more like i'm missing so much emotion that I know I used to feel, but can't remember what they actually feel like.

One of my biggest problems is with romantic relationships. The one thing I want is to grow up and find a girl that can make me feel some fucking love in me again. I want to be able to grow and make my own family with someone I truly feel a strong bond with. I remember early high school I really did feel love and strong emotions for one or more of my girlfriends through different periods. Since then I've had numerous relationships with people and I just don't feel anything strong towards them. It's not getting a girlfriend i have a problem with, it's feeling strong emotions for that person. I can care for them, sure. I just don't feel like i'd care much if they up and left me or I did the same. Because of this, I've broken some hearts out of fear of it dragging out too long and end up ending it only a couple/few months in.

I've found that getting drunk brings some sort of emotion out in me, sure it's all a blur in the morning, but I feel happy, energised and even sad at times like I just can't achieve when i'm not drinking. Obviously that isn't a long term solution and will degrade my quality of life if continued consistently.

I'm just trying to find anything, anyone that will help me feel again. I'm so desperate to feel.",02Oct2018,1
44,"The only reason I took this job was because I had to quit my old one due to a technicality, and my next job doesn't start until next year. On paper, it's the same role as my last position, though the pay is a solid $5/hr less. It's the nature of the job to get booked and cancelled on short notice. At my last job, this meant being booked a day, sometimes a few hours in advance, and being cancelled occasionally. At my current job it means being called every goddamn morning at 5 am to cancel my shift that day, then more often than not being called 20 minutes later just as I've drifted back to sleep to rebook me for the same start time at the same goddamn facility, only now I don't have enough time to take the goddamn bus and have to pay $12.50 for parking. Last week I was booked for 4 shifts and EVERY SINGLE ONE of them was cancelled! It's reached the point when I'm genuinely surprised when I DON'T get cancelled, or when I mark myself available for a day and DON'T get called with 40 minutes notice at some stupid hour of the morning. Often I have reason to suspect that ALL my shifts at a certain facility have been cancelled, but they still don't bother calling me about it until 5am on the day of! Because I get constantly cancelled I also have to be constantly available to work, otherwise I wouldn't work at all, so I can't leave the goddamn house without an action plan for what to do if I get called and maybe a change of work clothes. Every waking hour of my goddamn life is spent either working or worrying that I might get called to work! The kicker? I only end up doing like 20 hours a week!

Also, lately they've been booking me to work as a cleaner instead of the job I was actually hired to do, which blows chunks not because I think I'm above cleaning, but because I don't know how the fuck to do the job! The one person who bothered showing me what to do turned out to be cutting corners and I'm STILL getting told off for doing things the way she showed me! I'm sorry I don't know the exact minutiae of how to arrange the tissue box relative to the remote control! I'm doing my best, but no one actually trains the temp!

50,"I’ll be the first to admit.. I miss it. And I took it for granted. The freedom of doing with you want without the toll of paying bills. It’s unbeatable. 

There’s 2 of us, and let me tell you why and how we dropped out. Me and my boyfriend met in college. Both on a sports team. We then joined another team in a different city to do on the weekends (Friday Saturday and Sunday) while we did the school team (Monday Wednesday Thursday) on top of full time school. Things went well at first. Classes were easy as hell. I had good professors. But then the extra curricular activities became more demanding. We eventually stopped going to classes because we had no time for shit. 0 weekends. 0 week days without class and extra curriculars. Instead of being smart and just quitting the extra stuff we ended up just not going to class. 



Anyways, fast forward to the end of the second semester and my gpa was literally a .69. Like..? How did I even do that. I HAD ALL A’s THE FIRST FEW MONTHS. So we got kicked out lol. We decided to hide it from our families and move in together and work until we figured it out. It took us a year to get good enough jobs to afford a 1 bed. But we have it now and it’s nice. We buy what we want. It’s not terrible. But we hate working and feel stagnate. 



Sooooo we have decided that we want to go back to the school we flunked out of. And NOT do any extra curriculars this time. The goal is fall 2020, when we were supposed to Graduate originally. But I’m a believer in the whole “there’s not clock on your life thing” so I don’t care what age I am in college as long as I’m not out of my 20’s. If we make it by fall 2020 I’ll be 23. Our current obstacle is how we are going to get there. We have to take 2 semesters worth of classes to raise our GPA’s back up. We plan on doing a few online courses at community college at a time until that’s achieved. Now the big thing is funding. I don’t know how much online community college classes are. And my boyfriend has to pay off his current loans from the first year before he can get funding again..? Does anyone know if there’s a way around this? Also what about SATs and that other placement test they make you take? I don’t have my scores from 2016 and I don’t remember them either. 


In some sick twisted way I actually don’t completely regret dropping out because I learned some life lessons and got good with my money. I feel like going back to school now after working with bills would be so much easier. ",02Oct2018,1

I’ve had some pretty shitty birthdays but yesterday’s was definitely the loneliest. I’m stuck living at home with an abusive mother who purposely made it a point to make me think she hasn’t gotten me anything as retribution for things she’s not happy with me about. But she did get some something, a shirt that doesn’t fit. I guess that’s better than nothing? Either way, her point was made.

A couple friends texted me happy birthday and even a few more on Facebook but I didn’t have any plans. I spent it at home, eating pizza and watching Netflix. Only one close friend wished me a happy birthday and kept talking to me. She’s the only one who knows how much pain I’m in, my insecurities, how broken and fucked up I am. Even though it was my birthday we still managed to only talk about her anxiety and the new guy she’s seeing. I gotta swallow my pain to help her with hers.

I’ll admit I’ve been lucky enough to have one or two good birthdays. The last one was organized by the girl I mentioned above. She got a bunch of people together and took me out for a few beers. It was a lot of fun. And the one before that my ex did the same and then we spent the night alone together. She even got me the most thoughtful gift I’ve ever received.

59,"Heads up: This might be a bit of a downer for some of you, but I really want to get this out there. I have always regretted this. Not taking the initiative. It's been over 2 years. Almost 3 years now. 


I met someone that i felt a real connection to.  She was Cute as a button, but I just never took the initiative. It's really tough for me to talk about, but here goes. I don't know, just read and tell me if you think i would've had a shot, or if it would be smart to actually talk to her again.


It was my first year of college when i met her, there was a group of friends i used to hang out with in high school. They were sitting in the lobby, talking. Since i didn't have anything else to do, So i joined them. She was with them. One of our friends introduced us, and said she was new in town and didn't have many friends here. We talked a bit and the next day, i saw her again, so i went up and said hello. We talked for a bit, and every day after that we would talk to each other, sometimes up to a half hour.


We were very similar. Seriously, like scary similar. It really felt like i met, like, a duplicate of myself. Except, you know, female. We were similar in a lot of ways, similar values, hobbies and even similar personalities. Plus, neither of us drove. We both got picked up by somebody. We also hate tomato, yet love ketchup and spaghetti sauce and pizza. The only difference I ever really between us was that I like anime and she doesn’t. The biggest part for me, however. Was politics. You see, i am a conservative. That's just how i've always been. Now, i've always heard about how left leaning college campuses are. I never honestly expected to run into another conservative. especially one so incredibly vocal and active about their beliefs.


I started to like her, she might have felt the same for me, i don't know for sure though. I saw a few signs, nothing certain, but still. I know she always laughed at my sense of humor. I have a very weird sense of humor, i think it's called dry humor, but i make a little ""quip"" about almost everything, and most people think it's bizarre or stupid. It's gotten me a lot of weird looks, but not her, she always bursted out laughing whenever i would. I've never really was able to make anyone laugh like that. And some of the things i said were really stupid. Our first meeting, we only learned each other's first names. The next time we met, i learned her last name. Her last name is also that of a celebrity and i just said ""Any relation to (that celebrity)"". Laughed like crazy, she asked me for mine, i told her mine, she said something about it, like what country of origin it is because i have a fairly unique last name, it's german, then i just said ""Hey, maybe next time, we can learn each others middle names"" more laughing. My celebrity impressions also got a kick out of her. Then there was the time a celebrity died, she was on her phone and said something about it, and I just remarked “well, looks like Hillary just got another vote”. But, i think most i've ever made her laugh was a joke i made. It was something about Hillary Clinton and having something fall on her. I just said ""If that happened, i wonder if her feet would curl up and slink back under it.""


Yes, my quips were stupid, but they got a laugh out of her. Every time. Everyone else gets weirded out and annoyed by my humor, but not her. They always got a laugh out of her. And I enjoyed making her laugh, she always had this cute laugh, which she’d snort. That’s the only sign I ever got from her, well that and she always tried to high five me and shake my hand if that means anything


Anyway, we were also both somewhat shy people, so i never made a move, she didn't either. And for 2-3 days a week for almost a year, we talked every time we saw each other, not just saying hi as we passed each other, but we would sit in the lobby together after class, talking as we waited for our rides to come to pick us up, which sometimes took up to a half hour. Every day, she'd talk to me, just me until her sister picked her up. About life, some favorite interests we had in common. It was really nice and I actually looked forward to it. Then there was the last day before Christmas vacation, I sat at a table, we sat at the same table and talked for almost an hour before her family came and got her. Exclusively me. She didn’t glance at her phone, except to call her family that class was over (we had our final exam that day), but it took only about 20-30 minutes and class was generally 3 hours).


We had the same math class my first semester, but the second, however, we didn’t. Our paths just crossed because we had the same schedule. I mean, I had a girl, with whom, I had a solid connection with and saw every day. But I never did anything about it. My first semester, I didn’t know her as well as I did the day before Christmas Break. I thought that would be it, but the next year we had a similar schedule again. I still didn’t do it. I wanted to, but I just couldn’t formulate the words to do it. I’d always freeze up before I could do it. I just kept telling myself “next week, I’ll surely do it next week” but weeks turned to months and before I knew it, the semester was over. She was gone the next year. She transferred to a university (it was a community college). And my chances were lost forever. I never saw her again.


She was smart, she was cute, she’s one of the few people I’ve met who actually really liked my sense of humor, she always wanted to talk to me and even approached me on her own, she seemed interested in me and I just let her get away.


i kind of miss her, and still, honestly, have some feelings for her. I am friends with her on Facebook, but have never messaged her. I mean, over 2 years has passed since that time. Since we’ve talked or communicated whatsoever. I really miss her, and letting her slip by it definitely one of my biggest regrets. In the time, she's graduated, but she hasn't posted anything about a boyfriend, getting married, or anything. She posted about how fun her summer was, but everything she posted was with her sister. I still have some slight hope that maybe I still have a shot at rectifying things, but she probably doesn’t remember me anyway. I haven’t even bothered trying.

Rejected at every single company, had to chase down the recruiters at every single job to even get a response, and got the latest e-mail this morning. It is really grading on my self-esteem. I have 2 interviews today but doubt I will get either job, because rejection is a constant in my life at this point. I could just really use some positive thoughts right now, because starting the day out crying is not kosher.",02Oct2018,1

74,"VOTED. I tried to connect with her and get her to vote. She lives in Texas, and her vote can make a difference. Her vote really does matter, and she thinks she's too stupid to vote. It's too much trouble. She doesn't want to go out and do it because too many other people will be there and it's just too much of an effort. I told her that I would drive the 2.5 hours to her house and take her! She said she's too stupid to understand it all. She doesn't have time to learn about voting and about the candidates. She doesn't even know how our government works. That is where she hung up on me, crying, saying she doesn't have time to learn it all and I'm ""just criticizing her, like always."" I'm feeling very dejected, because there are so many people just like her, who don't have the desire to get even remotely involved.  I am disappointed. I really thought she was smarter, and was dumbing herself down. It may be time to give up on her. She's not going to change, she doesn't want to.",02Oct2018,1

80,"   This is pretty stupid, to the point where I made a throwaway just talk about this, so forgive me if this seems childish to y’all 

   Every time after I finish intercourse with said person, paranoia hits and I automatically assumed the worse. I go to the bathroom, run the condom under water to see if it’s broke, and it’s not; however, regardless of the fact that I know it didn’t break, I am struck down by paranoia and I can’t think about anything else. This heightens my anxiety and leads it to panicking if I don’t focus on my breathe. Before today I was abstinent for 3 months but I obviously gave into my urges. I just want to know how to fix this. I’m tired of being on the urge of having panic attacks because I have sex but my brain is stupid and it feels like it’s nothing I can directly control. It makes me feel like the only thing is to stay abstinent from sex but these are the prime time years. 

TL;DR: Anxiety and paranoia overtakes me anytime I have sex and even if everything goes okay my anxiety will follow me through the weeks. 

Even if no one replies,  I just needed to get this off my chest because it makes me feel deathly if I keep it to myself.  ",02Oct2018,1
81,"This past year I feel like I’ve been taking huge steps back in self love,my confidence and how I choose to spend my time. I’ve been digging myself deep in misery,alone with my thoughts and overwhelmed with the countless things I need to shift in my life. I am 19 years old and trying to catch myself while I’m young so I can start living to my true potential and not age with regret. One thing that’s helped me lately is to focus on one thing at a time and to not look at it like one huge unsolved puzzle. The path to self actualisation is a slow and patient one and not to be rushed! And while you’re on this path don’t forget to forgive yourself. Mistakes are lessons, forgiveness is the first step to actual growth.

My heart starts to palpitate fast and I wouldnt be in any pain but It feels like Im going to die.

89,"This is something that has been an ongoing problem with me. I say it started a couple of years ago I just started really dreading my job. I work as a Patient Care Technician in a hospital on a cardiac step-down unit. I only make $12.50 an hour and for all that I do and see and put up with, it’s almost a slap in the face. I’m basically a glorified CNA. The thing that holds me back from getting a new job is that I’m in school and they work with my schedule really really well. I only work a couple of days a week, you really couldn’t ask for anything more. It’s that even that feels like too much for me. I don’t know if it’s the job itself or if I’m just really really not meant to work at all. I know that sounds insane but I feel like I’m almost mentally ill. I have so much anxiety and depression surrounding work and I feel mostly fine outside of work (mostly). The night before work I can’t sleep and have nightmares, I get overall anxious and I just don’t know what to do. I get along very well with my coworkers no one would know I’d ever feel this way. I just need advice as I feel I’m getting worse. The thought of any job makes me absolutely depressed and sad. Like what a waste. ",02Oct2018,1
90,"In my novel, Mrs. Harris - a dignified, decorated, always well-dressed married 39 year old professor, goes out for a silly, old-school drunken night out with the girls.

They even play beer pong.

Mrs. Harris, not drunk but a tad buzzed, gets shut out, 12-0.

The table of women giggles. Her old rival, Rachel Collins, who defeated her, says:

""Well, you know the house rules, Mrs. Harris.""

""What house rules?""

""If you get shut out in beer pong, you have to run all the way around the block...hehehe...NAKED.""

Can you please answer these questions?

How old are you and are you male or female?

How do you imagine Mrs. Harris reacting to the word ""naked""? What does she look like outwardly? What does she say?

Does she self-consciously cover her breasts over her shirt with her hands? How do her friends react? What does she think inside?

How do you imagine her stripping down and running? How fast? What items in what order?

How do you imagine her run going? What funny things can you imagine happening as she runs around the entire block?

As she makes it back, her old rival Rachel SMACKS her bare, white, jiggling ass with her hand and says WHAT that makes Mrs. Harris blush and the friends all laugh louder than ever?

I WILL get that a+ and it will mean twice as much to me as anyone else because I will have worked for that a+. I WILL make it to my dream school because I am capable of doing so. I’m smart, capable, and I deserve it. And I WILL get there. I’m NOT scared of a little hard work. And I WILL work hard to get there.

94,"Loyalty, comfort, friendship, is what my best friend had given me for over a decade. His name is Pudge and he was my dog, my brother, my best friend. Out of pain, confusion, or something else entirely, I just wanted to write out what I had just experienced only but a few hours ago.

It started this weekend. He had been ill for a while, but it was much worse recently. I had gone out with friends from my university, I had tried to joke and play, I had done so much to keep my mind off the fact that my friend was about to die, but last night, it was horribly obviously he wouldn’t make it for much longer. I was woken up today by a family member to tell me that Pudge wasn’t waking up.

I steeled myself and walked to see my dog breathing softly outside. I then sat next to him and he opened his eyes, moved his head, and gave me the biggest toothy smile he could manage. I then let him lay on me as I smiled back. He always knew when I was down that all he needed to do was to snuggle up to me and smile. It always brightened my day through my roughest times.

I decided, no matter how painful, I had to do this for him as he had done for me my entire life. No matter what, I was going to make sure the last thing he saw, was me smiling just as big as he had ever for me. 

Guys, I probably looked like an idiot as tears streamed down my face as I cried, but at the same time keeping a big toothy grin planted on myself the entire time. I cried and cried, but my dog would soon die with the last thing he saw was my smiling face.

I love my dog. He was my family, my best friend, my brother. He was a one of a kind and it hurts more than I ever thought it could, yet I’m proud of the friendship we had over the last 10 years.

I’m attending university on the other side of the country. I got a package in the mail today from my mom with a cheque (she doesn’t make a lot of money. We’re middle class at best) and a literal box full of homemade cookies which are DAMN delicious and taste like home. 
I regret being a shitty teen but I’m gonna make it my mission to make it up to her for the rest of my life. 
Oh and she also sends me daily pics of my cat and pet Pygmy goat and last year sent me a joke valentines card from my cat for the laughs. Checks up on me everyday and always sending gifts to cheer me up. UGH

98,"Seriously, it’s literally child pornography but drawn and it’s disgusting and is the gateway to sexualizing children. Not to mention it's commonly used as grooming technique by pedophiles online towards younger kids to normalize the idea of sexual activity between adults and minors. So, the argument ""it doesn't negatively affect minors"" is a bullshit argument too. Regardless to say, it's something that really should be illegal. The only people who can view this as ""artistic expression"" are pedophiles who are better off behind bars away from children.

I looked then she said 'have you got a girlfriend?' Relaxingly, ignored her and their was a pause then the blonde girl then said 'aww leave him alone...he’s dead cute' while looking over at me smiling (idk if she said it like puppy dog cute is that bad?) and then said “he probably has” (probably has a gf) the brunette then looked at me a bot and asked me it again saying ‘have er have you got a gf’ nicely and I blanked her and then the blonde girl said laughed a bit and said ‘ aww leave him alone now hes fumin” .
