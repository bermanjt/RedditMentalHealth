2,"I know everything I need to do to have a better, healthier life. I need to stop spending all my money on drugs and doing drugs, start eating better, etc.. 


It's just so hard. I know a lot of people can relate. The first step is crawling out of the hole, out of the decrepit nest you've built for yourself, and doing all the things you aren't use to doing. Like eating breakfast, and having a schedule. Going grocery shopping and preparing nutritious meals. Not doing drugs every day, rendering yourself broke and unable to pay rent.  I know what I have to do. It's just.. oh man.",29Dec2018,1

She makes me feel like crap about myself on a daily basis just through her constant needling. and that's just when shes in a good mood and thinks shes being helpful. But got help you if you disagree. There was a year in which i wasnt living with her where I was confident, I had a social life. I could really even say that i was happy.

5,"So I was applying for a full-time permanent position in a healthcare profession (involved in cardiac surgery). I didn't get the job but they offered me a ""temporary position"" until April, that's when the person that they ""want to hire"" becomes available. So I'm pretty much just a ""filler"" until the other new hire, I'm only there until April. 

I feel like the team I am working with (team of four), doesn't really care to teach me anything or show me where all the medical equipment is, or just put in the time to orientate me properly because I'm just the ""temporary filler"" position.

This makes me so demotivated to work even I always go out of my way to learn and to help out. It's so discouraging but at the same time, I didn't have any other offers to take at the time and I needed to take this position to ""buy time"" so that other job postings can pop up. I know what some people will say, that many if they like me enough, that they'll offer me a permanent position if I excel. Well, even if I give my 110% until the day my contract expires, I really don't think that they will.

8,"So first off, I'm not sure if this is the right sibreddit and if this post violates any of the rules I will delete this post.

Since I was around the age of seven, I have been bullied a lot. I don't know why it happend, but I know it did happen, often. When I was ten somebody from my year groped my butt. I still don't know of it was just teasing or that she was dared, but it felt horrible. I still am incredibly uncomfortable with human contact. 

After that incident I decided to change schools. I had a great last year there, but after that it was time for me to go to highschool. (In the Netherlands we have eight years of primary school and six years of high school, also maybe important to note that I skipped a class and was thus a year younger than everyone else)

High school to me should have been a brand new beginning, but it wasn't. The bullying got a lot worse than it had ever been and after a year I decided to attempt suicide. However, because it was more of an impulse than a well thought out plan, I survived. My school decided to step in and honestly did a great job and in my second year not only did the bullying stop almost completely, but I also found some actual friends. 

This went on for three years and every year I would get a tiny bit happier. However, for some I reason I had trust issues and believed my friends were doing things behind my back. That they didn't actually like me and were just pitying me. Because of this I got kind of detached of them and suprise suprise, because of this they started to do thing without me.

This truly hurt my feelings and I felt like I wasn't good enough for anybody. The first half of my fifth year I felt truly alone. It was better than the bullying, but it still sucked. That's when I found my current group of friends. With them everything feels different, better. And after hanging out with them for about fifteen months I think I can let everything go. Accept that what happened to me was shitty but that that doesn't mean the rest of my life is shitty too. I feel like thanks to them I can let everything from my past truly be my past and not my present. And I don't know how I can tell any of them without making them feel really weird so I'm telling some strangers on the internet.

If you read all of this, thank you very much. I'm kinda crying right now, but I just want to everyone to know that someday things are going to look up and be alright.",29Dec2018,1

12,I know it’s just a dream but it’s been bothering me a lot lately. Literally I dreamed I was rubbing my sister’s p*ssy. It feels so wrong that I dreamed of this. Its my first time. It’s really not a big deal (I think) but I need some sort of explanation/reasoning to explain this. I definitely don’t feel any attraction towards any of my sisters. I swear.

13,"Confessing this isn't easy for me, I am 21 years old and female, I have always been stable, almost ascetic in my way if livibg and I like it that way, it gives me control and srabiluty not getting involved in romantic or even sexual endevours, humans often make terrible decisions out of lust or love, I dont want to be one of them. I don't want to lose my rationality, my neutrality.

It's not like I never had an opportunity to experience physical intimacy, but I always avoided or declined, and I dont regret those decisions.

The past 3 years have been rough, almist dying due to constant malnutrition due to an illness, no real support from family or friebds, having had surgery 3 months ago I am now recovering.

I had hoped that this wish for someone I could wrap my arms around, embrace, tell my feelings and have them touch my scars would fade now that I finally feel better, but I feel like it is just getting stronger. 

I havent met a person I would even want to get intimate with either.

The best thing would be something like a throwaway human, you can dispose of after an hour and never have to face again. Or a clone of myself.

Everyone else is telling me I overreacted and that I may have crossed his boundaries. I'm afraid he'll be mad at me when he wakes up. But did I really overreact? This is the situation he was in:

-We were outside, at night, during winter and he was totally unconscious.

-I couldn't call his relatives or friends because his phone had a PIN.

-I couldn't have dragged him ANYWHERE. We were like 5 minutes away from any public space.

22,"Let's imagine this happens Budd Dwyer style, blown brains on Live TV. Let's see what the pluses of this would be for Donald.  


1. He would dance away from any fallout from the plethora of investigations, any Congressional subponeas, or the looming economic downturn. Because he would be dead.
2. Not living would probably make the Mueller investigation, the state level investigations, even anything else that he may be linked to probably be settled because you can't convict a dead man.
3. Death has a habit of canceling out all the bad things a person has done. ""President who killed themselves"" is much more memorable in the eyes of history than ""Affluenza-racked Narcissist Perverted Asshole Rapist"".
4. Such a end might, especially in his mind, get Ivana's kids off the hook because, well, it would be in poor taste to indict them so soon after their father killed himself on live TV.
5. This would sow even more of the discord that Russia so badly wants. What way to own the liberals one more time than to put them in the position of celebrating the death of a suicide victim.
6. If he hates being President so much, this would end it without any real embarrassment to him. His suffering would end.

As for America, there would be pluses there too.

1. Yes, this means President Pence. But I think any resistance would double down on him and I don't think the base that went for Donald would go for an out and out theocrat with a poor track record.
2. Pence gets demolished in 2020 and the GOP can clean house and realign itself. Notice how all those Confederate state folks have little nationwide traction and it took a freaking fraud to win on a technicality? The GOP long term would be better off with a Charlie Baker than a Tom Cotton.
3. Donald is a cancerous tumor on the American body. By being dead the tumor could finally be removed and healing could begin. And by healing I don't mean doing like Ford and Obama did and reconciliation, I mean something more like...
4. Germany couldn't begin \*Entnazifizierung\* until Hitler was gone. With Trump gone, the GOP would be in a greater shambles than after GWB and perhaps we finally could finally get rid of all the bad elements and start anew.
5. If there is a silver lining in a President committing suicide on live TV, it is that it may finally force the US to have a discussion about mental health and trying to find treatments for NPD and BPD and all sorts of other mental illnesses.
6. The mental health needs of elderly men are often neglected, politics demonstrates this. This would finally force us to try to do something because for every Donald there are tons of other men silently suffering who see suicide as their one out of other pain.

I don't see the downside of all this at all. Do you?

But racism of any form is still wrong right? I can't wrap my head around the idea that I should be understanding of some ""prejudice"" due to socital inequality. How does that work?

I wasn’t sure when exactly I was getting off, and this caucasian guy with a beard, a hat, I think a flannel with a shirt under, a back pack, and a stainless steal water bottle with a whole bunch of stickers on it, including the one that stuck out to me the most, the Kauai coffee sticker right in the middle could tell I was confused and asked me where I needed to be.

I’ve lost 30lbs, took up lifting weights and got braces. I bought music production equipment. I remodeled my bedroom and got a new car (parents helped greatly with that part).

And I have PCOS, which is minor in comparison, but basically I'm at a higher risk for infertility and cancer?? It causes irregular periods. I take birth control to get regular periods and lower the chances of cancer. But with the birth control, my migraines might be getting worse.

I couldnt even try to keep a conversation going for 5 minutes. When i meet others i try my best to entertain them and tell them everything about me. Then conversations get boring as hell..

They would send nudes to other guys without them asking for it. And i had to fucking beg for it. They didnt care about me they didnt like me they didnt love me and never valued me. Its like this most of times in real life too. 
Its how it is. I get jealous of others guys girls chasing them. Never happened to me before.

It's been 163 days of 4-5 hours a day nonstop studying including my chemistry major and getting my Gpa back where it needs to be for an upward trend. Balancing school, research, studying, volunteering, assignments, and being basically alone in my university makes masks this feel insurmountable. 

I've been getting chestpain from the stress of these past three years of college, and went into vasovagal syncope from it once when I was playing tennis. I have developed nervous twitches and my right eye won't stop twitching for the past week. Furthermore motor tics have developed in my neck that randomly make me look to the left unwillingly. 

It's like swimming with weights and each island is farther than the last. I don't even remember what it feels like to have a clear mind, and now the stress has finally taken my one escape which was sleep. 

I've exercised, I've taken all the necessary ways to better myself, and no matter how long of a break I take I can't shake away the stress, it feels like absolute chaos, at this point I can't even force myself to cry to relieve this feeling.

47,"So this is mostly a letter to myself, hopefully to deal with this situation to move forward. 

From the beginning, my first true experience with anxiety is when I witnessed my mom experience it. She was sick for a good portion of her life and I was with her at a doctors office. I was holding her hand and we were waiting for something. Her hair on her arm stood up and she instantly became sweaty. I asked her if she is okay and she said it was just anxiety and she just needed to breathe.

Later, after she died, I had to deal with a lot of the paper work. I knew of anxiety but never experienced it. I had to make phone calls and I remember being super tense making calls. I made a call and I remember hearing a ""business type answer"", and rage came over me. I'm not an angry person, but I went and punched a wall (never done that before). I didn't see red, but I was about there. I don't even remember why it made me that angry, it was just pure anger for some reason. The following week I had to make another call. Just a basic one. I suddenly got angry again. From no where...just full on rage. I had to leave the house to take a breath.

I still have work I need to do, but it's hard for me to do it. Everytime I pick up the phone to call someone now, i can feel it. I try and text everyone now. It sucks because my job requires me to make phone calls to businesses. 

A year ago I went on a true vacation out of the country. When I came back I was so relaxed and focused that I didn't have those experiences as much (at least not as violent).  So I'm planning another vacation. It's hard to talk about because most people with anxiety will talk about how they feel how they have to get away from people and how it's a fear type issue. For me I don't experience the fear (at least not for long), and go straight to anger. So it's harder to talk about, and people to take seriously.

I feel very, very hungry and I'll be on my feet all day. I should fuel my body.

But I just can't. I'm so anxious. I'm still high strung from the drive. I've got that pit in my stomach as well as an intense hunger. Eating is the last thing I want to do, even though all I can focus on is my hungry stomach.

I don't know what to do. I just hope work (which I enjoy a lot - I have a great job) can help me take my mind off the drive. Thanks for reading.

52,"In my last post I had a list of all my self diagnosed problems. I don't think all of those are true. Maybe some of them are, maybe none of them are. I do however suffer from something. It's hard getting out of the bed in the morning, it's hard sleeping at night, and it's hard doing anything productive on my days off and when I get home from work. I leave all my projects unfinished, I don't do art anymore, and I barely leave the house. I don't think I'm sad. I just don't feel anything right now. Just nothing and anger that wells up inside of me. Is there a word for that? Is this depression? 

My insomnia has gotten exponentially worse since I was a kid. Now I experience regular nightmares revolving around the places I've been abused with the people who have abused me in strinkingly vivid lucid dreams that stay with me. I feel like I can never escape them. I wonder if they'll ever go away or if this is a burden I will always carry with me. ",29Dec2018,1

56,"It all started with nightmares. Nightmares every night that don’t make any sense they are just scary and traumatic. Sometimes they involve people or places I know, but mostly they make no sense.

Then it started with intrusive thoughts that don’t make any sense, but give me intense anxiety. And when I say make no sense, I mean it. For example (the most common anxiety inducing thought) is a thought of a picture of a sunflower that increasingly gets more and more dirty and bubbles up until it explodes. Makes no sense right? Well I can’t get it out of my head and makes me panic.

Then it escalated from there, to occasional voices. Sometimes I hear what seems to be a group of people whispering aggressively in my ear. I don’t know what they say but it frightens me and I often have to leave the room or turn on a light when that happens. 


I don’t know what the fuck is going on and I hate having to deal with this. I haven’t told anyone, and I don’t know who I would tell. Plus, I don’t wanna lose my job and I know I would under these circumstances.

57,"Yesterday I went to church around 11:30 pm last night. For the first two hours we sang, read the Bible,  and prayed. Then around the end (2:00am) the Mans of God started getting into some prophecies. There was one women who was saying she wanted money as a joke,  everybody was laughing but the Man of God took it seriously. He told this other women who had a huge bag to take everything out of it. When she did he made her hold the bag upside down and shake furiously multiple times. He then took the bag and gave it to another person so they can check it, it was empty. 

He then took a hair tie wrapped it over the bag, and gave it back to the owner. We then started singing a slow song while the women held up the bag and walked around the room. After 5 minutes of that we stopped and no money fell out. The Bishop again proved the the bag was empty again and gave it to a different women. We did the same thing as the first,  and again it did not work. 

The bag was proven it was empty again but this time it was the man of God who was going to be holding it up. We sang and sang for what felt like forever. While he was walking I saw something very blurry quickly fall to the ground. At this point people were getting out of their seats to get a closer look. Another one fell, then another one and another. The man of God stopped walking and we all clapped and cheered. I really didn't know how to feel because in the beginning I was lowkey doubting it. Last night just proved to me that God is real for me, and that there is many things he can show us.

59,"So my dad has fallen into the conservative filter bubble of facebook, and though I've tried to explore lain it, I don't think he or his generation will ever understand how social media isolates and confirms biases.  

He's constantly just sharing stuff from his own political niche, and the number of likes and shares only confirms that others feel the same way.  Thing is, they're just preaching to their own choir, and driving away those of us who tire of seeing the same hyperpartisan stuff posted over and over.  My mother in law is the same way.

So my goal this year is to start posting links to other things they enjoy (for my dad, it's always been cars), to encourage them to look elsewhere for fun things to share and ways to interact.

I’ve had some major fits recently of crying and I feel like I have a headache almost every day. I hate my life and everything honestly feels so unimaginable hollow and unimportant. I just want this all to stop. 

I’ve had a huge increase of hateful thoughts too. Especially racist ones. I’ve been thinking very positively on Nazi Germany. I know this is something new, I’m not a white supremacist and I’ve never been one. I’ve had a few PoC interact poorly with me and my mind instantly races to how much worse they are than me. Anytime it’s anyone poor I think about how much better of a class I’m in than they are. It’s like I’m finding the worst on anyone who slightly angers me. 

I’ve always had issues with my gender, and thoughts about that are worse than ever. I am hating myself so much and I see myself as a crazy person for wanting to change my gender. I really do hate myself.

70,"I’ve been having issues with gastritis for a few months now where I had constant pain in my stomach. My overly worried mother made me go to the ER in fear it was my pancreas acting up, and there they prescribed me Pepcid twice a day. For about a week I was taking it as instructed and it helped with acid in my stomach as well as the pain. The two weeks after that, I was taking it once at night with dinner to prevent acid reflux when I’m sleeping. 

I had told the ER doc that I had an appointment with a GI specialist for the end of this month, and I feel like he gave me the Pepcid as temporary relief for the symptoms (as he said all they can do at the ER is help with symptoms) and not intended for long term use since your stomach goes insane after extended use right? Like it keeps making tons of acid?

All’s good and dandy until we decided to buy three dozen oysters from a pretty decent oyster shop. They weren’t bad (not fishy) though they obviously weren’t farm to table fresh. I probably ate like 14-15 which ain’t nothing compared to how many I CAN eat.

72,"This happened a few nights ago, a little after 1:00 am. My husband and I went out to celebrate Christmas Eve. We got a hotel in a bigger city nearby and had a great evening at a restaurant downtown. As it turned out, a couple of our friends were also in town and just a few blocks away. We met up for a couple drinks, which turned into more than a couple. At the end of the night, my hubby and I made our way back to the hotel and eventually fell asleep.

I was passed the fuck out sleeping and suddenly I heard a little tapping at the door. Must be next door or something. I angrily fell back asleep.

Suddenly the knocking sounded loud and desperate, and half asleep, I throw open the door.

It's my husband standing there.

He's NAKED.

Totally, completely buck-ass fucking naked. Hands over his package.

There's a security guard and some other guy.

""Ma'am, is this your husband, he claims he locked himself out?""

The other one said ""Yeah and he just fucking woke me up.""

My glasses-clad only husband squealed ""Marcy I tried heading to the bathroom and went out the wrong door!""

This is too funny. We had a little ""fun"" after drinks and he must've passed out without clothes because he is so modest he never sleeps nude.

The security guard said ""Yeah the college girls down the hall called it in. Said he was streaking.""

""I was NOT streaking!"" my buck naked husband cried out.

College girls??? A group of college girls saw my chubby husband NAKED??? And thought he went STREAKING?! Oh, this is too good.

Despite being half-drunk and half-asleep, I laughed. I laughed out loud. So loud it must have echoed down the hall.

There he is. My 31 year old husband. Not fat but that slight round chubby belly he always hides under shirts out for all to see. Desperately covering himself with his hands. Bare from head to toe.

""Marcy please let me in this hallway is freezing I've been out here for over 10 minutes!""

10 minutes??? NAKED????? I laughed harder.

""Yeah yeah, nature boy is with me. Now get in here.""

He rushed past into the room, and I couldn't help it. There it was, just out for all to see, his bare ass. That round butt I have to admit I always loved.

I leaned back and gave him the SMACK of all-time as both guys laughed.

The hotel actually gave us a pretty hefty bill for violating noise ordinances and indecent exposure, no joke. But it might be worth it.

Maybe the funniest thing I've ever seen that I will never, EVER let him live down lol.

The cherry on top is that on the way back in, he accidentally bumped a table and spilled water all over the only pair of pajamas/undies he had, so my hubby had to sleep buck naked in his shame until morning next to his fully clothed and giggling wife lol.

Ladies, do you blame me for slapping DAT ASS? Lol

73,"I have a niece and a nephew, both the cutest, happiest kids you could hope for. My sister's home is in many ways everything we didn't have as kids, both parents involved, good consistent role models, never worrying about the heat or electric getting shut off. I'm excited to watch the little guys grow up.

They'll be starting school soon and she lives in a state that requires vaccination for public school attendance. She recently started talking about moving to a new state and a little needling revealed the root cause to be fear of those vaccines.

It's weird, I don't fear for the kids or anything. Sure it's obviously more dangerous for them, but realistically the odds are pretty long for a small pox (or insert your vaccine prevented disease here) outbreak to ravage their area any time soon. I'm, what? Disappointed? At a loss, more like.

I'm not going to yell at her or anything. She grew up in even worse conditions than I did, had even less opportunities. Less school, less education. She's just a frightened mother trying to do the best by her kids. I guess I'm a little more empathetic for the anti-vaxxers. They're frightened by things they don't understand and the only assurances come from people they don't trust. It's not like I can describe the pharmacodynamics of vaccines, and even if I could would we have a shared vocabulary capable of conveying the ideas?

I have a habit of getting so flustered I forgot what I'm doing.

When I take drink orders or food orders, I write it down on a notepad and always repeat it out loud to the customers. I do that when taking phone orders too.

Today, a customer called to complain they were missed an extra portion of their order... I re-checked everything, turns out they wanted TWO portions but I only put down ONE (we use a touch-screen PC system that prints everything out.)

Thing is, it's so busy I don't for the life of me remember every single order I took. If a customer phoned saying ""yes I ordered chips"" but they didn't, I would get flustered and think it was my fault.

I'm pretty darn sure I repeated the order out loud. She even told me on the phone I repeated it out loud. If I repeat it out loud, where did the second portion go? Did she think I meant two when I only said one? I'm so confused.

83,"tl;dr I am a highly accomplished woman in her mid-thirties, full of ambition, talent, and skill, but I’m chronically too ill to make use of any of it.

I have never posted anything on Reddit other than a brief piece of advice to another Redditor’s quandry, but am so entertained by what I read on here that I thought I’d add a slice of my own life story. It’s quite the read, a travelogue of bad health, really, but since I’ve enjoyed other long posts about people’s lives here and on other subreddits, there might be some who will enjoy mine as well. Otherwise, the tl;dr is the gist of it :)

I am a highly accomplished woman in her mid-thirties, full of ambition, talent, and skill, but I’m chronically too ill to make use of any of it. I didn’t use to be like this. My greatest passion is writing, and until my health went on the decline, there wasn’t a day when I wasn’t penning my musings on paper, or drawing, or making music on the piano or harp, avidly reading or studying, among a plethora of other creative outlets. The problems started ten years ago, when I began living in other countries doing volunteer work, attending university, as well as building up a career as an English teacher.

My health slowly made a noticeable dip while I lived in Thailand for two years, which was my first adventure abroad. I lost twenty pounds, was always low on energy, had trouble sleeping, and couldn’t eat much. It took me half a year to convalesce at my parents’ place back in the US before I was strong enough to hold down a regular job. By then I had been accepted into an MA program at King’s College London and was terrifically excited for my second big adventure abroad. A little over a year after I had returned home from Thailand, I went back out into the world.

Thankfully, my health did not get worse in merry olde England, but it didn’t make a full return to what it had been pre-Thailand, either. I would get tired long before my friends would when we were out exploring parks, cathedrals, and museums. My upper back would hurt, I’d feel winded, I’d feel sleepy, etc. It was always a welcome relief to return to the quiet of my single room and rest up until my next fascinating excursion.

Two weeks after returning to the US again, my brother asked if I wanted to go to China with him as a volunteer English teacher. I’d been watching Karate Kid II with my family when he phoned to ask, and had just been thinking how fun it would be to return to Asia. Sure enough, two weeks later, we were hiking the Great Wall with a group of other volunteer teachers. We were both eventually assigned to teach in a coastal city in Zhejiang province. The people in this city burned all their trash in the open. This filled the air with horrible-smelling ash that sometimes made breathing painful. I began waking up some nights, gasping for air.

(To this day--just last night even--I still have this issue. I’ll be sound asleep, and then the next thing I know, I’m sitting straight up in bed, my heart is racing, and I’m gasping and feel like I can’t get enough air in fast enough. It was very frightening when it started, but after six years of this, I know that my body eventually calms down and I can go back to sleep.)

I went back to the US with my brother, but then several months later returned to China with my sister, where we became teachers at a junior high / high school in Beijing. The air was so polluted, some days you could practically crunch down on the grit in your mouth. My breathing problems worsened to the point where I was getting almost no sleep. My short-term memory went out the window and I bumped into things as I walked. It was a sad time for me as I had been quite gung-ho about learning Mandarin, but had to stop when my brain couldn’t function.

My international insurance was great, so I went to a good hospital to get checked out. The nurses and doctors there ran many kinds of tests, including a chest x-ray and a breathing test. An ENT dropped a scope down my throat. Nothing. Everything looked healthy. But I felt horrible. An adventurous and social person by nature, it frustrated me to no end when I was forced to cancel outings with new friends I had made. Had to drop my language partner meet-ups as well. I became a dazed zombie and felt slightly sick all the time.

Eventually I went back to the US and convalesced at my parents’ place yet again, for a period of six months just like last time. Spent a lot of hours mindlessly playing games like Bejeweled and Jewel Quest. Watched whatever tv series the fam was watching while I rested, like gardeners-turned murder-mystery solvers Rosemary and Thyme and drama-filled Cake Boss. Was daily frustrated with myself for being unable to write, make music, or have enough energy to get a job, but at least I got to connect with my family.

Fast-forward to my sojourn in beautiful, peaceful Japan. By this time, my health was completely shattered. There was no such thing as a good night’s sleep. My partner of that time lived near Tokyo, and I had always wanted to experience Japan. Wasn’t going to let my bad health prevent me from ticking off more items on my bucket list. Lived there for two years, was unable to study the language, but at least I managed to (barely) keep down a full-time job—best job I ever had too. But there were many times when I had to grab a desk in the classrooms where I taught because I felt close to fainting from fatigue and constant, ever-present malaise. Went to more doctors, ran allergy tests, took a sleep apnea test, but nothing out of the ordinary ever showed up.

This time, when I returned to the US, I rested an entire year. Did a small tour of Denmark, Finland, and Italy (where I had friends / family begging me to visit) for three months during this time. This past January I moved to Denmark and married my amazing, sweet, awesome Viking, so here I reside, and hope to reside for many years yet. But bad health persists: I can’t sit still for long because my body starts to ache when I do. I’m often too tired to do too much in the day, so I end up resting a lot. This post is the first time in forever that I’ve been able to sit down and write and write my thoughts out. Feels quite good!

Anyway, that is the travelogue of my adventures abroad with bad health. Just feeling sad that I don’t feel well enough to write more, to clean my house up, to paint my walls or do all the other sundry things I was able to do once upon a time. There are many days, sometimes a week at a time, when even walking around the house to put laundry away tires me out completely. My doting husband is loving and understanding, but I can’t help but feel that it must be somewhat stressful and worrisome to him to have a languishing wife. Whenever I do have energy enough to do things, I burn out quickly and am useless for the rest of the day. He’s so loving and reassuring and helpful though, and that is a great comfort.",29Dec2018,1
84,"Just a disclaimer, I’m not superstitious at all. Idk if there’s a God, and I don’t really care.

All I know is I can’t live like this anymore. I can’t live in isolation. I can’t live with this constant fear, paranoia and anxiety. My life is like one huge bad acid trip. And if you’ve ever experienced one of those yourselves, you have a pretty good idea of what it’s like to be in my shoes.

Panic attacks every single day. Addictive (prescription) substances to fight them every single day. Social anxiety, trouble stepping foot out of my room where I rot. Everything is absolutely beautiful on the inside but on the inside I’m dying. I want to cry but I can’t. I don’t know how to. It won’t solve anything.
