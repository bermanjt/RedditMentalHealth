0,"This is the third time that someone has let their fucking dog shit on my lawn. Usually I just fling that shit on the street because fuck doing anymore work. But this time this time i had cameras installed on my house. And i find this stupid little shit and his stupid small dog on there and he let his dog shit on my fucking sidewalk.

Is there some kind of service i can call to clean up this shit for free? Or do i have to track this fucking kid down and yelling in his fucking stupid face to clean it up or punish him to cut my lawn?? This is owning a home shit. FUCK im so pissed right now.",29May2018,2
3,"I gotta vent about this, but vent is not the right word because that implies more anger. What I feel is not so ...energetic. 

He's basically a good guy, he's helped me a lot through the years, supporting me financially and handling shit that shouldn't have been his problem. So I feel like a piece of crap to even complain. We don't get along, we squabble, I yell at him like an angry teenager sometimes even though I'm 20 years past that. He needs my help and someone to lean on, he's stressed and got enormous responsibilities, and I can't get past my own selfish needs.

When he visits, he'll call multiple times to confirm pickup or meet times, so I feel nagged to death. Once we meet, it's never just to hang out or chat... we're not buddies. Our relationship is so far from that, that I can't imagine us just ""hanging out"". We have dinner together but I just shut down the whole time. The visits entail meeting at the office \(I work for him\) when nobody else is around, sitting down, and talking about everything I hate and dread. 

• The business had a bad month or two. He talks about how I need to know where it's at, financially, so I can deal with it if he dies soon. How I'd need to handle it if we had to liquidate everything. It's been a good business for 30 years but now the market is more competitive in our big specialty. He's trying to sell it to employees but they aren't committing.

• His health is not what it was, he's had ongoing problems with his foot and he loves to hike. He feels that if he can't hike, he'll die sooner. He doesn't trust his local doc and goes to great lengths to talk to the one doc he does trust. While he's travelling, mom is alone. She had cancer and went through a successful round of chemo, so she's ok for now, but it's the kind of cancer that always comes back. Also she had a fall and can't really be alone. So I'll be dropping everything to fly up there and be with her, and trying to work remotely. I don't have friends in that state anymore so it's just me and mom, which can be depressing.

• Other topics for discussion - I moved out of the family home but it's going to need expensive renovation to make it sellable, and we're on a bridge loan where basically the payments skyrocket if we don't sell it in 4 months, and it needs 5 figures worth of work. I gotta get my shit together in the new house still... changing the mail over, getting all utilities in my name, etc... I can't quite make my monthly nut and he wants to audit my expenses to know why. 

We'll awkwardly discuss things but it's mostly him talkin at me about things he's into, and I'm not, and I can't really contribute. I don't have much to say about the celtics or local politics. I feel him sometimes trying to connect and be able to chat like two normal adults, but it's impossible. And there are times he says things that just make me withdraw further. He doesn't seem to take hints or read body language, he plows ahead with conversations I'd clearly rather not have. 

I dunno what I hope to get out of typing all this, and I can't imagine why anyone would want to read about other people's problems. We all got our own problems to deal with. 

I probably come off like a huge spoiled asshole here, because I'm listing all these tough life problems dad is having and all I can think of is how I can't even bear to hear about them, much less help with them. I hate thinking about them dying. I don't want to run or deal with the business. I hate dropping everything and flying out of state every few months and being away from my friends and pets and home. I have no idea what I'll do if either of them go senile or need constant care, I don't have money for anything, not even the shittiest happy-gilmore-style nursing home. What little money I have comes from dad. The logical thing would be to get another job, work 80 hours a week, save up, and be less of a financial burden. But I can't imagine giving up my current life (which feels stressful enough) and becoming that harrassed, overworked guy who has nothing in his life except work and duty and stress. I don't know what I'll do if mom dies and I lose the one parent I can talk to and be comfortable around. I don't know what I'll do if dad dies, and lose my biggest source of support, my safety net, and mom's support as well. They're both old enough that I'm likely going to be forced to figure it out soon. ",29May2018,3
6,"Growing up, I was always discouraged to say ""I don't know,"" from my dad. From this, I always have to keep on having an answer to every single question even though I could possibly be wrong.

Fortunately, I met my best friend 5 years ago and he noticed about my habit of trying to answer everything ""correctly."" He was the first person to tell me that it is okay to say ""I don't know"" when I really cannot provide an accurate answer or have any doubt in my reasoning.

Looking back, I understand the annoyance if I keep on saying the phrase constantly from being needy, but I just cannot seem to understand that why my dad would treat this as a bad ""excuse"" and expects me to know everything.

11,"I’m 15 and I guess this post will sound really angsty but whatever.

I’m really introverted and I only made 3 very close friends, and people are really starting to change. One of our friends kinda drifted off and we just kinda stopped talking to him since middle school. Now I only have 2 close friends but they all have their own friend groups that I know pretty well, but I’m not very close with them. 

I really do appreciate my friends and I think of them almost as brothers. I was never too close to my brother and I’m still not, and my friends only have sisters. 

My lifestyle is really crap because my parents work all the time and they really only have time to check on my grades, so I spend all my weekends procrastinating and playing videogames with my friends. I feel like I’ll lose one of my friends or at least our relationship will weaken because he goes out a lot with his friends. They usually invite me but I always decline. I’m really introverted and lazy so I hate social things like that. I should probably go but I would rather just stay home and play videogames or try to do homework. Now my friend is going to Japan to study abroad for the entire summer and I won’t see him for a while. I really hope that we stay in touch.

Now besides personal relationships, I’m scared of wasting away my life doing nothing. My parents sent me to private math classes out of school, and I really was an outstanding student for a while, and I take a lot of ap and honors classes, but I’ve lost my joy for learning and I also have shit study habits because I was so advanced during the time I should’ve developed those study habits. I’m struggling to keep my averages at an A and I’m just sick of school already. Recently I just stopped caring about a career through my grades, which I hated, and now I just want to do something I love, which is pretty much just videogames and I’ve recently gotten into art. This probably sounds dumb but I think that art is the more safe or practical thing to do, but if I ever get good at videogames I’d jump at the opportunity to get a job for it. I’m really conflicted because I feel like I’m wasting my academics, but everyone only has one shot at life, so why should I spend my life doing something I hate and die regretting it, while I could do something I love and be happy for at least a little bit of my life?

13,"I try my best to not fall in love with people to avoid the inevitable heartbreak. The first time I fell in love was with a close friend of mine. We had a lot of the same interests, we knew each other well, had a similar sense of humor. Even my other friends thought we would make an excellent couple. So I confessed to him via Facebook messanger and he told me that this information ""would strength our friendship""

So yeah I was pretty heartbroken.

We continued to be friends after that. And the more time we spent together, the more his true colors showed. He wound up treating me like shit for a while after that. And even when he did horrible things I still thought ""but I love him tho""

The thing about this friend was that he was desperate for a girlfriend. He wouldve gone for literally anyone who had a pussy. But he still turned me down anyway.

It's been a few years since and there's a new guy. Another close friend. I confessed to him a few nights ago. He told me he ""wasn't attracted to me that way"". Which doesn't really surprise me, i can't imagine why anyone would.

I'm not the prettiest person in the world. Or the thinnest. Or the smartest, or most ineresting, or anything. I don't blame him for not being into me, because I wouldn't be into me either.

There are times where I think it would be better off wearing a mask all the time to hide how ugly I really am. Put on a new personality to be more interesting. Starve myself to be thinner. I am at a point where I would do anything for love at this point

16,"I'm brooding over a girl who ended up not working out and she would always say that. I hear it in my head over and over all day and it fills me with a combination of endearment and pain. That's it, that's all I wanted to say.",29May2018,22
17,"I wanna clarify and say that on a day-to-day basis, I'm pretty okay. I'm not having regular mental breakdowns or anything - I just have a hard time processing these memories (I think) and often-times they dramatically stand out against all the others.  
   
Keeping things short and simple, I did not have a super happy childhood. In my early life I wasn't really abused or anything, but my parents, their parents, and everybody else are all miserable people and it shows. My mother in particular had a very traumatic childhood, and it was painfully present in her every day as an adult. My dad's just very unemotional, even angry at the fact others have feelings. Something traumatic happened to me (with somebody else) and I was always terrified to tell my parents. I thought I would upset them, and make my mother feel guilty. On more than one occasion (before and after ) my mother had talks with me where she would cry and beg for confirmation that if I was ever sexually abused, that I should tell her immediately. My early years feel very defined by my mother and the way she was. Very very sweet, very nurturing, and other timed a terrifying woman. I have fragmented memories of her singing ""You are my sunshine"" and others of her wrapping her fingers around my little throat. My dad never really seemed hyperaware of the things she did, and was very quick to be upset when I was. I remember crying, struggling to breathe as he would grab me by the shoulders and scream at me for what seemed like forever.  
        
     
Unsurprisingly, my parents fought a lot. They both had independent substance abuse issues, and at some point we struggled really hard financially. My mom left my dad, and we moved in with my sick grandfather. I don't have too much comment for this time period. I was in my early teens, and my mother let her colors really shine in the emotional abuse department. It rarely got physical, and if it ever did it was only a little bit. Starting to beat me with a belt a bit (for no reason) but losing heart, wrapping her hands around my throat to intimidate, or shoving me into the wall for being in her way. She went through several boyfriends of varying degrees of awful (toward her) and blamed me for every failure. She was drinking a lot, leaving bottles everywhere in couch cushions, random cabinets, etc. She was taking pills a lot too, and it was all really apparent in her behavior. There was a lot of yelling at me for no reason, manipulating situations to hurt me (ie making me call my dad on christmas and saying things to make him cry and to beg her for her forgiveness and to not leave her then boyfriend). What few friends I had agreed - my house felt ""sick.""       
    
    
    
The next significant part of my life is bad. Without getting into too much detail, my mom at some point in the timeline started doing meth. She complained about there being bugs under her skin and disturbed me greatly by taking tweezers to her skin and making terrible gashes. Her boyfriend (who helped get her started) tried to ease her away from that kinda behavior, but an unstable drug in unstable people makes for bad situations. For a long time dangerous people would come and go in my house. People who threatened each other's lives, women who sold themselves for little to nothing. People had guns, and brought them there with them. Things were really unhinged, and I was pretty numb to it all. Upon returning from a vist to my dad's, my electric was out. I stayed at a motel with my mom until she kicked me out. My house was robbed 3 times, and I salvaged what I could and found diff. places to crash up until high school was done. I was 17 when she left me, so not a baby I guess. I finished high school, got into college, and left that place.  
   
        
    
   
My mother attempted suicide that following summer, and I was called to the ICU back at my hometown. Those memories are some the most intense and uncomfortable to think about. She lived, and went on to go to rehab and relapse over and over again. Periodically, she'd contact me (every 3-6 months) to tell me she's getting clean, but I haven't heard from her in a year now. She's homeless. That makes me uncomfortable. 
   

My dad took custody of my younger sister shortly before my mother got into hard drugs. He's not a nice person these days, and deals with his own demons, but he provides...
    

I got married at 19 and my husband got cancer shortly thereafter, but we were strong and got through it together pretty okay. I have a good job I like, and I'm a year away from finishing my degree now. I theoretically should have a good future ahead of me, but I'm followed by this unnecessary sadness. I'm anxious, and I have nightmares all the time, almost always about my mother. My chest hurts almost every day, and I'm nauseous so much of the time. Otherwise things are great. I want to just keep looking forward, but I always drag myself right back",29May2018,2
18,"For those who don't know, on February 13th, 2017, in Delphi Indiana, 13/14 year old best friends Abby Williams and Libby German were murdered by a man Libby captured on video while out for a hike on the Monon High Bridge right outside of town. This video hasn't been released in full but the ISP has released an audio recording of the murderer saying ""down the hill"". This recording and a still from the video, which depicts the man walking, along with a police composite, are all the police have released to the public.


I've read and seen a lot of terrible shit from crime scenes and crimes in general online, but this one, this case...haunts the fuck out of me. Maybe it's because there's so few details about the girls' last moments, or maybe it's because I was a young, teenage girl at one point in my life who just wanted, once in a while, to have innocent fun with friends without the need of having adults watching over our every move.


The fact that these girls tried so hard to stop their own deaths (with recording the man, etc) and they still lost their lives, makes me so angry. No child should go like this, and it bothers me even more that the fucker hasn't been caught even though they have a video and audio of him. It's just been really bothering me and I didn't know where else to talk about it.",29May2018,163

* ...or you'll end up drinking apple juice out of a soy sauce dish at 6pm while your roommate is doing rails of coke off the dishwasher and all you want is to go back to work somehow

* yeah I think we've all had one of those moments of clarity in the crawlspace under a late 1970s era mobile home while you're trying to figure out what's making that stupid ass sound and the godawful smell and you suddenly realize why your car won't start

* jesus christ karen do you think I expected to be bent over my garage workbench while my girlfriend ""tries something new"" and is in fact handling the strapon like she's worn it her entire fucking life and yet all I can think about is what happens when you bite into an onion

* look I'm not gonna judge you but just promise me you won't end up in a truck stop digging through your pockets for your last amex gift card so you can buy a clark reggie candy bar before you head off to visit your aunt who lives all the way in melville louisiana ok?

20,"This might be clear for everyone, but i still wanted to talk about this.

I don't really have depression anymore, at least not in the way i used to. I can't say that what i did will help anyone, but it helped me, and made me rethink some things about my attitude towards depressed people.

What i did was basically unsubscribing from depression oriented  subreddits, not just the ones that talked about it in a serious way, but also the subs based around depression and self deprecating memes. I also stopped reading all negative news and tried to look for goodness wherever i went. Now i don't know if this is what helped me improve my mental stability but i think it might have some connection. So now i think that maybe depression can spread in some cases, or at least reinforce the depression of others. And that it does this even when we try to help others.

What i think is that this means we are doing something wrong when we talk about depression. And that this could be harmful for both the people talking. But i don't know what we could change, i only have some guesses. Sometimes it feels like people focus too much on talking about why they are depressed, and this might get people thinking about all the negatives, without considering the great parts of our world, and where we are now. I know that letting people talk about their problems can be very relieving but i don't think you should focus entirely on that.

Maybe people could talk about the things they want more of in our world, or things they want to improve. This way you do start to think about what you already like, but in a subtle way that doesn't really dismiss how you feel at the same time.

So you think this could help others, and what do you think we should improve with how we talk about depression?",29May2018,3
21,"Do you ever realize at a random moments how something just clicks, like an ""oh that's why moment""? For example, you go through a weird situation where you can't process if things went well or terrible. Then later on years, months, days, hours, or maybe even minutes you realize and say to your self the ""oh that's why."" Today I realize that maybe I am not such a nice guy that my friends label me as. My ""oh that's why moment"" is when I met with some old friends from high school and we were all describing what our impressions of each other were. I recall that one of the girls called me  a ""nice"" person. I was thinking in that moment that I appreciated that, but now I am thinking why would she say that about me I didn't do anything for her.  I think I realized that she was trying to say is that I am an asshole. I realized that another example of this is when the way i treated a this down to earth girl I met at a school club. Her name was Nancy. We did hit it off pretty well talking for the first time. I even got her number, I even recall her glancing at me a couple of times with a distinct look in her eye. I thought dang I did pretty good, hopefully we see each other again and talk more. Then the time of meeting at the clubs come in and for some stupid reason I cant bring myself to say a simple Hi, and I feel like she took offence of this. I pass by her every often and wish I could talk to her again, but now I realize that I may have offended her. I even realized that I had her phone number and never texted her. I feel like such a jack ass. I don't say hi and I don't text her could make her feel like i am ignoring her or playing some stupid game. Now I realize why she somewhat looks uncomfortable every time we pass by each other. I feel genuinely stupid, but at the same time I feel like i grew a little with this small realization.

So i looked around and saw a vegetable vendor. I went up to him and asked him if he had 2 fifty rupees note. He hesitated for a while, but then gave me the change. I thanked him and paid the rickshaw driver. I went up to the vendor again and asked him the rate of potato and onions. I told him to pack half kg of both. While i was paying him i saw him move the other side and take few chillies. He put them with the potatoes and onions i had purchased. Surprisingly, he did not charge me for the chiilies. I too had not asked him to give me any. I thanked him again and walked away. Later i gave a thought upon this and realised that this was the way he thanked me for buying things from him. There were other vendors from where i could have bought, but i chose him for a return courtesy. He too was very generous and returned the favour in his own way. That evening I realised humanity still exists. People are still kind and helpful. And this happens only in India.",29May2018,6
30,"I’m not sure why but I’ve been sabotaging just about everything in my life to the point where I’m beginning to fear for my own wellbeing. 

I started working at a brewery a little over a month ago, and I love my job. It’s a lot of fun and I make way more money than I have at previous jobs, so money is never a problem. 

BUT a couple things...

I fell for a guy that I work with. He’s pretty awesome, makes me laugh... we’ve hooked up twice now. In just the last couple of days I’ve realized he doesn’t like me the way I like him. Matter of fact it’s completely about sex for him. Acknowledging that has been difficult and I still haven’t completely accepted it. Part of me thinks he’ll suddenly have feelings for me... but I know that’s crazy. I sent him nudes too, and so that kinda bothers me too, i have to see him all the time. 

Secondly, my drinking has gotten so bad in the last couple of weeks that I’m worried about myself. I had $300 stolen from my backpack while drunk, I’ve blown hundreds buying drinks and food for myself and other people. I dropped my phone and cracked the screen. I’ve spent over $100 on just uber rides in the last week. I think my dog hates me because I’m either at work or I’m drinking and don’t give him enough attention. I’ve neglected my summer school class and I’m probably failing it right now. 

Then this happened: Two nights ago, a guy offered to drive me home from the bar and instead of driving me home, he took me to a warehouse and when he realized I wasn’t going to have sex with him, he shook me around leaving bruises on me, threatened to push me out of his moving car, and only dropped me on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere because I called the police. The police wouldn’t help me because I had no idea how to explain what had just happened... I sat there on the corner and called an Uber. While I waited, I had someone pull over thinking I was a prostitute and had to tell him to fuck off. I got home fine and cried as soon as I got there. 

Yesterday I worked in the morning and stayed after work with coworkers and drank because the guy I like was bartending. We all had fun and I got to see the guy for a little while... but then I had too much tequila and spent $60 on pizza I ended up just giving away to a homeless man... don’t remember how I got home... and I’m just sitting here contemplating my life. 

I think my excessive drinking might have started when I subconsciously realized that the guy I like doesn’t really like me back. I’ve become reckless with myself, not really caring, and it’s put me in dangerous positions. I’m sad, humiliated, traumatized, torn, and I don’t trust anyone. All the “friends” I’ve been hanging out with are superficial and I’m pretty sure one of them is the one who stole my money. 

I need to stop hanging out with coworkers or going to bars after work. I need to somehow pull myself away from it all, disconnect myself from the people and the guy that I like. He doesn’t like me and the more I do all the shit I’ve been doing, the weaker I become. I need to focus on myself, my dog, my school... I need to start being good again and get past this all. I could lose everything if I keep living like this. ",29May2018,14
31,"If you peek at my other posts. I definitely had an emotional affair and feel like a complete failure. I have come out of the depression of losing this person, losing myself, and hurting my wife. 

I am still left with a fair amount of self-hate, I still miss this other woman even though I know that us not being in contact is what's best since we are both in relationships. My wife has treated me with such kindness through all of it. She knew the whole time. 

I told her I had a crush and hoped it would pass. Then at some work events it was apparent the feeling was mutual. My wife even said ""the way she looks at you, it's so obvious. You're a catch who wouldn't want you.""

We spent 12 hours a day mostly alone in an office together and became very close. Then we would text at night and weekends. It was wrong. 

I feel like such a failure.

Back in 2011 I was 10, I didn't understand the extent of how serious his surgery was. Anyway, he died in 2015 and it ripped me so violently I'm terrified of feeling that again. We were so similar and he was my friend. I hate writing the word ""was"". Every time something slightly good or funny or anything happens I always think how I'm never going to be able to share this with him, that's one of the things that hurt the most. I'm so scared of losing my mother I've had nights where I haven't slept thinking over what I would do with myself.  I have a younger sister, but we genuinely do not get along and I have no emotional connection to her what so ever. I don't know how to cope, I've felt so much pressure after he died. I feel like I'm the only one who can provide for my mother when shes older so I feel pressured into putting her first before myself. I know that sounds selfish. She doesn't speak english well and her job is minimum wage and I have potential. Every mistake I make feels like I've hurt her. I'm talking grades mostly, and stuff like taxes, bills and all.

48,"*TL;DR: If someone knocks on your door and wants to use your home as an ""advertising home"" and they'll install a security system for free, it isn't a scam but just read the contract you sign, if you end up taking the offer, carefully.*

Ok, so I've been mulling over posting this for awhile because I have been trying to figure out how to post this without violating my, now former employer's, contract with me.

*Back story:* So I am college student and was looking for an internship this summer, I had a few options but was not hearing back from the hiring managers and the end of the semester was fast approaching. So my friend hits me up and asks what I was doing over the summer and if I might be interested in an internship in a certain city in the US. I say sure since it doesn't hurt to options and end up taking the position because of how much they said their average intern makes over the summer (it's a commission based sales position). There were lots of verbal promises made, but I made the mistake of not getting them in writing. Promises included: a daily per diem and cash reimbursement for my travels to the location, both of which were not included in the contact I signed.

*Main story:* So basically this company sells home security systems, much like ADT. I will not name them, to just try to protect myself, but they are known for giving free systems and installations in addition to having smart home upgrades like doorbell cameras, thermostats, cameras, etc. Anyways, their main method of gaining new customers is by going to lots of cities all over the country between May and September, hiring college kids, and then doing door to door sales, which I don't think is the smartest method of trying to get business. However from what I've experienced, they aren't concerned with that because it's all a numbers game to upper management.

*Where the problem lies:* So when I was being trained, I learned quite a bit of useful sales practices but was told lots of things that, to me, were a bit on the pushy/used-car salesman style. Some of these things included:

* Not making eye contact unless you ask someone a direct question as that lower the chance of you being interrupted 

* Not asking to enter a home, but just making a statement, like ""lets go look at that"" instead of ""can I come inside to take a look at that?""

* Flat out making up stuff like saying you're an employee in the marketing department rather than saying you're a commission based sales rep.

I didn't agree with most of what they wanted me to do but I felt like they had a really good product so I tried to make sales by focusing on how we could help them with our service and make sure they got exactly what they needed and not pad my commission by up-selling. I knew it would be harder trying to do door-to-door sales by being upfront but I am not willing to do or say anything just to make a sale.

*Why I left:* Well lots of things I was told, directly by my manager, were only half truths about our services. They offered a lifetime service guarantee that I was told was completely free to the customer if they ever needed anything replaced or fixed with their system. Well, the replacement equipment is free, but there is fee for the technician to come out. Another part of that service plan is that if the customer moves, they just call up the corporate office and let them know they're moving and they will get a new system and their new house. Partially true again, it's only free if they sign up for another contract for monitoring, otherwise they have to buy their new system or will have to rip out the system from their old home to move to their new home.

My main concern arose when I started researching the company on the internet and found lots of complaints online from customers who were upset about things I had mentioned above believing that the sales rep hustled them or misled them into signing the contract. And when I started reading complaints online that were mentioning representatives by name, I realized that even if I sold to a customer with the sole intention of helping them with a new security system, I am putting my reputation on the line because if they have any problem with the service, I'm the only name they have. Being a broke college student, my reputation and brand is the most valuable thing about me. Trying to get a new job with the potential of being judged based on a review of an angry person that named me was just not worth the money I might make by staying at the job.

*What I would recommend:* I really do believe that the equipment is high quality. It's manufactured by an extremely reputable company and the monitoring company is also very well known. However, the contract they will have you sign should be scrutinized with a fine tooth comb. Just make sure you know what you're agreeing to. That's what lots of the complaints online were about, people getting rushed into a decision and not reading what they were agreeing to.

*Conclusion:* Its a good product sold that unfortunately is done in a less than upfront way. I'm not here to try to bash this company, I just want to let people know that if they do end up being approached by someone from this company, to not feel pressured into making a rash decision and to throughly understand what you are agreeing to.

Sorry for the wall of text, I tried to condense it as much as I could but there's so much I felt was necessary that it still ended up being a wall of text. I mean, I could probably talk for hours about this. I hope that at least one person finds this useful.",29May2018,0
49,"I’ve decided I’m not doing anything today and feel kind of guilty about it.

So let me start by saying I’m a 21 year old guy, and I work as a waiter in a restaurant so weekends are usually when I work the most. This past weekend, Memorial Day weekend which I usually love, was so shitty.

From working and moving into a new apartment on Friday, while dealing with the worst hangover of my life and like 90 degree heat. To having to finish moving after working a double on Saturday. Sunday wasn’t as bad, but the weekend ended with me having to pull a double to cover for a coworker that lied to call off, ruining my plans to go home for the first time in a while on Memorial Day. All this while living in an apartment that doesn’t have any water because my roommate didn’t have the split for the deposit to get it turned on on Friday. 

Today, I paid to get the water turned on and it will be tomorrow and was planning on driving the 70 miles back home for a few days. But my parents are dealing with a lot and kind of got a weird vibe. So 20 miles down the interstate I just got very exhausted from a shitty weekend and turned around and came back. I’m laying on my comfy couch now. 

I’ve decided that I need a day just to rest up. This past weekend was the shittiest I’ve had in a long long time possibly ever. It was very rough, and I just wanted to get it out there and off my chest thanks. ",29May2018,1

Don't get me wrong, reddit has a lot of entertaining/funny videos and useful information but watching a video of a dog do a backflip, just leave it to reddit to completely spoil imagination or simple enjoyment in something.

I’m alone in a very big house with no one but my amazing dog.

For context: my girlfriends family who live very close to me left for vacation on saturday, the mother was nice enough to leave me her car and invite me to stay in their house instead of my non air conditioned 90 degree apartment for the week and use her car.

Not complaining about the size of the house or sad that i actually have air conditioning here as opposed to my apartment but it’s eerie.

Hate the silence (have impractical jokers on in the background for company).

I have no friends in the area and just drink to pass the time.
