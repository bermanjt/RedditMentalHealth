0,"My girlfriend and I recently moved into together out of our parents house for the first time. We were so excited for our new freedom and independence. Soon after we moved out we moved out we decided to adopt a dog from the local animal shelter. Millie was her name, and she was such a sweet 7 year old Shiba Inu mix. She was timid yet very curious and we loved her. However when loading groceries into the house just a few days after we got her she ran past us and escaped. It was my fault. I trusted her not to run and I thought we had the door sufficiently blocked but she still got through. I should had the foresight to put her in our bedroom or tied her up somewhere.

We’ve posted on every Facebook page, lost dog website we could find. We also joined Nextdoor the day after we lost her. If only we joined sooner because someone posted about a dog sighting and a picture of her from the night we lost her. We went there but couldn’t find any sign of her. We went to every local dog shelter in the area. We are constantly checking Facebook, Craigslist and a bunch of other websites to see if anyone picked her up. No luck so far. Fortunately she is microchipped so if she ends up in a pound or at an animal hospital we will be notified. 

We were so excited for the future we had with her but I ruined it. I let her out and couldn’t catch her. After her initial escape I stupidly ran at her and when I got close a few times I didn’t try to calmly approach her, I ran after her with no sense of restraint. I knew about NextDoor but didn’t didn’t think to log in the night we lost her. We spent hours looking in our complex thinking she didn’t escape instead of expanding our search farther.

My girlfriend has been devastated these past few days. She’s always wanted a dog and she was so happy to finally get one. I’ve had dogs all my life but never have I lost one. I’ve been so guilty and distraught these past few days, like a shell of myself. I’ll do anything to bring Millie home and to make sure she’s safe. I’m so worried about her. If anyone has any recommendations for ways to look for my dog, please let me know. I would be so grateful for any advice at all. Thank you in advance.",09Aug2018,18

3,"I don't know why, I noticed this almost every night, usually at around 2am. At night when I'm in bed alone, my mood completely changes. Even if I was happy during the day. I become so stressed of deadlines approaching, I imagine the worst outcome of literally everything that I have going on with my life, I lose interest in my interests that I had during the day, I question my life and decisions and feel guilty of everything. 

I think about all the bad things that happened to me, I hate myself so much. I want to cry but I don't know why, I really don't understand. 

I write posts like this during the night, then the day after I delete them. Because I don't feel that bad anymore. But yet during the night it feels just as bad as I'm describing it. I don't know what I'm doing with my life, I don't know why I'm depressed right now, I want to die but I don't know why. And that makes me think that there is something wrong with me which makes me hate myself even more. ",09Aug2018,4
4,"This subreddit is like your own personal diary...although I suppose it is not very personal if anonymous users on the internet are reading or trolling, pick your poison I guess.  

Soooo I’m feeling pretty hopeful, I’m not sure why. Hopeful for the unknown, maybe. Also, it’s safe to say I’m a hopeless romantic. The hopeless part being I haven’t peeked interest in another human being “like that” in so very long. Eh, whatever. 

But it’d be nice to rent a cabin up in the mountains and stay for the weekend, maybe a rainy weekend. Where we can stay inside and read while the rain patters against the window panes. Both entranced in our novels, with a cup of tea by our sides.

5,"So, I'm just gonna come right out and say it. I write fanfiction. And I post it online. 

It's not all I write -- I do have a few original sci-fi books that I'm working on -- but it's about 95% of my work. 

I am fully aware that fanfiction cannot be published for any monetary gain, and so a few people -- my father included -- have told me in some way or another that I'm wasting my life/talent/time. 

But there are many people, most of whom have read my writing, who think my stories are really, really good, and that with some alterations to make them original, they could very well be published someday. (I plan to try and edit one of my biggest stories this way, once it's complete.)

What I want to know is, am I weird for putting so much work into fanfiction when I have several original stories on the back burner?",09Aug2018,1
6,"I’m sorry to be that guy, but I’m extremely frustrated with people at large. I’ve come to the point where I don’t really use Facebook anymore because every time I open it, I see some other thing someone’s shared, tagging  a friend saying “lmao this is so us” followed by a response of “omg literally”, or something of that nature. I have to come to Reddit to find people actually willing to have a mature conversation about fucking anything remotely serious or not very fun to talk about because the people I actually have more personal social media connections to are too absorbed in their drivel. By all means, put time into fun, stupid, ridiculous things, but take some time to face the more difficult, more unfortunate aspects of life too. I know I must sound like an ass who hates everyone (and there’s certainly an argument for that) but I’m just so incredibly done with people. Apologies for the poorly constructed off the top of my head rant.",09Aug2018,4
7,"My SO and I got engaged about a month ago. This was awesome. She told me she didn’t want a ring and she didn’t want a large wedding. For a minimalist like myself with a slow growing business, this was good news.  When her and I talked about getting married I was assumed it was on me to propose. But after the conversation she already considered us engaged. Which makes sense right? We agreed to marry each other.  True to her word, she did not want an engagement ring. I honestly did not mind buying any rings for her. I’ve been saving. But she thinks they’re a waste of money. And I will not complain. 

Today she came home on cloud nine because it is her last year of college.  After some personal set backs she’s finally graduating! She’s been working extremely hard and it’s paid off already. In her excitement she brought up the idea of having very close friends, and family come out here for her graduation. Then the evening after graduation we all go out to dinner. Bring our pastor and get married there at the dinner. And then we roll out to our honeymoon. Genius! The money we would’ve spent on rings can be spent on the trip. The money she saved refusing to get student loans, working, and working....funding the trip!  

When we told the pastor, he didn’t think we were serious. But I think she means it. I’m 100% on board and very excited.  I’m glad I found this sub, don’t really know where else to share the good news. ",09Aug2018,378

9,"I guess this applies to multiple aspects in my life. 

I feel like my willpower wanes after committing to something new for a few weeks even though I know that it takes way longer than that for change to happen. I always feel good starting something new but the feeling always dies off and then I get extremely discouraged and revert back to what I'm used to. I've try to focus on positivity and setting short-term goals but it's been so long since I've actually been able to commit to something new that isn't pre-scheduled for me (e.g. classes at school). 

This also applies to my eating. For a month I've been trying to lose weight by counting calories but I get so easily discouraged trying to do so when eating shared dishes with my parents at dinner. I've struggled with an eating disorder for a few years stemming from body image issues and I'm not sure if anything I try is helping. It's also not the first time I've tried counting calories but after the first two or three weeks I always get discouraged and feel like nothing I do is working. 

I've been wanting to pick up a new hobby, something to fill up my time that doesn't involve looking at a screen. Why is it that I find starting and committing to something new so difficult? How do I overcome this?

I'm scared that I'll never find something that I'm truly passionate about. Or that I feel like is worth working towards. 

I'm interested in what I'm studying (urban studies/human geography) but I also am surrounded by people my age who are already super passionate about a particular topic. And in comparison, I have nothing like that. Where do I start? And how do I stop comparing myself to other people?

I know I'm only 20 and I theoretically understand have time to figure this out but even thinking about all these aspects of my life that I can't seem to get in order stresses me out so much. ",09Aug2018,1

12,"I can’t figure it out. 

I’m 23. Currently working in a good job with a good salary for someone a year out of college. If I get experience in this role, I can then advance my career in practically any direction I choose if I play my cards right. 

Before I started this job about half a year ago I spent a month in south east Asia with my girlfriend

My girlfriend that I love, that I just moved in with 

I guess the area of my life that’s lacking now is friends. I feel like we don’t speak the same language anymore- even with the ones that were closest to me 

Short version: We just don’t have common interests anymore and I am tired of forcing conversations and faking relationships just because of the length of our friendships 

I love those guys and I wish it wasn’t like this and maybe it will change with time and I don’t claim innocence in terms of having nothing to do with the friendship fading but nonetheless 

I feel like I don’t belong anywhere and I can’t seem to find my place in terms of a social group. Maybe I just answered my own question 

But while this is a factor I don’t think it’s the whole story

I do have a problem with smoking/ drinking for maybe 5-6 years but it’s only when I’m bored. When I’m focused on something I have no desire to waste time on that bullshit but when I’m feeling down it’s an easy way to escape 

My family is all more or less healthy and we have a good relationship

I just want to quit my job and go travel alone but if I do that I’d have nothing to come back to. My job wouldn’t take me back, my gf probably wouldn’t either, it’d be the final nail in the coffin with my friends and my family will think I’m crazy and I’d be worse off than I started

How do I discover what’s making me feel empty/unhappy and how do I fill the void I feel whenever I am not distracted by something else...

Thank you guys for reading

13,"I have a group that has really let me down on a small consulting project, consulting for a charitable app platform to connect caregivers, people with debilitating conditions, and their friends and family together to help pay for things and do basic chores. It's a thing I have a real interest in going well since I have done some basic consulting stuff for charity efforts like this in undergrad that went rather poorly, and in this case my group members didn't pull through. 

All we want is to survey people who have needed someone to care for them while they had a disease or people who have cared for someone else, to gauge difficulty in completing daily tasks. Our results are due Friday at 1:00 PM EST and we do not have significant results. I don't know if this is the right place to get help, but any suggestions for any place to put it, including patient communities and other groups, would be amazing.

Please help me good people. I and my group would greatly appreciate it. ",09Aug2018,1
14,"So, first thing you should know about me is that I have crippling anxiety issues. It's pretty hard for me to get a post like this out here for a thousand reasons, since I'm worrying about how my problems are nothing compared to half the shit any of you guys go through, that trolls are gonna attack me further, etc. I'm trying to open up a bit so this is going to be a step in that direction.

So, anxiety, some of you probably know what its like living with it, but for the people who don't, I basically have this fear that everyone hates me behind my back, that everyone is smiling to my face and turning back to laugh at me as soon as I leave the room, that any acts of kindness afforded to me are just out of pity. Of course, I don't publicize my worries. I just smile through the pain, and just desperately hope I'm wrong. Pretty irrational, right? Why should I think everybody hates me, or even pays attention to me.

There's this song made by YouTubers JaidenAnimations and BoyInABand (Jaiden and Dave) called ""Empty"" and while its about anorexia, there's a certain line in there that really resonated with me. ""Just because you are colorblind doesn't mean you can see the colors"" My thoughts should be irrational, but that doesn't mean I can stop them.

I'm a new member of Student Council at our high school, I joined senior year but that's more so I can hang out with the few friends I trust than anything. I was just talking with someone who I'm acquainted with but not so much a friend with. We were just having a nice little conversation, and she said something like this.

""You know, you're a lot nicer than people say you are""

""haha, thanks""

...

""wait, what?""

Topic changed completely right there. Well, those irrational thoughts? Completely rational. I did the only thing I really know how to do in that sort of situation. I smiled through the pain.

Going back to the song example. If starving yourself with anorexia is being colorblind, then I just found out the colors never existed in the first place. Not for me, anyways. Everything that has ever stressed me, just barely held by the shallow excuse that, ""I might be wrong,"" just comes rushing towards me. I'm awash in a sea of my own forbidden misery, desperately trying to cling to anything that might support me. I go to one of my friends for support. I'm blunt, I ask her what people say about me behind my back.

""I don't know,"" she says with a smile

I know a fake smile when I see one. I've mastered the art myself, nobody would ever see the dam about to burst just beyond my eyelids if I never opened it up to select individuals. Maybe she's trying to protect me from the truth? Or maybe shes just like everyone else, smiling to my face but laughing behind my back.

I don't know what to do, I'm so overwhelmed and feel like I'm about to drown in my own repressed tears. I want to cry but I can't because I've spent so long trying to hide that side of myself.

So for now, I'll smile through the pain. Maybe one day I can convince myself I'm happy.",09Aug2018,2

16,"I went on vacation several weeks ago and I think that I came back with some hitchhikers. Since then, my life has slowly been dwindling downwards and this anxiousness is consuming more of my time and thoughts.


I have about 80 bites on my sides and waistband area give or take a few. However, I have never actually seen a bedbug or even signs that they exist in my room. The only evidence left behind are the bites and the tiniest droplets of blood left on my sheets.


The worst part about all of this is that I haven't seen a single one so my imagination is running wild. We threw out an old comforter, foam pad, pillow, and backpack just as precautions.


We called in a professional exterminator to inspect the house the other day and after about an hour of inspecting my room, the couch I had moved to, and my bags, he said that he didn't see any bed bugs himself. I thought that it was pretty thorough and he definitely seemed to know what he was talking about. He said that it could be just a single bed bug that is really, really good at hiding, or perhaps something else. The thing is that if it was something else, I don't think all the bites would be localized in one place. The bug(s) must be somewhere I can't find or see.


I've looked so many times. I keep taking apart my bed, shining my flashlight in cracks, inspecting the sheets... I swear I spend about an hour each day just looking around my room. If I found at least something, I might be able to calm down.

Three days ago, we kissed for the first time. The day after, she called me and told me she felt really bad after the kiss. She didn't have any relationship before, physical contact was always difficult her. She told me she couldn't have a relationship with me.

And of course, it hurt. It hurt a lot, I get attached quite quickly. But after a while, after the pain stopped being so overwhelming, I can appreciate the whole experience.

In high school, I had my teachers recommend I not take AP level courses. I took them anyways, got A's, and was eventually admitted to a top 15 school in the nation.

I love my family, but I am lonely. I don't have anyone to share anything with anymore. I'm tired of the silence. I can't cry anymore, I haven't been able to.
I have a lot of problems from my teenage years that have carried on into early adulthood that keep me from relating or connecting to people. 
I was a member of a recovery organization that put the idea in my head that I'm not a worthwhile person until I'm healed.

I am rejected often, I don't blame anyone in particular or women for this (I am a man) or have anger about it, I'm just sad I can't get anyone to like me.
It's hard for me to love myself anymore - I used to be good at that. 
I have been taken advantage of a lot of times. I come from an environment where you don't complain about this - I don't, can't, but it still feels really bad.
I can't get over some things from years ago - they still haunt me.
I try to force myself to be positive, I can't anymore.
I don't feel like a person because I don't think I've been treated like one.
I don't bitch or complain about harsh circumstances. I don't know what's a justifiable complaint anymore, though.
I take responsibility for my actions, but I keep coming up short.
I've only ever met 2 people I can truly relate to - one is gone from my life, one is dead.
I have friends but am romantically lonely. I just want to hold someone. I want to feel wanted. I never have.
I don't think I've ever felt like someone loves me - even though I have people around me who say they do, and I say I love them back, but I can't feel it.
I'll do absolutely anything and everything for my friends and family, but it's very hard to get the same level of loyalty and devotion from others.

Later that day I  went in to my advisor and I sat there about 10 mins (I thought she’d of wanted rid of me quick tbh?) she asked me about getting to work and how much it usually costs etc. I felt bad and there was an awkward silence as she was writing the paper form out for the bus pass, so I apologised again she then said 'it's alrigggghht' (but sounded annoyed or maybe a nice way of saying it idk) I then explained my manager questioned me about it and she seemed surprised like wtf and said 'did he?' And then she said 'just we have to contact them to confirm your employment' Then I said 'Its ok I understand' and she went quiet as she written the paper form out for me then just asked when I’m next in (my new job) I said tonight and she said ‘tonight?’ Idk why.  A moment later she passed me the form and I stood up to go and said thanks, then she leaned forward slightly sitting down with her hand out and said 'awwwwwwwwwww, awwwww (more like rrrrrrrr) (it was prolonged than what I typed like an gap filler tongue tied I think) and said a few things then I said ok and slowly walked away (out of nervousness) she then said 'let me know if you need anything else' I just said ok and slowly walked away and then she said ' oh..and I'll stay in contact to see how your getting on, I'll contact you by email if that makes things easier for you' and smiled (I mainly Contacted her by email) (she said it all upbeat and bubbly) I said 'oh ok thanks, great' (I'm really shy)she said 'awww ok' then she turned back around sitting on her chair and said 'oh and...(I turned around) well done' and smiled and then turned back to her computer. she said well done a lot since I got that job.

It's been real back and forth about whether or not anything more is gonna happen because of the circumstances and I'm pretty ok with it either way, I haven't invested much into it but I do hope to spend more time with him. I'm just not at a point where I'd be brokenhearted if he said ""let's not pursue this further"". What would suck is that the friendship would be permanently fucked if not totally dead. 

 For years I've had my little secret crush on him and it was kind of fun. I'd dream about him and laugh at myself when reaching for my phone to text him in the morning like that wouldn't be weird at all.. . I'd like all his posts on social media, and leave little heart eyes cats in the comments. He'd leave his bedroom shirtless while I was hanging w his roommate and I'd say, ""damn boy, why haven't you been snatched up yet?"" with a wink and giggle, and it wasn't ever weird. 

Now we've fucked and flirted and talked and went on a date, the whole deal, and everything is a damn chess game. 

Am I texting too much? Not enough? Did I initiate too much? Not enough? 

Oh shit I left him on read for an hour fuck. I didn't mean to, I hope he doesn't read into that.

 Hmm new instagram post... Better not like it, might look weird that he has one like on every post (literally never bothered me before at all and all of a sudden I worry about that). 

Oh this is a good meme I should send it... On second thought maybe not because i already sent him a cat pic and an inside joke and he hasn't responded yet.

His roommate, my good friend, invited me out, cool I'll swing by the house and we can get ready together, we can share a cab to/from the bar  and I'll crash there.. Actually that might be weird for him better shoot him a text letting him know what the plan is... Better yet let's just meet at the bar and skip the whole coming over thing, I don't want to invade his personal space...

Maybe I'm entirely in my head but barely anything had happened but everything changed as soon as I told him I liked him as more than a friend.

Someone amazing sat across from me on the train who punk too. Most people to approach me just smile and tell me of local rock n roll' shops but she was different.


She already had me beat on the edge factor and had everything I wanted. The odd thing was she approached ME, and asked about my patches just before my stop. It was actually about a patch I recently put on. Before I could muster up the courage to get their number I had to get off the train.

I had schizophrenic symptoms, but not enough to be diagnosed with schizophrenia. They called it temporary psychosis. But it took a while for it to clear out. But this was a shock, to my already depressed self. I was suicidal multiple times.

What got me here was therapy with my mom (she's not a licensed therapist, but just opening up to someone and letting yourself cry out the agony is super therapeutic. Never keep it all inside.) I also practised a ton of meditation and mindfulness. And yesterday I didn't feel like going to sleep, I was dancing and genuinely enjoyed it. After all those years of pretending to be happy when I was dead inside.

There was one and I asked out loud, (because I didn't wanted to walk towards him and then back to grab the thing) if it was the ""Komplement"" he wanted. He seemed confused and me repeating it didn't helped. So I walked to him and said it again with a smile and got his papers to check for myself what he actually has to pick up. It was the Komplement , but he kept understanding ""Compliment"" and told me he ""thought has he has to give me one"", as a joke. ""haha"" and all. I just smiled and grabbed the thing and while I was about to walk away he did gave me a compliment about me having a nice body.

I’ve lost all creativity and imagination I once had, I feel like I can’t retain information like I used to, I feel like I can’t think as critically or as intelligently or coherently as I used to. When I was younger I was so assured in my intelligence that I was borderline narcissistic about it, not in the “I’m a teenager and know everything” kind of way, like I genuinely was intelligent for my age and knew a lot of things about science and philosophy because I was so into it. 

It feels like when I was younger my brain was lit up and colourful with imagination and its ability to learn and grow, and now it’s dull and grey and shrivelled and it’s only getting worse. I feel dumber by comparison to when I was a child and I genuinely wonder if there’s something wrong with me sometimes that’s limiting my abilities. ",09Aug2018,294

Every single time I hear velcro, the deep insides of my nose itch itch like crazy, I can't explain, I have no idea why that happens, if it is psychological, or something palpable. Maybe it's at least partly psychological because right now as I'm imagining it, I'm feeling the itch, although much weaker than when I actually hear it.

48,"Suicide is polarising. Some think it to be an insult to life and the living, others a fundamental right that deserves respect.

The suicide I’m talking about is that of an otherwise physically healthy individual. I feel like these suicides are like a perfect mirror reflecting back at us everything wrong with our society. The alienation, the denial of our basic emotional needs, the forcing of round pegs into square holes causing them to break.

The thing is when we’re confronted by that mirror we can’t stand to look at it, what we see staring back at us is an ugliness we’re in constant denial of.

We don’t want to talk about it, and if we have to we would rather shift the blame to the reflection.

I feel as though this reaction is just as helpful and true as blaming your own reflection though. We’re all responsible for what’s in that mirror, and when tragedy presents us a momentary glimpse we owe it to the person who died and ourselves to have a compassionate and honest discussion about it, rather than an the go to conversation stoppers: “they were a drug user” or, “it’s sad and a tragedy” or worst of all, “what a selfish thing to do”.

The truth is if we or one of our loved ones were born into their bodies and their environment the same fate would have awaited us. It’s not just a normal inevitable part of life that physically healthy people want to end their lives as much as they do, the feelings that lead to this conclusion are almost entirely caused by the shared social and economic environment we all live in, as such we all have a responsibility to take responsibility for it in some small way.

We’ve made great strides in accepting our shared responsibility for the physical environment because of how our actions detrimentally affect others, it’s about time the same thing started to happen with our attitude towards our social and economic environment too.

49,"I need some help processing some emotions. The last 8 months I've been dating a girl, and it's been great. We've seen each other 2-4 times a week every week, and see eye to eye on most things.

She is currently one year into a two year contract (which is why is she came to the particular city I am in). She recently told me that she got a call for an interview she had applied a while ago on the East coast. When she told me, she seemed very nervous to tell me, and seemed relieved when I told her I was excited for her. She obviously still has to interview, and she isn't even sure if she'll take it. However, I'm starting to feel the anxiety build that she may leave if she gets it. My last relationship ended not because of personality differences, but because of the timing. It's hard to have a relationship end because of timing in life.

This comes as her parents are going to be meeting mine, and I'll be flying out with her to meet her siblings. We've never talked about what we want long term. I don't know if I should have a discussion on what happens if she gets the job even before she interviews? Is that jumping the gun? It's one of those conversations that will need to happen if she gets the job, and I know it's a hard one to have.

54,"I graduate college in December, which I’m thrilled about, but at the same time I am terrified. I’ve always worked my ass off holding a full time job only up until the last few months. That being said I’ve had to rely on my parent for financial help a bit more than I’ve had to in the past. They said they don’t mind because they haven’t had to do much while I’ve been in college for me financially. All of a sudden I’ve felt a growing shift in our relationship. My prospective career paths aren’t good enough, the looks aren’t what they should be, I spent too much time on my hobbies (literally never have time for them tbh), and the list goes on and on. I’m not sure if I’ve grown up and see my parents as adults so I don’t take too kindly to their intense criticism or if I’m just being sensitive to the whole thing. Either way, it’s exhausting. I can’t talk to them about it and even with the job I have now I come up a few hundred short every month and that’s having cut out pretty much everything but essential needs. 

I’m frustrated at having to rely on my parents for a couple more months and then using that as leverage to be critical of my every move. Sure they always have been to a degree but I felt like I had more control of my life then. Now I know if I don’t choose the correct career path in their eyes it’s never going to end. It will always be a constant critique of every aspect of my life. Granted, I’ve distanced myself considerably and they haven’t known that much about my life in years which has been really good for me I think . Yet I find them beating me over the head with that too. I’m at a loss and it’s a weird transitional phase in my life right now. I don’t know where I was going with this but I needed to put it somewhere.

55,"I am not the best communicator. Of anything. Really. I know that. I like to be silent. I’m sorry if it bothers you that I am the way I am. 

I sometimes like to write, though. 

I have feelings, and maybe you don’t know. I have needs and wants. Your role as a father, WAS to provide economically AND emotionally. I know, probably your father didn’t tell you it was gonna be hard to be a father when he himself was not one to you either. Almost any man can be a “Father” but really, there is much more to that word than just providing a bed, a computer, and a roof. You may have not had the chance to be a father and maybe that’s why you’re trying to be the best to your girlfriend’s children. I am happy for you. You are finally with someone who can make you feel happy and that someone has two kids who too make you happy. There was this day where I saw these crayons and pencils, etc., in a bag in the living room and I thought to myself - lucky girls. They get to have what I would like to have. ( I now have crayons, thanks to my partner, by the way and I bought myself some color pens online.) When did my “father” ever ask me if I wanted color pencils? I have always loved brand new color pencils, erasers, pens, backpacks, all the stuff that you usually get when you are going to go to school but then I think - I don’t blame him. How would he know if he really wasn’t there? It has been around 8 months that my sister left the house. And you think you’ve been a “Father” to me all this time? You might think that providing a roof for me is enough. Even YOUR father gets the role of being a daughter or a son. How? You might ask. He has it very, very easy. He has done whatever he went throughout his life doing as he pleased and is now just sitting on the chair navigating facebook. Just what a 15 year old would be doing. I don’t know if you’ve noticed. But I do not get a long with your father, and I do NOT have to. I might do it, just because I learned respect. All this time, you have asked him “what did you have for lunch/ dinner” even if you didn’t really care what he had, but hey! you asked, right? You have talked to him way, way more than you have talked to me. Plus, I have to clean up after the mess he everyday leaves on the kitchen countertops, don’t I? I don’t know if you noticed, but I stopped cleaning his mess a while ago. Because he does not deserve anything from me. Your father and I do not get along and don’t blame me, it is his fault. You know what kind of person he is. It is in the veins. You know his past better than my sister or I do. But I really don’t care about the past. I care that he does NOT care, that’s why I don’t care. Why should I care when they don’t care? If he cared, I would care. It’s not always our fault as teenagers. I guess that’s what happens between a father-daughter relationship. The father cares, he shows support, even emotional support when he sees his daughter falling. He is always there trying to pick her up, no matter how many times he has done the SAME, “boring” thing. He wants to be involved in their daughter’s time, that’s why they become their daughter’s best friend. But you gave up. You gave up on us and told us to go our own way. Didn’t you?  

You know, I read this article that said “If your child’s father is affectionate and supportive, he can contribute greatly to your child’s social development, ability to express himself, as well as academic achievement, sense of well being and good self-esteem” I quickly went back to “ ability to express himself” and I thought. Hmmm…. THIS MUST BE WHY!

I am being treated like an “adult”. Aren't i? Nobody will ever have the courage to say these things to you. But you have to know. I know you NEVER had a father. And I don’t know if you noticed, but you are not a father, FATHER to me. You may get called “father” by me and my sister but, are you? Do you even care anymore? Maybe you don’t, maybe all you see in us is NOT potential. 

I do not remember the last time you asked me: Do you WANT something? Although there was this one time when I was in my bed looking at some stuff on my iPad and you came and sat next to my bed and asked what I was doing, I told you im just looking at t-shirts on wish and you asked do you want to buy t shirts? And of course, I said no I am ok im just looking at them. I didn’t want to buy those t-shirts but maybe I wanted to buy a pair of shoes. You know, whenever someone thinks of a father, they think of someone who will provide unconditionally. I see that is not the case for everyone. The way you turned your back against my sister when she made her decision to go with her husband. That was very, very expected from a father. Not even through her bad decisions were you there. You know, a lot of people when they interact with me, they see how much of a good person I am. I wasn’t that with you and my sister, was I? I am caring, I listen, I am just-good at drawing, I have good grammar, I am detail-oriented. I ALWAYS, it didn’t matter if the given project was to draw stick figures, I always, ALWAYS did my best and I even added color. I have given a few advices to my girl friends in high school. In high school, nobody messed with me. I was always paying attention in class and even when I didn’t, I managed to turn in my homework in time. I am all these good things but you would you know?

I got my best grades and I did not have ANYONE pushing me to do so. I remember you talking about my SOLS. You said “ If you don’t pass those, you will regret it” -WOW, I thought, what a way to encourage! Hope it works. And believe me, it did, a little bit. I passed my SOLS, not only because you said I’d regret it but because I wanted to make you see that THAT is NOT how you encourage someone. You want to be the “self-made, straight-to-the-point, you-either-do-it-or-regret-it-forever” father in the family, but that’s not good. You think that you are the only one with a voice in this family? Think again. Now, you must be the one providing for ALL of us, but in the future, what’s gonna be left? Did you sow good thoughts / values / experiences within your family? Or were you just a modern, better, although not different version of your father? You may think that you are doing enough by just providing a roof and things that you bought with your money years ago when we first arrived here with Daniela. I have the needs, thank you. And I am not asking for the wants. I’m just trying to express what I feel within me. ",09Aug2018,2

58,"This post is basically two previous comments about my life mashed together which I've now divided into sections;

**Growing up disconnected**

I was born premature and had all sorts of doctor-handling and operations while I was a baby (where I didn't receive anesthetic) and going into early childhood. My mom believes this is why I'm so socially disconnected. I'm also hard of hearing and have below average eye sight, which along with meaning I'll never learn to drive, snowballed the ways I felt disconnected with or frustrated with the world. 

I was obsessed with Halloween year round from roughly age six to nine, and have maintained various other unusual interests/obsessions ever since. I turned vegetarian and got into animal rights as a kid, which is not the kind of thing that helps you feel part of normal society.

I could go on; growing up an idiosyncratic kid with unusual interests, beliefs and passions who laughed at his own thoughts, span around in circles in public and never developed normal interests in social interaction or even romance or sex. All the different things I've just listed, these are the reasons why I believe I'm so cut off from society, because I never believed I could be friends with a normal person.

**Realizing common interests aren't enough**

A core belief I formed is that people needed to be interested in the same thing to be friends. I always felt like my unusual interests, Halloween as a kid for example, put me squarely in one world and everyone else squarely in another. And my life since childhood has been a parade of niche obsessions. 

I realize on one level the belief doesn't hold up. For one, that means friendships end when people get interested in new things and that all friends are really just hobby buddies of some sort rather than actually caring about one another and while I may be inexperienced in real friendships, from the fiction I've watched it's not necessarily true, and lastly, I've discovered the internet and reddit, and it still hasn't resulted in friendships. It's evolved a variation ""people aren't interested in the same thing in the same way"". I suspect it's basically a belief that requires other people have zero capacity to identify with others.

Maybe the internet just shows what relationships based entirely on common interest actually look like, through online forums and ephemeral threads.

The relationships I've formed online, where physical handicaps, weird behaviors, hygiene and having disparate interests all need not have the same hurdles, have usually ended. Maybe because I base them on common interests? I'm neglecting a contact with one or two people right now because I'm interested in other things than what we were basing are interaction on. Looking over my online relationships one of us usually lost interest in further messaging and didn't respond to the last message and it died like a tired conversation. In one friendship, I felt like the person wasn't very interested in the things I was looking at online and I wasn't interested in helping with their vague world-building for their unwritten story. In the closest friendship I had I mentioned earlier, we were working on a story together and then when he lost interest things kind of collapsed and our interactions didn't have the same footing they once did.

**Living in my own world**

Last year someone invited me to spend time with someone a couple times and I was too pre-occupied with reading a story on the computer to pull myself away.

I have trouble both pulling myself out of my world, and being interested in others people's. I remember once in High School I was invited to sit with a bunch of kids, and I sat there while they talked about masturbation/sex and I thought I'd be more engaged in thinking about the story I was working on with the online friend I mentioned. Another time I was invited over by a group of guys and they were fishing and one showed me a picture of a girl, asking if I found her hot. I was disinterested in both these things. One guy came out to me as gay, wasn't sure why at the time but later realized it was probably because I was uninterested in the girl picture.

I am usually not interested in others and usually expect others to not be interested in me. 


**How did childhood friendships work anyway?**

I don't really know what drives friendships, in either childhood or adulthood. I may be averse to discussing serious things going on in my life, and that may not apply to normal people after a certain age, but doesn't that not apply to young children? Was I just too obsessed with learning/reading/my own imagination at any and every age to know what normally drives a childhood friendship? What are childhood friendships based on anyway?

It may be that a compromised ability to hear made me less social, and it's possible my experiences as a baby factored to. There's also the personal hygiene/personal appearance thing, and being told society wouldn't accept me unless I changed myself in certain ways. But why was that so different for me then even my older brothers? Did I just have zero sense of disgust and no desire to be connected to others?

Going back to the belief that friends need to have the same interests, I realize the belief has flaws, but I'm not sure what to replace it with.",09Aug2018,3
59,"So for those that don't know what MtF means, it means I'm a transgender woman (Male-to-Female). This is just a rant about a really shallow complaint I have about being a young adult pre-transition trans woman.

-------------------------

I know that sounds so shallow and bratty and just terrible, but UGH it's so true.

I'm 21. I'm pre-transition. I never got to be a teenager. I mean, yeah, of course I lived as a teenager from ages 13-19. But I never really...engaged in life? I was too dysphoric (before I knew it; before I had even heard that word before), too detached, dealing with depersonalization, derealization, dissociation.

But now I know who I am, and I'm mourning the childhood - and adolescence - I never got to have. I never got to worry about cute boys or whether they like me, whether I'm cute enough for them, because my conservative upbringing taught me that someone who looked like me wasn't supposed to be interested in boys. I didn't even realize I liked boys until after I came out to myself.

I just want to gossip about boys, meet cute boys, get attention from cute boys, date boys, be frustrated by how stupid boys are.

Honestly. I literally just want attention from cute boys.

61,"There are times when I feel how I feel right now, and at times like these I feel like... I don't really know how.

This is a recurring theme with feeling the way I do right now: it is intense, and it is beautiful, and it is so deeply moving - and yet, I don't have a single word to describe it. No word I know seems to fit. ""Romantic"" comes close - and yet, misses entirely on the intensity of it, of the sheer volume, the almost-overwhelming amount of... *something*, the *something* that helps me feel... ""alive"", for lack of a better term.

It is a bit past midnight where I am. The streets are loud because the rest of the world is peacefully quiet. There are few people on the street, mostly young men and women, in companies of two or more, going about, spending their time with their youth, talking that sweet nonsense that defines young people - has defined them always.

I feel old, because when I look at them - at the teenagers, the soon-to-be young adults - I feel like I've missed that period of my life. And I did. I barely was a kid. I never really was a teenager. I was... empty, for the most part. Life felt empty, like it does right now --

But I feel *something*, the *something* that's flowing inside of me and gives the world around me its colors, its senses, its beauty, and the smallest details - such profound significance and weight that it makes the rest of it seem... almost good.

I was thinking of a family: a man and a woman, both thirty-something and feeling rather young and full of energy and joy, and their children: an older daughter, somewhere around ten, and a younger son, somewhere around 8. (There's something inadequate about writing the number 8 as ""eight"", and yet ""ten"" comes out without any friction at all) I've never met those people. I haven't seen them or thought of them until half an hour ago. But in a flash, I imagined their life as they have a late dinner, and it felt *so real*, like few things seem to be now for me. The daughter, in a dress, with long pigtails, was serving the table, preparing it for the meal, and shouting at her younger brother because he misbehaved. The boy is stunned and upset but is taking the childish meanness of his sister in stride.

I was thinking of that family - and how I never had any, despite living with my parents for most of my life. I never had that - and boy, do I wish I did. I'd take the shouting matches, the tears, the bruises of falling from running too quickly, the sadness of broken toys - I'd take not being able to show off to my friends at the kindergarden, at school, I'd take *so much of it* just to have that - just to be able to live like that, even for a little while. Because there's comfort in that. There's peace that I never experienced. There's joy that I never had.

That *something* I feel makes me feel that way. It almost makes me feel alive.",09Aug2018,3

I slowly back up to my room that's when it pounced. I closed the door and started weeping as I heard the monster clawing at my door. I hear my parents  open the front door, I cried a tear of joy. My parents heard me crying so they check on me. I tell them everything, and they said that we were going to keep it and that I was going to learn to get along with him, my heart sank. A day later I see my brother walking towards the vicious beast I try to warn him, but it is to late. I hear screams of pain I run to my room, closed the door, and hid under my blankets. My brother walks to his bed(we had bunk beds) and started crying I saw he was covered in scratches. He starts getting sick and a bump appeared on his neck, the beast must be poisonous I thought. My parents take him to the doctor I came with them so I wouldn't be left with the poisonous beast. My brother had a allergic reaction. I didn't know what that meant at the time but I was cried tears of joy because we'd  have to get rid of the monster.

65,"So I've been struggling with this for a couple of days now. I had a serious moment of disorientation Monday night. It felt like someone struck a drum inside my skull and the whole left side of my face and head felt numb and droopy. When I looked at myself in the mirror I looked fine and it only lasted about 30 seconds to a minute. 

The next day I woke up feeling ok, but throughout the day I continued to get more and more light headed and had a hard time focusing. I went to the ER and they ran some tests, I passed the physical stuff, could feel, hear and see. I was able to follow his finger and all that jazz and they ran a CT scan which came up with nothing. 

I got referred to a neurologist, am still feeling light headed and slow to react physically. My mind is pretty clear though and I feel strong, but a little off balance. My work offers free therapy/counseling which I think I'll take advantage of, but otherwise that and following up with the neurologist when it comes time to I'm not sure what to do. Part of me is thinking I might just be sick and it was a weird headache, part of me is pretty sure I had a mini stroke and a little worried I'll never be the same.

73,"The policy of employees refusing tips by companies like Apple should be stopped. Those people appreciated the excellent customer service they received. They should be free to tip as they please.

I remember the handful of times I was given a tip, and I was always so grateful. I remember each and every time it happened. Once I was given a $50 for helping carry out an iMac to their car and the older gentlemen put the bill in my hand and shook it and said, ""I won't take no for an answer. Thank you for your patience with me today."" I walked to a mall alleyway and cried because I really needed that $50.",09Aug2018,0

77,"When I was young, I was really big. I had glasses. I had curly hair (im biracial, white mom black dad) and I’d brush it out and it was really frizzy, I never was taught how to take care of it. I never had the expensive or trendy clothes, I was told to pick what I wanted but nothing fit me quite right or suited me. So from about 8-the past few years I have really struggled finding some sort of personal style that made me feel attractive, confident, me. I just always had this deep rooted self hatred, like most people. But I found make up, and my style. I’ve found clothes that fit, go around my curves. I have learned to take care of my hair, its curly now and even ombre. I wear contacts so my glasses are gone. I was a tomboy growing up, and disgusted by bright colors, especially pink. Now I don’t mind them, I have a lot more variety other than blue and black. I have shifted to completely feminine. Even dressing up sexy. My boyfriend loves my style and I do too. But after dressing up I looked at myself and said _”who is that”_ 

I just feel like the old me and the me now look like two different people entirely, not an older version of the other. I’m mixed, and look black and white, but now somehow I look latina. I’ve been talked to in Spanish multiple times, and told that I look Spanish/Cuban/Puerto Rican. Its so odd. I love hispanic/latin culture but I have never been a part of it. Hell I live in one of the whitest places (nothing wrong with that I just dont have that culture around me). 

I had a really bad past with a lot of traumatic things that happened, and I had to hide a lot of myself. I couldnt be me and I have no idea if this person that I am today is a hidden part of myself or someone who arose from different parts of my environment. I feel confident, and sexy, but at the same time its not like I am.. me. If I don’t have my whole ‘get up’ then I feel pretty awful. And i hate it. If I don’t have make up on I feel like the girl I once was and I am changing. I’m changing habits, mentalities, especially with therapy. I don’t connect with my old self but that person was me, and its odd living completely separate from her. Now I’m wondering if its all a facade.",09Aug2018,0

79,"People told me to have confidence and put myself out there. I did just that in the last two years:

\* Created over 50 Tinder Profiles in the last two years gaining over 2,000 matches.

\* Spent $1,000 on online dating, Okcupid, Match, EHarmony, and other +10 dating apps

\* Meetup Groups, Exploring Political Groups, Rockclimbing, Book clubs, and more.

\* Visited Hundreds of Bars to meet people.

\* Took Dance classes: Ballet, Modern, Tap, Jazz, Contempoary, Hip Hop, Tango, Swing, Salsa, and Ballroom

\* Took Acting Classes, Auditions, Improv, Drama

\* Took Private Singing classess to improve voice.

\* Took Fitness classes, Yoga, Acroyoga, Pure Barre, The Bar Method, Gymnastics and a lot of Aerial Silk.

\* Attended Conventions, Events, Receptions, where the audience is mostly women.

\* Became very active in many Christian and Jewish commmunities and events.

\* Created a Website to find a wife (Will not post it here).

\* Volunteer &amp; Leadership Opportunities

\* There was a extremely attractive married women who looked like she fell in love with the person I have become. I had Integrity, incredible self control to choose to do the right thing by making her marriage stronger. The feeling of loss makes me stronger.

Made friends along the way. To be honest, I wish I had my time back because I did all of this only to find a girlfriend.. I have never been in a relationship. I never drink or smoke, or did drugs. I believe in Longevity and Health, expect the same from a woman who's physically fit/healthy lifestyle.

Everyone says I am very unique, original because 100% deaf, never learned sign and grew up in at least 4 countries through International Schools. Paris, London, Dublin, Singapore, United Arab Enmirates, Washington, DC. Also traveled to at least fifty countries before I became an Adult. Now I am virgin, saving self for marriage. Almost 40 years old but look like 30 due to healthy lifestyle.

Fastforward today in 2018, I have everything from health, career, financial success, strong family ties, and a great many things that most people do not have. Destiny of love is not on meant to be. Where do I draw the line here?

\*\*TLDR:\*\* I have all the things many women want in a man. I always knew how to enjoy life alone forever. In the end I failed to find a loving relationship with a woman through a rigorous two-year challenge to be the best man possible. Perhaps my greatest gift is also my greatest curse, the ability to adapt in a soundless life. What now?

\*\*EDIT:\*\* To all who responded, Thank you for taking the time to respond. I really appreciate your feedback. I will continue to improve myself and enjoy life. Again, thank you.",09Aug2018,2
80,"Hello, note going into this post: I am not a troll, I am desperate for help.


You may be wondering... how the fuck do you not know how to wipe your own ass? Well the answer is: I never needed to.


My family is rich in my native country so I grew up my entire life with a hose or a bidet available in the bathroom, and some air dryer contraption that my parents installed so it makes your bottom dry and warm. Very comfortable.


Because my parents spoiled me and never really bothered to teach me, I never bothered doing my
business any other way. If I was in public, I would simply wait until I was home. If I was on a trip, I would attempt to replicate my method of cleaning with a water bottle and an air dryer.


This all changes very soon though. I go to a university in America and I fly out with all my stuff to live there for months at a time. I’m aware that Americans do not have a hose or bidet or butt dryer contraption available to them, and because I’ve never wiped my ass, I’m a bit lost.


Anyways, how do I start wiping my ass? What is the best technique? Is looking at your own poop gross on the paper gross? I seriously need help because I will be gone in about four days and I know I will not survive there if I cannot wipe my ass.

82,"Maybe I am, I mean I’m weird and I’m not a model and I care so much but I don’t know how to show it, I’m awful with kids and I don’t know how to comfort someone with my words, I relay on my twin sister because I know she’s always there for me but one day she won’t be and even thinking about it scares the hell out of me because she’s the one person who loves me for me. I fake my feelings around people because I’m not a person who’s hurt by things or gets emotional often, I’m just passive but people around me expect me to show different emotions that I just don’t feel. 
When I say I’m too hard to love it’s not just in romantic relationships, it’s everyone, am I just that not worth it? I feel like no one believes in me and want to get to know the real me. ",09Aug2018,2
84,"We live in a simulation where you can never feel satisfied and that is runned for some evil entities that surely are in the same situation but just want to hurts others since others hurt them. Everything that gave your pleasure, turns out to be pain, suffering, death. 

We could just keep going on, trying to achieve higher goals and so on. But the last frontier is not space but death, that's the true mystery. It's the red pill, our fate.

Everything is a lie, this hell and pleasure is the chain that keep us here. Suffering is the signal you have discovered the Truth and that you can no longer be fooled by this evil simulation.

Now I’m heart broken, and as much as I love him and his friendship, I dont feel like we can continue being friends.
