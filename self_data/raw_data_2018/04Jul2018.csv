5,"I am a 24 year old Entrepreneur from the Netherlands. Last year, after returning from a work placement abroad, I started my own business. In hindsight this probably wasn't the most clever decision in my life, as the starting conditions weren't quite ideal. A little elaboration; I moved back to the Netherlands without funds and a source of new income and crashed on the couch of a friend.

As is logical in this situation my finances were direly low for a long time, but after eight months of hard work I finally did it, I now had a (albeit temporary) place to live, a bit of money on the bank and loads of new projects that were promising good payment waiting for me. 

During these eight months I had been gradually getting more and more stressed, and less and less productive, but I kept telling myself to hold on tight and keep going at it. I knew (or at least thought I did) that the stress would go away as soon as I had my finances in order. During this time my girlfriend had been struggling with school and depression, which is why I spent the rest of my able mind in trying to support her and get her to search professional help.

As I thought, as soon as the financial stress was resolved, the major source of stress was gone and I felt relieved. I truly thought this was the point in time where I could pick everything that I had been letting go over the past months back up, that I could start investing time and energy in marketing and getting the rest of my new business in order, instead of holding on to the half-assed somewhat working website etc. 

As you can probably guess; this didn't happen. After enjoying the first day of bliss I started trying to get back to old productivity numbers, but found out that I couldn't anymore. I couldn't even get myself to walk a few minutes to the supermarket to get some breakfast supplies, so I missed loads of meals. Looking back from that point I realised that I wasn't just experiencing stress and my standard ADHD symptoms, but that it had been gradually escalating to a point where I could barely function. I'm talking about losing a tool I had just put down about 5 times an hour, blindly staring at projects and genuinely not knowing what to do, even though I had done it hundreds of times before, not being able to get myself to my workbench, feeling immense resistance whenever I had an business or leisure appointment, and so much more. 

After two days of that I started worrying that there was more at play **cue sleeping problems**. It was at this point I realised I should do some research. Found loads of articles on Burn-out and felt like this could be what I'm experiencing. It was here that I started my ""road to recovery"" I cut alcohol, drugs and cafeïne  out of my life, tried to start exercising to make sure I could sleep at night, but nothing helped.

I started by acknowledging that there was a problem and tried to do something about it. I started to talk to my friends and family about what I'd been experiencing. This cleared my mind a bit, but not a lot of new insights came my way. I started feeling good about acknowledging what was at play, but felt there was more needed. Accepting that I wasn't going to overcome this by myself I contacted my local GP, who turned out to be conpletely unable to understand my story. I got a sort of mental health survey to fill in at home and make a new appointment. The new appointment was with different GP who thankfully was very lovely and understood what was happening. She told me that it was a miracle that I hadn't turned completely crazy yet as I had been sleeping between 0 and 3 hours every night. She told me we couldn't work on this in my current state, so prescribed me some sleep medication to use for a week, so we could then move on from a little bit of a better starting point.  

One week later, I still hadn't slept more despite the heavy sleep medication, it helped sleeping in for a bit, but didn't prevent me from waking up after a few hours, only to feel way drowsy and not being able to sleep.  Felt like I was at a sort of breaking point multiple times since financially stable. Work productivity was down to barely nothing and I started to worry about drifting back into that financial hellhole, not at all aiding my sleep. The GP agreed I needed some form of professional help and gave me a referral for a Psychologist. 

A few weeks passed until I was allowed to come in for an intake, during those weeks I kept visiting my GP and got around to sleeping a little bit better, between 2 to 6 hours each night, knowing that professional help was on the way.

Fast forward to the first meeting, which was extremely wierd. After talking for about 20 minutes a colleague of my psychologist came in and made me give a summary of what we had discussed, and then listened along. He was there to help the guy decide what to label my problems  for the insurance company. After I told my story, my therapist stated that he didn't think it was a Burn-out, the guy thought it was and they started to discuss why it would or wouldn't be Infront of me, the client. This felt very unprofessional, I also told them that I didn't  really care what it was,, as long as we could find a solution to my problems . My therapist stated that he didn't think it was consistent with being under a lot of stress and going over my limits for a long time, while I obviously stated that I did go through a hell of a time. The other guy agreed with me, and they went with Burn-out anyway. 
Since then I have had two more appointments, and both have been really unproductive. I have been yapping about my week, and he adressed  nothing but stuff I already knew. In addition to that we always go in overtime. I addressed these frustrations to him and he shipped the first point off with some excuse that ""some people like it when they have that talk in front of the client""  for the second point he is going to talk to his colleagues do discuss whether I psychiatric evaluation would be in place. On the third point I asked him if we could book double slots instead. He looked at me with big eyes and asked ""why?"" I told him it was because we haven't really been getting anywhere, and were constantly 15 to 30 minutes over time. And that I found it weird that he didn't understand that, while we were again 30 minutes overtime, way in the next clients timeframe.

I *have* made some breakthroughs in talks with friends during the week, or after breaking down crying twice in two weeks while with my girlfriend, and talking after. This is kind of new to me too, because in the past 5 years I have only cried when a family member died, never in other situations, because I just can't get myself to do so. Not because I'm afraid of crying or whatever, but it just won't happen. Another big breakthrough was while talking with my girlfriend's therapist, who told me that while my work efficiency might me at let's say 5%, I'd been spending the other 95% trying to get out of this whole Burn-out situation, probably still going way over my limits, but then in my head. 

The problem at the moment is that I don't really have a feeling that I'm getting anywhere with my psychologist, and waiting week after week after every appointment really tears me down, knowing that I'm falling further and further back in to the financial hell I had just climbed out of. Besides that I'm not leaving the therapist's office with new insights for myself either. A big problem of being an entrepreneur is that I can't afford to stand still, yet that probably somehow is what I need right now.  This is the wall I've walked into at the moment and I was wondering if any of you fellow redditors would have some thoughts on this situation.

6,"Michael Jackson is the greatest human being of all time. I think he's better than Jesus and Mohammed combined. 

There should be a religion started around this man. Have you heard ""Human Nature""? Go listen to it and tell me this man wasn't sent by God himself. Go watch him Moonwalk. Can Jesus do that? No. He can't. What about his anti-gravity lean. Moses may have parted the sea but Michael Jackson parted my ass cheeks because I'm a believer. 

I think in his prime, MJ had more followers than Jesus. He's the absolute GOAT of music. Fuck anybody who disagrees. I'd suck his dick if I got the chance, no homo. Like if you think about it, he looked attractive as both a black person and a white person. Mohammed was a child molester and consummated with Aisha when she was 9. But Michael Jackson wouldn't molest children. Corey Feldman (a guy who was molested by Harvey Weinstein) said that the only person in Hollywood he ever felt safe around was Michael Jackson. 

Jesus said love the children. That's what Michael Jackson did. He built a safe haven in Neverland Ranch for kids to play at. Also, Michael Jackson fucked Elvis's daughter, Brooke Shields, and probably Madonna. So let's not forget that. He also made Thriller. Jesus didn't make Thriller. If he did, then I'd probably say that he was the greatest human being of all time. But he didn't make Thriller, so I can't. 

Moreover, Michael Jackson is the only human being in history to switch races in the middle of his career. Name the greatest black dancer in history. Name him. ""Michael Jackson"". Now name the greatest white dancer in history. Still Michael Jackson. That's just a testament to his will and his perseverance as a human being. 

If Michael Jackson wanted to, I guarantee he could have walked on water. He just never tried to, therefore we will never know. But I firmly believe he could have. If you don't think Michael Jackson was a hottie, then I question your taste in men as a whole. Thriller is the biggest selling album of all time, go look at the Black or White video and tell me he doesn't look fucking cute. If I was a homosexual (I'm not, I'm straight), but if I was a homosexual, there is no doubt in my mind that the first cock that would be in my mouth would be the King of Pop's. I firmly believe that he did not molest those children, as he was acquitted of all charges, but if he did, then I would pray to be one of those children no homo. If you made Thriller, then I would let you molest me too. 

Go watch Billie Jean at Motown and look at the way he glided across the stage. There was one black woman in the audience who you can audibly hear finger fucking herself when he did that toe stand. If you don't believe me, go search up the video and pause the video at 3:35 and tell me you don't hear that shit. I don't think I'll ever be 10x the man he was. Nobody on earth has the ability to make a woman orgasm just by moonwalking. The only person Mohamed made orgasm was Aisha, who was 6 years old when he married her, and 9 years old when they consummated. 

If you think about it, there are 1.5 billion people on earth who worship a pedophile, and then 2.5 billion people who worship a fucking nobody. Go look at Michael Jackson's super-bowl performance and then go look at his Grammy performance in 1988. It's proof that he would never touch a child sexually. You know who touches children sexually? Your mom, full homo. 

If you also think about it, the universe was born on January 1st. Michael Jackson's birthday is August 29th. I don't see how anyone could deny this. Michael Jackson named his child ""blanket"". To name your child after a fabric takes balls. I read a story once about how MJ was ready to square up with his brother Jermaine Jackson for dissing him. Like he was legit ready to throw hands and box. His body guard had to pull him off. Jesus didn't square up with nobody because he was a bitch. He would have got his ass knocked out if he tried. And the only person Mohammed squared up with was Aisha, who he would severely beat at the age of 9 for misbehaving, after he married her at the age of 6 and consummated with her at the age of 9. And also, he squared up with a lot of jews. 

I firmly believe that if Michael Jackson and Hitler sat in a room together and spoke one on one, not only would he have been able to change Hitler's mind about holocausting jewish people, but he would have also made him sexually attracted to him as well (no homo). I fully imagine Hitler making a sexual advance towards Michael Jackson, and having him politely decline the sexual advancement. And then Hitler would be heartbroken, and write a post on r/rant asking where are all the nice men in this world? 

So overall, in conclusion, I think that there should be a religion started around Michael Jackson, as he was fundamentally the greatest human being of all time. ",04Jul2018,0
7,"Me and my ex used to date, but I broke up with her because I was terrified of intimacy and because I didn't feel a romantic connection. We became good friends again after the breakup.

She broke up with her boyfriend of four months about two weeks ago, and a week and a half ago we went and played putt putt together with a mutual friend. We got really high and we played on a separate course because our mutual friend was playing with his girlfriend and her siblings. Me and my ex's first date months ago was at the same putt putt course, and it was magical when I realized she was flirting with me that night. It was raining and we got soaked, but I felt incredible. I felt so lonely for so long after the breakup that I felt like I was going to be alone forever. I started using drugs to fix my social anxiety, and it worked, but that is a whole other story. Anyway, we fucking sucked at putt putt and it was hilarious and perfect. 

After the putt putt, we started hanging out pretty much every day, but she said that she wasn't ready to be in another relationship since it was too soon, but I still love hanging out with her so I don't mind. Getting high with her might be the most fun thing I've ever done in my life. We laugh our assess off for hours every single time.

Last Thursday, me and her met up and smoked in a park and went back to her car. It was raining and we weren't okay to drive so we started talking. I had texted her about some of my social anxiety problems the night before, and she said she wanted to talk about her issues.

I felt kind of anxious about talking about something so heavy with her while high, but it went really well I would say. I won't get into what she talked about, since it is *extremely* personal, but I'll admit that I cried. I don't know how to describe it but I just felt such a raw connection to her. Even writing this now I can feel such... emotion, I don't know. It just feels so powerful and personal. I've never had an experience like that before, it felt life changing. I've never related to anyone so much before. I don't know if it's selfish to say, but I feel so good about myself knowing that someone else trusts me enough to reveal things that like to me. I really hope I made her feel even a little bit better. I really want her to be happy.

By the end of the talk we were both laughing again like we always do, and we had an amazing day afterwards. We got ice cream (which tasted like heaven) and we went to the top of a parking garage and looked at the skyline on top of her car. 

It was a great day.

I feel like I can actually be myself around her and it's such a good feeling. God, it feels so good to actually talk about my problems and connect with another human.

I'm on a vacation to Chile right now and when I get back she's going to be at the beach, so I won't be able to see her for two weeks which sucks. I can't wait to see her again :)",04Jul2018,4

I have never come to terms with the anger I felt as a child. I didn’t know what I was feeling - my mother sought some help for her, but my younger brother and I just had to deal with the outcome on our own. 

I was not a good older brother - I physically abused him because I had no other outlet. That tears me up, because he has distanced himself from me, and I don’t believe he will ever feel the need to let me patch that relationship.

My mom is an alcoholic, and riddled with anxiety and fear. The business my grandfather built and my father grew has been run into the ground. I am shocked it has been able to operate the past 20 years. My mom is now putting her savings into the business rather than selling it - she can’t negotiate the sale and won’t let my brother or I intervene. My brother and I could always go through a conservancy and take over, but that would cause irreparable injury to my mom, and both my brother and I have our own adult lives to live.

14,"You sat next to me two years ago in AP gov our sophomore year. Yesterday marked the two month anniversary of your death. 

I remember the day I found out. It was the day of my first exam in May of our senior year. Geography. I walked into the cafeteria, which was eerily somber and quiet. Everybody was talking about you. The freshman whispered amongst themselves talking about the senior who had killed himself. I didn’t know it was you yet. 

I walked past the bathrooms and the senior locker bay. I saw people crying and holding each other. I saw looks of anger and people clutching their stomachs. That’s when it finally hit me. That it was you. You, my former classmate from two years ago. You, the swimmer. You, one of the hundreds in our class who was supposed to be heading off to college this fall. 

I felt numb and confused. All I could think about was our AP gov class from two years ago. All I could think about was the snarky yet smart replies you would give to our teacher that would make everyone laugh. I still remember you voice, your eyes, the style of your hair, and the signature smirk you would always wear on your lips.

Here’s the thing. It hurts me to know that you were in so much pain for god knows how long. And nobody knew about it until that day. I am so sorry. 

Your death still haunts me. For the longest time I felt like I didn’t have to right to talk about how your death has affected me because I wasn’t close to you. I want to talk about it. Yes, you were only my classmate, not a friend or even an acquaintance.  But we shared the same things. We dreaded going to AP gov, looked forward to going to college and getting out of high school. Your death still haunts me. I can’t believe that you’re gone. I’m still in shock two months after. 

Guys, please check on your friends. Check on your sad friends. Check on your friends who have mental illness. Check on your happy friends. Check on your weak friends. Check on your strong friends. Heck, even check on strangers. Ask about their day, give them a smile. Ask how they are and actually listen. ",04Jul2018,216

I told him that I understood his job is different and more challenging now and that I'm sure he's distracted with all that, but that I also wanted him to know how I was feeling.

The conversation turned into him yelling at me about this disease he has a small chance of getting from his job (first time I've heard of it), and that I always find something to be dramatic about after we've spent time with his family (I told him several times how much I liked his family and how nice of an evening I had with them).

The conversation ended with him walking into his house and locking the door. I left a voicemail telling him how much I loved him, but that I also needed to feel loved. Nothing since.

I'm proud of standing up for myself. What I told him needed to be said for a long time. I'm terrified that he will decide to end things, or sweet talk me without actually changing any behavior. I don't want him to leave, but I also don't want to be in a relationship where I don't even feel liked.

18,"Hello all. First and foremost I'm going to apologize for the wall of text you're about to read. I have been really struggling lately with this, and just need to vent it out. I want to do so in a way that doesnt add stress onto my wife. I dont really have anyone but her to talk but her.


Flashback to late 2016. My wife and I had just gotten married. We were both working great jobs, and happy in our lines of work. We were happy, drunk, and full of stupid fun. A few months after we had married, we found out she was pregnant. While truly a surprise, we were elated. The pregnancy started to get REALLY hard on her body early on, and being that I was (at the time) making enough money to comfortably support our life, I had suggested she quit her job and focus on being as healthy as she can during her pregnancy.

Two months after she quit her job, I lost mine. After a few weeks of job searching to no avail, I suggested we move to AZ after getting a job offer there.

Life went forward and I was making enough money to support us there, so I we carried on with the pregnancy, and a few months later comes my son, Alexander.

I had to leave work in the middle of a sale to get my wife to the hospital to have the baby delivered. I didn't know it while I was at the hospital with my wife, and I wasn't scheduled to work for 3 days after my son was born, but the general manager of the dealership I was working at did not like that I passed my sale to a co-worker and promptly fired me on my return into work.

I was scared. My life crumbled around me. We ate through our savings account in the months that followed while I worked whatever shitty day gig or sales job I could get to provide for my family. All while this was going on, my wifes health was declining and I couldn't afford her medication, rent, food, diapers, and formula. 

My mental health was degrading, I felt more and more distant with my wife and newborn, and I spiraled into a depression that in all honesty I haven't got myself out of.

We tucked our tails and moved in with family in California. I was working awful jobs, basically doing anything I could to make ends meet for my family. I tried to get back into sales, but because of what happened to my job when my wife gave birth, I always had this nagging feeling in the back of my head that I would get fired for something like what happened before. 
I just couldn't close sales anymore.

Life was tearing me apart. I was struggling to keep our bills paid, food on the table, and a roof over our heads. 

I feel like I've been a failure as a provider because I am having the issues that I am. My wife is unable to work because of her health, and I feel unable to enjoy anything in my life.

I'm depressed, I don't make enough money to support my family properly, and I dont have any time to myself

Sorry for the self pity. I needed to get this off my chest. It's been tearing me down. I can't think straight,  and I have trouble sleeping.

21,"I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how people develop their relationships with food. 

My sister and I grew up eating the same things the same way yet I’ve always had a healthy relationship with food and she’s always struggled. 

Recently I was making beans. 

Beans with onions is one of my favorite meals because it makes me nostalgic for childhood, but my sister can’t even smell beans without feeling sick. 

The reason is, essentially, my sister has always been smarter than I am. 

She put together from a very young age that we only ate beans and onions when we were *very* short on money (which was often). I’d never noticed that dinners of beans and onions coincided with our father losing his temper more often and not having shoes that fit and the heat not being on, and other unpleasant things. I just liked beans and onions and remember eating them a lot as a little girl. 

My mother was a wizard at making us feel like our glasses were half full. She’d take two onions and a can of beans and make us pray about how lucky we were to have food on the table and complain about how stuffed she was after eating. Unlike me, my sister grew to be acutely aware of how dire the situation was despite this, and had trouble adjusting her eating as an adult who could buy all the food she wanted. 

She felt obligated to clean her plate and as much as she could while times were still good. She couldn’t wrap her mind around the fact that as a college educated woman, she’d never be sitting in front of empty cabinets. She was gripped by this paralyzing fear that I guess only buying and consuming food was assuaging. 

I wasn’t completely in the dark about our situation, I couldn’t bring myself to throw out perfect good food today because part of me would worry I’d be in a place where I wouldn’t have enough some day, but I could certainly wrap a plate up to finish later if I were full. She couldn’t. She’d have to finish it there and then. 

Sometimes she’d go days without eating worrying we wouldn’t have enough for me or for my father (who had a health condition at one point and was supposed to eat regularly but wouldn’t to ensure we were getting enough. He eventually was cured when he got a job with health insurance, thank God). 

Anyways. I’ve just been thinking a lot about how differently we were affected by the same situation and wanted to put my thoughts down somewhere. Writing about it helped. ",04Jul2018,3

I started making real friends when I changed schools around middle school, but up until then, this was a pretty big issue for me. However, at my first school, I did have two very close friends who were never mean to me and who I considered some of my best friends.

Sadly, I fell out of touch with both of them. One friend, let’s call her G, moved away, and the other (let’s call her N)... I don’t know what happened to her. She used to live down the street from me, but we haven’t spoken since second grade.

About a year back, I tracked down G on instagram and found out that she has been battling cancer. We are pretty young (still teenagers) so this was extremely shocking, and I felt upset at not speaking to her for so long even though she was one of the only kids who was kind to me growing up. This got me thinking about N... who I couldn’t find on Facebook, Instagram, or anywhere else.

However, the other day, N’s older sister randomly popped up on my twitter feed, and I followed her. She didn’t follow back, but I’m trying to get in touch with her to ask what happened to N. I can’t find a trace of her on social media, and I would love to reconnect with someone who had such an important role in my childhood. Not sure how this will go, but I hope it works out.

29,"For years now I've been a daily Redditor. In addition to using the site for socialization (met my current partner on this site!) I used it for news and even for my job. I've watched this place become less and less what we all wanted it to be. Admins who allow subreddits which openly threaten and dox users to stay while banning any subreddit their advertisers disagree with is considered the norm now. Mods are held to absolutely no standard and are full of... God just.. sad, angry people. I am not sure if the site was always like this or I've just reached an age that it's not cute anymore. So I'm sorry Reddit but we're breaking up. We had some laughs but it's time for me to move on. I have read many threads about how much people hate what Reddit become. I think many of us stay much longer than we should because it's habit. But as I type this, the realization that I won't have to read the nasty comments and PMs which will follow it so relieving.. I realize I should have done this years ago. Sorry Reddit. It's not me, it's you. ",04Jul2018,13

33,"Might as well say it in the title. I’m sad, but am I depressed? No one really takes me seriously. I feel so ugly, I have dermatillomania (skin picking) I constantly convince myself that everyone is thinking the worst about me, I cry a lot, very easily, over small things. I stopped talking to my best friends for a month each because I didn’t have the energy to like talk to them? I convinced myself they were thinking bad things about me. I have always had sleeping issues, I’ll stay up until 8 am because of paranoia of someone breaking in. This is every night, the paranoia is every night but I will sleep around 3,4,5 and 6 am usually not as late as 8 am. I sleep in all day, when I get home I play on my phone. Honestly I feel like my phone is a distraction from thinking about things. I’m bad at hiding things around peers. In front of my parents I’m absolutely showing so signs of anything because I don’t like when they ask a lot of tough questions. I’m not as sad as other people but I’m just so tired, everyday I will have on and off waves of being sad, lazy, no energy to talk and move then I’m up and laughing again in 6 minutes. I want to have answers. I get anxious very easy and I say mean things to myself in my head all the time. I’m getting irritated with people so easily, everyone! And I feel so bad I’ve always been very nice to people. I don’t ever feel implied to be mean and it’s just not me. Sometimes I cry for being even a little rude to classmates and my parents.

39,"The last year of my life has been difficult, if I were to assign it a theme it would be loss and the pain associated with it. In the last 12 months I've lost my grandmother, my first relationship, the trust and comfort in my friends, my confidence and self esteem and in general the ability to feel happy. I can be happy in moments but ultimately it's a temporary distraction from my pain, once I sit down and think about my life and where I want it go a cloud of misery appears to dampen my outlook and hope in the future.


I loathe my main friend group because they never make an effort to make me feel as valued or important as I attempt to do for them. Since my grandmother's death they've been pushing me to make a change in my life, to stop being a doorman and a ""nice guy"" in order to put my needs first. I've been making strides in providing my own happiness and being cautious that my needs to myself are met first, but in doing so has lead me to multiple conflicts were I'm being told I ask for too much. I believe that seeing someone once a month and keeping in decent contact isn't too much to ask for a close friendship but apparently to them that's too much, I was told I'm being too needy and that's not a realistic expectation. On the other hand they want me to respect their boundaries and stop embarrassing them and myself in public, but when I ask for those two standards to be met I was told it was never going to happen. They also gossip and criticize me behind my back, never bringing up their qualms about me in person but discussing it amongst themselves when I'm not around. I usually find out through a 3rd party afterwards and when I confronted them I was told the majority of this circle are passive and don't like direct confrontation, being told by the more aggressive friends ""well people talk about people all the time, it's not as big as a deal as your making it"".


They also lack respect and invalidate the friendship or loyalty I show them. Throughout the last year I've had issues with this one guy Gerald (M33) which became a  big drama, whenever we were around each other it was an awkward situation of us giving the other the silent treatment or him threatening violence on his end. I was constantly being lectured and pressured to make peace with him as they felt I was the antagonist in this situation as I blocked his number and Facebook after Christmas and everyone was tired of our drama and it happening every time we went out. I'll admit that haven't been a saint this past year, I've been very obnoxious and been drinking heavily to deal my losses of my grandma and my first relationship. Regardless I was noticing troubling behavior from Gerald that I was trying to warn my friends but they fell on death ears; they believed him over me as I was falling out of favor and I was beginning to feel him replacing me. Sensing this I tried to contemplated suicide twice due to my inability to get along with him and feeling that I was losing friendships. It recently came out that my suspicions were correct and while I've gotten apologies over the last few weeks, it doesn't stop the hurt I feel that my friends of 3 years didn't believe me over this guy because he's been ""easier and more mature to deal with"" the last year than I have.


I also feel strained with my relationship with my best friend Daisy (F22). I've known her for close to 5 years now and it hasn't been an easy friendship, she has a slew of mental illnesses that make her being social difficult as well overall she's an introvert. It's compounded by that fact I've had/have a crush on her; I realized on my own after a year that we wouldn't work as a couple as I need a partner who can communicate and not be neglectful emotionally, and while I've been able to accept that in my mind I still hold strong feelings beyond traditional friendship. In the last year Daisy has been making attempts to be social and active, however after 3 years I've grown resentful due to her antisocial and lack of effort on her end. I've told her multiple times how her antisocial behavior hurts and makes it difficult to maintain a friendship, while she's acknowledge that she never made a true effort despite it. In the last year she's been alienated as well and has started to pull away from me while bonding with my main friend group, actually making an effort to be around them while I have to deal with her antisocial behavior despite fixing our issues. She's recently made a new boyfriend which I have mixed emotions about; while I'm happy she's found a great guy she genuinely likes it also hurts in that I still have strong feelings towards her, I've tried making relationships in trying to be realistic and moving on I've yet to found success. The hardest part is that Daisy has begun to make her own plans with our social circle but after all this time I still feel like an after thought; I have to make the plans, I have to come up with money for said plans, I have to deal with antisocialness and text multiple times for a response to a basic yes or no question and I'm still on edge because at the very last minute Daisy can still pull out chalking it up to her mental health. In our nearly 5 year friendship she's only made a plan once, I've been the putting things together and I'm totally exhausted and bitter over it. 


  It got to a point where my family pushed me to seek help outside my therapy as everyone was at their wits ends and at their limit of help. I decided to voluntarily go to a mental hospital for under two weeks. while it allowed me to decompress and calm down it wasn't helpful for long term benefits, the doctors kept pushing to take antidepressants despite my hesitation and history of side effects and no one truly talked to me about what's wrongs and my needs. I got to confront Daisy while being treated, she apologized for being a bad friend but admits she honestly can't change and be an active friend that I need. After getting out I feel better and I got out but my problems are still here, nothing will bring back the things that I've lost and my friends won't change. All the signs put towards cutting the chord and I'm more willing than ever to follow but I'm still fearful, it would mean getting rid of 90% of my circle and simply starting over. I'm not good with making friends and I don't want to start again being nothing, what if this is the best I've got or if the next circle I cultivate is being worse than the company I keep now? Everyone has been telling me to get my shit together and put myself first but no is explaining to me what that actually means and what actions put me in that path. Daisy wants to take a break but I'm again fearful in that is will be the end of our friendship and I'll lose her to our circle who have been supportive in her pushing away from me in recent months. What do I do and what do I become out of nothing?

41,"I'm just a really damn good looking guy. I have great hair, nicely done eyebrows, a nice beard, nice eyelashes, a sharp jawline and structured face, a slightly pointed but still nice nose, nice brown skin complexion, a nice/lean body because I regularly visit the gym, and my face just comes together so pleasantly. I'm also a pretty optimal height of 5'11, so clothes fit me pretty well overall. 

Sometimes I would stare at myself in the mirror for like 15 minutes to half an hour just admiring myself. I'm not totally flawless, for example my teeth aren't perfectly straight, and my skin has a few blemishes, but I think that's okay. I'm still super beautiful in my opinion. I wasn't always this hot, but puberty's been slowly hitting me, and I'm proud of myself for going to the gym, avoiding bad foods, drinking lots of water, taking care of my skin and hair, and taking the time to dress nicely. Few of my friends told me a look a little like a young Leonardo DiCaprio if you're wondering.

45,"I'm 19 years old, german. I've been raised in a moderately conservative household, by two loving and caring parents. Still, I've experienced frequent distress during puberty. Both of my my parents were top-of-their-class students, having studied political sciences and biology. My brother and I are both average students, frequently struggeling to pass classes, even though both of us have been tested for very high IQ's. This has lead to countless arguments in family, with my parents argueing that we spend all of our mental recources on recreation, rather than "" what really matters "". Just recently I've started working towards my bachelors degree and I can proudly declare that I've passed all of my courses, even though the study load seemed incredible high from time to time. I do have an active and broad social life, I picked up sports, have an assistantship with a professor I like and I DJ almost every weekend in different locations. Additionally I've helped forming an organization with which I'll travel to the middle east later this summer, helping syrian refugees and organizing workshops.

Still, I am constantly struggeling with myself. I catch myself frequently overworking, putting all my priority at certain unnecessary aspects. My marks are average at best, I have been rejected by mutiple girls I've romantically desired and I'm still in that permanent state of conflict with my family. 

Look, I'm feeling like I'm just on the way to become like my father. Constantly overworking, stressing about every tiny detail without really accomplishing anything. Yea, he enables my college education, a house for my family, especially as he has to earn for two as my mom suffers from a disability (MS). He is never satisfied, never resting, and seeking help for his mental issues is not an option.

The same goes for me. I literally can not take breaks. In my free time after Uni I watch documentaries or read informational books. I spend my entire summer holidays with building up a camp for refugees in one of the most dangerous regions on earth while my friends are drinking and chilling on the beach. The only time I take breaks is when I physically literatally can't go on anymore, when I've caught a bad flu or when I've smoked enough weed.

Oh yea, that's another point. I haven't spend a month drug-free since I'm 16. I do have multiple alcoholics in my family, and I feel like I'm on the path of becoming like that aswell. Not with alcohol but rather with a mix of weed, opiates and benzodiazepines. I've also used to frequently do stimulants like amphetamine or meth to make sure that I can hit deadlines in time, or, more often: To party on for 70+h.

That's the one thing in which I really differ from my parents. While my mum has one friend she frequently spends time with, my Dad has absolute 0 social life expect our family. He spends his nights with his laptop in front of the TV, working on presentstions while being passively entertained.  Even though the pre-conditions for a social life aren't exactly optimal and I've been severly bullied in multiple schools when I was younger, I managed to build up a network of friends. They are something I truely value, especially as I've now found true friends, unlike my 17-y/o "" getting as fucked up as possible and party to techno music until we literally can't dance anymore, then do speed until we reach a psychosis-like state ""-buddies.

When I am chosen to recite or to share my opinions, I would say it directly and concise, but is sometimes not substantial enough eventhough I carry lots of ideas in my mind, I just could not get them out. When talking in front of many people, I always forget the exact words to say and I always create long awkward pauses. Plus, I always get so nervous that makes my stomach feel bad. When I came to deliver my very last speech that I prepared for one night for a particualar subject, I forgot my own words when I stepped onto the stage. It was a disaster.

They are goals rarely accomplished by anyone, that way the glory of achieving it motivates me to do anything at all, and I convince myself it's an inevitability so I can be rude to you, and you, and fuck what you think, because im accomplishing this big goal that you wouldn't even get close to. The fact that it's so lofty means I can just skip past everything you normal people do, like get a job, what do I need a job for? I'm destined for great things. And here's the crux:when I inevitably fail, which I do invariably, I can blame my lack of success not on the fact I didn't do any fucking work to actually accomplish it, or even if I did maybe I'm just not good enough, no no no, I can just blame it on the fact that it's the enormous nature of the goal which means the odds where stacked against me.

I couldn’t pick up a 15lb barbell without my arms shaking uncontrollably and it was so embarrassing. In the beginning I used to only go 2x a week because I was so sore but then i started to go 3x a week. Then it became 5 and then..... 7x a week.. okay so ever since I started going 7 days a week at times I go 2x a day.

2. Like I mentioned, I’ve been doing that stuff for a couple of months. I have been eating around 1600 calories. Most of which come from protein and the rest from carbs. I eat really healthy and everything I eat I write it down along with the calories protein carbs and fat. I’ve been told countless times 1600 calories for me is too little yet I’m not losing any weight? Wtf?
