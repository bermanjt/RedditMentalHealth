0,"I’m a full-time student, 21 years old. Recently quit my part-time job so that I can focus on school. 
I am currently working towards 2 majors and a minor. It’s the end of my junior year and it’ll be one more year until I graduate. I only have a few classes left to complete my majors (it’s too late to back out now). 

I’m constantly depressed because I do schoolwork in between lectures, which is about 6 hours every day. I live 45 mins away off campus and I commute. 

By the time I get home, I’m exhausted but I still have so much to do. I’ll lay down for a few minutes and then I’ll go into depressed mode and stay in bed, thinking about all of the stuff I have to do, and cry. 

I feel as if I’m not working hard enough, but if I take a step back, I realize that I’m spending up to 8-10 hours a day doing schoolwork. 

The bulk of my workload comes from one class alone, and it’s gotten to the point where there are so many things I have to memorize for that course that I just freeze up, start to cry, and then I pretty much just lay in bed because I don’t know where to start. 

I’ve always been a good student despite my long- existing mental health issues and the added on stress. I was really strong up until this point, and now I feel like I’m going to break. 

Sorry, I just wanted to get this off my chest. I was probably having a manic episode when I decided to pick up a second major my sophomore year. But now I’m stuck hating my first one. 

Okay there. ",25Apr2018,1
2,"It feels so surreal. This is my first ever relationship so I don't have any prior experience. I'm trying my best to be a good boyfriend, but sometimes I can't help but think that I am not good enough. She talks to a lot of guys, so I am scared that she will lose interest quick or even regret her decision. Even though she is an amazing person and I trust her 100%, this thought still haunts me at night.

Right now I just want tips on how to not feel so insecure about everything and what I can do to be the best partner possible. I want to be there for her but I also don't want to be clingy.

Any advice?",25Apr2018,1

5,"Here I am, it felt like the right thing to do at this point: let everything go and right down my thoughts. This past week i've noticed that the past three girls that I've been dating have had kids and they all have families now. For myself, I keep falling back in my drugs addiction, which brings psychosis and an endless cycle of begining and failing. I can't keep myself from thinking that I could have a family of my own with one of those nice girls if I would had got my shit together at some point in the last decade. I find it very hard not to blame myself. I keep trying to keep in mind that there might be some other purpose to my life, some other place I need to be, and therefore those regrets should not get in my way.... But in the end, it all feels lik a big mess. I'm sick of seeing other man get the families that I could have had, would'have I been more of an.... adult.",25Apr2018,2
7,"This is how my grandpa made most of his money.

I have a goal, I want to retire (or at least be able to have that option) by the time I'm 45. I'm 28 now.

I want to invest in single family homes. I plan on buying my first house, a simple 3 bedroom, 2 bath, 1,500 sq feet, nothing fancy at all for my area and live in for 2-3 years as I build up another downpayment/fix up my current house/etc and purchase another house, and rent that out. 

Basically I'll leverage 30 year mortgages with the lowest downpayments the banks will let me get away with (at first I'm sure it'll be 20%)

I'll keep a budget in each rent amount for repairs/upgrades/etc I'll pay my mortgages and then all the left over money after all the taxes and good stuff will go into a savings account to buy another single family home.

Each home I'll buy in the same way, I'll look for a solid deal and be prepared to put a little bit of elbow greese into it, and budget for repairs etc. But I'll make to have an independent home inspector every single purchase. If I can't inspect the property (some deals are like that) I won't buy it.

I will pay a property management company to manage the property for me, especially at first. That way they know how to screen potential renters, deal with issues, have contractors on call, etc. 

If I do this for the next 17 years I would guess I could have 8-9 properties conservatively speaking. I'm finding typical homes in my market that are 3 bedroom, 2 bath tend to go for $75k in decent neighborhoods. With taxes and everything that comes out to $375~ to $400 depending property tax/insurance etc. Those homes can rent for $1,100-$1,300 a month. Sure there's a lot of costs involved over the years but once the properties are matured (i.e through any growing pains) and all repairs are budgeted for and tenants are full retirement by the time I'm 45 isn't out of the picture even with 6 or 7 properties. 

I will also sell homes along the way depending on how the market goes. If the market goes up quite a bit and I can sell a house and use that money to buy 3-4 more houses I'll do that. Basically the goal is to acquire single family homes.",25Apr2018,2
8,"I feel like a lot of the arguments we get into are because of misunderstanding and lack of perspective taking, whether it be from him or me.

Recently we got into an argument because I'm getting annoyed at how my parents made their friends obligated to babysit me and my sister while they're out of country for two weeks. Mind you, I'm 22 years old, I have a job that doesn't hinder me from taking care of my 13 year old sister. And while I'm at it, here's a bit of background: I'm Asian, first generation, the eldest. My parents have always been strict and overbearing, my parents have always treated me as if I was incompetent but for some reason don't see I AM capable because of the years of neglect they've put on me (they worked very hard while I was growing up and while I can't blame them for trying to better my future, there is also no denying they were not as present as a child needed them to be when growing up). My parents told their friends and co-workers to occasionally drop by to give us food, but my mom had already cooked food prior to leaving, but on top of that I know how to cook??? Like, bottom line: my family is making others obligated to babysit me and my sister when we're both capable of being independent. It's really frustrating because if feels like they're constantly trying to strip any ounce of autonomy I've made for myself or try to maintain.

But then the new problem is, I just vented to my boyfriend saying that what they're doing is honestly annoying. That's all, just saying I was annoyed. He thinks I'm making a big deal out of nothing and just being drama seeking. This irritated me even more than necessary, maybe on top of the fact it's our fucking fifth year anniversary as a long distant couple. I just felt like it was very non-understanding, but I honestly think he doesn't understand that because our family dynamics are just polar opposites. And not that skin color should play a part of it, but culture REALLY does play a big factor into this that I think he NEVER looks at, or at least forgets to. He's white, I'm Asian. His family let him grow into his independence, my family makes it visibly and emotionally difficult to be independent when I need to be and when I want to be; and I genuinely think this is cultural.

 
 

tl;dr -- my overbearing, Asian family and upbringing has yet, again created some type of annoyance for me that my Caucasian, independently brought up, boyfriend doesn't seem to understand and I'm just so SICK of the arguments.",25Apr2018,5
10,"I question if posting this is the right thing to do. I feel like I am constantly searching for answers, inside &amp; out, an epiphany, something. When I think about my life, childhood to now, I feel like I have always been this way &amp; it sucks. I can’t pinpoint from my childhood what could have affected me, or if I am just carrying some crazy shit from a past life, but apparently I have always been this way. My mom used to tell me stories about how I had terrible tantrums, I have no relationships with childhood friends &amp; I struggle with making friends still to this day. I feel like the person I present to the world, the one that is happily married with two beautiful children &amp; has it all together, still gives off this sad unhappiness that doesn’t draw people in. It makes me really sad &amp; deep deep down inside I know this isn’t me, but I feel trapped in this unhappiness hell. I pray that one day my purpose will just hit me, the thing that holds my key to happiness, but as I get older I feel further from it as every thing that I think is the answer fails &amp; I’m back to the drawing board to figure out my calling. My marriage could definitely be better &amp; we struggle constantly. My beautiful children are my only joy, but I fear I’m going to screw them up. I am trying to turn it around, fake it til I make it &amp; I utilize resources that suggest a path towards happiness. I don’t want to give up on myself in this search, but it is hard to not get discourage. If anyone can give me advice/encouragement, I would appreciate it. ",25Apr2018,3
12,"I’m in my final years of highschool, and everyone is talking about what they want to be and their plans and I never had one and it kinda bummed me out, all I ever had going for me was I could make people around me laugh.

I grew up adoring comedy, watching anything that’s comedy and mimicking it and taking little bits and pieces of it too shape who I am today and use it to try and make people laugh. 

I want to be a comedian in anyway possible, My dream would be something of a surreal comedy skit show like the Eric Andre show or loiter squad. 

The thing is, I’m scared if it fails, my parents are going to hate me for not going to collage or the military, but I feel like the only way I can make it is to give everything I have towards it, nothing else seems like I will be happy doing it, I want to make people laugh and make my career be that.

13,"It's weird. Like the title says, It's been approximately five or six years since I broke down and cried for no reason. My anxiety and self-deprecation use to be through the roof, but I've gotten older and have had a good handle on it. But tonight, in the middle of doing homework for finals, It snuck up on me. It's a culmination of things, I suppose. But tonight I feel terrible. I'm reminded of my past and how bad it used to get. I want to believe I'm better than I was years ago, but now I'm unsure. I'm even making this post impulsively, I hate venting. But lately I've felt so insecure, stressed, and overwhelmed that I just can't. I know others have it worse than me and that others are doing better than where I'm at, but I don't know.",25Apr2018,1
15,"I’m always marveled at the things people do. Whether that’s expressing themselves and why [that is]. Movements and why. Reactions and why. Social interactions and why. Etc.
I’m also always interested in the movements and behavior of animals, whether they’re wild or pets.
For instance: I found myself in complete awe watching a slow 4K Res video of kittens playing, recently. I loved looking at the way they pounced around and how their claws would come undone. Sometimes I question the evolution of things as well and how our creatures today came to be who they are and where that evolution began.
I don’t know where this sort of new phenomenon came from inside of me. I think most people would find it dull like, “Eh? That’s life?” But I can’t help but just feel so questionable about it all.

18," I have a sense. There have been different instances over the last few days that have reinforced it. It's as if a big puzzle were constantly shifting, and then here a piece, there a piece, and as they slide in, you get sudden “ah ha” moments. It's a mild reassurance. It's a degree of comfort. It feels like understanding, and whether it actually is or not doesn't seem to matter.


A consequence I blame on getting old is starting to see everyone as a child. “Big” and “important” and “dramatic” things lose their shine. The connotative value of the life or death scenario that's playing out at all times loses its ability to provoke a sense of urgency. When I talk about having a foot in the grave, whether I were 5 or 50, it's still true. It's not some screaming insecurity or genuine fear as one might experience as they're actually spiraling out of control on the highway. It serves as a kind of reminder that in order to maintain a kind of persistent motivation, it needs to be rooted in your ideas.


As far as reminders go, I'm now living the firsthand experience of the kind of “safety” the “normal” world craves. If I stay polite and fill out paperwork, I could do this job indefinitely. Every home broken or saved isn't really on me, no matter the “faithful” lip service. When people trust you an inch, they give away miles of their lives with information for you to work with. I can make their lives easier or harder, throw their mistakes in front of authority or bury them, or maintain a standard of care and authority, or bemoan getting home a little later than I'd prefer. It's the same kind of choice you make every moment of every day even alone watching TV and reading, but it's dressed up with “consideration” for people's petty egos.


I'm reminded that I'm good at it. As “friends” found their safe spaces and stopped flirting with the idea of drunken hook\-ups with me before finding a spouse, they liked the guy who could talk about anything and not judge them. They liked when I had a plan to entertain them or went out with the agenda to help them get laid. The energy it takes to keep a party flowing is 10 times more than to encourage a person struggling with addiction for a few minutes every week. Writing blogs takes me longer than the paperwork for a dozen families might take to fill out. I could choose to complain in greater measure and slack off, or I can place this job and its relative impact into my giant bag of life experiences that engender that much more credibility when I bother to opine.


It's in watching people rationalize in real time their inadequacy that sense of reassuring calm comes over me. Oh, right, this is why when I first started writing I was obsessed with discussing non\-maliciously manipulating people. They give themselves over, all the time, every day, with every chance you give them. I choose to take to the page and lay out every possible detail for you to twist or learn from me, they pack a handful of sentences with how they'd like to be treated and understood the rest of their lives. They tell you how they're going to fail or how they justify. They *imply* things they know you understand.


And in the world of “implied understanding,” I thrive. Big and tall well dressed and well spoken man? It's night and day going to the bars in that outfit verses my normal tattered shirt and cargoes. I feel like an infomercial; it's just that easy. It's why I got bored with it initially and stopped whoring around. It's why conversations of potential malicious toying with the dynamic can creep up too often if you're not paying attention or no one is around to hold you accountable. Lucky for me, I keep sharing my writing.


There's also the reason I'm persistently angry prevalent as well. Particularly of my smart friends who didn't become doctors. You know it's that easy too. You could budget better, or organize, or try and create something new. You have the time to speak to big whole\-world issues. I'm “busy” too now, except, of course I'm not. Just like we found the time to party in spite of college and still graduate. The “real world” is the magnified insecurities and fears never dealt with, not this looming mediocre fate one needs to suffer in solidarity. Remember, my biggest complaint isn't “failing” at the things I try, it's having no one to try them with, and it's not for lack of asking.


Alas, in the parallel normal world, I'll find all sorts of people! Yes, I'm sure soon I'll have co\-workers inviting me to lunch or after a flurry of a few busy weeks that bank account will have me nonchalantly talking about actually making good on a few cross\-country visits. Is that what I want? Well, sure, I wanna go chill with Hatsam and Wendy, no doubt. Is it going to be what I need? Is it going to speak to what gnaws at me every day I don't see a road to achieving? Hardly.


I feel I've moved a little too far away from that sense though. The pieces falling into place have everything to do with having lived, to some degree, through a similar scenario before. I've been in many random places and homes before I started doing it for this job. I routinely gamble with how much I should or shouldn't say so negotiating the space between me and a “problem” client doesn't register as intimidating. My fundamentals and outlooks are clear, so the wordy details get a little less important. It's easy to see how “playing by the rules” makes you think of ways to support a family or plan for trips months in advance that come without notice and are over too quickly. There's an extremely powerful cultural flow that isn't all bad.


My concerns remain the same. It can arrest your perspective. You work yourself to death. You make excuses and apologies. You get too polite. I let my “jaded” sensibilities breath in writing, and perhaps it's a testament to a measure of wisdom to rehearse and release here so blowing up in real life becomes less likely. There's still a fuck ton broken and that we're not paying attention too. You know how little I've thought about Trump? I'm just busy enough writing a report that he's the furthest thing from my mind. Not terribly long ago, I was railing about the creeping fascism arresting this country. That's still true. Bill Maher calls it a “slow moving coup.”


I think my anger towards “friends” and confusion about my relationship to them is in taking for granted they could transcend this flow to the same degree I try to. They could see past their paycheck and bills, I supposed. They wanted to take chances and live differently. NOPE lol. God, I'm a fucking moron. They're as happy to capitulate to normal feelings and obligations as the next guy. They didn't take my blogs as predictive prophecy, THE BASTARDS lol. My anger seems more a mourning in that light. It was the comfortable “school lie” like this comfortable “work lie” keeps paying as long as I keep singing their gospel. You play along long enough, you might get a shot at affecting some “real change” \(you know, because they're the guardians of the “real world”\) and your name will go up in lights...or a plaque or something.


I still want to be what's underneath. I'd rather never be known and watching my impact unfold than be handed some award and be expected to give a polite speech about how the system really isn't out to get us. I'm not full on conspiratorial wing\-nut believing every junk piece of “alternative” media, nor am I a buttoned up rule bloviator, but it seems I've exercised a degree of competence across layers that no single one is ever going to speak to. You don't care if I'm a “good” social worker. You want to see me build secret rooms in my playhouse and whether or not I can “revolutionize” some industry or way of living. You know why you want to see that? Because I want to see it of myself. I speak to what I actually want, even when I'm exactly confused or wrong in knowing how to get there.


I just wonder if you've taken enough time to know what you're really built out of. I'm still fitting in pieces some 717 blogs in, but what's stuck has really stuck. I keep shifting into different versions of familiar, and fairly fucked up, worlds. Breaking out is extremely hard. Doing it alone, I suspect more and more, is impossible. How many times have I advocated for a “culture” level change? That means I see myself shaping more than our professional or interpersonal relationship. I want to shift the tides of life itself. That takes a level of creativity and people signing on that you're willing to concede to the Scientologists? Even Waco managed dozens of people. I can't get one or two?


I suppose it's that every playbook is already written. I'm nothing special, I'm just reading. I want my story to be interesting and encompassing. I want the people in my world to view themselves as equitable characters and not incidental pawns or tragic failures filled with hopes and dreams about what they'll get to read about me one day. I want the kind of help that's actually people helping themselves. Because they're not, and you, the majority of the time, aren't actually helping. I can't stop people from doing drugs, or beating their wife, or from sexualizing children. I can learn and approach the topics in ways that could improve the culture that essentially acts like profiteers on their behavior. Be it emotional profiteering in lazy ill\-informed donations and inflated budgets or actual cash grabs in sneaking in as many “extra” 15 minutes as you can plausibly defend in billing.


Who's side are you on? Your own, and therefore mine, or the end of some passive agenda? You do remember you've got a foot in the grave too, right? You know there will be plenty of struggle left over for your kids, excuse me, puppies, because none of you want to admit the dire circumstances you're living under which are constantly at war with your biology. What's it gonna take? Because when you're not the one acting, shit's going to happen to you. You're gonna get sick and old. You gonna have enough money? You're gonna wish and pray and try to remember the good times. Is your small donation or encouraging facebook post gonna prop you up? 


Do you want to be the bigger and better culture, or just ride the one you've been given? Doing so doesn't mean you're thinking or have figured something out. It means you're already dead. Don't fool yourself into thinking there's a dollar amount or number of friends that will ever count if that's your umbrella. And you certainly shouldn't think of me as anything but a faint eccentric memory of our youthful folly. My begrudging ignorant pragmatism isn't condoning the larger picture in hiding behind the perks or recognition. My obligation remains. My real anxiety isn't being tangibly spoken to. Are you better off than me? ",25Apr2018,2

And then there was this sharp pain in my stomach when i drank the water, I usually get sharp pains in one of my body parts atleast twice a week but this sharp pain was like 4x worse than my normal sharp pains, It was like getting stabbed but on the inside. I walked towards somewhere fast, And it was on the bathroom door, I leaned in the door and then ran towards the kitchen and sat on one of the chair, It was so hard to breathe, I needed more water but i couldn't stand up, Probably cuz of the pressure. So i asked my grandma to give me plain water, And after i drank it, My breathing became normal after a few seconds, And the pain lessened. But she said, ""Why'd you drink cold water while you're hungry?"" and then i said if that was wrong and she said Yes..And i ate after that, And i got full quick. Im now back at my room and i can still feel the pain, For some reason i feel like it's bleeding, Hopefully not lol

For context - I have a history of mental illness and Leukaemia (Blood Cancer) alot fo the side effects that come with it. 

Recently have dropped alot of weight and have a low white blood cell count.

Have been eating and putting on weight slowly.

I think it’s close too two years now that I haven’t been able to do nearly anything that I have wanted or thought.

Probably due to sleep and fatigue problems.

My energy is depleted all the time.

I feel like shit all the time. Mental and physical exhaustion.

Wondering if the next day I have enough energy to do anything

I belive learned alot and made progress even if I didn't do much.

I don't really have a job at the moment, im working on it but I have a plan.

I’ve done so much research into chronic stress, adverse childhood experiences, toxic stress, cognitive impairments, fatigue syndrome, depression, depersonalisation, anxiety and other health ptsd.

Trying to understand whats going on my life and why things happen and why and how I react to them.

For treatment I have tried councelling, psychotherapy, CBT, healing emotional issues, talk therapy.

I found this thing called neuro NeurOptimal®. It is an advanced neuro-technology that offers training to the brain, enabling it to function at its best. It’s mathematically designed to communicate directly with your central nervous system and has been called “the most effective bio-hack on this planet”.

What im asking here I guess if there is any information anyone knows about cancer support or just support and health support or any information or critisim. 

Open to anything really. If I haven't mentioned much or if you have a question about something feel free to ask.

32,"I was planning on spending the rest of my life with him up until that morning when I was completely blindsided because ""we had different paths."" And I am so grateful to him. We loved each other and have great memories, but we were both settling. I thought I would be content with the life we were planning together and was too scared to end it in fear of ""what if it was the wrong decision?"" So I buried that thought for a long time. He made the decision for me. He was strong enough to do what I couldn't.

I wake up each morning with such self confidence, I don't know where it came from. There's a burning desire for self improvement mentally and physically, it's almost indescribable. I just feel so fucking good about myself. I'm starting to love myself after years of bitterness, anger, and anxiety that I hadn't realized was taking over. I'm seeing the beautiful things in life, the small everyday things I took for granted when I was in an unhappy and unfulfilling relationship. And I had no idea how much I had negatively changed after being together until we broke up and had some deep self reflection.

I feel so calm and at peace, especially after such a huge change that was out of my control, even though I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. I am so grateful for the life I'm living and for the love and support of my family and friends, for the fact that I can do what I love with nothing hold me back. I feel so free. I have no anger towards him, just gratitude.

I hope you are happy in your life. I hope you appreciate the small things, small gestures, the beautiful world we live in. It takes too much unnecessary energy to be negative, to hold grudges, to be angry and bitter when there is so much to be thankful for, when we can put that energy into ourselves to become even better. I hope you know how beautiful you are and that you deserve to love yourself and be happy. Go outside, take a long deep breath, and take in and appreciate every little thing around you. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",25Apr2018,8

I’m excited to get out of the monotony that comes from living in this town and have a fresh start where people don’t know me and I can break past all the negative energetic and toxicity. But I’m also scared to leave the good things behind, like good friends and I’m worried we will inevitably drift but I’ve never known so many people that I can trust. ",25Apr2018,1

36,"I got a job last year at a pub/restaurant local to me. All was good at first, but I quickly realised how bad the manager was. Bullying, manipulative, short-tempered, and a thief of wages and tips. I stuck it out for a few months, before managing to get an even more local job, with better hours and a better wage. 

So I've had the massive pleasure of texting my manager (IMO he doesn't deserve me telling it to his face) my resignation. A massive weight off my shoulders, couldn't be happier.",25Apr2018,6
38,"3 years ago I moved to an extremely remote town in northern Canada with my ex. We broke up last year and it was messy. I also see her around town constantly, which sucks.

 I have more or less settled in to life here, I have a new girlfriend who is amazing and a pretty decent job as an apprentice electrician, although I am not passionate about my work. I have been feeling the urge to move back to a bigger city, closer to my family and more ""connected"" with the outside world, where I can pursue music in my free time and have more experiences available to me.

I doubt my SO would want to move with me as her family is in this small town and she loves her life here. I've never been in a situation where I might have to break up with someone where the relationship is going great. How can I start planning to leave everything behind and start a new life?",25Apr2018,1
39,"I’m a junior in high school, I know my problems aren’t as crazy as other people’s. There are folks out there who don’t have food to eat, a place to sleep, or people who care about them. So my problems feel stupid when stuff like that is going on. I feel like a brat when I think about how I’m feeling. I have depression as a result of my parents separating and all the burden and responsibilities falling on me since I’m the oldest. My doctor has asked the school to try and help me. That was almost 3 years ago and nothing ever happened. I met with a councilor twice and they decided since I didn’t want to kill myself then that I was just being a baby and swept me under the rug. Now all the repressed feelings are flooding in and they’re too much. I haven’t gone to school in over a month. They haven’t dropped me yet but I know they will if I don’t start going. But I just can’t find it in me to face these problems. I can’t face the consequences, i know I need to go but I feel hopeless. I don’t want to walk in and look my classmates or teachers in the eyes. What do I respond to when they keep prying into why I haven’t come to school? If I didn’t want to tell my own mother that I’ve thought of killing myself, what makes you think I’m just going to spill my guts out to you in the middle of class? I appreciate your concern but I really just want to slip back into school and put this behind me. But I can’t, I feel like I already threw my future away since I have already missed a semester. And it was ingrained into my head that without school there is no success in life. But I can’t find motivation to go to school anymore, I can barely find motivation to eat. I just shower to be alone. My family surrounds me everyday, but I’ve never felt so alone. I don’t want to tell anyone what I’m feeling. I’m supposed to be a man. I can’t share my emotions, I’m not supposed to have any. I was raised to look problems in the eye and bottle up all my thoughts and emotions. But I can’t do it anymore. I don’t talk to anyone anymore, all day I’m just alone with my thoughts. And when my family is around I have to pretend to be happy so they don’t worry. I can’t let them know about my mental state, we have enough issues as is. So, I tell my mom I’m just lazy and I promise I’ll go the next day. She gets angry and we argue it eats at me everyday. I hate fighting with her. I don’t want to argue anymore, I just want to disappear because I know killing myself is just going to create even more problems for everyone I leave behind. That’s literally the only reason I’m still sticking around. I hope that by writing this down maybe I’ll feel a bit better. If anyone reads this, thanks for taking time out of your day to read this wall of meaningless text.",25Apr2018,2
40,"After finishing my works, i went to the cinema which is near my apartment, i wanted to see the “ Infinity War “ . The cinema was full of people, they were waiting to get the ticket . I got into the line , waiting with them . It took me over 30 mins to get to the stalls . 
As i think , all the seat had been booked, the earliest would be 2 days. But I accepted, i paid for it and left . Everything was great , i had the ticket , i had a great seat . It was like nothing bad could happen. But then i met him ... the SPOILERS . 
He is 15 years old , I guess. Worn the green shirt with blue jeans. He just watched the movie , with his friends . They were smiling and talking. 
I met him when i was waiting for the elevator. He saw the ticket on my hand . 
“ oh , you want to watch this flim too ? “ He asked 
“ Yes , i will watch it “ I answered 
“That’s great . The movie is cool .”
At that moment, i knew he would say something, he would spoil everything about the movie , my brain told me to run , run far away from him . But i didn’t, and that is my biggest regret. 
“ **** Died , do you know that and bla bla “ 
My heart stopped beating when he said that , all i could hear is “ **** died “ . Everything around me was falling .... F you you dirty bitch , how could you do that ??? I haven’t watched the movie , and now thank to you , i already know what will happen. You scumbag ...

46,"Im almost 30, and Ive been cooking for 5 years now. I like what I do, but wtf is the point? If I had gone into plumbing 5 years ago Id be making WAY more money than I do. Id probably have benefits. And some sort of not insane work/life balance. Id get vacation time... Hell Id get fucking LUNCH BREAKS.

But no... Here I am, making 14$ an hour plus tips (usually pushing me up to 16$ an hour) barely able to afford a medium apartment. My employer is ""good"" as far as employers go in this industry, but I only work 25 hours a week, and my schedule is all over the place so a second job would be next to impossible. I could move on- But like I said, most employers in this industry are scumbags. Id be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire most likely. 

I mean sure, if Im the next big thing in the culinary world in my city Ill end up making decent money. But Id have to give up so much more than I do now... To what end? So I can create dishes? Woohoo... And honestly? If Im being honest? Im a damned good worker, and Im a decent cook... But Im not going to be the next Gordon Ramsay. Im just not willing to pour my being into this. I love doing it, but it doesnt define me. Its an EXTREMELY competitive industry and people like me usually end up burning out. The ones who succeed do so because they dont care about pay, or work standards. They want to cook. And they'd do it for free if they could. I mean hell- Watch Chef's table. Im no Grant Achatz. That dude is inhuman. 

The worst part is Im not really good at much else. I want to move on... But to what? Im willing to go to college, but Im not a numbers kind of a guy. Im not very handy with tools that arent kitchen stuff... I feel trapped.

Maybe it wouldnt be so bad if this industry wasnt tailor made to fuck cooks over. Everything from stupid hours, to outright labour abuse. I know for a fact the biggest and most prestigious restaurateur in my city will NOT pay over time to his staff. Justified by saying that being able to put one of his pet projects on your resume is payment enough, or that tip outs (which he dips into) even things out. Labour abuse in this industry is so endemic its common to hear ""thats the industry you work in! Cant deal with it leave!"" as if wanting fair pay and over time is being selfish. Complain to the labour board and enjoy being black balled because the chef community is very small, and nobody wants to hire a shit disturber.

Or I could go work some bland corporate gig like my last job where Ill make okay money, and maybe get mediocre benefits, but have to cook shit food for people who dont give a fuck. Which... Is somehow just as bad as the opposite to me. Either way, if Im not cut out to be a chef Ill be stuck below the poverty line forever. Hell even as a chef I wont be making much money.

Wtf do I do? Ugh. ",25Apr2018,1
47,"I don't even know how to start this. I have felt completely dissociated from my past and myself for so long that I don't even know who I am anymore. I have been journaling and spending a lot of time thinking and trying to figure out how to get out of this, and yesterday it felt like I finally found a way to describe how I view myself. I have never been able to pinpoint it until now. I was looking in the mirror and I thought that I looked creepy. Creepy. It just hit me that is how I see myself. I act so creepy towards people. I am sulking, with this angry expressionless look on my face all the time. I can barely speak and when I do, it always seems like there is something off about me. 

This thought sent me down a whirl of different thoughts about my past and how I view myself. Suddenly I felt a lot more like who I was and it was like I felt like myself again but at the same time, I was horrified. I kept thinking about me as a child and how I feel like I was born with an evil bone in my body. Like I was born evil. I was trying to figure out how to stop being so creepy and this is what I started thinking about. I kept thinking about how, deep in my mind, I have this belief that I am destined for greatness and how I am secretly better than everyone else. I went down a spiral thinking about how to go about changing this belief. I was thinking so much into it I was giving myself a headache so I smoked some pot and now it feels like before. I don't even know who I am anymore. I just know that deep down somewhere inside of me, I fucking hate myself so much. And I was thinking, what would I rather have? Feeling like this blank slate of a human being, with no identity or past, or remembering how much of a monster I am, and honestly, I would rather at least have some kind of identity than none, even if it is terrible because at least I can try to change it.

I want to know how to reassociate with your past when you lose it. Right now, I don't even know who I am. I feel like this person is typing who doesn't have a past or any kind of identity. It's miserable.",25Apr2018,7
48,"Hey reddit. I'm a 17 year old boy, akward, shy and bit of a nerd.
I've never had a gf or kissed a girl

So, going straight to the main point, i got into a new high school this year, and i really liked it despite being scared and stuff, i just prepared my mind to say ""You won't be making friends or lovers and that's Ok"" in the end i actually got more friends than i expected but i still enjoy having a small circle and being alone

One of those friends is a girl, who is really cute and sociable.

She started talking to me and we became good friends, even to the  point of her joking about she being my girlfriend (Btw what the fuck, is this something normal?) and saying that we could date someday, we laughed when talking and took selfies for snapchat, but as time went through we started talking less, and because i'm bad at starting conversation i always expect her to talk to me, and she doesn't. We had a parcc test this week and i didn't see her for about 3 days (We only have one class together) so that hurt a bit too.

Today i decided to do something about it. I just felt like my life would just be a boring loophole if i stay quiet, my mind just shouted ""No more"".
So i chit-chatted  a bit with her and then asked if we could hang out this weekend, because i'm really bored and i feel we don't talk enough.
She said she will be working, and that she doesn't really like going to the mall because she works there.
Is this true??? I can't even tell if she's lying because i can barely keep eye contact but i guess she wouldn't do that to me
instantly after that i just get a storm of thoughts, ""Is she lying?, Do i even mean something to her? Will i ever get another chance?""

I don't even know if im love with her or not, my emotions are pathetically mild. We don't have that much in common but i think we're a cute couple, even if it is a couple of friends
This is why I also wanted to go out with her, the lack of social pressure makes you show what you really feel about someone, and if she's not talking to me just to make me feel emotionally better (This has happened to me in the past and i feel i was at fault for misunderstanding her intentions)

I just want to know if i'm really into her (Ignoring her pretty asian smile, and hourglass waist) or if it's just my desperation from thinking that every chance i get with a girl will be my last

Don't get me wrong, im fine alone and i'm not depressed at all, but quoting Blur: ""I don't need anyone, but a little of your love would make things better"" that's exactly how i feel. Some women are just breathtaking and marvelous ",25Apr2018,1
49,"So I'm only in my 20s, but I'm starting to feel angry all the time. Up until college I was depressed all the time and then one day it just stopped. I found alcohol and the depression went away, at least until my doctor warned me to consider my health. I only drink once in a blue moon nowadays but it left an impact on me.


Around the same time I started to drink, I started getting angry all the time at the slightest inconveniences. I still feel that way and it's getting worse. I just hate other people now. I'm losing my empathy and worry that one day I'll just explode and off myself or something. The world is fucked and there isn't much good left to be found.


*HOWEVER*, that is not the person I am at this very moment in time. I don't mean for this post to be a cry for help, but instead a piece of reflection. At the start of this year, I made a vow to myself that I would improve my life by trying to accomplish some goals that I've had for years.


I'm working out and I've lost almost 15 lbs in the past couple months. I wanted to learn a new language so I started learning French with DuoLingo and I'm about to hit the 100 day mark. I've kicked my lifelong soda addiction and I've started improving my health.


I still really need to find a job but I think my life is going in the right direction. I just need to find a way to get rid of all this anger and hate that drags me down.


Edit: Also, I need to improve my grammar and punctuation. I used to be a fairly decent writer but being out of school for a while has diminished my vocabulary significantly.",25Apr2018,3
50,"9 years ago today my father-in-law died of cancer. On my birthday. He was one of the best men I've ever known. He was supposed to have a couple more months left. He should have had decades. I can still hear my mother-in-law's voice on my wife's cell phone saying he's gone as we were on our way to see him. 

He was so much more important than my birthday. I don't care about it. He was an awesome man that a filthy disease took from us at 49 years of age. I just want people to remember him. It being my birthday was coincidence. Him dying was a tragedy.

I only got to know him for 3 years. And it's amazing how after 9 years the pain can still be so great. If you've read this far. I'm sorry for my rambling. I just can't let these feelings out to my wife or my family and I just needed to vent. He was a great man.",25Apr2018,1
