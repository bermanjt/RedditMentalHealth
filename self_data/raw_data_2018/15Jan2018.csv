0,"I went to a concert last night, on the way home someone tried to fight me. For reference I’m a guy, and a freshman in college.

Well on the way home we jumped on the green line train (this was in Boston btw), there was a massive group of people waiting with us to get on the train. Once the doors opened I rushed to a seat, I chose a random one. 

It happen to be next to a man around his 50s. I didn’t notice but his jacket was splayed onto the seat I chose, so when I sat it was on hide jacket. He instantly snapped and said “get the fuck off my jacket”. It was awkward because I was already getting up to go sit next to my girlfriend so I was at a distance when he said it. I looked back at him a little shocked, I didn’t really know what to do so I just said “what the fuck is your problem man” but not in a really aggressive way. I was scared so my voice was cracking. 

He said “do you want to fucking go?” while he shot out of his seat and did one of those things where you kind of charge but then stop short. I was scared so I sort of lept away towards my girlfriend, and by then the concert crowd had filled the train cart so we were separated.

That was about the end of the altercation but for the rest of way back to my girlfriends dorm I was in full panics mode. I kept my cool and remained calm on the the outside. But on the inside I was freaking out, it kind of felt like an anxiety attack because I kept going over the situation in my head.

Another important piece is that I’m physical disabled, in no way could I have defended myself against this man. I feel like a bitch but I want to invest in mace.

So when we finally got to my gf’s dorm I just broke down. Full on ugly cry just because I almost got into a fight. I feel like a wimp, but it really scared me. It’s been almost a day but I’m still shaken up. Luckily my girlfriend was very understanding and comforting while I bawled my eyes out.

3,"I was going to sell my ps4 because i no longer love gaming yet sometimes I go on there for the sake of boredom when it'd be better if I just watched a helpful YouTube video instead or something. My plan was to replace it for my roku box and I'd also be getting rid of the browser on the ps (trying to quit porn). I'm still unsure though, I've lately been chatting to a couple of friends on there and it's been quite nice communicating from the comfort of my own home, but at the same time I would like to have more of a routine in my life and would prefer going out more instead. Selling it would mean that I can only talk to those guys in person, over the phone or through messaging. I feel like if that's ever an issue then they aren't worth keeping in my life. Is it wrong to think that? I can see how benefitial consoles can be to hang out digitally but for me it'll just me staying on the home page while everyone else is playing. I just don't find games gripping anymore and the ones I like make me rage.

I feel like selling my p.s will make me somewhat lonely, half of me feels like it'll be in a benefitial meaning more focus on real life but the other half feels like I'll just slip further into isolation. Anyone have some advice or experience this or similar?",15Jan2018,6

I’ve cut out social media, russian practice, and more.

8,"I’ve had social anxiety since adolescence. I think a big part of it is my self esteem. I worry constantly what people think and I hate my guts.

Last year was so incredibly lonely for me. I moved away from my family to study a year course and I only really made one proper friend. But not a friend i’d keep in touch with. I feel so fucking pathetic.

I can’t be myself around strangers and it fundamentally gets in the way of me making friends. It never used to be like this, I still have old friends who live far away now, but no new friends. 

I want so badly to change, but I don’t know how. My parents always told me I would grow out of shyness, but basically halfway through my first year of university, I still haven’t fit in and I feel so depressed right now. I really wish I was someone else, I can’t seem to function like a normal human being. I don’t want to kill myself, but I wish I’d never been born.

How can I start to change myself?
Can anyone else who suffered from social anxiety and low self esteem give me advice on how to begin the journey to recovery? It would mean a lot, I’m pretty lonely right now.

I know somethings wrong with me, but I don’t know what to do.

10,"I was supporting some friends at a soccer game. They were kinda taking forever packing up, so I stretched out belly-up on some empty bleachers. My friend comes over to me joking around and saying ""Wow Mondonodo, you're such a hunk!"". I couldn't believe it at first, but he said it again, ""Yeah, you're so hunky!"".

11,"So this may sound weird to others and some may not believe me, have you ever heard of a game called Red Door, Yellow Door. My personal experience honestly scared the shit out of me, when my friend started chanting, I immediately saw things such as a purple door, hearing screams and crackling of fire behind the door, I could hear my other friends say, “Wake her up! Wake her up!” But instead of stopping we continued, she told me to see what was behind the door and that’s when emotion hit me and it was like I as inhaling smoke from the fire. They woke me up and I felt traumatized from this, but I decided to continued and did it a second time, and this time it was scarier than the last, feeling even more scared and terrified. I saw a man beside the same door, that was indeed purple, started to fade and a picture appear on the wall, of a man and two little boys, the picture was  hanging on the white walls that soon turned to ash as I stayed there longer and longer, I felt emotions hit like a brick. And they woke me up and I was breathing hard and crying I felt as though I was watching a family be ripped apart, the screams are still haunting me.

13,"I'm a freshman who is attending the college of their dreams. Everytime a relative or friend asks how I like it I lie and tell them I love it, when in reality these have been the hardest and darkest 5 months of my life. I moved 10 hours from home to make no friends and have no motivation. My whole life I lived in one place and friends came easily to me through sports then I got here and couldn't make any true friendships. I joined clubs, went to events and put myself out there like everyone told me to, but nothing stuck. I'd talk to people in class and at meetings, and some I even went out to lunch with or hung out with out of class once or twice, but they already have a group of friends so they don't really need me. On nights and weekends, I'm alone. My one and only close friend chooses other people over me all the time. She'll cancel plans to hang out with other people, and never even think to invite me. I know I should probably cut her off, but she's the closest thing I have to a friend here. I can't even tell my family how I really feel. They're so proud to tell people I go here and how great my life is, I don't want to disappoint them. The semester has just begun, but as each day goes by and get sadder and sadder. Every failed attempt at making friends has brought me lower and lower. I started to workout, hoping that would help and it did a little, but not enough to get rid of the pain and rejection I feel. I don't know how I'm going to do this for 3 and a half more years. I don't even know how I'm going to make it to next week. I have nobody to turn to except the internet. I even tried to get a single appointment with a therapist just to vent, and I was told she could see me in the fall. I don't even know if I'm going to make it that long. I have never in my life been this low before, I'm lonelier than I ever thought possible. ",15Jan2018,127
14,Is this something that happens while your in college or after?,15Jan2018,2
15,"I don't hear that so much anymore in my mid-20s.  Mainly because most people seem to think you should already have that figured out.  But I don't.  I'm currently in the process of trying to become an electrician while bouncing around from shitty job to shitty job.  The truth is I don't want to work, and it's like I can't tell anyone that without getting judgement.  I understand you need money to survive, but if you really want to know what I want to do you aren't going to like the answer.  Because it's unrealistic.  I want to hike the AT. I want to travel around the country in a van based on weather conditions. I want to relax on the beach. I'd like to live on a farm or in a commune of some sort.  I'd like to backpack around Europe.  I want to ride my bike from the Pacific coast to the Atlantic.  I want to spend time in Alaska.  I don't want to do anything else besides go on adventures.



And before anyone tells me ""well just do it!"" It's not that simple.  You need money for all of these things.  You need a way to get food, you need a way to not freeze to death, and most of all you need skills.  And after you're done, after you're burnt out and you want to rest for a little bit what do you do?  You don't have any place to unload.  Because you don't have money or a stable life.  Sometimes I feel like what is the point of all of this.  If the things I want to achieve are so far out of reach, and the only things I'm able to do make me miserable, why am I even here.  It would be much easier to just end it honestly.  And I've only really had that urge once in a fit of despair but I feel like as I age it's going to get more and more common.  I love my wife and I never ever want to leave here, but one day it will happen.  One day one of us is going to leave each other and it's so fucking depressing to think about.  Here we go, day after day, doing shit we hate to live a meager existence with a nice experience every once and a while meanwhile hating all the time in between that we aren't together.

16,"Well I have been feeling much better lately except tonight (still better though for sure). I did at least find a Christian therapist, from the 211 number that is a pay what you can so whenever I can fit that in I'll do that soon that way if anything maybe it can help clear my head idk. 

My husband has been helping me try to slowly do a few things with the kids (normal stuff that I will do with them but stuff that's far from my mind in this mood) he just sorta tries to nudge by saying if you want maybe you could try to do this with the kids today.  He's also been helping me get some things done that he knows I've been wanting to get done. Just stinks cause here he is able to help me yet it seems a bit like he might be a bit depressed and I can't do nothing because he won't ever tell me anything (I've brought it up with him before so it's not anything new he doesn't like to share his feelings very often). Makes me feel horrible. 

Still angry at my myself for making dumb choices , like how I stayed up watching tv. Now tomorrow I'll be cranky with two kids up and ready to go who will also most likely be cranky. At least finally feeling tired now should be out in under 5. ",15Jan2018,0
17,"I'm not sure if I have real anxiety issues, or if I just have a very active brain.
I tend to think of worse case scenarios for everything, before it even happens. 
I have a disease which for the most part is not under my control and I'll randomly be in huge amounts of pain, people (women) have compared it to child birth. Basically I get infections in my colon randomly and I get inflammation which is painful, if it's a bad infection it'll be pain that's mind numbing. 
Recently I had inflammation pains and I keep having huge amounts of anxiety which cause to keep replaying worst case scenarios of me being somewhere and I'll get a huge pain our of thin air and basically die. Or something like that. Basically my head makes it worse for me before anything has even happened.. I didn't use to have this problem but after my diagnoses it happens when I have pain. My head makes living almost unbearable and I shut down.. just waiting for the pain to get worse and basically acting like everything is doomed and my life is living hell.

But truth is... It's not. Even during the pain I know I'm still alive and with modern medicine I'll be fine for the most part. How can I help myself from stopping these thoughts ? My brother mentioned cognitive restructuring as something I need to look into and probably get therapy to help me achieve. But I haven't even bothered to learn about it. 

So basically.. how do you deal with thoughts like that ?",15Jan2018,1
19,"I am an outsider. A freak. Not normal. How many people can relate to that statement?

I am a piece of shit. A nobody. A loser. A loner. How many feel that one?

It’s amazing the stories we tell ourselves.

Who am I?

What is it like to be Alan? I sometimes stop and think.

When I consider the inner voice, that part of me which, when alone, is shouting at me to do something, I feel a bit intimidated. It’s like my mind is running the show. So am I more than just my mind?

When I was a kid I convinced myself that I was not worthy – not worthy of love, of friendships, of relationships and of success (which at the time meant school results) and I approached every situation from that standpoint. They‘re ok, but I’m not. They can have normal, healthy relationships and success but I can’t. And how I hated them….and myself…and then them again..d’oh! I am still dealing with the consequences of that choice; gradually becoming aware of my own needs, rather than believing everyone else to be more important.

So, what happened to me to make me that way? I don’t actually know and here’s why it doesn’t matter. As long as I acknowledge that part of me which suffers I can find relief. So I talk to myself.

Dealing with an overactive, underproductive imagination has been my ‘problem’ for a long time. So I’m writing spontaneously. What’s going to emerge when I put myself in this space? Am I learning through writing, through sharing that writing or through the feedback I get? Or all three? Do I have any idea where this piece is going? Right now the answer is ‘no.’

And do I actually care about putting this out into the world even though it is apparently pointless? Also a ‘no.’

That’s not normal.

Am I now worthy?",15Jan2018,2

21,"I am now beginning my 7th year since graduating school. Also, my 3rd year in my current degree. With 2019 being my final year. 

Since leaving school I have studied 3 different degrees - the first ended because I was sick and didn’t like the course, so I didn’t continue when I recovered. 

I next studied an Arts degree as a pre-cursor to another degree I wanted to study. I moved interstate and then realised it wasn’t for me. Frantically I then enrolled in a creative course which really was more of a passion than career. 

Quite simply, over the span of 3 years I scrambled to find my “thing”.  So I took a couple of years off (in the new city) and realised what I truly wanted to study was what I had gained work experience in at school. I had steered away from it previously because I didn’t want to be the family of “teachers, plumbers, hairdressers etc”, as my sister is in the same career. 

Now, despite beginning my 3rd year of my dream course (which I love and enjoy so much!), I feel frustrated at myself for not studying it straight out of school. It’s not put any financial strain on me - thanks to sickness &amp; census dates. I haven’t wasted time as all my previous study has been credited into my current degree which has made it incredibly shorter. 

So why do I feel like this? Especially when I’m in a peaceful place now that I know I’ve found my thing. It never comes up in conversations. I’m a v open person and don’t struggle to talk about it, but internally I’m frustrated at myself.

I know that I wouldn’t be where I am today if I definitively knew what I wanted to study from the beginning, but it still doesn’t shake these negative self perceptions. I wouldn’t have moved interstate to a life I LOVED - the place, the new friends, the job, the boyfriend. I also wouldn’t be so sure this career was my dream, as I wouldn’t have dabbled in alternative working industries. 

Overall, I guess I’m just struggling w people’s perceptions of me having studying 3 different courses. Yet everyone says my current career is ALL they could see me doing and I’ll be so great at it etc. I don’t believe I care about what people think, but that seems to be the feeling I have? I could just choose to not speak about my study past with new people I meet, but I never shy away from it. It’s my journey. 

Just one confused and self-conscious girl here. Any personal experiences or pearls of wisdom to help me shake these feelings would be lovely. Despite this, I love my course and can’t wait to be a graduate and get my career started. I know I’m in a good place now!

Thank you kindly.",15Jan2018,1
22,"Getting blood work or a vaccine is getting a ****ING NEEDLE STABBED INTO YOUR SKIN, yet it's painless. Kinda squeamish to look at, but if you feel any twinge of pain it's all mental.

26,"I need somewhere to vent.

I've been alone my whole life. Even growing up as a kid, I was an only child and both my parents worked a lot. They usually left me to fend for myself at home so I quickly became independent.

I was never able to make many friends because we moved around a lot and I'd avoid getting close to people because of the inevitable pain when those relationships were cut short.

Now, 20-something years old, not much has changed. I still only have a couple friends. I still have never had a gf. Or a date. Or experienced anything beyond purely platonic with the opposite gender. I'm sick of it. I've pretended that I'm fine with being alone for years now but I feel like I'm slowly dying inside.

All my attempts at making new friends or trying to find a gf have ended in utter failure. Nobody ever tries to even talk to me. When I show interest in someone else, it's never reciprocated.

Everyone keeps giving me advice that I follow but it doesn't help. I have good hobbies (reading, gym, music, art), a job, my own place to live, good grades at my university, etc. I dress well, shower, brush and floss my teeth every day, and take pretty good care of myself. I have a nice haircut and people even tell me I'm attractive (usually from the few friends I have). By all means, my life is great outside of social aspects. Even the friends I do have are pretty baffled at my lack of success.

People keep telling me it'll go my way but it's so empty coming from people who don't know what it's like. Even the most hopeless people I know have had some level of social success. I just want someone in my life that really cares about me. Where I don't have to pull teeth just to get them to hang out with me. Someone that will ask how I'm doing and actually care about the answer.

Sometimes I wonder if it's just not meant to be.

I don't want to kill myself, because if I do then I'll definitely never experience these things. But if I knew it were going to be like this forever, death would be a preferable alternative.

It just feels like the longer I go on like this, the further away these dreams get, and the further removed I become from everyone else. I feel like a broken person but I don't know why. I've done everything as right as I know how, but everything feels so out of reach.",15Jan2018,40
27,"I used to date this guy back in middle school (seventh grade) and we were off and on until senior year in high school when I finally left him for good for someone who actually treated me nice. The sad thing is I still talk to him, just as friends of course, but I hate myself for it. I wish I had the strength to keep him out of my life but I always find myself going back to be in his life. I know most people don’t like the idea of being friends with ex’s but I went through a lot with him and he became one of my very few close friends. I feel most comfortable venting to him than any other person.

I only wish I left him out of my life because of how he treated me. The first time we broke up was the absolute worst of it all because him and his best friend harassed me and mine. One night he texted me to apologize and at first I didn’t believe him and he said he was sorry again and that he wanted to be my friend so I said okay but of course it was a lie and he continued to harass me more. Then after I threatened to get the police involved was when it all stopped. I took him back like a stupid person “in love”  would do when he later apologized and said he didn’t know what he was doing. After that, nothing was the same. During those weeks, he made me hate myself. He humiliated me and to this day I still am so angry and a part of me still hates him. Fast forward to high school, it wasn’t even a real relationship. It was more of just hanging out at school because his mom didn’t like me and didn’t want me around the house. But, we did hang out when his mother wasn’t home. I was literally just a booty call and I knew it but he told me he loved me every day and it made me believe it was okay. After we would have our intimate moments he would send me straight home and he wouldn’t even walk me home (neither of us drove) so I would walk home myself and sometimes it would be during the night. But hey, at least he told me he loved me before I walked out the door right? God. I still stay up thinking about this and it makes it all worse because I know that I shouldn’t even let this bother me because it’s in the past and I should move on but I have this crippling need to hang on to things that make me hurt. There would be times when I didn’t even want to do anything with him but he would beg until I finally gave in and just let him. I was so attached because he was my very first and since I cling to things, I never wanted to leave. I was too comfortable with him and I didn’t care about me I just cared about how he felt and what he wanted. People would ask me if I actually did love him and I would say no because I knew how stupid I would look to be able to love someone who constantly made me feel like shit. Every time we broke up, I tried to move on but he would ask for another chance and I would spring back because I figured he would change. These things that I mentioned weren’t even half of what our relationship consisted of. There was so much more.

Anyway, I guess I’ll just end this post before I go on forever. It just seemed to hurt worse tonight for some reason. Sorry my problem is so small compared to others but it’s still a pain and something I think about every night.",15Jan2018,3

31,"This is going to sound whiney. It is whiney. But Reddit is here for things like this, right? =)

I'm a 33 year old woman. Kind of old to not have a clue of what one is supposed to do with their lives. I have a job that's exceedingly boring, but it pays the bills (sort of). I have a handful of friends. I have family I no longer speak to except on holidays. I currently live alone. I'm moderately attractive and in shape and have quite a long list of failed relationships under my belt. I just got back into online dating and have my first date in a couple days that I'm not looking forward to at all. I'm planning a trip to the Outer Banks by myself in a couple of months because... I'm supposed to do things like that, I guess.

I'm just very bored and unsatisfied all the time. I'm bitter, though I'm fairly good at hiding it in public. I've been told I could do well in a different career if I was willing to ""work hard and challenge myself"" and my reaction was ""I don't want to. Work is stupid. I've never enjoyed it- why would I want to work *harder*?"" 

I have no passions for anything. Jobs come and go, people come and go, and my heart's still forcing blood through my arteries for some unknown reason. I feel like I'm just waiting around for it all to eventually stop. A therapist once asked me to identify a time in my life where things have been better, and I couldn't answer. It's always been like this, barring times of incredible stress when things were decidedly worse. I'm told I have trouble with ""attachment"" and ""commitment."" 

And it's not like I don't try. I have changed jobs. I've traveled overseas. I've dated weird people. I'm actually pretty social. I tried to see a therapist but my insurance wouldn't pay for it. I've read self-help and ""find your passion"" books. I'm going to the fucking Outer Banks for some reason.

34,"Years ago, I had a friend who was troubled. I was kind and understanding, as helpful as possible, however the friendship quickly became toxic. I saw no way out, until it all became too much, and I completely cut them out of my life. I “ghosted”.

TW: emotional abuse.
My “friend” became my abuser. After I cut contact, it took a long time for me to trust others and get close to people again. I was subject to heavy emotional abuse and controlling behaviour. I didn’t recognise the affect it had on me, until I confided in my best friend a year after I had cut contact. I hadn’t discussed any details until then, and she was the one who told me how bad it was. She let me cry in her arms.

In short: it fucked with my head, a lot. Over the years I’d started to forget. So, you can imagine when I got a notification, 3+ years after no contact; I freaked the fuck out. Until, I read: “I’m sorry.”

I let (abuser) apologise to me. We exchanged a couple messages, and wished each other well, agreeing never to speak again. I cried a lot, and now somewhere deep inside feels at rest.

I don’t know if I’ve forgiven. I never said those words. But, I feel like I can let it go.",15Jan2018,96
35,"I'm 22, I'm weak and let my depression and social anxiety get the best of me, in result I haven't worked and barely left the house since about a year ago. This started after I quit my internship (november 2016) after graduating from college (ceremony on february 2017). 

I'm a MtF transgender, and now at this age I think I missed the chance of ever looking like a woman. Besides I'm completely dependent on my parents, and they would never accept it. I feel like I have little to live for, while my peers have been partying, travelling and having fun since I was 14, I have been staying at home, hiding from the world. 

At 22 I haven't done what most people my age have. Acting on a first love, the first kiss, dating, travelling on your own, going places on their own,etc. I feel old, I feel like an overgrown child who is mentally stuck at 16 because I didnt get to live.

When I read stuff or reddit people always say things like ""I'm still living with my parents at 19"", and that makes me feel like the biggest failure. It's normal in my country to live with your parents for longer, but even then I should be more independent by now. I don't have connections in my area and I'm far from the best, and now with this 1 year gap in my already short CV (my only experience was that one internship, kill me) makes me think I won't be able to get a nice job. My parents spent so much on my college, I feel so guilty and disgusted at myself.

I also feel over conscious about the fact that I never left my region of my country, and even that I haven't really visited much. I have an online friend and sometimes while mentioning places from my country she'll ask if I ever been there, and I hate saying no. It wasn't a problem of money, but rather our family vacations were always at the same place, at a relative's house.

I feel like I have no life experiences, I want to know the world, I want to be able to go to places, even within my city, without being filled by fear, I want to be independent and have my own life. But then I think, is it worth it? Is it worth going through so much hardships if at the end of the day I still won't be able to have fun and a normal life like my peers because I'm a disgusting tranny? ",15Jan2018,4
36,"Unfortunately, being underage in a TIFU means you're not responsible for your own actions and as such this post was removed and I was advised to repost here.

This took place in the ancient year of 2000. (Roughly 17 years ago)

There's a few points in my life that I can honestly say have been huge pivoting fuckups that lead to the creation of the person I am today. I posted [one of them](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7q1s8g/tifu_by_breaking_space_mountain/) a day or two ago and got a lot more response than I had expected. I can't sleep right now so I might as well do another.

I was 9 at the time. I know what you're thinking, ""how can a 9 year old fuck up enough to warrant a post?"". Well, let me tell you.

I grew up a latch-key kid. I'd come home from school, drop off my backpack, and go out to play with the neighborhood kids. Near the end of second grade, however, things changed. My mom, who was a single parent, had just finished her schooling and started doing casting at the local hospital. This was a big change in hours from her last job working as a bartender. She was almost always home right around the time I would get off school. Her getting the casting job was good timing, as she had just gotten fired from the bar. The manager thought she was stealing, as she was making 300-400$ a night in tips. (Topless bar)

After summer vacation ended, things started to get a little tight cash-wise. She had to start taking double and triple shifts to keep food on the table. Unfortunately my birthday was approaching, as it did every year when school was about to pick up. She had to choose between a good present and school supplies, to which she made the right choice for a parent. School supplies. I didn't mind, I was a pretty bright kid. I knew it was how it had to be. To try to make up for it, she picked me up from school on the day and took us out to eat at burger king. On the way back home she told me to open the glovebox, which contained a present. She had gotten a toy from one of the hospitals fundraisers that they were holding for children stuck in the cancer ward(most of her casting was for the children's wing). It was a toy gun.

I was pretty excited, because I've had cap guns before, but this was different. It shot sparks. Boy did I love the hell out of that thing for a day. My cousin was very envious of it and had threatened to take it, warning that I can't stop her from doing so. Fuck that. I was paranoid as shit that I might lose my new favorite toy. So what does the bright little asshole me do? He throws that shit in his backpack, as it's the last place she'd look.

Next day rolls around and I get ready for school. As I am about to walk out the door, I get this thought in my head that I probably shouldn't bring it to school. Paranoid me steps in ""if you dont bring it, [Cousin] will steal it."". I take a moment to think and decide that as long as I don't take it out, it'll be fine. 

BOY WAS I WRONG.

I go through the usual process as a latch-key kid. I lock the door and make my way to the bus stop. As usual not quite awake yet and stuck in a zombie state of mind. Bus arrives, I find a seat and fall asleep. Pretty common for me to do, as I was usually the first stop meaning 30 or so minutes of wait time to get there. I awake to a kid screaming next to me ""HE HAS A GUN"".

The bus driver was seconds away from the school and I guess this kid was digging in my backpack for some fucking reason and saw it. The bus driver pulls up to the bus zone and slams open the door. She ushers all the kids out in a panic and glares at me, saying ""don't  move a fucking inch"". She radios in the problem and within a minute 3 squad cars pull around the bus and a line of school staff peek around one of the brick walls nearby. One of the officers comes in slowly with his gun drawn and I'm just bawling my eyes out, no idea what to fucking do. As he gets in range of me he lunges and pins me to the bus seat while another officer grabs my backpack. I get cuffed and thrown in the back seat of a patrol car.

About half an hour later we make it to a police station and they lead me, handcuffed, to a holding cell. I had no fucking clue what was going on. Couple hours later my mom comes in with a lawyer and says everything is alright. I was released into her custody pending trial. Obviously a 9 year old isn't a flight risk. About 2 days go by, a squad car pulls up to my house and I get taken to a judge. He calls up the district superintendent for the entire branch of school I was going to and they both start explaining what I had done, all the while I was shaking with anxiety.

Turns out there was an overreaction and they didn't know it wasn't a real gun, but it was still pretty serious. There existed precedence for bringing cap guns to school and the punishment was usually time spent in juvie and expulsion, but because it wasn't technically a cap gun the district superintendent had talked down the punishment.

8 months of In-School Suspension, backed up by law enforcement. Monday through saturday, 6 am to 6 pm, no exceptions.

This was really just fucked up. I was put into what was called the ""Timeout"" room for this duration. It was maybe 5x5x15 feet, little bigger than a closet.

I was given the full year of my school work on day one in the form of packets and had it finished by week 4. I was let out to get lunch, but had to bring it back right away. This happened just before the other kids were released for lunch, so I would go through the process alone. There weren't teachers. There was no social interactions besides the periodic hello from the front staffers as passed them. I wasn't even permitted a break to exercise.

By the second month I was losing it. I would crawl under the table and curl up in a ball. I'd sleep some days. Doodle on the table on others. My skin was starting to look bad, almost opaque.

Third month comes by and I look like a fucking vampire. Few words to say. Just kept going.

Fourth or fifth month, I can't remember, It all just kind of blends at that point, one of the new office attendants peeks in and notices me staring forward at the wall, not moving an inch. She brings it up with the pricipal and he checks me out. He's a bit spooked and asks me what's going on. I inform him I ran out of work a while ago and had nothing to do, so he decides that it'd be alright if I go to the library and get some books.

Some time later, kids stopped showing up. I guess winter break or summer break, I have no idea. I've read every animorph book released at that point, all the classics like captain underpants, where the wild things are, where the sidewalk ends, ect. There was nothing left in the library for me to read for my age group, so I moved on to the higher grade shit. Mostly Jack London stuff.

Winter hits and I get real sick. Like 8/10, I may die, sick. My mom figures it alright if I miss a day. Few hours later a police officer picks me up and takes me to my prison. I was given a bucket and allowed to keep my blanket so not all bad. Temperature hits 105 or so. Being winter break there's only 10 or so people on campus and they didn't know what to do so they just pulled some ice packs from the nurses station.

More time goes by and before I knew it, the next year had begun. Didn't go well. Had a lot of difficulty talking to kids my own age, as they all just seemed so fucking dumb. Like the kind of dumb where just being around them gives you a headache.

On the plus side, had this happened a year later I'd likely have gotten juvie time because 9/11.


TL;DR: brought a toy gun to school because of a bad decision, got ISS for 9 months. Spent all of third grade in a box.

*^edit:* damn this thing really jumped up there. Let me answer some of the more common questions and concerns here.

* I wasn't tried in court, I was brought before a judge and the superintendent of my school district, there was a long conversation that ended with them both going into agreement that I could take ISS instead of more serious consequences.

* one of the people in the comments pointed out that this occurred just after columbine, it doesn't justify what happened but it makes a little more sense.

* I'm pretty sure it didn't turn me into a sociopath, but you never know.

* it happened in Phoenix, Arizona.

* the timeout room was tall because the building was in an office-like format and looked to be made in a half-assed manner where all they did was plaster a few walls up.",15Jan2018,109
39,"Biopsy results came in and it turns out my grandma’s brain tumor is cancerous. She has a year left.

While it’s a major shock, I can’t feel anything. Even throughout the period she was sick and hospitalized all I felt was a vague “Well that’s too bad” feeling and that’s it.

We’ve never really had a close relationship and I haven’t seen her more than once a month, but she is very sweet and motherly. Plus, she is a family member of mine, and I should feel sad but I simply won’t.

Everyone’s obviously very sad and depressed, but I just don’t understand why it doesn’t bother me. I’m very concerned and I don’t really know what to do about it.

40,"I have been feeling down every day since Friday. This might be another strike of depression that is messing with my head, though I can't ignore thoughts such as: ""I am boring"" and ""People consider me annoying"", because I genuinely believe that some people do dislike me. 

Today I had a friend ignore my snapchat. I am aware that this sounds really lame, but it hurt me. I have been thinking about it for an hour now, and I can't judge if they want me out of their life, or if I just am overreacting. To play it safe I guess that I have to assume the worst...? Anyway, I think I will stick to myself tomorrow at school, to avoid bothering this friend and other people.

42,"Throwaway.

This is a crazy story I know, but it's true, and I would never dare tell anyone in real life.

I am a huge geek in college. 4.0, Dean's List calculus geek.

I really, badly needed a job to pay tuition first semester. I saw a listing for a desk clerk position at a resort that perfectly worked with my schedule, and found out it paid twice as much as any in the area.

I got there and found it was a NUDIST resort. And that even employees had to respect the dress code...

This is insane to me. I am a total geek. Obviously still a virgin. I never even take my shirt off with friends at the beach. Just the thought of standing there all day...exposed...just at the mercy of nature...made me blush red.

I am about 5'7, a bit of a ""Freshman 15"" belly. A surprisingly big, ROUND bubble butt behind me that my friend Ashley always teases I'm ""hiding"" under my ""nerdy khakis"" and not exactly the biggest package in the world (Hey, it's a throwaway!). Plus I was lily-white from the neck down.

The idea terrified me, but in the end...the money won out. And I actually worked a full semester as naked as a jaybird, wearing nothing but my glasses. I would just tell myself, hey, my bottom half is hidden by the desk!

I only told my friend Ashley because she was out of state with her longterm boyfriend, who thought it was hilarious of course. But I only told her the type of resort, never told her what it was. It's even very discreet to look up on Google.

Finally, one day I absentmindedly thought I was sending an email about a shipment, but I CC'd Ashley on an email that had the address.

Guess who showed up giggling mid-shift in the early afternoon while I was blushing and bare-assed naked behind my front desk?

""Hehehe are you really NAKED behind there? Like you have NOTHING on?! hehehe""

""Oh my God, you're actually getting tanned!""

""Do you have a fig leaf, at least? hehehe""

At one point I was distracted by another guest, and Ashley snuck behind my counter, grabbed my neatly folded pile of clothes (even my sneakers and socks!) and said ""Have a nice ride home, nature boy!"" and SPANKED my bare butt as hard as she could as the guest laughed and she ran out of there.

I started to chase wearing nothing but a blush on my face and a hand on my package (she turned around and got quite a laugh out of THAT image) but chickened out about running through the parking lot in my birthday suit in broad daylight. Plus, what if she had her cameraphone in her car? (Cameras and/or phones aren't allowed to get into the front entrance)

Anxiously, I stood at the front entrance, naked and helpless, hiding my bottom half behind the front door and poking my head out, nervously waiting for her to walk back up laughing and give me my stuff back.

As I waited, the female guest said ""She got ya good across both of those cheeks, honey! And it looks like you're drivin' home NEKKID tonight! hahaha""

I faked a laugh, and stood there bare waiting for the relief of my friend returning my clothing.

Suddenly, I hear an engine roar, and she went speeding off in her car past me yelling ""WOOOOO!!!"" while swinging my boxers in a circle like a victory flag out of her car window.

I just watched her drive off, with my package exposed in the cool air conditioning, and my bare butt-cheeks still stinging from her admittedly hard slap a few moments ago. She didn't just have my clothes. She had my phone, my wallet, my money and my ID!!! At least she left me my car keys. (probably just forgot to take them)

Feeling even more naked than usual the rest of my shift, finally we were closing for the night, and I saw that everything was locked up.

I actually had to drive home naked and blushing since the towel they let me borrow to ""wear"" home barely even wrapped around my butt.

Luckily, she left my belongings in my mailbox, but not a stitch of clothes. She mailed them to me later to make sure I had to make the naked walk of shame into my house!",15Jan2018,2

48,"As the title says, I’m really struggling trying to decide if I should continue to game on Xbox or swap to PC.

During the Black Friday and Christmas sales, I managed to pick up both an Xbox One X and 4K TV, and a high end gaming PC (i7 7700, 1080 Ti, 16GB DDR4 ram) and monitor (1440p, 144Hz, G-sync) for really great prices.

Unfortunately, the time I have to make returns is almost out, and I’m still having difficulty making my final decision on which route to go.

I definitely see the merits of gaming on a PC over the Xbox.

* The games run smoother with higher frames, better graphics and better loading times, if only slightly better then games on the Xbox One X right now, but probably much better in the next few years as newer games require even higher performance.
* I love the ability to get so many cheap games from Steam sales and Humble Bundle.
* It’s much easier to just jump into discord and play or chat with friends then it is trying to manage the clunky xbox party system
* There are way more games that are available only on PC that I would like to play then there are games on Xbox and not on PC
* The steam refund policy is extremely useful and has already saved me a few times where I would have been screwed on Xbox

While the PC has a bunch of advantages over the Xbox, there are still some things keeping it in the consideration

* I’ve been gaming on Xbox for years, so I already own about 300 games (mostly digital) on the system, most of which are AAA games rather then a bunch of the nonsense games filling up my steam library. Having to buy some/most/all of those games again is pretty annoying and wasteful
* While I appreciate that a M/KB is superior to a controller for gaming, it is much more comfortable for me to use a controller. Because of that, I will probably play everything but FPS and RTS with a controller on PC. And while I know that many steam games support a controller, there are some that won’t. Games on xbox will never have that issue
* I really like completing achievements and 100%’ing games, and Xbox does a much better job of making you feel like you’ve completed something and inspiring a sense of competition then steam does
* The Xbox is much easier to move around and set up which is pretty nice right now since I’m constantly going to and from college every semester, but might be far less important after I graduate soon

I would appreciate any advice or suggestions any of you have for me to help make this decision a little easier for me",15Jan2018,2

51,"I made a group of new friends. People I always wanted to know well, but occasion has never happened, so our ""friendship"" has never really started. About a week ago I was invited to quite a small party (more like meeting of the best buddies, about 10 people). I've never seen most of them before. Unluckily for me I drunk a but too much then. Way too much. I remember nothing, but my friend (always honest one) told me that I acted like a piece of narcistic shit, overestimating my ""intelligence"" (I don't think of myself as some ""genius"" while being sober). He told me, that I said so many embarrassing things that I don't really want to hear them. Now all those people think that I'm some weirdo with too high self esteem. Others were quite sober, they remember everything. 

What to do? I feel too embarrassed to talk to them, because I don't really want to know what I did/said that day. I tried to confront one of them, he kept laughing at me.
I can try to convince them, that I'm not such fucked up person but it will be hard and acknowledging everything they think about me right now would be painful. And really, really embarrassing. I'm not used to do stupid drunk things (especially in front of people I care about), so it's even harder for me. ",15Jan2018,0
