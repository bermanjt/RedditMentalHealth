1,"The title says it all.  This man was my boss for many years until recently.  He was the first to give me a chance despite a five-year gap in my work history.  I became a better worker and cook under his tutilage.

He died this afternoon after a pretty severe car accident.  He was 35 years old.

This isn't the first time this has happened.  My Great-Grandmother died a few years back.  I shrugged my shoulders and moved on.  My cousin was struck by a car and died just before Christmas.

All around me, everybody that knew him is saying what a shame it is that his youngest won't know his father and asking when the funeral will be.  I'm browsing Reddit and wondering what to do for dinner.

What is wrong with me?",14Feb2018,16

Brilliant, kind amazing man. Never heard him speak in anger, just cool confident and inspiring.

I am FB friends with one of his old friends (40+ years), the tribute written has brought out so many current employees sharing their stories... So much love.",14Feb2018,3
4,"Throwaway.

College senior Dean’s List geek here. 21 year old virgin.

I sort of have a soft “rivalry” with Brandon at my school. He’s a 6'3 frat guy who plays football, and I’m a 5'7 calculus nerd.

He mentioned that his best subject is history, and I said “Well it’s my worst, but I’ll still score higher than you at your best.”

He said why not make it interesting? Whoever gets the highest score on the midterms gets to make the loser do whatever they want that night.

I said “Are you crazy?! You’re on!”

I barely even studied. I got a 97.

My face went white in shock when he showed me his 98.

Okay fine, what stupid thing do I have to do?

He said “No big deal, Martin. You just have to run across the football field tonight at midnight.”

“Okay fine.”

“Naked.”

My face turned red and my jaw dropped as everyone around him laughed.

“Yeah, right. Haha. What do I really have to do?”

He said “You have to run across the football field at midnight tonight. Butt-naked. Not even socks.”

A cute girl said “Oh baby! I know my plans tonight!” and laughed as I struggled for air.

Even my friends Heather (just a friend, she has a BF) and Jason laughed.

Again, I am a huge geek. I never even take my shirt off at the beach.

""You're not serious are you?""

And at midnight that night, there I was, running across my own college football field.

As naked as a jaybird.

Two sets of people on both sides laughing out loud. Both my own friends, and Brandon's. Males and females in about equal number.

I am lily-white from the neck-down. Not fat but a “studies-while-eating-Doritos” belly shaking as I ran. My “bigger-than-you’d think” bubble butt jiggling behind me. And my…ahem…small package flapping in the breeze.

Wearing nothing but the smattering of hair on my chest and stomach. And my (blush) public hair.

Protected by nothing but my body hair like an animal.

Wearing absolutely nothing except the glasses on my face and a pink blush on my cheeks.

The humiliating, brisk breeze attacking my bald, hairless butt-cheeks as I ran past.

The loudest roar of laughter was when I ran back past Brandon and he said ""Look everybody, it's the genius. Nice ass, virgin boy!"" and SPANKED my naked ass hard as I yelped out loud.

Not only was it LOUD, not only did he perfectly get me across both bare cheeks, but oh my goodness did it STING.

I just continued and ran towards my pile of clothes I stripped out of.

I'll never get arrogant again!

**tl;dr got confident about my intelligence, ended up butt-ass naked for everyone to see**",14Feb2018,0
5,"Hi guy. So I hope that’s the right place to post sth like that. If not. I’m really sorry. 
So I always had intense fights with my parents. And I know I have a nasty side while fighting. Meaning I get hurtfull and sarcastic and I can’t walk away from the fight and it goes on and on and on for maybe one hour. Not with everyone but with some people. Now I have this problem with my current boyfriend too. I realized it and I try to do better. And I already do. But today I just realized, after years, that not my parents were the problem but I was. All these years. And this hurts soo much. So incredibly much. I really don‘t know what to do. I feel like I probably lost and hurted so many people because of this. I really feel like not knowing myself anymore. I always thought I’m a nice person. I‘d like to break up with my boyfriend and not see him anymore because I‘m so ashamed. And I don‘t want to hurt him with our fights. I don‘t know what to do. ",14Feb2018,5
7,"There's no easier way to say it.

SJWs, idpols, internet politics, etc. have me just hating everyone else. I know it's an overreaction, but idk who I can even trust anymore. 

I just want someone who can emotionally take care of me. Be affectionate. Not try to force me to care about other people- because I need to take care of my damn self for once.

Too bad the only ones are either way too SJW, way too right-wing, or just too fucking creepy. No good looking nice ones that are available. ",14Feb2018,3
8,"I need help. I don’t know what is wrong with me. I am completely addicted to food and I don’t know how to stop eating. I am not an incredibly obese person, but I am overweight. I started Weight Watched on Dec 30 and lost about 17 lbs. I started at 187 lbs and got down to 170 lbs (I'm a 32/F). For the last four days I have been on an absolute downwards spiral, binge eating everything I can get my hands on. I think about food constantly. I feel so guilty and disgusting. I don’t even eat good food. I just rummage through the cupboards until I find some shitty nasty food. I had about 20 pieces of old Christmas candies and cookies, I was eating cheese right off the block, chips, frozen burrito, etc, etc, etc, basically anything I can get my hands on. I want “food” that is absolutely no effort. I need to eat it NOW. I seriously feel like I am on a drug binge, but food is my drug. I go to bed feeling absolutely disgusted with myself, telling myself NOT to forget how terrible I feel both physically and emotionally. I wake up every morning say that “I can do this, this is a new day, I can get back on the wagon”. I try to give myself positive self talk. But then the feeling comes over me and I don’t care about anything but eating whatever I can get my hands on. It’s like I have a horrible monster inside me that controls me. It’s absolutely terrible. I feel so lazy and sloppy and out of control. I have absolutely no idea why I am doing this to myself. I have had no (known) childhood trauma, I have a family (husband and son) who love me and who I love. I have a job. I have a nice house and financial stability. I don’t understand why I am abusing myself like this. Nothing has happened to me in the last four days for me to self-sabotage like this. I am trying to hide all this from my husband because I don’t want him to know how out of control I am right now, after I had been doing so well. When I am not doing Weight Watchers, I eat whatever I want without thinking about it, so this is nothing new. I am just sick of doing this to myself. My body does not deserve this kind of treatment . I am so mad at myself. I don’t know if anyone else here has felt like this. If so, what did you do? How do you break the cycle? How do you take control of that terrible demon that tells you to eat? I feel like I am comforting myself with food, but comforting what… I don’t know. ",14Feb2018,18
9,"I work at a cafe as a waitress and I have this one coworker who I am really grateful for as I have never been in hospitality, and she taught me a lot of things that made me better at my job. I’ll be honest though, I made a lot of mistakes while I was starting out (and I still do, but I am able to fix the mistakes on my own now) and I think she resented me because she usually had to fix my mistakes even when she was really busy.

She takes a lot of her anger out on me. One example I can think of is when I was going to run some food and she like “they’re over there!” and pointed vaguely at the patrons. I looked around without moving, couldn’t find them and she got more irritated and was saying “You just served them!” In a really exasperated tone. I had just served a lot of people, and this wasn’t a problem because I gave them a number. We ALWAYS have to look around the restaurant for the right customers, so I had no idea why she was getting so mad at me, then I realised that she was taking her frustration out on me because she’d dropped a platter of sushi not moments before and I was her scapegoat.

Other examples I can think of is when she was serving a line, and so I offered to take some folks to the other till (we have two) because I thought it would help out. The customers were a little confused because the moment after I offered, she finished the line, and they were like ‘where do we go’ and I pointed to wards my till but this co worker gave an exasperated laugh and was like “What are you doing?” In that angry, passive aggressive tone.

Once I was also working and I had to move somewhere and we moved at the same time and accidentally crossed paths so I stopped because we were close to colliding and she stopped dead in her tracks and turned around, looking at me like a) she wanted to murder my incompetent ass and b) like I was the most disgusting thing that had ever crossed her path.

Asides from calling my hearing shit, giving me a wedgie (in a joking manner, but I thought it was fucking weird), and saying her “favourite face of mine was this one” then proceeding to make a dumb face, I just don’t  know what to do. I’m too scared to ask her questions and stuff because she thinks I am so dumb. Granted, I make a lot of mistakes and I think it would be frustrating to work with me, but I am trying my best to improve and always give my all despite how stupid I feel.",14Feb2018,3

11,"Valentine's day is here, I'm 16/m and have never celebrated it with someone special. It's a bit late to hit the gym and diet to get in shape for today, but I still want to be attractive to women. What are the most important things that women look for in a guy? Is it nice physique? A sense of humor? Intelligence? 


What I'm working with here is :

-Overweight but dieting

-5'7 or 5'8 and hopeful

-Kinda insecure/anxious, but working on it more than ever

-Sometimes I think I'm funny, but I can get carried away quickly

-I have no hope in school 


Other things that I don't know if they are a HUGE problem/turn off?

-Body hair (Kinda everywhere, most defined on my chest, legs and pubes)

-Long hair. I have long bangs that are kinda wavy so they look nice some days, but not great on other days. I know the sides and back of my head are messy, but I think it looks more like an organized mess. Then again, I can't see behind my head so I have no clue what's going on there. Thinking about haircut 


Things I can't change or have to work really hard for

-Is penile length crucial and what are the sizes that are just an absolute turn-off?

-Is a good physique a must have?

-Do I have to be smart to want someone who is smart?

16,"I am 24 years old, my brother is 26 years old. And for a long time he’s been abroad studying in  the united states and he comes back to visit us in Saudi Arabia, That’s usually around Christmas time, he used to stay for two weeks top. However this year is different he is still here and we are in mid February. He now says that he is planning to stay here and finish his bachelor degree in Saudi Arabia but also says that he spent 4 years in the united states and he just now decided to change his major!  

I am no hard ass but for years our family are known to be hard working. We are never late and we do our duties till the job is done no matter how hard or long the job is. My father always tells us that we have to show people what they are paying us for and it better be exactly what they expect. 

Yet my brother is playing video games most of his time, spends over 12 hours sleeping and if he is not sleeping he is playing video games and eating junk food. 

My father tells me that I have to teach him the importance of time. But to be completely honest I myself don’t have time for that, I have my own problems to deal with and I just failed to see how my elder brother is one of my biggest problems.  I don’t mind that he likes to play games, I like playing games as well, I played the Witcher 3 and I liked it but I didn’t spend over 2-3 hours playing at a time, I have other things to do and my brother simply doesn’t feel that way, his yesterday is exactly like his tomorrow and his tomorrow is exactly like his today.

The main reason I think he has the mind of a child is the way he always complain about how hard things are, he complains even about the simplest of things like if i went to the grocery store and didn’t bring him a Pepsi, that would upset him.

I love my brother, but I am starting to think that he doesn’t understand how cruel and unfair life can be. I’ve gone thru a lot of hard times and still am but I know I have goal I want to reach and to get there I will have to deal with the challenges that comes with it, but being shy and anti-social will get you nowhere. I tried to talk to him to tell him that, but I fear I don’t know how to say it exactly how he needs to hear it.

17,"Two or three times now in the past three months, I've experienced quite a strange sensation. The first time, I was looking at myself in the mirror. I recognized the face, and logically I knew (I think) that it must be mine. Regardless, I was overcome with a sense that I wasn't looking at myself. I did not sense that I was looking at someone else, or something else; simply that I wasn't there, or that I was looking in from the ""outside."" Tough to explain. I recall thinking quite seriously ""is that me?"" with a sort of tilted-head demeanor. 

Some time this week, or last week (I literally can't remember), I was having a conversation with coworkers at my desk. I was again overcome with a sensation that I couldn't believe it was me performing these actions, but it was more of a ""realization"" than a complete inability to understand that it was me like the mirror.

I feel like something along these lines has happened to a lesser degree at least one other time in the past few months. It's not frightening, but it's new and I'm not sure how much concern I should have. ",14Feb2018,1

He calls you every day, you only pick up once a week at best because he only talks for like 2 minutes..and I mean, you feel like a piece of shit and you kind of want to talk to him more but he sort of ejects himself out of the conversation?

Now, he keeps on telling you he's gonna die so you want to spend time with him but he's been doing that for the past decade...however, he's ironically the healthiest person in his family; he has none of the high blood sugar or diabetes or whatever that his kids have, no dementia or alzheimer's or anything, he's just getting old...

You've tried talking to him at length in the past and he tells you all kinds of stuff yet sort of stops paying attention when you talk?

One one hand, he's pretty religious and taught you your own religion without you questioning it. On the other, he gets pretty skeptical when you bring up stuff he doesn't know about, like

26,"If nobody likes to be near sad people. And your a sad person. How do you fake being a happy one without being completely fake? How will people react to see this absolutely happy person turn into this depressed lump of shit? How do you expect them not to leave when you trust them enough to show them what you are underneath? Realistically nobody cares. They'll continue on without a large hitch and what you showed them in your time of need will be earased from thier memories soon enough. Leaving you to obscurity in their recesses of the mind. They'll lock it up along with the other unsavory parts of their lives never to be thought up again except for inebriated occasions where they remember you. What you said. And how you felt but nothing can be done about it now. And they wonder ""Are they still fake happy? Did they just end up showing their true unhappiness in real life? Or are they dead?"" But after those thoughts there will be nothing more. How can I 'fake it till I make it' without feeling like I'm losing myself? I'm not me anymore I'm someone else who doesn't exist in this world. Somebody who doesn't belong and isn't meant long for this world. Then after that person is killed off. The next person is the one underneath it all. But this time the death is permanent. No backups to fall back on in case it gets too scary. I'm back to square one and I don't think I can be here this longer. I was hoping you were help but it turns out after a little of what I felt you feel it maybe deems me a no longer viable human to add to your life. I don't know what actually goes on in your head. I wish I knew so I could stop torturing myself with thoughts of happiness with you. They're not going to happen.  They haven't happened so far so what makes me think it will happen later on? I can feel myself growing more catatonic every day. My brain no longer wants to think it just wants to be. The loss of interest in everything from T.V., books, eating, family, talking to people, and video games is growing stronger. Soon all I'll have are my thoughts and those don't help. ""Why would she want you?"" ""Who would ever want you?"" ""You must be a bad person or done something bad for nobody to look at you in the same manner."" ""You'll end up being taken advantage of becuase of the low bar you'll set."" ""The whole hiring a hooker to lose your virginity isn't a half bad idea."" ""How bad would it be for the people if you died?"" ""Not too bad probably."" ""Why don't you kill yourself?"" And I'm tired. I wake up feeling only slightly refreshed or happy to be alive. When is it my turn to be happy? I just want to finally be happy. Is that so wrong? Even if it's just by myself. Which may just be the case.",14Feb2018,2
27,"Today I went out to see my horse, Gadget. I drive about 30min to go see her and always bring my puppy, Fluff. When we arrive I get out of the car to open the gate and call for Fluff, she doesn’t come. I look in the car and can’t find her. I know I definitely bought her with me because she was playing with her ball next to me while I was on the motorway...which was 20min ago. 

I start fuckin freaking out, got back in the car and start driving back the way I came. I was hysterically crying by this point, assuming she had jumped out the window on the highway and had gotten run over and it was all my fault. I am calling my mum non stop but she’s not answering and I can’t find Fluff anywhere. I begin thinking about how much I love this dog and how for an experiment today I was counting how many cuddles we have per day so I could work out how many hours total I had cuddled and smooched little Fluff in her lifetime. 

I hear my phone ring and it’s Mum. Someone has found her very scared in the middle of the road but she’s okay! That feeling of pure relief was just wow fuckin thank you God!!
Turns out I completely forgot that I had stopped at one of those honesty box stalls, got out for 10 seconds to grab some apples, the dog had jumped out and sniffed around where I couldn’t see and I assumed she was in the car so I get in and drive the 10min it takes to get to the barn. 

The part i feel the worst about is that she was found pretty far up the road. She had probably seen me drive off and tried to run after me as fast as she could. She’s only little and I just imagine her face when she was trying to keep up with the car because she would have thought she was getting abandoned.

Anyways, crisis averted. I am so lucky she’s okay but I still feel so guilty at how close that came to my idea of a nightmare.",14Feb2018,0

30,"Firstly I'd like to say hello to everyone on reddit. My name is Jacob and this is my first post, so I apologize if anything is amiss. If this is a wrong reddit to post this kind of thing, I'd like a moderator to direct me to the right place. 

So today I was going through some old things, and found a couple of old photos from my early childhood. [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/RIQA4nk.jpg) The first photo is of me and my grandfather, dated circa 1993, when I was three years old. My grandfather passed away the same year, so I don't have many, if any, memories of him. [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/SdzfPI3.jpg) The second photo is of me and my grandmother, taken just after christmass in 1998, when I was eight years old, grandmother passed away when I was fourteen years old and I have very fond memories of her. 

When I found these photos, I cried a little, because it reminded me of how great my grandparents were and I miss them. 

Today I am 27 years old, born and raised in Czech Republic, where I am currently living. I live alone with my father, my parents divorced when I was fifteen years old. I like reading books, listening to music, my favorite is music from the 80's, or the, now rising genere of Synthwave, or Retro wave. I enjoy playing video games, watching anime and movies and drawing. I originally started gaming when I was six years old, when I recieved an old Atari from my uncle, it was such a blast at the time. Later on I moved to Sega Megadrive, or Master system for you folks living in the US. I used to play alot of games, especially Contra, with my father, later I got a Playstation 1, then Playstation 2 and currently I game on PC.

Moving on, I'd like to share a little about my life and myself. I suffer from chronic depressions from young age, also personal anxious disorder, chronic social fobia, or antropofobia and panic attacks. I am treating these problems with the help of a psychiatrist and psychologist for over fifteen years, however unsuccessfully. Nothing I try, be it medication or therapy is working and I don't know what to do anymore. I cannot go outside of my apartment without the escort from my father, let alone be amongst people. So it comes as no surprise that I am also unemployed and currently visiting employement office, since the age of 16. Everyday I feel deep loneliness and am in a perpetual state of bad mood, I cry alot, without a concrete reason and sometimes I feel empty inside, like my life has no value. I feel that my looks are subpar, or if anything, I am ugly and worthless being. When I was young and was regularly going to elementary school, I was constantly bullied and could not find a place amongst my peers. I changed schools frequently, three in total. Later on I tried to go to middle school, on the behest of my father. That plan failed quickly, as I could not stay in the presence of other people. My heart ached, I was nervous, dizzy, sweating alot and almost frozen in place, where I could not utter a single word, nor communicate. When I was thirteen, I was sent to a spa, for the duration of month and a half, from my doctor as I suffer from problems with thyroid. I was supposed to treat these problems in the spa, but all that happend during my stay, was only weight loss program and nothing more. I was constantly bullied, attacked physically and psychologically terorized during my stay, these attacks ranged anywhere from burning, physicall aggression, harm and even at one point rape. If you want to know, this happened as I was physically attacked, beaten and then held down by two people and the third one did the act, I could not fight back or do anything else. Through the course of my life, I was sent to spa in total of three times and my experiences were the same after each stay. These attacks were submited to the police, but they did not do anything about it nor the staff present. This experience has traumatized me heavily, thus my psychological problems.

Currently I am single and never experienced any love or intimate thing, nor relationship. To preface, I am hetrosexual and interested in women, not only for sexual reasons, but more for comfort, long term relationship and intimacy and all the feeling that comes with it. I am currently looking for a girlfriend, or a soulmate to be more specific, was my whole life to be frank with you all. 

So that's a little something about my self and my life, I'll be happy to share more details if anyone is interested. I'd like to hear what you people think or if you have any helpful advice. 

Thank you, whoever you might be, for reading this post and I apologize if my english is bad, for it is not my native language, although I feel that I am more than proficient at it.

33,"So, it's been a bit of a crazy ride this last week, but I finally wanted to post about it and encourage everybody to register and help out whomever they can.

My first run in with leukemia was way back when I was a teenager in high school. A very good friend of mine was diagnosed at the age of 15 and fought for nearly a year to overcome her leukemia. Unfortunately, even after a bone marrow donation, she passed just before her 16th birthday.

Fast forward about ten years and I'm browsing Reddit and see a post encouraging people to sign up for leukemia registries. Of course, this hit close to home, so I signed up with [DKMS](https://www.dkms.org/). The process of signing up was incredibly simple and all they do is send you a swab kit. You're on the registry until you're 65 and you are under no obligation to help if you are unable to at the time of contact.

Almost exactly a year after I signed up I was contacted and told I was a match. It was exhilarating, but also a bit nerve-racking. What was the process? How much will it hurt? How long will I be out of work?

DKMS walked me through every step of the plan. Initially they thought I would be able to do the ""easy"" procedure where they remove the needed cells from your blood and then transfer those to the patient. Within a month or so two they realized that wasn't going to be an option for the recipient; I was going to need to do a full bone marrow transplant.

They set up every test and appointment with me needed to get me checked out. I passed all of the blood tests, but there wasn't anywhere close to me that would be able to do the procedure. We decided on flying out to Denver to do the surgery and they sent me once ahead of time to do a physical.

When it came time to do the procedure they sent me and my father to Denver and set up all of the accommodations/flights for us, even rides to and from the airport. The only thing we ever had to pay for was cab rides and eating, which we were reimbursed for.

The surgery itself wasn't too bad. They put me under, drilled some holes into my hip on either side of the spine and went to town extracting the bone marrow. They pulled over a liter of bone marrow out of my hip and the whole thing took 2-3 hours. I was released from the hospital a bit later that day and stayed in the hotel for a couple or nights before flying home.

The recovery process was not nearly as bad as it seemed it would be. The best way I can describe it was it was like I was strapped to a Stairmaster for a day or two. My glutes and thighs were sore, but not so much in ""pain."" They highly suggested I not stand for long periods of time nor lift anything over 20 lbs for a few weeks. The procedure took place on a Wednesday and I was back at work on Saturday. The entire process from start to finish was just at 4 months.

DKMS would contact me every once in a while to give me updates on my recipient. Eventually a year passed and they asked if I would like to release my info to her and I, of course, said yes. She contacted me a couple of months later and, while we haven't had a chance to meet, we talk to each other regularly over Facebook.

Well, a couple of weeks ago I started feeling extremely exhausted. Walking up the stairs in my home would wear me out. I'd have to take a five or ten minute break to catch my breath after a shower. It was such a weird and gradual slope that I didn't realize how bad it had gotten in just 2-3 weeks. My wife kept encouraging me to go to the hospital, but I've never had any serious issues and I rarely get sick for very long so I just kept saying, ""I'll get better soon."" Turns out she was right all along.

I was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia last Monday. It's a different prognosis than my recipient (AML), so I truly hope this isn't something that has the possibility of transferring to her. She has been notified and her doctors/oncologists are keeping an eye on her. 

It's just so weird that this one disease keeps creeping back into my life.

I started chemo late last week and will be in the hospital for at least another month. I've had a ton of support from friends and family.

I really don't know to end this since it'll be an ongoing process to recovery, but I just needed to get this off of my chest and encourage everybody to register if you're able to. There are some great registries out there, so don't just look at DKMS (though my experience with them was excellent). I will try to answer any questions that I can if anybody has any.

Obligatory, ""This isn't my main account"" mention since I'm sure friends and family will figure out who this is. :)

**TLDR:** Please sign up to help each other out. It's a very easy process that can save another person's life.

**EDIT**: If anybody else has any good registries to suggest, please do!",14Feb2018,270

35,"**Paranoid disclaimer: I do not currently harbor any ill-will, violence, nor malice towards any specific individual. I have no intention whatsoever to inflict harm on anyone, including myself.**

I've developed severe and consistent violent urges over the past couple of years, and I nearly crossed the line into manifesting them a couple of nights ago. I'm writing this for the purpose of articulating the events and sorting through them mentally.

I have limited social interaction currently due to the state of my overall health. I spend a lot of time on Tinder fucking around and making conversation with girls for entertainment. I do fairly well on there considering I am physically attractive (so I am told), but have no intention of meeting in person due to lack of interest, so once conversation goes towards meeting in a romantic context I ghost. I generally have an emotionless/toxic personality so I wouldn't do well in person anyway.

However, two nights ago this very attractive girl I matched with straight up told me to come visit her at her hotel 20 minutes away, and that she was leaving the state the next morning to go back to school. I was alone eating pizza and torrenting a show, so I thought I might as well since I'm not doing anything. I had her Snapchat me and call me to verify that she was legit.

I drove to her hotel and she texted me on the way, seeming very excited and urgently wanting me to come see her. We met in the lobby and made small talk up to her room. Once in her room, she said ""So are we done with the small talk?"" and clearly wanted to begin having sex. I generally prefer to be more comfortable with someone before engaging sexually with them, so I suggested we hang out for a few minutes first. I have a very low sex drive, and had to psych myself up to get into a sexual frame of mind. 

After about 10 minutes, I was up to it and initiated on her, however she pushed me off and told me that she wasn't interested in having sex anymore and changed her mind. Up until this point, I was virtually emotionless and carefree about the whole ordeal that night (perhaps my personality, or lack thereof, made her uncomfortable), but I became extremely enraged in that instant. She wasted my time and had me come all the way over there for absolutely nothing. I held her down while looking directly at her and intensely deliberated for about 10 seconds whether or not to assault her to teach her a lesson. The desire to do so was so strong (and purely non-sexually driven) that it took all of my willpower to refrain from doing so. Ultimately, the realization that I would certainly go to prison over it was the deciding factor for me to walk away. There would've been clear-cut evidence due to text conversations. 

I got off of her, put my shoes on, said good night, and left. She subsequently blocked me on Tinder, snapchat, and my phone number assumedly (I haven't attempted to make contact). 

I haven't thought much about it since it happened until now. I'm not sure how to feel about it. I worry that I won't be able to stay in control indefinitely.",14Feb2018,1

38,"28M here, my love life is like some kind of paradox. I crave the feeling of being in a relationship with a woman I love, sharing experiences, bonding and doing life together. However without fail even if I come across someone I am attracted to and connect with, my attention span is short and the familiarity of it all just makes me bored. I lose interest and break it off. Chase after another one.. Rinse and repeat.

Case in point. I met this amazing girl recently and we really hit it off straight away, shared interests and just very passionate. I thought, ""finally this might be the one""... yet now these thoughts are again creeping up.

Is it just a case of I haven't found the right one yet? Or are some people just wired that way?

52,"I have diagnoses for depression and anxiety and my therapist and I are also now considering PTSD.

How do most people get these things? Shit, I've seen veterans with PTSD because they accidentally shot an innocent child, or people with depression because their childhood was shit or something.

My childhood wasn't shit. It wasn't GREAT, but I had plenty of people who loved me. So how, HOW, I ask... Could I obtain such an invasive neurosis that I couldn't bring myself to get out of bed for class TWICE this week?

Because I was properly disciplined as a kid. 

No, seriously! I can't think of any other way that this could have developed. It's so fucking stupid. It makes me feel weak. But make no mistake, it is very real.

I went to Catholic school in 2nd grade. No there weren't any nuns there (at least not while I attended). We didn't get spanked. Yes we were taught religion. Yes, I developed some anxiety relating to sinning and piety and all that, but considering I haven't been religious for years, that's not a big deal today.

What I DO remember... the thing that carry with me... is that academics were a HUGE part of the culture of this school. From the time we were very young, we were all expected to get accepted into four-year universities, and that failure to do so meant that you would work at McDonalds for the rest of your life. There was almost no talk of trade schools. No wood or metal shops. If I had declared my intent to be a plumber (hypothetically) I would have been given weird, disappointed looks.

Excellence is the standard. Maybe that phrase was never uttered by a single adult in my life, but that's what I learned. Excellence in academics, excellence in piety... and when I didn't do well enough I was scolded. 

But like I said, it was nothing out of the ordinary! I forgot a homework assignment, I was scolded. No big deal right? Proper discipline for a young child, right? For the record, there was no swearing or other abuse. Just telling me to straighten up and fly right.

But due to the facts that a) I had almost no positive social interaction with my peers b) I had/have ADD and at least one other learning disability, and c) no one sat down with me and really told me how to organize myself... I was scolded A LOT, and I took it REALLY HARD. 

So what did I do? I wanted to be a good kid. I wanted my teachers to be happy. So what did I do? What any normal kid would have done: I doubled down. I got to work. I did my assignments...

...until one day I would forget an assignment and I would get scolded again.

So what did I do THEN? I doubled down AGAIN. I remember in middle school trying to psych myself up for incredibly long study sessions which I would plan to be around 4 hours in length. I would never be able to finish those sessions. No middle schooler should feel like they have to do that much homework.

My organization habits improved over the years, but all that doubling down was taking its toll, and by the time I was in 8th grade, I didn't even need to be scolded when I made a mistake. Though the mistakes I made were small (eg getting a pre-algebra problem wrong), the punishment I began to inflict on myself was disproportionately harsh. It didn't help that many of my classmates we're already taking algebra, and they were doing just fine. But I didn't give up. I wanted to be like them. I wanted to finally be accepted. But despite my best efforts I could never do it. Suicidal ideations became a regular occurrence.

I don't think about suicide any more, thank fuck, but due in part to my upbringing, I cannot control the way I feel about school. I spend so much stress and energy just THINKING about school, that I develop psychosomatic fatigue. To clarify, my brain has such a strong negative reaction to school that I PHYSICALLY shut down. No manner of positive self talk can get  me out of these funks. This has made getting a college education nearly impossible. I spent 5 years trying to get an engineering degree. That dream is now destroyed. I am now working on being a nurse. If I do not find a proper treatment plan for this neurosis, that dream will also be destroyed. And the nightmare that I was taught since I was a kid - working shit jobs for shit pay for the rest of natural life, may actually be realized.

I want to tell my friends what's wrong. But how? ""Hey, guys! I've actually been depressed because I was properly disciplined as a child."" They would fucking laugh. Damn near every functional adult was properly disciplined as a kid and no one has a fucking disorder because of it except me. I feel incredibly alone in all of this. My friends are supporting me, but they haven't a clue as to what's really happening.

54,"I’ve been single for a year and a half. I’ve done the whole tinder, bumble, etc thing. When I first started out I was naive. I would get hype and burned fairly easily. I didn’t realize the fickleness of online dating. But I learned, it’s just the nature of the beast. I’ve been faded on, ghosted, speeched over the last year as much as I’ve done it to other people at this point. So the guard stays up, no hype allowed. Nothing’s guaranteed and that’s just part of the deal. 

Then comes along a girl who says all the right things. I know better, but I start to get excited. It just seems so hard to find someone who is as excited about you as you are about them. We talk for a week then go out and it’s so fun. She says things like she couldn’t have imagined tonight in a million years and she’s so happy. Now, granted this is all short lived, and I know in overall context there’s not much to support maybe the level of disappointment I have. But anyways, first date: nailed it. Longest and best first date I’ve ever had and she similar things (see above). We continue hitting it off into Saturday and circumstances line up to where I can get tickets to a game on Sunday. I invite her, she’s for it, so we go out Sunday. We barely pay any attention to the game Sunday as we are just talking away enjoying getting to know each other. We get dinner, she says all the right things. Invites me to something a month or so away, talked me up to friends and parents, the reassurance is there and I try to reciprocate. 

The guard comes down. I know better, but damn it I’m excited about this girl and all the right signs are there I thought. Monday and Tuesday seemed fine if not spread out a bit more with communication because of our busy jobs. I kind of mention Valentine’s Day and how I work but I’d like to see her again soon. She pitches Valentine’s on Thursday and we’re good. 

Today I woke up to a text saying she’s sorry but she’s just not feeling it, etc. Nothing I did or said she says, but she just doesn’t think we’re as compatible as she wants. Something just feels off. Now, who knows the whole story. Maybe it is all just that. Maybe she met someone else. It happens. 

Bottom line is I’m just bummed out. I let my guard down and felt that I finally met someone excited about me as I am about them. Maybe I misread the signs but everyone I’ve talked who says I didn’t, they seemed right. And like I said, this is only about a weeks worth of getting to know each other so obviously we never got to know each other that well. But after all the other dates and girls I’ve met over the last year and a half this girl had it all. This was the one I felt had real potential long term. Now I have to explain to everyone (who I normally never say anything to because I know nothing’s guaranteed so it’s not worth talking about every date) that oh remember everything I said yesterday? Yeah forget it. Yeah, I don’t know either. Yeah, I agree she seemed basically perfect. I don’t know what I did. I wish I knew. 


I wish I could’ve made it click for her. I just don’t have the heart to go back on tinder or bumble or whatever for now. I honestly don’t know how I can top this past weekend based everything said and done. And if I can’t reach that feeling again or top it, what’s the point? I need a break. 

I’m just writing this as kind of a get it out of my head so I don’t keep dwelling on it kind of thing while I lay on my couch, on Valentine’s Day, with Strep throat. It’s already kind of comical in a twisted way, and I’m sure I’ll look back at this as a lesson learned and laugh about some of the things eventually.

56,"I meant everything I said but I reacted in a very empathetic and impulsive way. Just because you probably have more experience dating than I do doesn't automatically make you completely right and me completely wrong.

From my perspective you put me in a tough situation. Why would you offer to pay twice (the first time I said it wasn't necessary and the second time you made the decision without even looking at me for agreement) if it was going to bother you. To me there's a big difference between waiting to see if I'll pay and artificially creating the situation by offering to pay early on. If you wanted things to end on a positive note all you had to do was say separate bills.

Why was it even necessary to offer to pay in the first place? Did you think I wouldn't have gone to the restaurant with you? Did I ever give you the impression that I wanted the date the end or that I'd be the type of person who needed to be bribed to go out? If so you need to give yourself more credit. I happily drove to Brampton, paid for mini golf and I would have happily paid for all of dinner too if nothing was said because I think you're a cool person and I enjoyed getting to know you better. If I wasn't able to show you the kind of person I am then I unquestionably failed.

I'm a very honest and sincere person and when I meet someone I get along with I assume they are the same way. I don't think believing someone and taking them at their word is an inherent flaw. I don't think you should offer to do something as a nice gesture if you don't really mean it. You needlessly put me in a position to fail. Had I been experienced, adept, or suave enough I could have navigated the situation properly but I'm not those things.

I think if you're honest with yourself then you'll agree that you made it difficult for me. I don't know if it was a test or just the game two people on a date are supposed to play but it clearly ruined an otherwise nice night for us. I still think you're awesome person and I only say all this because I think it's beneficial for you to hear.

On that note, I have a lot more clarity on this whole mess of a situation and I'm happy to have some closure. I hope you feel the same way and if you give me an email address I will gladly etransfer the money for dinner if it helps you move on too.",14Feb2018,3
57,"I've been having the same nightmares every few days throughout the years, for roughly 6+ years now. I know I should seek professional help but it's not within my monetary reach at the moment. The recurring nightmare I consistently keep having is my older brother stabbing me to death. I know it's a very extreme dream to keep having for so long. Without seeking any help or telling anyone till now. 

My brother suffers from schizophrenia, he had these episodes late at night when he was living with me and my mom in 2011, where he would trash everything in the house. Computers, phones, beds, chairs and etc. Everything and anything will get destroyed when he had these episodes. It got so bad that he ended up attacking our mother while she was asleep, and she ended up with minor fractures. She luckily escaped the attack by jumping out the window. I am little upset with myself that I wasn't able to stop the attack soon enough. 

After that night when the cops came we decided to send him away to get treatment. He was sent away for about 4-5 months, and when he got back he seemed ok. He was crying to my mom saying he was sorry about what went down. He had apologized while we visited him during his time in treatment as well. But the apology when he got back was the apology of someone who seemed ok. 

Seven months had passed since he was treated and it was summer of June 2012, my brother came home from the park. I was getting ready to go out with some of my friends from school. While I was getting ready my brother, asked me if he can use my phone to make a call and I said ""no use the house phone."" For some reason, he felt angered by me telling him no. He then kept on asking me for my phone, in a more angered manner. But I told him no once again. So he went away, and as I was putting on my pants he came back at me with a knife. He said to me ""so you're not gonna let me use your phone."" At that moment I was thinking to myself am ""I am gonna die over something so silly."" Then I tried talking him out of it, and he was still approaching me with the knife. So I grabbed his hand that was holding the knife, he managed to cut me by my knee. I was lucky enough to knock the knife out his hand and make a run for it through the back door. 

I called 911 and told them that my brother with schizophrenia attacked me, the cops and everyone that showed up handled the situation so calmly. No force was needed to restrain my brother, they just talked to him and the paramedics just brought him in to get medical help. I called my mom later that day and told her what happened. She was happy none of us got hurt (I didn't tell her about my knee.) While he was being treated me and my mother thought it was best that he didn't live with us again. His first attack was her which left her bruised with fractures, his second attack was towards me with a knife. We didn't want to risk it anymore, mostly me. 

Throughout the years since then, after his treatment and integration in regular society. I have been the one regressing into a more introvert nihilistic person. Having nightmares of what could have gone wrong with that situation, me getting stabbed. Not being able to save my mother from the attack, I have so much fear now that I rarely go outside. I fear people, and what could happen to me with one wrong move. I often laugh at myself of how much of a coward I am now. I know I should talk to someone and let them know but I am embarrassed by who I am now. So here I am typing these experiences in a condensed version to vent out a small problem within myself.

60,"I've wanted to post about so many things in my life. I've been through quite a bit and there is much about it that I want to share.  The fear upsetting my family for prior for the abuse I suffered and not being as articulate with my words as I once was has held me back.  I would love to write beautiful letters, notes, blogs or posts, but I lost a lot of my ability for writing when I chose a practical path that would ensure employment as long as I wanted it.

This specific post is about my college rape.  It happened almost 15 years ago and I have long since healed, but there are things about it that still irk me.

Part the impact that it had on my life started 3 years prior as an 18 year old coming out of a long-term abusive relationship.  I had decided, not for any specific moral or religious reason, but for myself that I would not have sex again until the guy I would marry.  I spent most of those 3 years, and most of college for that matter, single.  I knew I needed to love myself and put myself first before I could be ready again.

So here I am at 21 enjoying life in my small college town and like so many typical college students, I went out with friends on a Friday night with friends.  And like so many, I had too much to drink, maybe I was drugged, but back then I didn't think that was the case. I had more than too much to drink.

I left the bar just before bar time to get some fresh air and wait for my friends.  A Hispanic gentleman (probably 35+ years old) happened to be outside and asked me if I was ok since I was obviously not in a good state.  It was an awkward conversion of English/Spanish translations not going very well and some college guy came out of the bar and asked to walk me to my car.  I obliged.  

From here, my memory is spotted.  I don't think I realized how bad I was until we were walking, I vaguely remember stumbling several times and then I remember him parking at my apartment.  The only reason this stuck out to me is that I am a creature of habit and always parked in the same spot, he parked somewhere different.  

The next thing I know, I wake up with this guy inside of me.  I remember saying ""use a condom at least"" before passing back out.  I don't know what this guy looks like and have no idea who he is.

I wake up the next morning thinking ""oh shit"" and ""what the fuck happened."" I knew I was sore, it was obvious after not having sex for over 3 years, and I knew something was wrong.  I frantically searched my apartment for evidence and then I shut down.  Like, literally I locked myself in my apartment and didn't talk to anyone for 2 days.  Strangely, I had such good friends that they never even called to that night or the rest of the weekend even to just make sure I made it home.

I wanted so bad to just pretend it didn't happen, but I also knew I needed to be checked out.  I went to the hospital to make sure I didn't get HIV or pregnant or anything.  I did not want to report it because that would mean facing that it had happened and I had nothing to say since I had no memory of it.

The hospital (in a neighboring town) of course wanted me to report it.  They convinced me to talk to the police and reassured me that it would be a woman.  Only it wasn't and now I had to relive whatever I could with him.  After taking my statement, he came to my apartment to collect the condoms that I didn't even want to admit were there.  The worst part was that he literally told me that it ""didn't qualify as rape"" and that I had ""given consent"".

The after effects on my life was devastating.  I drank myself into oblivion most nights and starting sleeping around (limited to a couple of guys that I deemed ""safe"").  Why not, I broke my promise to myself anyways?  I quickly went from being a straight A student to being on the verge of getting kicked out of school.  My GPA never recovered and it still limits me in my career in certain aspects.  

I never fully sobered up in college, but I at least started counselling and was able to work towards healing. 

My senior year rape became a controversial subject around campus.  Not in your face, but there were letters in the campus paper debating the circumstances around a particular rape that was reported.  I weighed in and wrote a letter to the editor as well without identifying myself as a victim.  

I knew from personal experience that rape statistics in my college and in the surrounding town were being suppressed to make our campus more attractive.  I had personal accounts of other women who were overlooked and I had proof that the statistics were false. See, in the year I was raped, the crime statistics in my town stated that there were not any rapes reported in the entirety of that year.  I'm not saying there's a conspiracy, but I've always found it interesting that since writing that article, the public crime statistics for that year were no longer easily found.

In any case, since graduating, I haven't gone back.  I don't pay much attention to my Alma mater except when several years back it became national news that they were among the 55 campuses being investigated by the US government for sexual misconduct.  The problem I have is that it wasn't just the campus that needed be investigated.   

It's obvious that its been many years and I've had other pains in my life to get over since then, but it still pisses me off to this day.  I'm not looking to charge anyone for the crime, I wouldn't know who to charge.  In fact, I don't even fully blame the guy for what happened, he could've been just some ignorant, drunken jerk who had no idea what he did was rape.  Yea, he should've known better and I don't think its really a gray line, but I also remember a quote from one the literal ""good guys"" in college saying ""there is no such thing as rape, just drunken sex.""  This is seriously one the good guys, I don't think he even realized how ignorant his statement was, but its probably because he would never consider having sex with a passed out stranger.

Even 15 years later, I want to raise awareness, I want to shout what happened to me to the skies, I want to help change the college-aged culture that borderline encourages rape as a sort of passage, I want my university and town to be held accountable for suppressing what happened on regular basis.

More than anything, I just want to be told by my campus and by the police department that, yes, I was in fact raped.

61,"I tried calling my mom to talk about it but every time I talk to her about stuff like this, she makes me feel worse because she doesn’t offer any advice to me aside from “you gotta stay positive”. Same with my dad. It only works until it doesn’t work given that I genuinely try to be positive more than negative. 

So here I am, sitting at home (work from home), and constantly feeling like I’m a failure given my constant mistakes at work the last few days. I’m starting to basically doubt everything about myself and the path I chose and even though I’m still pretty young, I feel like I wasted years of my life as a failure. A lot of it is my fault too. I really just want to vent about all this because I don’t really know what else to do. The last few days I’ve been feeling really bad. 

I have a therapy appointment this week after talking to my friends about some of my problems (first therapy appointment ever) and I honestly worry that it’ll just ruin me more. And if I somehow get fired from this job, I won’t be able to even pay for therapy if it’s something that lasts a while. 

I’m genuinely scared of myself right now and have no one to talk to that will just listen and care because I don’t want to unload my problems on my parents or friends anymore. ",14Feb2018,3
62,"To my utter disbelief, I actually managed to go on a date last night. A first for me. I met her on Tinder and we chatted a bit before she showed interest in meeting up. Hella cute pictures and even more attractive in real life. She was legitimately way out of my league and things were actually going really well until the end when she needlessly put me in a tough position that I handled in the worst way possible (she told me as much after the fact). I tried to apologize profusely but it's likely she blocked me already and has moved on. That's the high, believe it or not...

So my day has obviously been kind of shit. Even though I think it's bullshit how she basically ""tested"" me, I still have regrets because I actually really did like her. It's obviously made worse by the fact that today is also Valentine's Day. The nicest message I got today was from a stripper, who gave me her number a while back. I have no illusions that it's anything other than a business arrangement and even though she's a nice person, her being nice still benefits her from that perspective. The fact that that's been the best part of my day in contrast to last night where I was actually tangentially close to being a normal person, it really shows how pathetic of a human being that I am.",14Feb2018,1
64,"I feel sorta good, but also sorta off? Like I want to say I feel fine, but also like, I dunno, tell people “get off my back”? New, uncertain feelings. Like usually I feel mildly solicitous, like I care about how I do and how I’ve done, but right now I sort of want to be like a regular person, not care, and step on people if I want to. What is this feeling? Compensation? 

I guess to me being “normal” means being full of myself, as opposed to my own normal everyday a little bit low in the self-esteem department. 

There’s this one episode in “Big Bang Theory” where an ex girlfriend of one of the guys in the house brings over a new boyfriend and like, all the cast who might identify as nerds kind of throw punches with their intelligence. They were bullied, and they become the bully. 

I’m sad to recognize this trend in myself. I feel. . . Inflated. Like not high self esteem, but like I’m a bubble that could pop. 

Man. Has anyone else felt this way? 

I kind of don’t know what “manic” specifically means in a mental health context. Am I using the sense of the word okay? 

Thanks!",14Feb2018,1
65,"I don't care if this gets upvoted or downvoted or even removed because I'm getting this off my chest anyway. First off, I'm going to say that reddit can be amazing, but it's a tool. Sharpen it and use it properly and you'll have something that can work for you greatly, let it dull and you'll have something that will slip and cut you. There are a good number of people who use reddit as a good tool for their hobbies and self-expression, but the vast majority, who are mostly decent people offline, slip into negative cycles that perpetuate shallowness and hatred.

Sadly, while I haven't really contributed or upvoted those loops of shallowness and hatred, I've read them. I've read them in /r/science. I've read them in /r/worldnews. I've read them in in pretty much every mainstream subreddit. Reddit is sometimes refreshingly tolerant and insightful about things, and it's a towering mountain of intellect and wisdom compared to Youtube or Facebook comments. However, it always assumes the worst about something. Special other does something very stupid? Break up, they obviously don't care about you, never mind that in a healthy relationship big mistakes happen and should be forgiven. Islamic terrorist attack? There will be someone saying ""lol religion of peace amirite?"" Someone mentions /r/askreddit outside of /r/askreddit? Someone will inevitably whine about the puns and overused jokes there. Someone will post a copypasta containing all the overused puns and jokes in a single paragraph. Thread about modern politics? Get ready for the dehumanization and bigotry toward a third of the United States population. It feels like this website is populated by people who are just a tiny bit smarter than average and then take that to think they are way smarter than average. It increasingly feels like the liberal secular way that they preach is hostile to other points of views and people despite preaching tolerance. I'm a sensitive person, and every time someone drags someone else down, it makes me feel a little worse too, even if I have nothing to do with it. It's not like the groups reddit criticizes shouldn't be criticized, I don't like Tea Partiers any more than anyone else, but when you focus on repetitively attacking them to make yourself superior, you're just dragging your own self down too. 

I'm dragging myself down too by even reading it, thinking about it, or typing this thing up in the first place. However, this will be the last time I worry about it. I have already unsubbed from all toxic, angry subreddits. I have filtered them out too and get my news from actual legitimate websites. I will limit myself to subreddits that are either dumb fun (like /r/bossfight or /r/oddlysatisfying) or insightful or interesting in some way. (/r/letstalkmusic and /r/askhistorians.) /r/askreddit is the only default that's staying because of all the interesting stories I find on there. From now on, reddit will be something that benefits me, not something that drags me into a pit of mud. If you've bothered to read this, thanks. ",14Feb2018,16
71,"I’m 17 and I was invited by my friends to go to Dubai for a week, keep in mind that I have been so sheltered not allowed to go many places with my friends or not allowed to go to sleepovers and when I asked my parents they said no. And I said I’ll go when I’m in university but apparently I can only go when I’m married to someone. I can only go when I am someone else’s responsibility because to them that’s what it means. I can’t go know because they don’t want me to but they believe that if I’m not married I’m still their responsibility and I can’t to anything without their permission. I need a man, a husband because without him I’m clearly not capable. Because a man is going to help me book flights, he’s going to talk to the airport people for me because I don’t know how to speak to people and he’s going to walk me everywhere because I’m his fucking dog.

73,"I started hating myself probably around when I was 10. Grew up with an abusive father who regularly beat me and verbally abused me (called fat, worthless, etc) and a mother who was too afraid to stand up to him for me. 

Also being the only black kid growing up through school I never fit in, on top of the fact that I was large. From what I can remember I spent most of my childhood feeling shame and just wishing I could be alone so I didn’t have to feel the shame in front of others.
So pretty much spent my whole life wondering why I was the way I am. Made it to college off of football scholarships but failed out the same year when I couldn’t bare to even leave my dorm room because I just felt so shameful, and unworthy to even present myself to another human being. 

Currently feel pretty dead inside, no motivation for anything, no goals... constantly wondering what is the meaning of my life. Also becoming numb to my emotions and find myself pinching myself or burning myself as pain seems to feel good. 

Working at a job just to make my mother happy, I know she wants to pretend as if everything is fine. I feel sorry for her. 

I find myself thinking that our individualism is just an allusion, and that if this thing that I call myself were to pass away, it wouldn’t mean anything. Then after I think of these things I realize how bat shit crazy I am. I wonder if I’ve dealt with too many concussions from football, or if I’m just trying to make sense of why my life has turned out the way it has.

Drugs seem to be the only thing that can make me feel good, and I’ll take it even if it’s for a short period of time. I like sleeping because I can sometimes dream of living a different life. 
It’s like I just exist and that’s it. I’ve tried to change so many times and I eventually come back to this point. If willingness is something I do not have, then so be it. 
I do sometimes daydream about like if the devil was real, and there was a way I could actually sell my soul for riches and material things. An eternity of suffering afterwards just feels so fitting to me.

I’m not writing this for pity, but just to shed light on how the human brain can spiral out of control.  It’s actually interesting, I even surprise myself sometimes. Sharing my insane thoughts.",14Feb2018,3
