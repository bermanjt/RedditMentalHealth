1,"So I was in /r/worldnews, and there was a thread about Russian election interference. I wrote a comment about how we should be allowed to compare American interference to Russian interference. 

You may agree or disagree. Feel free. But shortly after that, my character limit on posts was limited to 1. That means I can write one letter in response to the people I am in discussion with. 

What the fuck is this? I've been using reddit for years. Now they're fucking blocking me because I said something wrong? 

Here's the full comment for context:

How many global superpowers are there? Nations that are capable of massive global influence. Some people might say two, some people might say five, but whichever way you look at it, it's a very small number, and it's acceptable to compare like for like when you are dealing with just a few countries.

So when you are looking at interfering in elections, it makes sense to figure out who does it most often, and who does it most effectively. Otherwise you have no point of reference.

It is perfectly fair to say that Russia has been interfering in foreign elections. But without a point of reference, that doesn't really mean anything. Maybe it's totally normal to interfere in foreign elections. Maybe they're the only ones doing it.

We need to compare to understand.",11Jan2018,3
3,"I made a thread in /ULPT about lying on a resume.  It did ok but  got me thinking.  How unethical is it to lie on your resume?  If you can do the job correctly is there any harm done?    

Some entry or junior level jobs require years of job experience.  

Jobs now require a college degree that previously didn't.  AKA degree inflation.

You can't function in society without a job/source of income.  

If you lie then get hired you were the best candidate.  Again assuming you can do the job you applied for.

I'm going to bring up the dean of MIT who worked there for 28 years.  She was hired but lied on her resume. She worked her way up to dean.  She got fired once it was found out she lied.  She obviously did a good job because she was promoted to dean.  Does it really matter that she lied about her qualifications?  

There's no question we live in a competitive world.  Both employers and employees want the best.  Employers are requiring more qualification for entry level jobs.  If you don't meet the qualifications for a job but can do a job, do you think its unethical to lie to get an interview.  

What do you guys think?  I know someones going to bring up an example about lying to become a doctor.  That would be impossible unless you had all the licenses.  Same with other jobs that require licenses but if you have the licenses and then lie on your resume about something else, does it matter?   ",11Jan2018,25

8,"Where do I start? As keeping with the theme of my life, I'll apologise for me and for any mistakes. I hope this all makes sense.

I am a 32 year old guy and I dont know how to speak up for myself. I have no voice and it's killing me. I mean I can speak, I am not mute, but I cannot stick up for myself, I have no opinion. I might have ideas, or something I like and I constantly apologise and say sorry! But when it comes to pushing something personal, something for my good, or my feelings or even arguing the point I have no 'substance', no 'back-bone', no real courage. I am a coward. I have no voice.

I know I suffer from depression and I know I get reasonable anxiety (except when it comes to speaking up for myself, then it becomes unbearable), and I can have very low self esteem, (although like most when things are going good I can be very happy with myself). That being said I am very lucky that for the most part of my life, I have had great support from friends and family, so the monsters in my life have not too often reared their heads and when they have its been 'part of life' and I have just sort of got through with their support. Well until it didn't work anymore.... Until the wheel on my life felt like it started to wobble.

Years ago out of school and in the real world, I started to see the true colours of my circle of friends and decided I wanted more from life. They were all becoming increasingly involved in harder drugs and the bullshit that came with it (If you sleep with dogs you get fleas and I was over getting eaten alive). Being constantly tarred with their brush and unable to speak up for myself I walked away from them all and stopped talking to anyone associated with them. To start fresh and be free of the past felt empowering. I thought now if I worked hard the rewards would come. I would get a great job, earn great money, meet the woman of my dreams etc. I had it sorted.... Hahaha well I thought I did...


Sadly with my monsters becoming the normal and my lack of voice my hard work didn't get me anywhere. Im sure I wore the vulnerability on my face but it felt like people could sense I was timid and this became the beginning of my career that never happened. Promising great jobs that never eventuated. Wanting my hard work but to give me the least possible. Working for my entire tewntys at not much more than minimum wage my self worth slowly deteriorated. As it did I tried to make up for it by working harder, hoping to somehow get out of this rut. Everyday finding it harder and harder to get out of bed. 

Then one day 3 years ago as I was offered the opportunity to do an apprenticeship and go back studying to learn a trade. It's been during this apprenticeship that I've realised that the reason that people were getting ahead in life wasn't just because they worked hard but because they were standing up for themselves. They wouldn't let themselves get walked on like I did. When it came to an opinion they had one. If they felt they deserved something they said it. They used their voice. The fact I have never used mine is why I've struggled.

Since this realisation I have felt a huge change and these monsters have become ever more present in my life to the point I dont remember not having them... 

I know deep down now that the way through this is I need to find my voice. I need to learn to speak up for myself. I have stopped both alcohol and weed this year (smoked daily and drunk the odd beer after work but hardly ever got drunk). Being sober for the last 11 days has definitely helped show me how much pain and hurt my habits were covering. It's helped show me that I am a shell of the person I once was and had the potential to be. I need to let go of everything and start speaking up.... I just don't know how.... 

I have so much I feel and think inside but I get scared of peoples reactions so say nothing at all. I get scared of not knowing what to say back. I get scared I'll sound dumb or stupid. When I try and be funny I find I just end up offending. I end up with this inner monologue that reminds me that I'm better to say nothing at all.... Now this inner voice and self doubt has taken over. It has rotten what was left of myself belief.

I need more than anything for it to stop. 

I need to speak up. 

I don't know how to find my voice.

14,"This story isn't about me. It's the story of my cousin's friend. And it was just so entertaining that I just feel like sharing it for your viewing pleasure. 

There's a girl, goes by Julie. Julie is American-born, but raised in a strict Indian household. Her entire youth was spent in the pursuit of grades, numbers, certificates. Julie had 4 months left to graduate as an accountant from a prestigious institution. But in these 4 months, Julie realized she was unfulfilled by a life of chasing prestige and decided to have some fun. The result was a 22 year old woman who went absolutely ham on booze, grass, and general partying. She managed to keep passable grades, except for ONE class. For the first time in her life, she had failed at something. 

Telling mom and dad why she failed the course, and how she spent her semester was NOT an option. The funny thing about overbearing parents is that it produces the best liars. Julie could have simply retaken the class over the summer and graduated just  4 months later. But in her shoes, anything was preferable to telling her parents the truth. So, despite not having enough credits to graduate with any degree, she decided she was going to walk at her original graduation. On the big day, Julie's wide-eyed family sat in the stands, oozing with pride as their little girl, the accountant, would walk across that stage. However, Julie knew her name was not going to be called. Just as she had mentally planned for weeks, she hopped into a random place in line and acted natural. When it was her turn to shake the Dean's hand, he gave her a curious look, as she did not take a diploma from him. She merely shook his hand and progressed forward as quickly as social niceties would allow. Her parents' faces turned to discontent, disappointed in the school for ""forgetting"" to call Julie's name. Julie was interrogated about this anomaly later. But the quick witted girl she is, she managed to concoct a story that there was a mix up with the administration and she had resolved the issue. After some thought, Julie's parents decided there was no reason not to trust her. So they let it go. 

This is not even the end of this story. 

So Julie had some incredible luck and managed to get away with this. The sensible thing would be to retake the class secretly and finally earn that degree right? Well Julie's parents had paid for her education. Since they believed she was done with college, they would not be writing anymore $15,000 checks and Julie was no longer enrolled at her school. Well, the jig is really up. Shouldn't she just tell her parents the truth? Nope, that's not her way. She applied for jobs at some very big companies and landed an interview for a great position. She aced the interview, impressed her superiors, did everything right. But there was just one thing. There's always just one damned thing. 

They had to do a background check and verify her education before she could be officially hired. Most of us would cave under such anxiety and pressure. Not Julie. Through details I am not 100% clear on, she began dating the man who was in charge of background checks and education verification. Upon realizing she wasn't going to get any special treatment from her boyfriend, Julie dumped the man. And 2 days later his mom died. The man quit and it would take too long to replace him, so they let her start working without verifying anything. In all the ensuing craziness of this man quitting, Julie settled in as a valued part of the team and her verification was completed forgotten. 

No, I'm not done yet. 

After 8 months at this job, Julie wasn't satisfied with the money. So she applied for another large company. This time around, they didn't need to verify her education as her work experience was enough. They signed her on for a $100,000 salary and she now lives in a luxury apartment. 

Sometimes you work so hard, and barely make it an inch. Then there's Julie. Some people are just lucky I guess. The world isn't fair, but it's always interesting. ",11Jan2018,15

16,"**The best way to stop being lonely is to act like someone who isn't lonely.**

This is the real fake-it-til-you-make-it. Sadly, nothing is a bigger social repellant than loneliness. People don't want to take on your emotional baggage when they barely know you. And people don't want to feel like they are interesting to you purely based on the fact that they are better than nothing.  So you need to get out there and meet people, but as if you already have a basically completely full life and are willing to make some space for them. And when people are friendly to you and make overtures, say yes, but don't over do it. These overtures likely mean they are somewhat interested in getting to know you better, not in interviewing you to immediately to be their new best friend or love of their life. *Remind yourself to take things slow*.

**Pursue your personal interests.**

Join a writing workshop, take a language class, learn how to throw a pot, learn how to tap dance. If you have time be lonely, you likely have a lot of time on your hands, use it! Activities doing what you love are good for the soul, keep you busy and with a full life, and you will meet people with common interests this way. It also makes you way more interesting when you meet other new people.

**Initiate plans with the friends you already have.**

Don't feel bad about always being the initiator with people. Most people are pretty self-centered and kind of glide through life reacting to stuff, rather than being ""pro-active."" When your friends don't call you, it's not because they don't care, it's likely because they aren't thinking as far ahead as you are, and aren't thinking about that much other than themselves or maybe their immediate nuclear family. And don't look down on being the initiator, it's a great characteristic to have and develop. Initiators are why relationships last. 

**Get out of bad romantic relationships. Being lonely because you are with the wrong person feels worse than being lonely because you are actually alone.**

Sometimes the loneliest people actually have a partner -- but it is not a good fit.  The initial break-up will probably feel like shit times ten, but once the acute period rolls back, you will likely feel much much better.  Get a break-up buddy for this, call a friend, and it's doesn't even need to be a very close one and recruit. I recommend selecting someone who has been through a break-up relatively recently. This is the person you call or text when you are tempted to call or tempt your ex. This is the person you vent to in those first few weeks of wallowing. This is the person who will get your ass out of the house and back into life when it's time to stop the wallowing period. Also, this shows that just having an SO is no panacea for issues of happiness and loneliness, don't romanticize the idea that all you need is a partner and then you'll be all set.  ",11Jan2018,52
18,"So as the title says, i hate my nose. 
I'm a (white) girl and I think my nose is too fat/bulbous/wide etc. 
I daydream about becoming ""perfect"" in which I actually just have a slimmer nose. 
I want the kind of thin, slim, perfectly chiseled noses that ""Instagram models"" and people I know and see all the time have. My sister has a thinner nose and I have always been envious of it. 
I just feel like it's not fair I ended up with such an ugly nose, and I have a rounder face which I don't think they go good together. 
But at the same time I would never get a rhinoplasty b/c I'm Christian and God created me in his perfect image, so at the same time I can't change it. 

I hate it so much. 
Sometimes I dream that someone breaks my nose or some injury happens to my nose so they can fix it and in that process tell me that they had to make my nose thinner. 

It's a huge insecurity of mine and it consumes my everyday thoughts, especially with snapchatting people all day I get really self conscious about my nose. 
Honestly I think I'm depressed about my overall self image and other aspects of my life but i am working on changing some of those things (like my weight, I'm not really fat I'm within range for my height, but I just feel so fat and unattractive) but I know I will never be able to change my nose, since you can't really slim it down enough through weight loss since it's a bulbous so it's just the nose I got. 

I know other people in this world had larger problems such as starvation or homelessness but I'm over her complaining about my nose. 

But yea, I hate many things about myself and my nose is just one of those things. Hopefully I will grow out of some of those things (I'm only a 17 year old girl so I hear the phrase ""you'll grow out of it"" or ""you'll get used to it as you get older"" and I am hoping that's the case... )

Back in 2013, I reevaluated my life.  I no longer could do things out of freewill and struggled with depression.

In March 2016, I was forced to a leadership program by my twin brother.  I had an eczema flare and accidentally infected it.

30,"Hi, I'm new to reddit, nice to meet you all. I was hoping to get some advice on family issues, depression, anxiety and past experiences. I also need to vent and get these thoughts out of my head.

I've been depressed for quite a while now without knowing it (10 or more years) and past issues that I ignored or blocked out have surfaced and I'm not sure how to deal with them.

I apologise in advance if this is long winded. 

Here goes. 

I was bullied throughout school because of my weight, I then became depressed which stemed into an eating disorder which made me borderline anorexic, bulimic and I was self harming. I'm an introvert and very quiet person so I kept what I could to myself. My mum started taking me to an eating disorder clinic as advised by the doctor which didn't help, apart from this my parents were distant during this time. My parents relationship was starting to crumble at this point which took priority. 

My dad always kept his distance from us whilst my mum blamed me for causing her stress and lashed out often.

My dad was a horrible drunk and would constantly cause arguments, tell us he was going to kill himself, tell me that I wasn't his daughter etc. once whilst drunk he tried to commit suicide by overdosing in-front of me, my younger brother (aged 9 at the time) and my mum who was egging him on to do it. I stepped in and stopped him, lucky for me he was too drunk to fight back. After putting him to bed I emptied all medication from the cupboards and checked up on him often to make sure he was okay.

I had a so called ""best friend"" at the time who would put me down and would fall out with me over petty shit like not helping her clean her house. She made several fake IM accounts with one of her friends to dig into my personal life.   


I had nobody to turn to which resulted in me being cat fished. I would skip school and travel for hours to stupid locations on my own just to be let down or told the person I was supposed to meet was in some sort of serious accident. I just needed one person to listen and was desperate.  

Not long after, I finally tried to commit suicide by overdosing. My dad found me downstairs crying. He woke my mum, when she saw me she shook her head and called me a stupid bitch, shrugged it off and went back to bed.

Skip ahead a few months. I stopped self harming and got back to a steady weight. I did this hoping to get my life back on track and hopefully move away from everyone.

At the same time I met my 1 year on and off , druggie ex boyfriend. He was emotionally abusive, knowing how sensitive I was he would use this to his advantage. He would break up with me to sleep with other girls knowing I would chase him. He would always choose his friends and drugs over me and made me feel as small as he possibly could. On one occasion he made me watch a video of him hooking up with another girl and explained in detail what they did. I guess he got some sort of sick and twisted kick out of it.

After 1 year of a disaster relationship we called it quits and I did my best to move on. I had no friends at the this time so it was pretty tough getting back out there and keeping myself busy.

I eventually met a guy through a girl at college. I was desperate for affection and somebody to talk to so I agreed to meet up with him. I was really uneasy around him and instantly felt like I had made a mistake. Long story short, he lured me into a secluded area and I was sexually abused. After it happened he took the long journey home and never spoke to me again.

Still not having anybody to talk to I tried turning to my ex boyfriend for help. He didn't believe me about the sexual abuse, messaged the guy, they became friends and he said to me ""we know what really happened don't we"" after this I cut him off.

A few years later I attempted to tell me my mum about the abuse whilst drunk, she told me I needed to tell someone. When I confronted her the next morning she repeated herself and said ""I told you, you need to tell somebody, there is nothing I can do"" 

A few years later I met my fiance, moved away from everyone and couldn't be happier with my home life. I finally have a supportive, loving partner in my life, I'm so thankful I have him.

Since moving away, alot has happened.

My dad has cheated on my mum several times, they divorced but are now in this back and forth relationship of not knowing what they want. My mum will ring me and only me often crying or moaning about how much of an idiot my dad is and how she can't cope with her financial situation. She plays the sympathy card and asks for money, which she gets. She makes it obvious which siblings are her favourite and uses me for money and as her personal therapist.

My dad is still distant, drinking a lot and ditching us to hang out with dead beat friends but tries to worm his way back in with us after cheating or upsetting one of us in someway.

My granddad passed away with motor neuron disease. I regret not seeing him before he passed, He was an inspiration and helped me flourish with my art. I miss him everyday.

If you made it this far, thank you for listening/ reading my long winded venting.

If you have any advice on how to deal with past experiences or have anything of your own to share please do so.

I'm a 21 year old male. Had one gf, never had sex. She broke up with me 4 months ago. I'm okay with the situation now. I mean I'm sorry she left, but I'm ok. 
I'm on no contact with her for over a month. I am also on nofap, so no porn or masturbation, which I used to do 4-5 times a week or less. 

I'm trying to improve myself now. Here are some improvements I made : started exercising (gained some muscle and some weight), started eating healthier and more, started nofap. 

I became better at social interaction, and this brings me to my problem. How do I make a girl know I'm attracted to her? How do I talk to her so she can know my intentions without being a jerk or something? 
Now I don't have problems with the relationship itself. It's just...I don't know how to get in a relationship. 
If someone could help me, give me some advice, even steps...I don't know. 

BTW, don't think my life is empty. I'm a student, I play guitar, I compose music, I take photographs, I have a sense of humour and I'm friendly. I don't want a gf just for sex (although I would like it a lot). I want to be able to get close to someone, to be close to someone, etc.

32,"so.... yea. I don't normally go out of my way to help people, but this morning i did! Last week's snow storm dumped a lot of snow on my area, and while the roads are mostly clear now, the sidewalks are still covered in slush and ice. I was on my way to work on a military base, that i wont name, and saw a guy in a wheel chair stuck in some slush on the side of the road (This was literally a block away from the base's gate). He was sitting there in shorts and a t-shirt in 30 degree weather and no one else was stopping to help. So I decided that i just wanted to do the ""right thing"" and help the guy out. I didn't know how far he was going or what he needed... i just knew he needed some help and i was going to make sure he got where he needed to go.

So I flipped a u-turn and got back to where he was and got out to see how i could help him. He was stuck good! it was a powered wheel chair and was just spinning the wheels on the ice. I told him that i would push while he steered the 100lb machine. Luckly he was only going down the road a bit to a trailer park where he lived. so I just keept pushing through all the slush and finally got him back home. He was so grateful that someone stopped to help him.

after walking back to my car and getting to work late, i started wondering why i was the only one to stop and help this guy? there were probably 50 cars with military members in them just driving by while he was stuck there and while we were pushing through the snow, but then again... thats usually what i would do.

I just feel really proud of myself for going out of my way to help a complete stranger. I haven't told anyone else at work, and no one would really know otherwise since i'm a civilian and dont wear the uniform anymore. I don't really want any sort of recognition, but i just felt really proud of myself for doing the right thing today!!

34," Life just feels isolating. Losing people and feeling irrelevant. Wondering how those you cared about can so easily leave and not look back. Feels like your the only only  one that wanted to hold on. The other just walk out and never cared to look back. 

 I wanna accomplish something and atleast leave a mark. 

Shit, just recently I thought I can make a difference for someone and now Im on their shit list. And she has no idea how being close with her meant alot to me.",11Jan2018,2
36,"I'm 24 years old and I have body hair. I have some chest hair, forearm and upper arm hair, leg hair, even a tiny bit on my hands and feet. It's not one of those situations where I look like I have a jungle growing on my chest or that I'd be mistaken for big foot, but the hair is there. The only rules I've abided by is that back hair and back of neck hair are gross and should be shaved off.


I've been at a beach resort all week and almost every guy I've seen has barely any hair. I feel like a monkey here in comparison. 


Do they just shave it off or are they incapable of growing it? Have I been mislead about grooming my whole life or am I just slightly more hairy than average? Did I miss some sort of male waxing movement or something? It's one of those questions I've always been curious of but have never felt it was appropriate to ask.",11Jan2018,51
39,"A vulnerable family were held hostage on Tuesday by 4 armed thugs who ransacked their house and stole the family’s life savings. The father is 89 and is the sole carer for his 3 adult children who all suffer from severe mental disabilities. They dragged the adult children down 3 flights of stairs and held them all in 1 room while they raided the house. The father had been saving the money for his funeral and to help pay care home costs for his children. I cant believe these scum could be so callous and devastate these poor peoples lives.

41,"Hey guys, this may be a bit long so bear with me. 
Anyways, I’m really struggling right now about what to think about this. I don’t know what to do. Let me just give some background details first.

So we’ve been decent friends for about a year now, but we really started talking a lot after we talked about loneliness. It was eye opening to me that she felt the same way as I did during that time. Eventually she just opened up to me about a ton of personal stuff that’s happened over the years and it makes me feel really good that I’m the person she goes to for comfort. I eventually gave her my number and then she called soon later, and we talked  for about three hours. We text each other almost every day and when she came back down from college, she always invited me to do stuff with her, so we hung out quite a bit during Xmas break. 

I feel so happy to have her in my life, I even told her that I considered her my best friend and she said she felt the same, and that we’re both happy for what we have together. I also told her that I don’t need anything more than that, although that may have been a good idea to put it like that. I feel like she really cares about me and I’ve never felt like this before. 

My point is, I don’t want to ruin anything if I ever told her. But I really feel like we could have something together, and I’ve never been more confident about this kind of thing before. However, when she’s in college it’s a bit far, so we’d have to have a long distance relationship if anything happens. We talked about long distance relationships before and she said that she’d try it, but I don’t know if it would make her happy. I would be though, before she came down, we would talk all day and that’s all I need to be honest so I don’t see how different it could be. I know I’m probably not giving enough details, but I just needed to vent if anything. I’m not sure if I’m ever going to tell her, but I really want to, and I don’t want to lose what we have, because a friend like her is all I need in life.",11Jan2018,1

44,"Last year I got fired from a job and I've been unemployed for nearly 2 months now. For some dumb fucking reason I didn't even think to apply for unemployment until a few weeks ago. At that time I was already just drowning in debt and finally got my dumb ass to apply. Now I'm finding out that its STILL going to take a month+ from now and I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do. 

Im way behind on bills, credit card, car payments. Been mooching off my brother for everything else. And to think that all this fucking time I could have at least been getting some income to help out.

Would have avoided all those fees, all the collection notes, all the stress. But now it's way too fucking late. It's going to be another month before I can even collect, and now im so far back on bills that it's not going to fucking matter

Plus I'm actually close to employment again, which is going to cancel the unemployment which means another 2 weeks before even getting my first paycheck

It was like a huge fucking red flag that was like ""Hey you dumbass, there are programs specifically to help you in this situation. It's easy to apply, just do it and remove weeks of stress."" and I was too fucking stupid to think to take advantage of it.

God damnit what the fuck is wrong with me, god DAMNIT. ",11Jan2018,1

46,"I have literally no idea what I want to do with my life. I graduated with two bachelors degrees in psychology and biology. I got depressed near the end of college and focused only on having fun and meeting people/going out, didn’t apply to jobs or internships. All I have to my name is an okay ~3.4 GPA, membership in a few honors societies, and some basic biology lab skills. Right now I work part time in a grocery store. I’m unsure of how the “real” world works, and although I can feasibly live doing what I do now, it is a miserable existence living in a crappy place that is really cheap and with roommates I do not even like. The only things that I have piqued interest are women’s rights, cats (seriously love cats), and psychology in general. My family and friends and SO are all low or high key disappointed in me doing next to nothing with my life and my depression only gets worse every day. What do?????

51,"I don't intend to hurt feelings here, but I'm going to be expressing some raw unfiltered opinions and frustrations here, and it may be offensive to some people. If you can't handle honest criticism then don't read. If you aren't open to a real discussion then don't read.

One of the things that really annoys me isn't people trying to tell me what's attractive or sexy; it's an opinion determined by the biological response or lack thereof to another person's appearance or behavior, and it should vary from person to person because our brains develop individually and therefore learn to pick up on or be sensitive to different traits. In other words, if someone's mom was really tall and she was very effective in her role as a mother that person might develop an attraction to especially tall women by subconsciously associating tall stature with good feminine parental instincts. And that same line of thought could be applied to almost any sort of healthy human trait. What annoys me is people trying to completely redefine what has been the generally accepted concept of beauty for hundreds, probably even thousands of years for a reason.

I'll use myself as an example and for the sake of humility I'll say I have high standards, I'll get into what I find attractive and why that might be, what I don't think is attractive and why I think pushing for to be accepted as such needs to stop. I don't think my standards are unrealistic at all but I do think that maybe I set myself up to be hard to please. BUT I will say that what I find physically attractive are all traits of a fit, healthy, fertile female body as is supported by science and medicine (no I won't post links there's plenty of support for this, it's not hard to find, you can do your own research if you want). I'm attracted to sturdy legs with thick strong thighs, a lean but not malnourished waist (for the sake of being specific let's say 26-32 inches in circumference with an average height, or something proportionally equivalent), wide hips, strong shoulders, well-developed and shapely breasts, a clean smell, a face with a relatively symmetrical structure, and a reasonably healthy clear complexion, and really I don't care about height; you could be 5'0 or 7'6 and it wouldn't make damn bit of difference to me. Keep in mind that I'm not saying I don't find women who don't perfectly match this description attractive, I'm just giving you the extremes of my physically ideal partner to give you an idea of what direction my preferences lean to. 

So why might that be? Thick thighs (well firstly the thighs and hips are a more optimal area to store body fat since it doesn't restrict movement as much as in the upper body) are a sign of being well nourished and being capable of less encumbered mobility during pregnancy. A lean or narrow waist is a sign of a healthy ratio of exercise to calorie-intake. Wide hips help in child baring/birthing. Large, well-developed breasts are usually the result of sexual maturity and the body using growth hormones to say it's ready to reproduce (not to mention that large breasts typically produce more breast milk which is good for offspring in early development). Facial symmetry is a sign of a diverse gene-pool. And a clean smell coupled with a healthy complexion is just and sign of basic hygiene. All of these are evolutionarily advantageous, and men instinctively find such traits attractive because of the genetic and reproductive benefits. Men are not necessarily CONDITIONED to find these basic signs of beneficial evolution and genetics attractive; they're just wired to have that predisposition, it's based more on instinct, and it just so happens that society and modern fetishism that has gotten way out of hand sets up somewhat unrealistic expectations for reality.

Now this is what I don't find physically attractive: fat, bad smell, lack of basic hygiene, and anorexia/malnourishment. There aren't many things that I find sexually repulsive. An excessively fat or overweight physique is a sign of a lack of exercise, high blood pressure, and unhealthy eating habits; more is NOT better once your figure begins to resemble that of the Michelin Man, and if you find that attractive you're sick in the head because that is simply unhealthy in every sense of the word. Bad smell and lack of basic hygiene are so obvious that if you find them attractive you should to seek help. And a sickly or malnourished figure is a sign that the body isn't getting enough nutrition to carry out basic biological and motor functions at a sustainable rate, and a woman needs proper nutrition to develop and give birth to healthy offspring. It's wrong to tell fat people that they're physically beautiful or that they're fine the way they are, the same way it's wrong to let teenagers think that denying themselves food and throwing up after meals is going to make them beautiful. It's wrong to think of things as needing to be one way or the other, that's just not what the reality of the human body is. You don't need to be a doctor to know this crap; you just need to put aside your emotional biases, do some research, look at the research with an open mind, use common sense, and learn to accept the reality even though it might make you feel terrible. 

So now I loop back around to my main point. It isn't wrong to have standards, if you find signs of basic health and physiological indicators of reproductive capacity attractive then you aren't shallow, you're actually pretty mature and reasonable. What makes you shallow is seeing everyone who is less than substantial as undatable, and that can be applied to homosexuality too; a gay guy who won't date a perfectly normal dude just because he isn't as handsome as Chris Hemsworth is just as shallow as the straight guy who won't date a woman because she doesn't have a bod like Scarlett Johansson's. Chances are your standards for physical beauty and attractiveness are not shallow. Unwillingness to accept what you are instinctively disgusted by doesn't make you shallow. There's a line between shallow and reasonable, that line is the acceptance of only what is substantial and of what is adequate or more.

Keep in mind I'm not saying that physical beauty is the only contributor to attractiveness; behavior, personality, and character are just as important. In my book, a genuine care for the wellbeing of those around you or the ability to act as a functioning adult gives you +10 personality, and the THICC gives you +10 sex appeal, contributing to a total of 20 attractiveness-points out of a measurable maximum of 100, and I've heard that an imbalance between personality and sex appeal actually causes the difference to be deducted from the the total (awaiting confirmation). After reaching 100 attractiveness-points or above you enter the realm where the line ""so did it hurt when you fell from heaven?"" is a serious and legitimate question. 

Just to clarify. I didn't set out to fat shame, I didn't set out to hurt feelings. I simply expressed my frustration with an insidious and manipulative social movement that makes people feel ashamed for finding outward/physiological signs of health beautiful, telling us that characteristics of poor health are just as beautiful as characteristics of good health. I'm sick of having ""fat is beautiful"" sentiments shoved in my face, and, unlike obese slobs that play the victim card who are sick of having ""slim is healthy"" shoved in their faces, I have a good reason. We shouldn't just accept everyone the way they are because some people are disgustingly unhealthy, and we're doing them a disservice and injustice to let them think it's okay to continue living unhealthy when they can do better. I'm going to get a lot of hate for this, but I needed to vent this frustration.",11Jan2018,0
