I work at a pub and a group of girls sitting and drinking and one stopped to ask me can they play music on their phones I said no we arnt allowed to play music and I said if it was up to me I’d let them but it isn’t etc and I walked off to get glasses from another table when she said something to her friend who laughed and in my way back last she looked at me and said ‘what time do you finish?’ I paused a little and said ‘oh 10pm’ (it was 8:40pm at this time) and then she turned away and said ‘oh so you don’t want to drink with us then’, is this a bad thing?

Edit; they already asked my boss can they play music a while before and he said no aggressively  and then they asked me later ",08Oct2018,1

Because of that, I kind of wish I had done LSD sooner since I would have been more successful at this.  Although the other angle to it is I wouldn't have enjoyed life the way I did before taking LSD, because once you tune into ""the game"" life is about dark paranoia 24/7.",08Oct2018,1

They call me “Goyo”, Gregorio, and Caguama because of these Mexican commercials in which a token white guy named Gregory keeps grabbing the wrong thing when everyone just wants a “caguama” (which is the American equivalent of a tallboy.) Many of the guys and gals have invited me to their homes and fiestas in Mexico. 

The reason I post this is because I have been struggling horribly with anxiety and self esteem issues for most of my life, but when I’m there, everybody is there to work hard and play hard later. I’ve never felt so accepted anywhere before.

9,"I am 29, a single female. I have been single for four years, estranged from my parents and I come from a difficult family background. One half of my family is Protestant and the other is catholic. My only constant was my gran, up until recently, whom I adore. She now has dementia and isn’t ‘with it’ anymore. 

My past relationships have been intense and messy up until I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and started receiving weekly therapy. That started five years ago and I’ve really levelled out. But I’m not exactly excited about my future.

I feel a bit hopeless today. I genuinely don’t see myself being in a relationship in the future where I can be a good mum and have a family and success. I feel like I’m broken and worry I’ll only ever hurt people the way my family hurt me. Especially any family I hypothetically would have. I don’t date any more. I’ve given up on that. My weight has ballooned these past few years as my health issues are chronic and can’t be cured. I have fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. 

I feel like I am a burden. I miss my gran. My friends are good but I have trouble speaking about how I feel. I don’t have a career or anything I’ve got qualifications for. I have tried for the past decade to get my degree and I keep being admitted to hospital etc cos my immune system is shit and it fucks up my studies. My only companions are ones I have online sometimes. Especially during the night when I can’t sleep. 

Joe Rogan said something. I watched his most recent podcast and he was chatting about how he’s always being asked what others can do to sort their life out. He replied “some of these people you would have to live with and start from scratch with them” plus further making out it is too huge a task.

I’m one of those people. I feel useless and like I’ll never be happy looking at what I see in the mirror any more. 

I just feel so bleh. Like, what’s the point?",08Oct2018,1
10,"So here's the background: I'm female, married to a man, and have a daughter who is 12. She is easily one of the coolest people I've ever met. Our parenting style is pretty laissez faire. I want her to figure out who she is without too much interference. Like, for example, my husband and I are atheists but I don't think we've ever had that conversation with her. If she wants to go to church with her grandparents (a fairly liberal church) I don't want her to feel like there's some conflict with how we believe. So that's the general up bringing she has had. I give her fairly free reign on the internet and I don't snoop, which may or may not be good but it hasn't been an issue thus far. I just really want her to figure life out on her own, and that's important to me. 

A a few years ago, my husband and I decided that we are polyamorous. We have a strong marriage and have other loving relationships outside of that. He really wanted to tell her and introduce his girlfriend, Heather, as such. I just had so much nervousness about it and it stems from a lot of things. My own parents made such a big deal out of everything and were so intrusive that I felt like I had to hide everything as a teen. I also realize this is a huge paradigm shift and she may feel uncomfortable about her changing family dynamic. So we presented these people as friends of the family. Realistically she probably knew more than what she let on, but that was the spoken dynamic. 

So anyway, for her 12th birthday, she decided to take a bunch of kids to the mall and spend her birthday money instead of gifts or a party. Only the kids could fit in the van so I drove them by myself. It was several girls and a boy she's been friends with since kindergarten. On the way home, I noticed I had a text. I don't normally text and drive, but I wanted to glance at who it was from. It was from my 12 year old...who was sitting right behind me. The text read: ""Mom, I'm pansexual."" 

Here I am in this van full of kids, I have no idea what her friends know and if they know nothing I don't want to embarrass her, so I text her back ""Ok."" I can hear her laugh and she texts back ""Do you even know what that is?"" I yell back to her ""Stop texting me while I'm driving!!!"" Ugh...of all the responses to coming out, I respond ""Ok"" and then yell at her....

Anyway, our house was kind of wild that night. We had so many kids there so I didn't get a chance to talk to her. But at some point in time the next morning, everyone aside from her and I was outside so I was like ""Was my reaction okay? Like, should I have said more words?"" She laughed and was like ""I have no idea."" And finally, after all these years, I decided now was the time to rip off the bandaid and I told her we were poly. I know I should've waiting until her father was there, but I may never have gotten the courage again and it just felt like the right moment. She didn't have a verbal response but her face was like happy quizzical? I can't describe it. Anyway, immediately after I said that she said ""Oh, and [boy's name who was with us last night] is trans and goes by Emma now."" And then walked away. 

My head is kind of spinning. And how awesome is it that my 12 year old had the guts to do something that couldn't figure out how to do? She's amazing :-) ",08Oct2018,1

Thursday I roughed it and forced myself to go to school even if I felt sick because I didnt want to miss 3 days in an row. Big mistake.

We thought we finally had the timing right, but then....we broke up mutually due to us being across the country from each other for college and it was really stressing me out thinking about how to make our relationship work. He was getting stressed about it too and he started to distance himself from me and ignoring my texts for days on end, leading up to our move in days.

25,"The girl that I met in one of my periods when school started has started showing signs to me but I’m not sure what actual signs are since I obviously never experienced them. I used to be “in between the spectrum” of introverted and extroverted as I used to ask girls out by the end of middle school (When HS started I’m a sophomore now) however years of rejection after rejection has completely destroyed my confidence in sometimes leaves me as the black sheep of the group. Some people think I’m gay because they never seen me with a girl before and even my dad messes with me on the topic.

About the girl I have a semi crush on, I’m having trouble determining between IOI’s, being friendly and trolling. (I’ve been humiliated by being led on before by several ladies before like Free Money, Food, Doing their assignments at the last moment for them.)  This week in class she was acting somewhat willing to engage in a few very brief conversations with me (I never been able to hold a topic with a girl for more than five minutes and they ended on my behalf), She did attempt to tell me a one liner joke making a pun on my name and she giggled, I wanted to laugh with her but I stayed silent because my laughter sounds like one of an emotionless robot so I responded that I didn’t get the joke before she went silent. Before leaving class she randomly asks to high five my hand (I think she giggled too but I really can’t tell.) 

The next day during the middle of the period she just happens to run out of lead for her pencil (I’m not entirely sure if my mind is playing tricks on me but I think I saw her move her pencil to the side out of view) and she asks to lend her one, she taps on my shoulder because I have my headphones in.

Today (I guess yesterday.) during the middle of class she tells the small group of four that we can all watch her pop fruit snacks in her mouth from the air and upon having the last one fly into her mouth I chuckle slightly and she giggles back, I think it was in a cringe type laugh because my laughter sounds like Hal 9000. Fast forward an hour later and I see her walking down the hallway with my one of my friends that I met during my first year. I’m not jealous or anything is just the thing is she does happen to like him (I’m not sure, you can consider my social skills on the spectrum when it includes to talking with females) how do I get rid of her from my mind? It’s not like I never had the chance anyway with her. I think I’m mentally abusing myself with trying to find a girl with similar characteristics of myself like playing anything except Fortnite all day but I guess it doesn’t help that every guy I’m around is either physical or socially superior to me in every possible way.

The thing is I can talk to a female for a few minutes about the latest assignment but shit truly hits the fan when any woman treats me like a human being.
I find myself looking down all the time and pretending to occupy myself for I don’t want to end up embarrassing myself for being me and most importantly the girl for talking to me. Girls simply don’t deserve having their reputation ruined by talking to a 5’3 feminine/masculine voiced guy with insecure and depressive thoughts that he’s been going to therapy since middle school to treat, they don’t deserve a weak piece of genetic trash that’s been getting the fucking shit beat out of him since middle school but he fights back finally but it’s his fault in the first place by thinking fighting back would change a damn thing about his pathetic life. They deserve so much better. He should’ve never said anything and just kept letting people continue to beat the shit out of him because that’s the only one thing he’s good at in his pathetic failure called life and that’s all he can do and the only thing he can look forward to in life, handle pain.


Update:

It turns out that she didn’t like me at all, one of my friends told me that she was talking shit about my speech and about how she was on the verge of laughing every time she saw my hairline. He also told me about how she got passed around like a blunt a few weeks ago.

They all started after a traumatic event which was caused my by “family”. You know that “light at the end of the tunnel “ bs? Well, I’ve never had that. My thing has been ongoing for so many years at some point I lost hope. 

Well, a few weeks ago I learned I could (and did) enlist in the usmc which would mean escaping from this toxic environment. For a while after I learned this my insomnia disappeared completely which leads me to believe my insomnia is anxiety related. That anxiety is caused by my parents, remove my parents from the equation and theoretically, my insomnia should go away right?

Self-care and self-interest are not  selfishness. I'm from a Christian upbringing, was taught J-O-Y growing up: Jesus, Others, Yourself, in  that order. Turns out that is not only  stupid but Jesus didn't even teach that anyway. Some Christians I've met seem to  think that basically you should delete yourself, you should lose  yourself completely in service to God and others. Nonsense, and nobody  wants that anyway. For example, if you get involved in a relationship  where you know the other person isn't really interested in you, but is  just there because they're putting you before themselves, to serve ""the  greater good"" or whatever... that's a crappy relationship, because what  you want is to be wanted.

We’ve had this assignment for let’s say 2 weeks, she even moved the date a few days farther for the class, so i have extra time. About a week before the due date i let her know i was struggling with finding sources, etc and she helps and says i should have enough time to get the assignment done and make the changes i need. However, fast forward two days later, I’m probably the worst i’ve ever been mentally. I’m not clinically depressed (haven’t seen a doctor) but i’ve been struggling with some depressive thoughts at times (but nothing too serious) and i deal with social anxiety. But for two days straight i’m feeling nothing like i actually didn’t care...about anything...which was scary because it felt like i felt nothing. I didn’t care about my assignments, myself, just felt nothing. I even considered some...darker thoughts that made me realize i need some time to focus on myself. Spent two days doing no homework and just kind of drew and listened to whatever i wanted. This calmed me, but it also occurred to me this might be due to my birth control, i’ve never felt depressed this way before and it felt like it came out of nowhere so i went off the birth control and i’m feeling a bit better. But i’ve spent  the past two days not working on the assignment still and just watching shows i think either out of laziness or because i’m subconsciously scared of going into that mental state again. 

ANYWAY, this is all just a long way of me saying it’s 3am, i have this paper due tomorrow.

Fred and I met 8 years ago he was an Iraq war veteran with PTSD issues that basically had a mental break down, got fired from his job, evicted from his apartment. Naturally he was also an alcoholic which only made problems worse. He ended up sleeping on a mutual friend of ours couch. But after the 3rd day his wife had enough. I was asked if Fred could sleep on my couch, I was recently divorced and pretty busy but didn't see why not.

About a week into Fred stay with me we had a heart to heart. Long story short Fred is ticked off at society, thinks the world is unfair and doesn't wanna partake in the rat race. So we came to a deal, I'd give him a monthly allowance for spending money and let him live rent free in my house. In return he would do all the chores in the house, cook, clean, shop, run errands, whatever if it has to do with maintaining the household, that was Freds job.

Freds a great cook and pretty handy with a hammer. He's remodeled our Kitchen, both bathrooms, re-landscaped the yard, built a pond, and basically ensures I don't have to do shit when I get home. And its nice, and Fred doesn't mind it because I make a good living and give him what he wants.

42,"Just had a conversation with a truck driver that shocked me quite a bit.

The guy said that he drives for a trucking company, and first day on the job the owner specifically instilled in his employees: if they ever hit someone on the road, always reverse over them to make sure it's a clean kill. Do not leave the victim 'merely' injured.

This is out of financial necessity. There have been many cases where the victims end up in a vegetable state, and the trucker and the company have to pay a monthly hospital bill and monthly lost labour compensation to the family of the victim. This goes on until the person finally dies. Many truckers end up bankrupt, their family in financial ruin, and they have to slave away at their job just to pay the compensation. 

If the victim dies though, it becomes vehicular manslaughter. The driver and the company pays an one-time fine and that is it.

Apparently this is standard practice in every trucking company. Every truck now is equipped with dash cams, but even if it is 100% the victim's fault, the trucker still has to pay. 

The whole situation just saddens me. The drivers are not monsters; they are simply looking out for themselves. Insurance in our country is a joke. It does nothing, except that it is mandatory so you have to buy it to avoid being fined. The health care system is purely based on money. Everybody loses in the end except for the traffic policemen who make money from accidents.",08Oct2018,1

“an idea,” she’s treading carefully, looking at feelings happening back then, conjuring those things she struggled to be in her daily life, “an idea i had about myself, it was murky, superficial, with its roots in the length of my hair, the shape of my nose, even, i think, the spread of my toes,” her hands are animated, waving adlib, “in a word..vanity..brought me here, where the display you make has a value, a price, and you can trade who you are for an..identity or privilege or any..social vice,” her cheeks flush with the memory of what she exchanged.

“an idea..of beauty,” she stares at the tip of my cigarette, “that..beauty..can be caught, packaged ..sold or bought,” she shakes her head at my offer, “but that’s not..Beauty, with a capital ‘B,’ Beauty that’s naked, unblemished, unseen..”

in a flash of comprehension, it’s there, beneath her skin, a shape like the sky or infinite wisdom.

48,"**I'm 22.** My Fiancé is 2 weeks older. We will marry next April.

&gt; Nope, way too early! You're a kid
Well, yeah, I am quite young. Actually about 5 - 10 years under [what is normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_age_at_first_marriage#Americas). But let me tell you more about me:

&gt;!I'm virgin and never been drunk, high or stoned, nothing!&lt;
&gt; You ARE a kid!
Alright, if you think I'm crazy, abnormal or just weird: Sorry for wasting your time. Keep scrolling!
If not: Thanks for givin' me a chance.
Because I didn't end up here accidentally. Not at all. I could have done everything *normal kids* and *most of my friends do*. No-one putted pressure on me. There isn't any kind of sect or cult I secretly take part in. It was my very own decision to live the life that brought me here. And as it went so far, I'm definitely not too young.

&gt; You should enjoy your life, make your own experiences and travel the world!
Absolutely, I should! And I did. More than all of my *normal friends* together.
I am only 22, but I
* lived in 4 different countries
* travelled 14
* 've seen a birth
* 've seen a miscarriage
* was leading for 6 different groups
* learned 5 languages
* hiked the alps, drakensberge and carpathian
* drove 93 different cars
* worked in 4 different sectors
* can play piano, drums, guitar, bass (at on-stage level) (...and ukulele)
* learned coding in one year
* coded 3 10k+ users websites
...and had one girlfriend.

No, I am not narcissistic (imagine the huge list of struggles...) but yes, I used opportunities. Except those, which would waste my time. And don't get me wrong. I like alcohol. There is no week without a huge glass of Beer or *Cabernet Sauvignon*. But getting drunk and losing control sounds pointless to me. Also girls, I like women. And oh, I('d) like sex (afaik). But tindering for an ONS or changing girlfriends faster than I can change my underwear just sounds weird to me. Okay, at this point I might the one being weird. Nowadays I guess a relationship is valued more like a bonus, nice to have. But what its really about is stimulation. And I don't want to agree with it. I need relationship, intimacy. And I need to be 110% sure, before I offer my deepest vulnerability to someone. This is why I engaged to my Lady before sleeping with her. And guess what: She isn't upset. Not at all. She is rather very sure, that I'm serious about her. And that's what I miss so much in our generation.

&gt; Kids today think they can do whatever they want.
Not quite my point. I'm proud of everything we can do and the freedom we have. The huge range of possibilities was always a big plus in my life. And *to do whatever you want* is one of the most important steps in developing a solid personality. But I really don't like, how no-one is giving a shi't about anything. That draws me crazy. Our definition of *being an adult* is more like of list of things you should do when you don't care. But there is nothing honourable about getting drunk. Every 14 years old can get a faked ID card and buy hard stuff. Same with weed. But still, rather than discussing about real issues, we keep getting drunk. The good thing about forgetting oneself is that we don't have to care about me or you or someone or something. You don't have to be serious about anything. And we can keep it 'til we wake up someday and realise, that we've been drunk a whole decade, or two. Or that we are about losing our jobs. Or about getting a child. That's why there are so many stories and videos, in which (honestly nice) folks start over and stop drinking milk, watching p'rn or getting drunk, but getting up every day at 5.30am. Congrats! Seriously! But why do we have to wait until we're smelling the 30s? Why don't we get our stuff together when we're supposed to? Wouldn't we be ready for serious things way earlier? Ready for making life-long decisions? Ready for getting married?

&gt; You sound like a boring, old d'ckhead!
Okay, thanks anyway for paying attention. But let me conclude with one last thing: I really don't feel like I missed my youth or could have experienced soo much more. Everything I wanted to do before becoming an all-day-married-tax-paying-worker, I did. And everything I wanted to try, I tried. Skipping the things, which would rather hurt than help me, I am done with my youth-bucket-list by 22. I'm not afraid of losing opportunities. Serious, I can't wait for being a normal and married guy.

49,"Rethink how you see the world.

If you believe the world as it is taught to you outside of the Bible, then you should know this:

1. If you are in Patagonia, the opposite side of the earth to you is in north-east China.
2. If you are standing up in Patagonia, then below your feet are people standing up in China.
3. So this photo would be true to you - [https://imgur.com/a/AXO54Xv](https://imgur.com/a/AXO54Xv)

However, the Bible says - Proverbs 15:24 - The way of life *is* above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.

What's beneath your feet is hell, not Chinese people.

What's beneath your feet is hell.

So for some reason you believe this next number:

4. If you are in Patagonia and talk to someone in China, you are having a conversation with a person that is upside down.

Psalm 19:4-6  In them hath God set a tabernacle for **the sun**,  Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a  strong man to run a race. His  going forth is from the end of the  heaven, and his circuit unto the  ends of it: and **there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.**

So  another thing not understood by this world is that nothing in the  universe is cold. Everything is exposed to the heat of the sun.  Everything gets exposed to the sun and gets hot. Instead of taking the  Bible and God's view of the world, you are taking the words of humans  who set up public schools. They have decided in most countries on earth,  it is not allowed to teach the Bible in public schools. Instead the  Bible is kept out of your life, and you think the universe is infinite  and cold. You do not realize that the universe is small and kept warm by  our sun.

Now you think we live on a  sphere with a bunch of upside down people having conversations with one  another. You think this way because you are being told for over a decade  throughout school information that is against the Bible. It's not hard  to understand the reason why the Bible is kept out of your life is  because of Daniel 4:17 -  This matter is by the  decree of the watchers,  and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to  the intent that the  living may know that the most High ruleth in the  kingdom of men, and  giveth it to whomsoever he will, and **setteth up over it the basest of men**.

Basest  means most evil, most disgusting, most wicked. These people are  directly related to what information gets taught in school.

The  most disgusting people on earth, your leaders, have you left (at the  end of the world) thinking the universe is cold, and thinking the world  is a sphere. It makes you ignore Isaiah 66:1 -  Thus saith the LORD, The  heaven *is* my throne, and **the earth** ***is*** **my footstool.**

I've never heard in my entire life about a King that uses a sphere as his footstool. Seems kind of wrong doesn't it?

Proverbs 15:24 - The way of life *is* above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.

59,"Mr. Capybara lived with Mr. Moose for 6 months, in Moose’s place. Moose lives in Sorryland. Capybara is from a different country, Beachland, and they’re best friends. Moose supported Capybara financially for a while. Moose paid for rent, utility bills, and some other things like gas and furniture for Capybara’s bedroom.

Capybara promised to pay it all back, even rent. Moose never totally agreed with it.
 
Now, Capybara moved out and wants to pay his debt with Moose. Moose refuses to accept the amount referring to the rent portion.

Since Capybara is from a different country, there is an exchange rate to be dealt with. They never really discussed how that would be handled.

Now, they’ve been arguing for more than two hours about it and decided that Reddit can probably sort this out.

&amp;nbsp;

**Capybara’s arguments:**

&gt; “It was on my requirements to move in with Moose (which he really never agreed on) and I just think that also paying rent is the right thing to do. It’s fair, even though I understand that the rent would be the same amount for him. Moose have always helped me with a lot of stuff through all my life, which makes me feel like I’m taking advantage of him, making this current situation tougher for me.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I’m living in another country, in Swampland, and since Moose insists on refusing the rent payment, I proposed to use a share of the debt to pay for his airplane tickets to come visit me in the future. I also proposed to use the exchange rate from the period that I lived with him, which would make a good impact and, in a way, he would be helping me again.
&gt; 
&gt; I cannot shake the feeling that I was getting in the way of Moose’s everyday life. Don’t take that the wrong way. It was not because of him make me feel that way. It’s just the feeling of really bothering someone of doing the things that they wanna do. Like watching TV, having lunch or going to the movies.
&gt; 
&gt; Moose is an awesome person and I hope he comes to visit me soon. Or even, maybe, live nearby.”

&amp;nbsp;

**Moose’s arguments:**

&gt; “If Cabybara wants to pay me back, I don’t think it should be anything other than what I spent extra because of him staying in my place. My rent or internet bill didn’t go up because of him, and I already agreed on him paying for his share of gas and electricity. Not only that, rent would be the bulk of his “debt” and I don’t think it’s fair. 
&gt; 
&gt; Also, in my mind he was a guest, not a roommate. And it’s not like he was a burden. We had tons of fun and I already miss him staying here.
&gt; 
&gt; He mentioned something about exchange rates, but I don’t quite understand the logic and prefer to be paid in my local currency.“

70,"So, I’m 22 and I’m in week 2 of a one month intensive CELTA course (a Cambridge-certified English teaching course), and I just got some feedback on an assignment where my tutor has marked my potential learner pronunciation error as incorrect (pronouncing “look” as /luk/). I asked her about it and she said I should have used /uː/, not /u/ because the latter “doesn’t exist,” she says, gesturing at the PARTIAL phonetic transcript guide they have on the wall in all the classrooms at the school which features /uː/ but not /u/.

Now, at university, I decided I didn’t want to study phonetics and phonology in depth and I ditched it in favour of syntax, morphology, and other areas, but I have a joint honours degree in linguistics and Spanish, so I think I have a fairly good idea about the use of the IPA (international phonetic alphabet). I asked her “but wouldn’t you find that on a broader phonemic chart?” (knowing very well that you would find it on an IPA chart because it’s one of what are called ‘cardinal vowels’. She didn’t really have a proper answer to my question. But it was clear that she wasn’t well-informed enough to know that the characters on the walls did not represent the entirety of phonetic transcript and that what she was referring to is the extended form of the vowel (think “loot” (/lut/) vs “lose” (/luːz/).

In the end, neither of us were too happy after I essentially said words to the effect of “well whatever, if you want me to use that before you’ll mark it correctly, I’ll use that.” It just pissed me off so much knowing that I was being penalised due to my tutor’s lack of knowledge.",08Oct2018,1

When I try really hard to do that I always fall back and the worst thing is that he just doesnt want to go by himself. He always brushes or laughs it off!


Last two years were really depressing with him. First year was specially hard for me because then I just came out from high school and while the 1st semester I was getting used to my studys, I had my college fantasys broken by my father who made me feel just like at home. Only thing different is the city, gosh dang it. New college year has started and already it makes me get a job that would be just enough to pay the rent somewhere out and maybe I could cram it in my schedule. I am really just getting massive disrespect living with him, I cannot be me when all he gives me is the mornings till I go to college and maybe max 1 hour when he is off running in the afternoon. I guess I can't make him do anything, I can't change a guy, can't make him give me the car and he knows this. People can use you if they see they can. I made a promise if I ever have kids to let them live alone, respect college time as holy, because maybe it wasn't the best time of my life due to my dad, but I know I had high hopes and I'll make extra sure to not make this same mistake my dad is making. Had to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading.

Tl;dr My dad wont leave me alone while in college because he thinks its fine for him to stay and that mostly me and my mom are being rude(?) for asking him to travel home. Mom sees him only on weekends. He used to travel daily. College time is supposed to be student time. When I return tired from college to this thought, then I really want to avoid coming home.",08Oct2018,1
73,How do i stop this madness? How do i fix approval seeking affection/attention from other people? So people will finally value me and i dont feel invisible..   I have tried to be genunily interested in others. Ask open minded questions..  I have learnt to say no to people. And i have stopped fapping for 4 days and i deleted all my social medias.  And focusing on getting better at soccer with school..  Sometimes i get stubborn and bitter about advice you guys give me. I should take advice.. i admit im wrong.. the reason i cant talk or have social skills is because i care to much what others think i have forgot my own opinions when i ask them questions.. i want to improve my self. Yes finally im not stubborn to ignore all advice.. i want to stop being the nice guy people pleaser. I try my most to fit in. How others treat me is the way i decide whats my value..when i see others having banter or something between them i get jealous.. and beat my self up..  . It makes me frustrated.. tired of always chasing chasing.. i dont want to live my whole fucking life living for people.. i want to be smart and a genius.. i wish i was like tesla or some other scientist.. i know i have gotten good advice i have gone through everyone of them twice or more and i read them. Im forcing my self to much and trying to be someone im not but honestly i dont know who i want to be or who should i want to be...,08Oct2018,1

76,"I've met someone at uni who I really really get on with, she introduced me to one of her close friends from home and I proceeded to get absolutely shitfaced without realising and behaving like a bullish, arrogant, unhinged loser. Apparently I tried to start a (verbal, not physical) fight with someone in a bar and stormed off home when no one took my side. I've apologised profusely to her and said I don't know what happened and it won't happen again, and she laughed and said it was fine but that her friend doesnt like me now. I have no idea how to make this better. Because she's a new friend, I feel like she's just forgiving me to pity me and actually thinks that's the person I am all of the time. I have no idea what happened or why I behaved like that, I'm usually not an aggressive drunk at all. I just feel lame and upset- she was my closest friend at uni and I've made a terrible impression. What should I do? (Besides, obviously, refrain from ever getting that hideously drunk again). Thank you :(",08Oct2018,1

So,  I went to this massage place a few miles from my house last year where I  found it through an online search. Prices seemed great, $45 for 30mins,  $60 for an hour, and $90 for 90. They offer different types of massage  on their signage too. I’ve gone to it at least three times since. It has  listings on yelp etc. It has pretty good reviews.

When  I first went to the place it just made me wonder about it just because  of the feeling when I went there. It’s definitely run by chinese as the  lady or two that work there are. It’s in a professional office building  complex, such the type that look like townhouses with two floors, with 5  or 6 seperate buildings. Initially it was on the second floor and you  had to go up this long undecorated hallway to get up to it. The place is  bare bones, there are licenses on the wall, but its very quiet. I don’t  know maybe they are still a new but a few years doesn’t seem that  young. Maybe its just the fact that its chinese and the places I hear  about are all asian that I’m stereotyping. Anyways, the first time I  went in it JUST seemed like a place that could possibly give happy  endings. The room lighting is very dim and the windows are blacked out,  just seemed bare bones. Again, maybe its just run by foreigners who are  just trying to make it. I did my first massage, if I remember correctly  with my underwear on. It was actually really good. Nothing funny  happened. I went again at the beginning of this year I went again, this  time got fully undressed, and it was a great massage but I don’t know it  just seems like its possible that this place might give a HJ lol. It’s  hours are 10 -930pm through saturday.

This  is where it gets somewhat interesting. Last month I called up for an  appointment. Mind you every time I call it seems like the call is going  to a personal phone rather than a phone in the unit. I setup a 630pm  appt or something and when I got there I walked in and there was no one  at the desk. I sat down on the couch and a massuese came out and asked  if I had an appointment and I said yeah at 630 and she didn’t speak  english very well but she basically said the person was going to be  another thirty minutes. I was somewhat frustrated but accommodating as I  had a little time to spare, I had been there before, and somewhat  intrigued. So I waited 30 mins and I was thinking I cant stand for this  so when she came out I said I wanted an hour but I couldn’t wait since I  had to be somewhere later. Long story short she couldn’t speak very  well so she busted out her phone so we could phone translate. I set up  an appointment for the next day.

Next day  rolls around I get in and she is there waiting for me. I ask for the  hour and she leads me to the room and I get undressed. She apologized  for the other day saying the other client was late in arriving so it  went over time. I was totally cool with that. We do the massage as  normal, its great, but this was kind of new when she went for the legs  she pulled the drape right up to the bottom of my butt. I felt exposed  as she spread my legs a bit to massage up the back of my thighs. It was  kind of exhilarating I might admit haha. I had NEVER had that happen in  any of the massages I’ve done. I kept thinking theres no WAY she doesn’t  see my nether regions that way. She finishes that area with nothing  else weird and finishes the massage regularly, I flip over , I try to  not be hard haha. Again, great massage.

A  few days ago, I went in again for an hour massage but they had moved  downstairs. They now had an open front window and inside was a big sign  that said massage with christmas lights and there was a blinking sign in  the window. The same masseuse was there and I think she recognized me.  It always intrigues me because I feel like I can call up and sched most  any time. I get in and do the same thing, get undressed, under the  drape. The window is completely blacked out with a stapled cloth to  cover the window. We get to the lower back again and legs, this time she  pulls the drape completely off my butt and I’m exposed again. And her  hands go a little higher up the back of my thighs this time, I swear she  might have rubbed a knuckle on part of me. I’m still surprised. I don’t  remember exactly when , but I ended up asking about pricing for the  length of massage, at some point in the session and I said something  like I think I’m interested in doing the 90 minutes that session. I  don’t think she completely understood my question but she was like ‘ohh  90 minute? hmm…” and then she mumbled what sounded like a question,  which sounded like “are you married?” I was like ‘huh’ to repeat and she  didn’t ask again because I was like “if its ok to do 90 mins if not its  ok” anyways I think we were both confused. However, I could have sworn  she asked if I was married, which Im not. This time, when I flipped  over, she draped as normal but when she went to do my head massage, she  sat behind my head, she massaged a bit of my pecs, went down my stomach,  and then started massaging around my pelvic area, inner thigh, upper  pelvis, again no touching of my junk. I don’t remember that happening  last time though. Massage ends as normal.

When  I get out another lady, I’m assuming the manager, is out there doing  some paper work and I’m assuming closing out for the night as its  getting close to closing. I pay credit but my first card doesnt go  through as my chip sometimes doesnt work and I go to a second card. As  I’m flipping through my cards, I mention I have some cash but not enough  to cover and the manager seems very interested in the fact I have cash,  “Oh you have cash!?” Again I mention, I dont have enough just for tip. I  said I’d return next time and get the 90 mins with cash and she said  yeah 90 minutes is better.

Now, am I going  crazy? The massage is really good. I’ve been checking online to see if  anything is fishy with the place but so far everything seems legit. The  only thing I did notice, and a website I read said to look out for this,  is that it has quite a few negative reviews from women. I don’t think  I’ve seen a negative review from a guy yet. Just interesting  coincidences or not? There are a few other massage places, I’m assuming  asian, in a few of the other buildings in the complex. When I walked out  I noticed at least one had its lights still on after 930. Hmmmm..

A few months ago 7+ I started drinking a lot of water. I was doing about 2.5-3 gallons a day. I was constantly peeing and it was majorly inconvenient so I tried to stop. After a while I finally managed to stop but I didn’t really stop while I was at the gym. 

Like I go to the gym for 1 hour and by the time I’m done I refilled my bottle (normal sized bottle 17oz) 3-5x. By the time I get home I’m like a river that won’t stop flowing. I’ll be peeing when I get home then 10 min aafter I’ll pee again and rinse and repeat 3x

I used to teach kids, I liked it, but I was told I am not a good teacher either, and was basically let go.
