2,"**tl;dr: I’m bad socially but not entirely useless and I don’t know why**


I’m new to this subreddit so apologies if I’m breaking any rules.

Could somebody point me in the direction of some good reads or help me as to why I just seem unable to form a relationship (not just romantically). Im like a slightly more outgoing sheldon (I can manage socially but wouldn’t want to manage people if that makes sense).

Romantically/sexually specifically;My friends constantly tell me “man what are you doing, that girl liked you and you let her get away”. I get why they are saying that but it’s like social cues* have a 2 hour delay for me.

Sorry for the post, I’m kinda drunk and just venting. I posted this earlier to /r/relationships but was apparently the wrong sub which is fair enough",08Mar2018,2

8,"I haven't found a religion in which the worshippers *pity* their deities, and that's the worshippers' main connection to divinity and their main affect toward deities in terms of things like motivation and morality, but it's the religion that would make the most sense to me.

Deities can't die. They know everything and can do absolutely anything. After a few trillion years of that their existences would become unendurable torment. Think about it. So feeling sorry for them is only just and right, and so is basing our relationship to them and founding our moral system on that feeling. (All moral systems are just ways to control people through their emotions, anyway.)

So how about it? Anyone want to join me in starting this new religion?",08Mar2018,0

10,"I don't know if I'm naturally screwed up or if my parents read the wrong section of the hypothetical parenting manual. Normal people of reddit, are these normal:

Kid (elementary school age) is upset/crying. Parents ignore the kid or tell the kid to get over it and become progressively more pissed off if the kid doesn't stop being upset soon enough.

Kid talks about having symptoms of a medical problem. Parents ignore the kid repeatedly until the problem gets too severe to ignore. Then the parents blame the kid for not bringing it up earlier.

Kid does well at something; parents say nothing and pretend like it didn't happen. Kid does poorly at something; parents go on a rant calling the kid incompetent.

Kid wants friends; parents don't want the kid to make friends. Kid has shitty social skills; parents get pissed off at the kid for having shitty social skills.

Kid expresses hopes for ""when I grow up I want to _________"". Parent tells the kid to stop daydreaming because it'll never happen.

15,"My childhood friend and I's age is 4 years apart. We began being friends when we was about 6 and I was 10 maybe a little earlier than that. I have this sick feeling that I may have groomed him. Does anyone know what it actually means to groom someone? I don't really remember although I have this faint still memory of him being in front of me and me kissing him. But in my memory its a joke. Like I didn't mean anything serious or sexual about it. I'm not even sure if it was even a kiss, it could've been left and right air kisses. I remember a girl in school doing that to me many times in my first years of school and I'm sure I did it as a joke.

I also have a memory of me asking him what's wrong a few years ago and him saying ""you groomed me"" followed by ""i'm just joking"". I joked around with a couple of friends before and told them they groomed me when they didn't I was just pissed off at them.

I still need answers though, I can't be thinking that I may have. I was controlling in many ways when we hung out and played made up games and I was often always the one to give advice and I played the role of being the mature one due to the age Gap and felt that I influenced him a lot. A lot of my influencing was predicated on me not wanting him to be bullied in school because I used to get teased and picked on by a few boys during those first few years at school and continued to be paranoid and picked on throughout secondary school as well. I have a lot of paranoia at the moment but I can't cope with this fear that I may have. I honestly didn't feel like I was, my childhood is barely rememberable let alone my teen years, its all just one big anxious depressed and paranoid blur. I always looked at the ground in school simply afraid of being beaten up. Please help, my mind's in torment",08Mar2018,1

21,"And another thank you to the 911 operator that answered my call. I got molested today in broad daylight-- on a Wednesday at 3:30PM and two blocks away from where I live.

While it happened, I screamed and tried pushing him away from me. After what happened happened, he ran away and disappeared around the corner, where this one lady was coming from. I don't quite remember what was going on in my mind, but when I saw her I asked her if she saw where the guy went and if she recognized the person. 

She stayed with me while I waited for the police to come. They couldn't find him, but they filed a report and gave me a pamphlet with information about my legal rights after being sexually abused along with my case order. They sent another police officer over to try and see if we could get his DNA off of my cheek and lips.

It was shameful. Embarrassing. And I heard footsteps behind me for a couple of blocks, but I thought we were going the same way... A block before, there were tons of people and even kids playing outside. I feel like I could have prevented it somehow, maybe by turning around when more people were in the area. I don't know.

24,"Hi,

I'm an occupational therapy student who will be placed in a spinal injuries unit soon,

I don't have a lot of experience of working with people who use wheelchairs, which I expect a lot of the patients will be so I'd like to hear from those of you who use chairs so that I can make people feel comfortable, avoid faux pas etc 

I've done some reading on etiquette and understand the basics of treating the chair as the person's personal space, offering help (and saying ""do you want me to get that?"" vs ""do you need help?"") rather than grabbing doors or pushing people without asking and finding somewhere to sit if conversations will be more than a minute or two, not being weird about language like ""let's go for a walk""

Is there anything else you'd like a trainee medical professional to know? Anything I may not have considered?

Thanks in advance

29,"Hi there! My name is Lauren and I'm a Certified Personal Trainer and Fitness Nutrition Specialist. I'm also a lifelong dancer, who competed and taught Ballroom Latin and Smooth for almost a decade! I have past experience as a short film model, I still teach dance, all while focusing on my personal training and bodybuilding, and because of both of these life passions I have been able to build a wonderful cliental, making each ""work,"" day a blast. Last year I decided to jump onto Instagram and expand my social outreach through its platform. After gaining a number of followers, I was surprised to be contacted by Logan Garments for their sponsorship program. After checking out their company I was surprised to see the quality of their clothing, cool designs, and a wide range of styles to choose from that fits different aspects of active lifestyles. Logan Garments clothing stood out from the rest for sure! I'll be honest as say I was curious to try them out and decided to give it a go! Logan Garments Sponsorship Program required me to order a starter package of my choice. (For this I chose leggings, and a tank that I could use in my training field) and then submit photos wearing them, or even better a video showcasing my talents. Since its a concern of privacy recording me training cliental, or teaching my dance class, I decided to have a photo shoot done while wearing the Logan Garments clothing. I did so, and submitted a single photo to Logan Garments representative. Within minutes my photo was on their Instagram page and it received an outstanding number of ""likes."" Since that day, I have placed two more orders, both of which, once order was placed came in a very timely manner. Upon the last order I had another photo shoot done and again submitted photos to Logan's representative and -again- three of my photos (one just being a headshot) was used.
What I have experienced from Logan Garments Company is first and foremost, a complete connection to its people and a wonderful sense of community. Not only have a connected with some outstanding and talented people, but I have connected with a group of supporting members. I also have received some awesome clothing, and have been able to showcase my talents in them! I look forward to working more with the company, and staying connected to its beautifully talented people! Follow the journey @laurenfarrfitness on Instagram",08Mar2018,0

31,"In exams with multiple choice questions, the exam taker should lose for example 1/3 of a point for a mistaken answer if the question had 4 choices, and 1/4 of a point for a questions with 5 choices, with winning 1 point for a true answer, to make the exam fair and make exam takers not choose an arbitrary random number for a question they didn't read or have no idea about, if they have a small idea about the question and the answers, then they should choose an answer by their brain, and not randomly if they have no idea what the question is about.

In the current way, let's say an exam has questions that for each question there are 4 choices, and there are 20 questions, this way for those who could read only 19 questions, 1/4 of them will have the  20th question right for free, and the same about 2 questions left or 3 questions left or 4 or 5, statistics and probabilities become numbers on a big number of exam takers, and the exam is unfair to some people.

Also, a bigger number of choices for each question reduces the luck factor in it.

So im in this club at school where we sell cookies. So durring lunch im here cooking cookies with this younger girl (we’ll call her A) whos p lax around me and looks to me as i see it, as a respectable older peer. So we have this other girl in here (she will be SS) who i dont know too well but i do know shes my age and highly mature. Ive been cooking cookies longer than both of them BTW.
So shes in here showing A how to properly put the cookies on the pan, what time to leave em in ect. So i notice as we are putting the cookies in the oven i notice SS wants things to go very fast, wants everything spotlight perfect and there must be no mistakes also shes kinda grumpy. 

I notice shes putting alot of pressure on A. A doesnt say anything about it to her though. 
So i start taking the cookies out and i get the mitt to grab the cookie tray and she starts saying “look, this is how you do it. Grab the tray this way, no like this.” I grab the tray and this doesnt satisfy her so she points at one specific area and goes “no like this. You know how to hold a pan right?” And me having SA and never talking to anyone and never getting into ‘confrontational situaions’ with anyone i was taken aback and did not respond to her comment. (But yes i did brush it off) But its made clear to me that shes having a bad day. 

When SS finally leaves the cooking area A tells me shes stressed out because of all the stress SS was putting on her. I tell her not to worry about it. So as time goes on and SS comes back and shes giving more tips to A on cooking, i say outloud “we have a cookie master in here” just to test to see what SS would say in response. If she smiled i would know she ment no harm but she diddnt. She kept silent and turned her back to me and i got the memo that yes she is in fact having a bad day. 

Now im in another class annnd fuck. Im rethinking the whole situation. I shouldve told SS to stop because she was stressing A out and putting that negative energy on us. And looking back at the cookie monster shit just sounds so retarded...

Quantum mechanics. It is 'awareness' or 'consciousness' itself.

Without something that is aware to witness something, do things happen? Maybe? Does it matter? Maybe? We don't know - we will _never_ know itself in it's true face value. ""We"" as in living concious creatures of three dimensions, with something most would consider a ""soul"".
