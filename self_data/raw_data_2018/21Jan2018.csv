1,"It wasn't really out-of-the-blue or a way to get me to back off since I admittedly was doing some prodding. I was asking her about a guy who I thought might be her boyfriend because she doesn't post on social media much for me to know about him and she told me. Part of me just wants to detach completely from her, meaning un-connect with her on all social networks but that seems a bit too harsh. I just want it to stop bothering me. I was never interested in dating but when I met her there was something about her that really made me like her. Just like ""see if it works out with her and if it doesn't, keep being single"" sort of thing. But I never had a plan of what to do to deal with my feelings if it didn't work out with her.

2,"I got married two years ago, while my husband was still in grad school. We didn't have a honeymoon. We planned to go to Italy for a week trip a few months after we married, but we moved cross country and didn't exactly have time or vacation days at our new jobs. 

  

We've been talking out kids this year. We already knew we both wanted kids, and we knew it would be at least 2 years after we got married because of him finishing grad school and the possibility of moving. But it's become a rough plan for the end of this summer. I've been reading books on pregnancy and parenting, looking at names and nurseries, and reading forums for pregnant women and parents with young kids. I'm not obsessing over it, but I am definitely on Pinterest binge. 

  

He surprised me last month with a honeymoon. 2 weeks at a resort in Mexico, with ruins visits and scuba trips scheduled for the end of May. Except the Zika virus is still very much a thing there. I found out while looking at any recommended travel vaccines that after exposure to a Zika threat area, women are advised to avoid pregnancy and unprotected sex for 2 months. For men, 6 months. 

  

Now our rough timeline has moved from July to December. And that's not a lot of time and I feel awful for feeling bad about it. I know that even if we started trying in July it could be months before we had a pregnancy, so I realize how fucking stupid I'm being. But it feels like, even though it wasn't a thing yet, I've lost it. It was a possibility this year and now it's not something that we'll have this year. And it's not even like I can really talk to my friends or family about it. 

  

Oh hey I lost my hypothetical future pregnancy.   



I feel awful about this. Out of my two closest friends, one has struggled with infertility for 5 years, and the other had a pregnancy in high school she wasn't excited about, but was pressured into continuing. She got a permanent birth control solution after her baby was born, but it failed and she's just had another. She does love her kids, but it's not exactly the life she wanted. My sister will probably never be able to carry a child. My feelings of upset are so fucking minuscule and petty compared to them, and I'd feel like dirt if I told them that my husband and I have to wait an extra 6 months to start trying to concieve.",21Jan2018,1
3,"I'm currently in 11th grade and have a decent amount of friends but I have been told that after high school, it is difficult to make friends, and it worries me. I love friends.

5,"First off: you had about 50 items (basically, an entire 3-4 bags of groceries) in the 15 item checkout lane. About 10-12 of us patiently waited (and annoyed - everyone was grumbling about you), **but nobody said a word**. All of us had 2-3 items at most (I had hot food &amp; a cold drink).

Then, you had an issue with one of your items pricing after you got your receipt : **GO TO CUSTOMER SERVICE**, not make the checker have to call in your item &amp; make us all wait.

So I said something to you &amp; you rolled your eyes at me (but, could not look me in the eye). Stop being selfish, stop being condescending, and for fucks sake, just get in order like the rest of us do.

I said ""fuck this"", and left to the balcony, ate, and then went back down to pay for my meal / drink. I apologized to the checkout guy and he said ""thanks for the apology, but no, that guy was in the wrong, but I can't say anything due to store policy.""

9,"My whole life has been so easy. I had friends since I was little that were always there for me. My parents provided me with everything I needed. They were supportive, pushed me to do my best and always showed me so much love. 

I decided to ""break away"" from my old life when deciding to go to college. I made the decision to move 10 hours away and basically start over. I had no idea how hard it would be. 

My whole life I thought I was an independent person, but I guess I'm not. I've made a few acquaintances, but no real friends. I get left behind by the ""friends"" I thought I have. I stay home many nights and just cry. 

My school's counseling services wouldn't even see me because I didn't have a troubled life. I understand that many people have it worse than me, but the fact that even paid professionals didn't want to listen to me only made me feel worse. 

I've joined clubs, initiate hanging out with people and just try my overall best to meet people. But every time I end up with a new acquaintance that already has a set group of friends. I'm so lonely. All my friends from home tell me how much they love college. I'm too scared to tell them I don't. 

I don't want to take the easy way out and transfer. But I really don't know if I can stay here. Literally nobody here would even notice if I dropped off the face of the earth. I've never felt so worthless and unhappy. ",21Jan2018,1

20,"Hi /r/self, I'm writing partly to you all and part of me wants to just vent because I have no one to talk to. I'm alone in a hotel room in a strange city in a foreign country feeling sick and depressed . 

I have been chatting with a girl online I matched with through Tinder and we were both hitting it off. She lives in the country where I'm at now. It was  a big deal for me because I know from myself I lack social skills and for a girl to like me it made my days so much better. So around new years day I go to see a friend that lives in the same city as her. We agreed to meet up at least once and ended up meeting every day I was there. First date was terrible because I was horribly nervous but she said I was cute and good looking but she was also weirded out by me she said due to me lacking social skills. Second date slightly better and we get to know each other better, third date was the best :) I knew I really liked this girl and she said that she liked me back. She proposed we should date even though we are separated by the distance. Next day I was going back we meet up again and she totally came back on what she said and she needed more time to figure out what she wanted. I was in a foul mood and things got worse from there. Back at home we chatted some more and basically she said she didn't want to see me anymore because we were too different. I got really upset because she changed her mind so suddenly, and some not so mature messages were sent. The reason being she said I 'was not normal' which is kind of true because I'm just me. 

Ultimately after some time we got to talking again and we talked things out. We agreed that I would visit her again this weekend , this time just by myself, and I was ecstatic to see the girl I liked again. I would show her I'm confident, normal nice guy (I know the negative connotation with that word) and just have a nice time so she could decide what to do with me. First date again this Friday was great. We went to a few bars, bit of kissing and I suggested she could stay at my room to just be together. That didn't happen because she wanted to be in her own place. Second day we went hiking in the hills which was okay, and in the night we had a party. She brought a male friend which I was a bit apprehensive about but okay. We talked in private where she said that she was not going to be seeing me again. Of course drunk me took it over the top and left her in a bad way. Cue drunk me in a foreign country feeling like shit alone in a hotel room having suicidal dreams. I couldn't reach my friend that lives here that I wanted to see before I leave today.

Now the girl just messaged me again that she do wants to date me if I can be normal all the time, which I think is doable, and she wants to have coffee in an hour. I agreed but I'm at a loss and have this complete feeling of being alone in the world that I cannot shake off...

21,"I recently discovered (through friends telling me) that i am not the most emotional person. In fact, i was told I really don’t show any at all.

25,"I'll start with the bad news first. For a pretty long time I've been thinking I want a career of physical work. Despite what my parents think, and what society seems to expect, I don't want an office job or some kind of ""intellectual"" career. Those sound so boring. I've been sitting at a desk day in and day out for the past 15 years or so. I don't really like the idea of sitting at a desk for two more years, so I can do more desk sitting, in order to pay off four years of sitting. 

I'd rather do something more physical like driving a truck, fixing bulldozers, cutting down trees, or as I more recently considered, welding. I always avoid telling my dad my plans because it's always the same story ""no, you no wants to do this. Do something easier"". And today he found out my most recent plan and gave me another lecture about how I should do something intellectual. He says welding is dangerous. First of all, I read that it's really not as long as you always follow the safety precautions. Secondly, even if it is, I really don't care anymore. I'd rather do something dangerous that pays well than something safe that will leave me starving for the rest of my life. Let's be real, I'm probably not going to live that long anyway. Do I even want to? I legitimately want to die most of the time already, do I really want another 60 years of this, on top of the trouble of getting old? Not really. One thing's for sure, once I'm done with my aa degree in never stepping foot in a college again unless it's for welding classes. Oh yeah, my local community college has a welding program. It would be absolutely stupid to pass up this opportunity.


Anyway, on to something positive. I asked a girl out for the first time last night and she said yes. At the age of almost 20, I'm hopefully going to go on my first date sometime soon. Maybe it doesn't ""count"" since it was in tinder but who cares? Thank god for tinder, because now dating is so accessible, even to me. The only downside is I'm going to have to explain this to my parents. I think they might think I'm already dating my best friend (who's a lesbian by the way) so it's going to be awkward. But oh well. Maybe 2018 won't be so bad after all. 

And another thing, last semester I finished my American history class with a 100%! I think taking the class with a friend helped because it made studying a lot easier. The homework was all a completion grade so that was easy, but somehow on all the tests and papers I got a perfect score. The only other class I've ever finished with a 100 was drawing. I almost don't believe it. ",21Jan2018,31

Due to the excitement and chronic back pain, which came from over-exercising, I was unable to sleep well. I had asked my parents to buy me sleeping pills, they bought me a Phoenix which was on advertisement and was highly recommended by pharmacist. It had became quite late and I tried out one of the sleeping pills to have a nice sleep.

Once I had taken the pills I slept like an embryo, that was dumped to a trash can wrapped around the black plastic bag. I was so uncomfortable that I woke up in the middle of the night. Opened my eyes slowly due to an overwhelming force that kept my eyes closed.
Only to see a pitch black faced person floating in middle of air right above me, gazing at me fiercely, thinking that this might be my last moments on earth. I tried to yell for my parents at the top of my throat, but it was useless, as I couldn’t raise my voice to that level of the extent to make them hear me, I barely could even breath. I tried to move, but the force kept me from not moving. It was really heavy feeling. Like I was giving my all strength to not die. It was meaningless, I felt like I couldn’t do anything, except to face the fact that this is it. This is how humans brain functions in their last seconds. I embraced myself to it as if I accepted my fate and I am ready to die. So I closed my eyes, hoping to be over with as quickly as possible.

42,"I was just reading this article on deepdot about a longitiudinal operation run by the government accountability office in which they tried to illegally purchase firearms on both the clearnet (or ""surface web"" as the intel agencies refer to it) and dark web. 

http://deepdot35wvmeyd5.onion/2018/01/20/gao-tried-illegally-buy-79-guns-online-failed/

Oddly enough, of 79 attempts apparently only a mere 7 were made on the dark web.

All of the clearnet attempts failed and of the 7 made via TOR only two purchases came to fruition in the form of firearms deliveries made via USPS that were intercepted anyway by the (presumably) unwitting United States Postal Inspection Service. 

What always surprises me about articles like this is the almost sarcastic candor with which  these ""failures"" by government agencies to succesfully commit crimes are addressed. The justificationis usually in line with evidences used in this article: unspecified claims made by Attorney General Jeff Sessions by, or, for instance: similar claims made by former attorney general Loretta Lynch (http://deepdot35wvmeyd5.onion/2016/01/12/do-people-really-buy-weapons-from-dark-web-markets/)

There are a number of things that I think a majority of these sorts of articles/analyses fail to take into account with their poo pooing of such government operations. Notably, that the vast majority of us would prefer illegal weapons not be sold via the dark net markets, so in tandum, would be supportive of government funded research geared to measure the degree at which such illegal sales are made. 


Furthermore, the Government Accountability Offices overwhelming ""failure"" to make such purchases in the majority of instances also begs the question: to what extent is the successful application government countermeasures (USPIC, for instance) responsible for the fact that it is nearly impossible to illegally acquire a firefarm (or illegal firefarm) in the United States through the Dark Web in the first place. 

Articles like this also tend to leave out more objective but relevant issues, in this case for instance:  weapons that are legal to own in the US being shipped from the united states to countries outside the United States. The ramifications for such activities abroad notwithstanding, this also represents a Homeland Security issue, whereas weapons bought in the United States can be funneled to international terrorist organisations that aim to do harm to US Citizens, or international criminal organisations that aim to bring crime into US communities. The historic bungle that was the ATF Gunwalking Scandal comes to mind as such a government operation actually worthy of the aformentioned ""sarcastic candor,"" but also as a quintessential example not only of foreign elements sought to purchase weapons from America(ns), outside of America, for the purpose of expanding criminal enterprises inside of America, but also of the cunningess with which such handoffs can be made. How quickly these weapons can quite literally disappear in to the international abyss.

A search on justice.gov for US residents caught providing material support to terrorist organisations reveals an almost unbelievable number of people caught doing just that in 2017 alone.

All of the people caught doing that makes me think of shit like 9/11. Most people here were probably pretty young when it happened, but I bet you still remember the looming feeling in the months, even years following. Everyone was so sure the next big one was right around the corner. Rumors would spread about proposed attacks. One that comes to mind was that there would be an attack on some mall on Halloween on 2001 fdsafdsafffnjjfjf

So, what happened to the next big one? Well, in the early 2000s the CIA in cooperation with the ARMY launched a widespread internet pornorgraphy campaign featuring women getting fucked in military fatigues. For some reason Al-Qaeda was super into this shit. The CIA allegedly has webcam shots of Osama Bin Laden himself jerking off to this shit. Aside from purportedly attempting to snap pics of Osama beating his terrorist dick off, for years, the CIA had also been engaged in a campaign to poison Bin Laden via dialysis treatment that he received regularly for renal failure .

The thing about the launch of this proposed porn campaign and the timing of these alleged webcam shots is that they conicide directly with news reports from November and December of 2001 that Osama Bin Laden had actually died of renal failure, or lung failure caused by renal complications.

www.nytimes.com/2001/12/26/world/a-nation-challenged-the-pursuit-high-level-murmurings-that-bin-laden-is-dead.html

What you may notice from those NYT and Fox News pieces is that they were published the day after Christmas. 

The hunt for Bin Laden along the Tora Bora district had allgedly gone on for months, but it turns out, Osama wasn't hiding along the Tora Bora district at all. No, you see, the 32 virgins jihad myth was running thin, but these bitches getting fucked in military fatigues (or ""AGGIES"" as the Al-Qaeada members called them, which is the phonetically english pronunciation of the Arabic word for ""logey whores in military fatigues, priase be to Allah"") had actually  inspired a new myth that following a successful jihad, holy warriors would meet not just 32 virgins in nirvana, but 32 logey virgin whores in military fatigues. Or, 32 virgin AGGIES. 

This brought Osama to LaJolla where, donning a masterful disguise, he was able to produce the nastiest AGGIE gangbang movie in military fatigue porn history. Unbeknownst to Osama though, this entire AGGIE fetish was being perpetuated by the CIA from the very beginning, who knew all along from comments Osama had left on internet porn videos in the past, that he planned to travel to LaJolla donning a masterful disguise, to produce the nastiest military fatigue gangbang porno known to man. 

Ass To Mouth AGGIES was a masterful porno, conspiracy theorists hypothesized for years that it had even featured Usama himself. Despite having never been released, and having in fact been classified sometime in December of 2001, around the same time Osama had reoportedly died of renal failure, or lung failure as a result of renal complications. In November of 2001 The Guardian Magazine reported that in July of 2001 Le Figaro,  a French magazine, had reported in July of 2001 that French Intelligence services had asserted that Osama met with the CIA in July 2001. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/01/afghanistan.terrorism

This leaked photo from the French intelligence services has reverberated mostly undetected amongst the deepest crevices of french internet conspiracy forums for years, with many insisting it shows the masterfully disguised but unmistakable likeness of Usama Bin Laden at what would have been the Ass To Mouth AGGIES production launch sometime in July of 2001, in LaJolla  [2nd from the right](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Aggies-CampFallujah_Robert-Gates.JPEG)

The fact of the matter is that the CIA blackmailed Osama with webcam shots of himself jerking off and convinced him to make the ultimate porno that would turn every member of Al-Qaeada presumably gay by showing a bunch of dudes in military fatigues fucking, but promising a girl was on the way, but never actually having a girl show up, forcing the Al-Qaeda members to just nut to dudes fucking eachother. The Al-Qaeada members, widely uninitiated in the ways of internet porn, did not realize that accidentally nutting to a dude just one time doesn't make you gay. Which inadvertently led every member of Al-Qeada to believe that they were now in fact gay infidels. 

This presented a very odd conundrum to the Al-Qaeada , as now, the gift achieved in Nirvana by a gay holy warrior for jihading a gay infidel would be 32 virgin sluts in military fatigues that were also dudes. Essentially, this meant that the ultimate gift achievable in Nirvana for murdering an infidel who desires gay sex with men in miltary fatigues, would be gay sex with men in military fatigues.

Efectively, it was the confusion caused by this phenomenon that led to 9/11 and the ""war on terror."" A fuck up so astronomical, that it actually convinced Congress to permanently replace the office of the (Director of Central Intelligence)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_Central_Intelligence] in 2005 with with the (Director of National Intelligence)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_National_Intelligence]

For all intents and purposes, the position was essentially the same, the Director of National Intelligence would head the intelligence community and the Central Intelligence Agency. 

From a historical standpoint, it was feasible to reign in some fabricated change to seperate the CIA's proverbial era of cocaine smuggling that led to the crack epidemic of the 80s and 90s 

from their present day poppy cultivation and opiate smuggling that has led to the opioid epidemic of the 2000s. 

muddying the waters that connect Director of Central Intelligence officials and Purdue Pharma execs from the 1990s

as well as the military-industrial complex crossroads that those connections inevitably lead to,

43,"I used to fear cheating. I used to think it was so fucked up someone would ruin a relationship for alternate physical affection.

Now I'm quite the opposite. I read stories about angry victims. I see how people react kindly to tales of revenge on a cheating spouse. It makes no sense to me.

All relationships should be physically open. Cheating, like virginity, is a totally made up concept. It isn't real. It's all inside our heads. If your partner loves you, you'll know. It doesn't matter if they fuck other people or if you do too. What matters is your actions toward one another, not your genitalia.

Basing a relationship on possession of each other's junk is, frankly, anachronistic. I don't understand how we've progressed so far socially and yet we still expect relationships to be 100% closed unless otherwise discussed.",21Jan2018,0

47,"I’ve been chewing through this for a while, trying to figure out why I infrequently date and why things go the way they go when I do. 

To readers digest this post, let’s say sexually is on a spectrum. Most people regardless of who they’re attracted to (gay, straight, whatever) know pretty quickly who they want and don’t want. To break it down as I see it, if you put the straightest straight person into a room with other of the same gender, he won’t be sexually attracted to them. Same if you put the gayest gay in with opposite gender folk. That individual may appreciate the physical beauty of the gender they aren’t attracted to, but that gender won’t illicit a sexual response. 

This can be different from behavior. A gay person can choose to try to live as a straight person, have sex with that person, marry, and even hold affection for that person they chose to be with, but they’ll still be gay. A straight person can do the same with gay people, for example many male porn stars are gay for pay, straight but will have gay sex in porn. I’ve known straight people that enjoy the attention of gay people, even experimented, but they’re still straight in that end. Your behavior does not have to reflect your sexual orientation (but it’ll probably make you happier if it does). 

And then there’s libido, which is separate from both your orientation and how you choose to express yourself sexually. Any sexual orientation can have a high or low libido. 

Ok, all that out of the way, I’ll get to my issue. 

Asexuals are also on a spectrum. What you might imagine with that word is someone who is romantic and sexually repulsed, someone who isn’t interested in forming either a sexual or romantic bond. However it can run the gambit. You can be down with the romantic and sex repulsed,  you can be down with physical affection, you can have a high libido even and masturbate. What defines an asexual is: 
&gt; Someone who does not experience sexual attraction.
[FAQ here](http://wiki.asexuality.org/General_FAQ)

Put an asexual in a room with a mess of people and they won’t find anyone attractive sexually. They may have sex to please their partner, or to have children, and they may masturbate for physical release, but they won’t want to have sex like somebody who isn’t asexual. It’s just not a thing they want. 

But that’s not quite me. After chewing on this I believe I fall into more like [Gray-A](http://wiki.asexuality.org/Gray-A/Grey-A) or something closer to [Demisexual](http://wiki.asexuality.org/Demisexual). I provided links if you want to read up, but to TL;DR, Gray As may feel sexual attraction sometimes, rarely, and often the feeling is so low it’s easy to ignore. It’s kind of a catch all term for folks on the asexual spectrum but don’t feel they fit completely. Demisexuals are considered half way between sexual and asexual. Commonly they are described as not having sexual attraction until a bond is formed. So throw a Demi in a room with a mess of people, and if they are strangers the Demi will be as if they are asexual. No attraction to anyone, but if that Demi is thrown into a room of friends or people they know and like, sexual attraction is possible. They have to get to know you to see if they’re attracted to you. Gray As and Demis can be sex repulsed or not. Depends on the individual. 

So all that out of the way… I’m in my 40s. When I hit puberty I didn’t have the same reaction to boys (or girls) that my friends did. In my teens my fro chased boys like a sport, but I never really felt that way. I wanted to. They were having fun, dating, and sex sounded fun the way they told it. It was part of growing up right? But I just wasn’t in the same space. I could tell a dirty joke and even flirt but I never felt or reacted the way everyone else did. It was like part of me was turned off. I did want a relationship, but was never interested in anyone to pursue it. I’d feel uncomfortable if anyone I didn’t know hit on me, and confused when someone I knew did (which was rare). I was described as weird, not quite a prude but weird that I could ‘be so sexual‘  but never have sex, not even so much as a make out. 

Without dumping my entire life story, I did eventually have sex, and was nonplused by it. I started having periods of casual relationships to see if I could find someone where it did for me what it did for my friends. Eventually I did, with someone I connected to comfortably and it was pretty awesome. In the 24 or so odd years that I’ve had sexual relationships, I have only been strongly sexually attracted to 3 people, and was only in a relationship with 2 of them. I have had many flings, but because of the nature of the relationship I found the sex ‘meh’ at best. It’s not that they were always bad lovers, or that they weren’t decent good looking people. I just wasn’t sexually attracted to them. I was trying to be, but I just wasn’t. 

When I was a kid growing up people only talked about being straight or gay (which was still rather taboo). Maybe bi… asexually wasn’t a thing, or if it was it was for prudes who had issues. I had no language to identify myself with for a long time. After giving up an attempted FWB which wasn’t working for me I found myself researching alt sexualities, and it’s lead me here. 

I don’t really identify with other asexuals as most seem sex repulsed or indifferent. I’m very sex positive, I am just not attracted to most people. I wish I was, I have friends who are poly and kinky and friends who are very open and accepting of alt sexuality. If I wanted to get laid I could, easy. But I have realized that I just don’t enjoy casual sex without connection. I enjoy it most in a relationship where friendship, trust, even love, is in play. I want to have sex, I got a pretty healthy libido, but I currently am not attracted to anyone

This is miles different than being picky. Picky means you are sexually attracted and are choosing to not act on it. I don’t have a choice. I might find you pretty but that doesn’t mean I want to fuck you, even in abstract terms. 

So, I’ve been debating coming out about this, but not sure if it’s worth it. I’m active in burner and art communities, so I know lots of people. Sometimes I get hit on and I shut them down as a reaction because I don’t know them well enough. Coming out would explain to people why I don’t date (I’ve been single for 12 years, only occasionally have has a fling when I decide I want to try and feel normal every couple of years. They’re always brief). At the same time though I expect blowback, and is this really anybody’s business?  

So yah… gold star if you’ve stuck around this long. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this so… posting anonymously hooray. This isn’t like coming out as gay or trans. It’s an alternative sexual attraction thing, but as it’s not as obvious I expect people to call bullshit on me. I have had sex, how can I be on the asexual spectrum? I don’t feel like having a debate with people who won’t listen anyway (which I know can happen here but y’all are anons so whatever). I don’t know if people would care, it sounds so arrogant almost to bring it up to people who aren’t interested and don’t ask about my orientation. However it’s not a thing that’s known or talked about

Anywho, thanks for reading. ",21Jan2018,3
