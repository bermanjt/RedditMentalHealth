0,"I'm a college student who might be asocial, might be depressed, might be anxious. I have this habit, or defense of constantly scrunching up my face or scowling so people won't approach me. 

Often I would like to have friends to do things with and become close to, where I can feel completely accepted. Of course. But often it's easier to sit there silently, and I don't mean easier because of anxieties and coming up with things to say, because yeah that's tough, but it's easier in this lazy sense. Like opening my mouth and forming words and smiling is so exhausting it's easier to not engage, to sit there with my mind in a fog. 

I became sort of friends with this girl in a class last semester. But as we got closer, the more disinterested I became. The more I tuned her out. Didn't take her seriously. Just stopped being able to come up with good responses. 

Same situation with a different girl, her quirks and personality just *annoys* me as time goes on. She is grasping for something from me, giving me a chance, but our personalities are too different and I'm withdrawing at each interaction now. I want to move far away from her in class, where she can't talk to me. But she's my only sorta friend, and I can't dump her like that. 

I realized the closer I get to someone, the more agitated I become with them, and crave to be completely alone. Only for the next day to want friends. 

I've gone to 2 therapy sessions where I was told this was normal and everyone has these feelings, and I was brushed off.",20Mar2018,2
1,"Like I said, his 5 year old cyst popped (my dog is 11). I don't know if I should take him to the vet to have it looked at. The crud inside had the consistency and texture of oatmeal. There was also a small amount of blood. The issue is that it left a hole about a cm wide. I'm afraid that it will get infected. But I'm not sure about taking him to the vet cause I'm afraid of how much it will cost and for the vet to be like it's nothing to worry about and not do anything. I have a pic of the cyst after it popped but it's kind of gross. Does anyone have any advice?

Edit: let me clarify. I've taken him to vet several times over the last 5 years about this cyst and he has said not to worry about it, it'll pop on it's own. Then he would explain about a surgery to remove it, however the surgery was really too expensive to consider.

I don't want to take him in and have the vet tell me that there's nothing to worry about and not do anything about it. Not only does the vet office stress my dog out, and my dog is old, but there's a chance that it might be an unnecessary expense that I may or may not be able to afford. I'm asking for advice from people who maybe have been in this situation. If their dog had a cyst that popped and what they did about it. ",20Mar2018,1

4,"I think a big problem with today's society is that people are way too quick to change their beliefs, and aren't quick enough to care about others and how they feel. I think this leads to society as a whole to lack integrity and conviction, and it leads to cultures losing their identities and becoming jumbled existential messes. I think the world would be a lot better off if everyone consciously chose to be a little less open-minded, but at the same time more open-hearted. I think people would benefit from maintaining a tighter grip on their beliefs while allowing other's into their hearts and searching for the things that make others tick. Instead of trying to win arguments, maybe we'd be better off trying to understand each other for the sake of understanding, not for the sake of changing their mind. Instead of trying to change their minds with eloquent words, show them your understanding of their perspective using words, and then through action and demonstration allow them to find the appeal of your position for themselves. Words, no matter what you do with them, will be flawed and be twisted by perspective. Perspective is not reality, it is its shadow. The heart does not feel what it sees, it sees what it feels, and what it feels is what it tells the mind to perceive. So instead of telling others what to think or see, give them the chance to feel what you believe they ought to think. Just the ramblings of a stubborn jackass.",20Mar2018,2

9,"I've just been coming to the realization of how awful of a friend I've been to some people.

About a year and a half ago, my best guy friend cheated on his girlfriend, who was my also my close friend. In the aftermath, I spent my time comforting her over text and listening to her vent. I don't think there's really anything wrong with that, and I definitely did not have any ulterior motive. I wasn't interested in getting with her or ""stealing"" her from my guy friend. But then she started asking, ""should I break up with him?"". And this is where my thoughts started becoming concerning. I honestly felt like she totally should have broken up with him. In fact, I kind of wanted them to break up. In my mind, if they broke up, my guy friend would be getting exactly what he deserved. I wanted that righteous indignation. Now, I didn't actually end up telling her to break them up; I just said, you make the decision. She ended up not breaking up with him.

Fast forward to a few months ago, my guy friend dumped her. Again, I spent a bunch of time comforting her, and again, no ulterior motives. Throughout the whole time, I felt really bad for her, but I couldn't really feel bad for my guy friend, because I thought, hey, you deserve this.

Now I'm realizing that that is quite a messed up pattern of thinking, especially towards a guy who was my best friend.

Thing is, this really isn't the first time something like this has happened. I was really close to this person in freshman year of high school. One day, she jokingly stole somebodies food and ate it. The person was pretty pissed and suddenly, I felt that feeling of righteous anger again. I ended up not talking to her again and to this day, we don't talk at all.

This has really been bothering me. Am I a narcissist? Why am I just so willing to throw people under the bus for this idea of ""righteousness""? It's not like I'm gaining anything. I'm just a terrible friend. I don't want to continue through life like this though.",20Mar2018,0
11,"Haha... this is a post for the journal not live.

I'm starting to care less I am doxxable.

I could just go for freedom, $50K, freedom, $10K sustains yearly life... the female seeking, why. Rise above the cycle right, who cares about evolutionary continuation, the next person after you could die/not propagate your genes. Are my genes worthy of saving.

Of course a nice life is nice too, great job, more money, less stress. But again, freedom by not needing to do much. Have a bunch of micro sites that make whatever per month even less than a thousand. But it is hard... I don't have any ideas... all I seem to be good for is being told what to do/building it, so I still trade hours for money.

I don't have much time. Unfortunately I'm not someone that can sit down and shit out code consistently. If I was on adderall it would be possible. But that takes a toll eventually.

You are average, mediocre, what's wrong with that. 1 in 7 billion is a hell of an odds stacked against you.

Whoa is me?

I just feel like a delusional, peasant squabbling over nothing. &lt;- this sentence proves I'm not smart.

That's the thing, do I actually want what I strive for. I mean certainly anything non-labor-use-your brain would be better than a labor job. Not being in debt/stress from credit problems... don't need much.

I can't seem to break free though, or I'm just impatient/don't try hard enough. Personal problems, self esteem ""be a man""... then there's the thing of regretting your actions ""I shouldn't have done that""

Haha... my recent job application is something to show around and make fun of like look at this retard. It wasn't appropriate and I don't know what made me try.

Life goes on, time moves forward.

I put in the time too but I hit a wall... my mind just sucks. Then I feel sad. Have to watch some show/other people streaming to fill a void, then I get out of it, go back to it, chase the dream, escape poverty, tell myself delusions to get by.

There is also this other wall, it's fun to talk about business/getting things done but actually doing it... my mind locks up in stressful situations. When I have to put an application together that actually handles real money and I have to piece everything so it flows right and executes properly without double charges/dumb problems like that. Have to be dumb, granulate it, write it out, draw it... understand the pieces. Then I think it's bad, this code is bad, have I improved? Months/years have gone by. Why am I still in the same position? Maybe I'm not trying hard enough. I also realize more the finite hours in a day/week.

random excerpt - this is a rambling, I'm tired, mentally exhausted, over-tried on a dumb coding mistake I had earlier.

I used to idolize Howard Hughes, I really liked that movie The Aviator. Then I was listening to this book ""Ego is the Enemy"" or something like that and it talked about how this guy wasted money, the only reason he was able to keep wasting so much over and over again was because of the oil monopoly his father made (special tri-cone drill bit and licensing the tech).

What do you live for? Why do you exist? What do you want? hahaha sucks when your mind is mediocre, discipline... water cuts through rock eventually (or instantly if you have a fucking jet with diamond dust-infused water)

more unrelated rambling

was going to respond to a thread on a sub

I remember a moment when I subletted this apartment (sublessee idk) which had 2 girls in it, one of them was pretty much telling me she was DTF ""I like anal"" she said one day to me. But I was afraid like ""is this correct? what if I'm rapy? if I made a move"" She wasn't super hot or anything either. I didn't make a move, even when I had her on a boat and it was just her and I. Ahh... I had a car then, something you take for granted till you don't have it. Nothing crazy or anything, I did like that little hatchback car though.

I had this funny thing happen to me, I was coming back from the bars and this blonde girl I'd say 6, fit (not exercise fit) shorter, stacked... I meet her at the starewell in the dorms, first thing she says ""want to fuck"" and I'm like hell yes! I'm already naked in this room with her, got her on the bed, fingering... then this fucking dude is there. Obese guy. I realize what it is! Straight bait! I also realized that my lower member and alcohol don't work together.

Oh my god another gem (my life is full of cringe moments) there was this girl that is attracted to me and I called her out in front of her friends was like ""hey name, can I talk to you"" she gets up and looks at me interested, we walk out into a hallway. I was into bodybuilding at the time ([still am](https://i.imgur.com/hNB1stg.jpg)&lt;-insecure though I am behind, haven't lifted for a year or more - actually probably since I got out of school 3-4 years ago due to not having daily access to a gym) but that was what my mind thought was a way to ask her out. I was like ""Hey we should work out some time"" and she took this as an insult to her body and threw a bag of cheetohs at me hahaha.

lastly I hate dependency... I am dependent because I'm needy (financially)

I can't speak my mind, be me, because ""I need to look good so I can get employed"" of course I'm not advocating bad things, ""terrorism"" or ""rape"" whatever... I have to think twice about what I post online... but I'm also no one too. Who cares.

If people really wanted to, you have so much random connected data you can follow it.

Then there's the concern ""what if..."" and if you were valuable/people wanted something from you well they would put up with your shit. That's the thing too I can't figure out if I want to be a nice guy or a bad guy, I mean I have been a nice guy and it doesn't work. But can you transform/can you change or is it imprinted/shaped/my brain pathways are wired this way hahaha. 

Time to find out

This is insecurity ""I haven't been working out until recently because of the weather but my body is genetically decent and can build/tone pretty quickly-ish"" It's a blessing that I'm average build because my mind is weak like ""cry whoa is me, please don't hit me, I'm a bitch"" but because I'm big-ish I often don't have to deal with confrontation. Not that I want to, but sometimes I want it, like I need to experience what would happen (get my ass kicked).

Do it right, how much time you waste cruising through these sites. I won't deny that I get a lot of help from people and try to return it when I can. Also watching shows... but sometimes my brain just won't work either even if I want it to. My eyes hurt. Can't think logically anymore/do hard things.

Like I feel like I failed today, that I didn't get anything major done, I built a working UI with variable state for managing users, I fixed a bug, I updated an endpoint, added a redirect catch... ahh why isn't it enough. Like good job... patience. I also just don't have time... fuck. I'm not free. I have to return to this job that I don't want because I need to keep making that money... slave to my balls as well. Mediocre brain (how many times have I said that) can't will the branch to pull me out of this pit.

Damn even on a 1080p screen this is a lot of text haha.

At the end of the day though, I'm fortunate. I was in a shitty life situation 15 years ago, and here I am now, I lived 15 more years in the US, I'm healthy, with a decent brain. I can almost do anything that I want to with computers. It takes time though but so far if I really wanted to build a project I am capable of it.

I will add that nothing I say about status/sex/finance/career matters unless I've reached it and then reflect back. It might as well be another delusion when I tell myself/convince myself of something that I haven't actually experienced yet.

Overall I just need sleep.",20Mar2018,2

22,"I'm 28 and turning 29 this year and i am scared I might have something wrong with my brain. I can't remember a large portion of my childhood. And I think I have gotten it from my dad. My dad was a drunk druggy who used to beat my mom. The only memories I have of him are of him beating my mom.  My dad had committed suicide when I was 5 or 6.( I don't remember the exact age it happened.) I'm pretty sure my dad had some sort of mental illness and that it was passed down to me. 

I'm not exactly what he had and I have no one to talk to about him. I don't speak to that side of the family anymore. It wasn't like I didn't want to talk to them but my mom and step dad used to be upset at me when I did. They made me and my brother feel really guilty about it and it made me distance myself from them. I was very young at that time and if I knew what I know right now, I would of done it differently. There has always been alot of shame in regards to my family. I never wanted anyone to find about my family history. So I hid behind this fake persona. Tried to act like nothing bothered me and like I don't give a shit. I tried to act cool in front of the guys and tried every I could to please the ladies. I always avoided conflict with my everyone but my close family (mom, step dad and brother) . But I wasn't perfect, I used to take my frustration out on my close family. I realize now why I acted that way to family. I always wanted to please people and wanted no one to hate me. So I did whatever it took to be liked. It probably comes from mommy issues. I always wanted my mom attention but I was never good enough. She always used to make me feel like shit. She would call me dumb and tells me other how stupid I was. But she  was going through her own issues at that time. I don't blame her for that shit now. It was very hard for my mom as well.  She was an immigrant in a new country, with two kids, and her deadbeat  husband killed himself. And now she is alone to take care of me and my brother. She didn't even speak English. So yeah, I have mommy issues. 

When I was younger I walked in on my grandad dead in the bath room. He was face down and had fallen off the toilet seat. I don't remember what happened next. I just remembered I was the first one to find him. I had forgotten about this and just remembered when I smoked some weed. Weed has been helping me with my memory. It brings out memories 
that I had forgotten about. 

So maybe I subconsciously blocked a few things out from my memory; or maybe it's a illness that is messing with my memory. I really don't know what it is. I probably need professional help but Im living paycheck to paycheck so I can't afford it. I also got a shit load of debt and have a shit wage. But I will find something and get I will put together some money so I can see a psychologist. i've been looking for a psychologist that I can go to before or after work but there doesn't seem to be a good match.

It's been nearly 2 years since my ex(23M) and I(23M) ended things. It's been nearly 3 years since I've had sex. I miss the intimacy, I miss the cuddling, I miss being with someone. I miss sex. And I hate it. I don't want to feel lonely anymore. I'm not sure why I'm posting, but I've had to hold all of this in for about 3 years. No one close to me knows how I feel, because I would just get judged. And honestly, I think I want a FWB. All of the sex with none of the relationship problems. But, I don't think I'm equipped for that. I've only ever had sex with one person, my ex. I feel like I might end up getting attached, maybe mistaking lust for something more. I don't know. But, I know that would make things worse. I just need some companionship or something.

I have no friends besides my ex and his friends, which I don't consider to be my friends because I rarely talk to them, and I can't talk like this with them. I can't talk to my ex because I know he won't understand. I can't talk to my family because we're not that close.

Though a pastor by trade, Mr. Rogers also became a child psychologist and believed that encouraging children to express their emotions in a healthy way was the best way to have them grow into functional adults. On his show Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, he encouraged kids to not only reflect and talk about their feelings, but to be curious about other people and the world, and to understand that every person is somehow different from everyone else.

Every year I think it's important to remember, especially in trying times, that the simple act of speaking honestly and openly is more powerful than a gun or a punch or yelling at someone.

35,"people often have many questions about autism or wonder what autism is autism is often misunderstood by many people i hope that i help you to be more understanding about autism 
autism is a life long developmental disorder that effects those with autism in many ways people with autism are different in many wonderful ways i was diagnosed with autism when i was ten years old today i am 23 years old i am on the adult swim team for my local health club 
here is some of the things that people with autism deal with in every day life 
what is sensory overload it is were a autistic individual’s senses are overwhelmed examples of sensory overload is loud noise , bright lights strong smells and different textures and strong tastes 
what is stimming: it is a process in which a autistic person may do things like flapping their hands back and forth or spinning around or spin objects or rock back and forth 
is following a routine important to a autistic person the answer to that question is yes following a routine helps a autistic person make sense of their daily life and keep track of their favorite activities it also helps them follow a set schedule for their day and week 
is there a special day or month for autism awareness yes the month of april is autism awareness month the second day in april is world autism awareness day which is ment to spread autism awareness around the world 
how can you help people with autism or families who have loved ones with autism by being kind and respectful and understanding and not being to quick to judge it might be wonderful to educate yourself about autism and help others understand those with autism 
i want to thank you for your time and have a wonderful day",20Mar2018,3
36,"I might blow a gasket today. I am beyond frustrated with the amount of sexism I see in my field at an organization that is supposed to be diverse. Let's ignore the fact that the IT industry was at one time dominated by women.

So I guess for the little things pushing me over the edge today. I am sitting at my desk and a user comes looking for a loaner computer. I ask her if I can help (mind you I sit in the IT department). I ask what I can to help her and she states ""Oh I am looking for the IT guys"" SIGH. I promise my gender does not automatically exclude me from a specific department. I had to explain my position and that I could help her. So I resolved her problem despite my gender disability. (eye roll). 
Following this a ticket comes through for a user experiencing issues that I just created a training for. I explain to the guys working on this ticket that I am familiar with her issue and have some insight into what is going on. Not to mention that they guy working on the ticket is new and that he is likely unfamiliar with the software as it is specific to our organization. The user in this instance has no idea how to explain her issue. Since I have trained on this issue I am able to read between the lines.

Of course the guy working on the ticket dismisses me with an open eyeroll and tells me that this is likely not our problem because we dont support the software she is saying the issue is coming from. I do. I provide training on it. So finally exhausted from being written off I explained that I should handle training issues and have a quota to meet and that i would like to reach my quota for a raise. ",20Mar2018,12

Now the boy is still holding the things only when you give to him close to his hands, he always hits his hands with my face, my body or also any thing you give without curiosity to take initiative to explore . he is more calm, he likes to laugh and to play  but his movements are mostly random in comparison with his sister",20Mar2018,1
41,"Every time I go onto Reddit I see something that makes me incredibly paranoid, upset, scared, or some variant thereof. Whether it's something some corporation is doing, related to the environment, the US government, *any* government, I always seem to leave Reddit in a far worse mood than when I open the page. Even if I'm just trying to take a glance at r/fantasy (because let's face it, with a world this shitty we all could use some fantastic escapism) I almost always end up seeing that all our data is being stolen and controlled at all times and that there's been another shooting and that Russia controls social media and that global warming is going to kill us all or something like that.

I am not suicidal now, looking at the sidebar, but I have been in the past and I wouldn't be surprised if I become so again in the future. This influx of horrible horrible things from Reddit is something I know played and plays a large part in these feelings - again, even these things show up even when I'm only here to look at r/blup and r/fantasy!

From their support of the Iraq War to the current Catastrophe-in-Chief, if I was God these people would be among the first in and last out of the hottest flames of hell.

Believers who are this terrible as people are part of why I am an atheist, because a just and loving God would smite these horrible people immediately rather than let them spew their ignorance and stupidity for the rest of humanity and creation to suffer.

44,"My environmental science professor told me today that I won’t be able to pass her class, which is understandable considering I haven’t done much of the work, and have only shown up to about half of the classes. I tried to ask to do corrections or other forms of extra credit, but she said that she doesn’t want to jeopardize her academic integrity in doing so, which, again, is understandable. She sympathized with my extracurricular issues, which include being kicked out of my mom’s house (and my childhood home), having to move in with my boyfriend, pick up a job, and generally have my life fall apart while I was busy trying to fit the pieces back together from the last time it fell apart, which was a few weeks after I turned 18, a year ago (an unrelated issue I’d rather not discuss here). 

I really want to go into environmental studies, and I really want to just leave my current community college and finally move onto a real, four year college. Specifically Western Washington University, my dream school. Aldous Huxley is one of my heroes, and considering their environmental college is called The Huxley College of the Environment, that sounds perfect to me.

It’s just, I understand what people say and mean in relation to me, my life, and my choices within it. I understand them and what they have to say, and therein I do try my best to respect it. However, I wish people, such as my teacher, and others around me, would try to understand, not merely sympathize in a superficial way, what I’m going through, and what I’ve been going through. I know I can make a change, and inevitably I will, but until then, who’s to say? Certainly not me, and apparently not even an environmental sciences professor.

49,"I've been friends with a girl for almost 12 years now, since the second grade. I've grown up with her, and her family, and they treat me like their other child. We get along really well since our personalities kind of grew up with each other. But as we got older we became a little more distanced from each other.

Her family is very, very Christian. And so is she. They aren't conservative really, they're all democrats actually. She started inviting me to her church and I liked it because I got to hang out with her and the other people our age there. She invited me to her Christian summer camp, which I went to and absolutely loved. It was a lot of fun, and all of this started to actually convert me to Christianity. But now that we're out of high school, we grew apart a little. We always had some differences, she's always been very introverted and I have always been very extroverted. But I grew out of religion, and she doesn't know that.

She still thinks I'm a Christian. She still thinks I've never been drunk, she thinks I've never done drugs (I smoke weed every day now), she thinks I'm still a virgin, she thinks I'm straight. All of that. I had a boyfriend for a little bit that she didn't end up meeting (thank god), but I was so scared of her meeting him because he's practically the polar opposite of her. 

My mom has always known everything about me and she's fine with all the choices I make with my life, but I'm more scared of my friend and her family finding out all this stuff about me. I don't think she would want to be friends with me anymore if she knew everything about me. I know the natural solution is to not be friends with her anymore, because true friends should support you... But it feels like the equivalent of having really conservative parents. Her family has done so much for me, I feel like if her or her family found out it would be like a slap in the face to them. She's just been such a significant part of my life it would feel like being shunned by my family if she didn't want to be friends with me anymore. ",20Mar2018,1

54,"It didn’t used to be that you always had to respond to messages and calls. 

In the 80’s my kids could miss a call from me and be out all day and I wouldn’t really think more of it than “I guess they went out.” Or “They haven’t checked their machine today.”

Now if I call and send a text message and don’t hear anything without context, I’d be showing up at their house by the end of the day. 

It didn’t even happen right away. When I first got my phone my kids would send me messages and what not, and for the first couple days I put off answering because I hadn’t learned  how texting worked yet and didn’t want to respond until I could sit down and draft a nice message. 

Well, middle of the second day, two of my kids separately show up to be sure I’m alive. 

I kind of hate this constant contact and love it all at once. I get to be much closer to people I’d otherwise be totally out of touch with. 

I also am never truly alone. Never 100% clocked out of work. It used to be you went on vacation you just didn’t give your office the number of your hotel and that was that.

56,"I love being weird! The conventional kind of weird, if there is such a thing. My point? Being weird, human, injecting my personality into all my relationships, conversations, work projects. I love being who I am to everything and everybody. That is, everybody I'm comfortable with. 

I'm awful at meeting new people, and my social anxiety is through the roof when put in positions where I have to socialize with people I've never met. Often I'll avoid any direct contact. No asking them questions. I can answer, but I don't usually explain or elaborate. Short and concise answers. I feel that it's unattractive and gives off an impression that I'm not interested in this person/people at all, all the while I'm shuffling inside my head wondering if I paused too long to continue, or if I'm being rude, are they being rude? What am I even doing here?? So on and so on. 

Because of this PAINFULLY obvious and abrupt change in my personality (what I imagine the people who know me see this as)  I sometimes withdraw into myself and think about who I think I am, and who my friends think I am. Sometimes in the middle of completely comfortable social situations. 

Now exclusively with close friends I believe have had these thoughts about me, it will happen even if its only them and I in the same room, and I'm pretty comfortable and accurate at reading the room. I guess a way to describe it would be phasing out sometimes. A brief autopilot. One minute I'm having fun, friends and I are all having a good time with good conversation, and the next i feel like I just missed an important social cue suggestive of my ""offness"". Not to be confused with a dry joke that didn't land, or whatever I was saying just wasn't interesting, but a shift in atmosphere almost like... Bringing up someone's recently deceased pet inappropriately. If only a few seconds, it's like I enter ""reality"" so to speak. It's a really awkward and uncomfortable feeling, and I don't know what makes me feel this way. ""Episodes"" can last up to multiple days now, and when it's finished, it's like its completely redacted from memory. It never happened, and I'm back to being me around the same friends.

58,"so my sophomore year of college, a month or so after coming out to my college friends and family, I went to a gay bar in town for a fun night out. as i was dancing with my friends, i noticed this boy (we'll call him BJ for privacy reasons) with his friends across the dance floor. i had never approached someone before but after a few shots, i grew some balls and started dancing with him. dancing lead to making out, which lead to him coming home with me. we didnt have sex, just hooked up, but after that we stayed up most of the night just talking about anything and everything. he left the next morning and we kind of dated for about a month but i ended it because he wasnt putting as much in as i did and was kind of sketchy. we remained distant friends over the next year and a half. i dated a boy for a year after that, which I also ended. I decided after that relationship ended, I would reach out to BJ and see how he was. we went out the following night, hooked up that then went to a bday party with my friends the next night. it was like nothing had ever happened between us. after getting back together, I knew I loved him. we both swooned over each other everyday. neither of us had ever liked someone more. we dated for 3 or 4 months and one day, on our anniversary, he came over and dumped me out of the blue. saying he loved me but wasnt in love with me, he lost the feeling, blah blah blah. i was blindsided, distraught, destroyed. so to cope, i drank and hooked up with people. he found out and got mad at me. i was even more confused. then his true feelings came out. he said the time apart we had and seeing me with someone else made him realize how much he does love me and wants to be with me. and me being a dumbass, took him back with open arms. we dated a total of 7 months, before he dumped me again. after getting back together, we was never the same. he was very emotionally abusive. made me feel like i was some needy psycho, all because i wanted him to acted like he loved me and to spend time with me - instead of choosing all of his friends over me every time. he acted like hanging out with me was a chore. this of course lead to lots of fights. which he made myself and everyone think were my fault. i was always willing to work on things and fix things, as was he, for a day. then it would all go back to the same. but i love him so much that it was worth working on things and trying to figure it out. but he just gave up and ran from everything, as he always had. through all the emotional abuse and manipulation, i still, to this day, love him with all my heart, I thought i was going to marry him. but once we parted ways, he blocked me on everything and refuses to talk to me. but i still think he was my person, I just wasnt his.

So now, after breaking up, I'm more sexually frustrated than ever. I feel like a dirty, shallow person because I fantasize about it all the time, and think about sex any time a girl gives me attention. I hate this as it feels totally disrespectful and I am incredibly scared that I'm turning into one of those nice guy, incel, or red pill types who feels entitled to sex. 

Just masturbating doesn't cut it anymore. If I masturbated every time I felt horny, let's just say I'd be taking a lot of bathroom breaks.

63,"After you break; after you reach a level of sorrow, pain, or paralyzing fear is when *something* hits you. Jesus had to die and resurrect. Hercules had to dive into hell and fight to come back. Addicts profess hitting “rock bottom” before they take the first of 12 steps. Runners describe a “high” from pushing their bodies through the pain. Whether you want an ancient parable, or modern catechism laying out the value of abject struggle leading to awesome if not immortal reward, there's plenty on offer.

It's with this sentiment in mind that I often think that I haven't struggled enough. I'm loath to admit “real problems” in the first place. I'm wired to irrationally panic, talk, and write before I even remotely bother to calculate what's coming next. Whether it's the goals I have for my land, or the principals I'd like to defend, I think there's a case that the “right” kind of struggle hasn't been engaged, and it's as plausible as any an explanation for things as a claim to the generalized indifference of the universe.

For me, it happens with certain authors or with phrases that come out of nowhere. What I fear, what rests in my chest besides the cool air of this snowing spring day, is being right. I want more than anything to be wildly off the mark as to what I both feel and think is in store for, not just the country's future, but humanity as well. I want the most depressing fictionalized accounts of future worlds to be fond parodies. I want every depressed or dead literary genius to be suffering from the same undiagnosed subspecies of egoism. I want the “most telling” and “consequential” descriptions of the doors closing out the light to be a set in a house of a million rooms.

There are consequences regardless of your approach to life, but the consequences of being right are worse. When you're right, you've made it impossible to believe that *something* couldn't have been done.  You spotted the malevolent look in their eye the moment you met them, and yet your computer was stolen anyway. What gives!? You've studied in depth how societies fall or herd-mentality allows everyday normal people to be complicit in compounding waves of atrocity, yet people will *insist* you calm down and accept “the facts of life” or the circumstances you inhabit. But you're right, and you're suffering, and you're desperate to plan a workaround, and it doesn't matter.

I've said in the past that I don't get very many opportunities to “feel like me.” Some weird confluence of forces has to persuade me to *lean in* to my extroversion or dejected combative take on “hope.” To put yourself out there makes you a target. Besides the inherent danger of asking people to aim and shoot at you, it acts in lesser known or described ways. Millions of people could flock to you, and yet you're alienated. The circle is on your chest, not theirs. The words you used to whisper to yourself, or scream to a chosen few, are abused to literally every end, and particularly to one's you'd find abhorrent and opposed to what you intended. You're a repository for every resentful inclination a person may have felt against anything they don't live up to.

Every hero of mine has the same story. Every “justice movement” goes through the same paces and iterates similarly. I've heard every condescending and self-righteous declaration of my motives. When someone professes that, “you take the good with the bad” they don't stress that you literally don't have a choice, and the bad will be actively punishing you for bothering with the good, no matter how good, and the bad can jump straight to death threats. If I stand up for worker's rights as an embattled delivery boy, I'm “threatening livelihoods” and “salty” to the invigorated propagandized, and/or the harbinger of fate flowing from my worthwhile story and sacrifice in the eyes of labor organizers. I'm both, at all times, choosing to pop my head up or down.

My fear is that I'm right about all of the choices I haven't made for myself that I watch people make for themselves. It's the wildest extreme empathy has to offer. The relief! I constantly profess of choosing death, video games, or obesity. It's as duplicitous as I can ever manage. There is no relief to adopt the burden of giving up. There is no solace in tacking close to your isolation and indignity. There is no sustained power or value in exploiting your capacity for self-delusion and quiet complacency. I know, I've tried. I'll go so far as to say you're often not actively aware of what it's doing to you, but that's the point. It shows up when me, the guy who's begrudgingly consistent where it counts, “magically” becomes intolerable or negative when you can literally pair my sentiments across 13 years. Can you choose to not step on your dick for that long? Even my favorite authors have had things to recant, but with a singular concern for rooting out the truth as far as you can dig, absolutely.

Given that I don't know anything, by the time I feel comfortable claiming I might, it's hard for me to cope with what happens when the truth plays out. Be stuck skeptical. Be in doubt, always. AND THEN SHIT KEEPS COMING TRUE AS YOU THOUGHT! What a beyond bizarre state of affairs. Why, it could have been any number of a dozen reasons A went to B or C decided to D. But there you freakin' have it, like dominoes. No, maybe not every single time, but enough to be concerning. If the world operates with such regular and terrible consistency, what's my infinitely small window on that pattern going to do against the tide?

I think you have to blow up the moon.

The moon is the looming reminder that the sun is still shining. It took fundamental mathematical truths and the coordination of minds towards a singular goal to get there. It was once part of the Earth, now uncoupled, watching. It's a place to stash away that voice always flitting about our heads telling us things we don't want to hear. It's a place to throw our baggage of responsibilities when they're too heavy. It's a place of cold indifference with no ability to shine on its own.

The moon matters. Animals respond to it. Along with the stars it aides in navigation. It can be the perfect backdrop of a romantic evening. But it acts as an unconscious force, kneading the shores. If you're not paying attention, it can drown you. “What a silly thought!” Says the woman who's never fallen asleep on the beach.

There are many moons in many orbits around the earthen body you're using to perceive the world. The ebb and flow of their movement has real consequences. I only need one moon. I know when all of the things I don't want to say or all of the weight I don't want to carry are swaying, way up there, pulling me back and forth. Your moons though? Prepare the explosives. I know how yours make you dance because I'm intimately familiar with my own. It's not clairvoyant to read the words on the page. And if you'd bother to read about yourself, you might discover a way through your journey to hell.

I'm afraid I'm going to get everything I put my mind too. I'm afraid I'm going to open myself up to thousands of people and try to provide something that speaks to my values in earnest, and it will be something equally or stupider so that blows it up as I've always discovered. I'm scared I truly only matter to myself, and every selfish exploitation I've bore the brunt of is the “just” way of getting what you want in life. I'm scared that it's okay to be smug and self-satisfied and flawless in your judgment of other people and their motives. I can't stomach it. I can't slow my heart rate in thinking about what being convinced of that does to every ounce of my effort to behave otherwise. What I've clawed together so far, that I might have to sacrifice it for...for to fit...for to win...for a seat at the table...for people to like me...for the opportunity to sacrifice piece after piece for more connections or profit or timeline stories of my achievements and grandiosity that outpaces you. It's a fucking disgusting picture. It's a vain and decrepit joke.

I'm so fucking terrified that I'm not wrong. I can't cope with having the resources to be of greater consequence. I don't want to be like my heroes, beleaguered by idiots, getting into Twitter wars with the jealous and lazy. I don't want every instance I've typed “nigger” in a blog to send reporters to my ex's house. I don't want attention and praise. I want to work. Because whether I believe there's any point to life or not, work means something to me. Work never ceases. Work is the physical manifestation of what you actually believe, and evidence that your better nature can betray all of the stupid and confusing shit coming out of your mouth. Work is your immortal impression, and so you should be deathly afraid of not paying attention to what you're working towards. More important, you should bother being aware of whether or not you're working through!

I make decisions, but you allow them to matter. You lent yourselves to the parties. You helped pay for, unload and assemble, or took over for a spell at the kiosk. You provide the encouragement or “likes” or standing invitations to stop talking and visit already. How do any of us enable such a dramatic degree of deadly and hopeless decisions to matter more than basic decency? How do I *just know* it's never getting better, and there's no appeal, and no fix, and what I create will have bruises and scars from being punched and cut like there was never *something!* else that could be done? There isn't, is there? This is it. You can write about it. You can watch. But there's no one to help you get to the moon.",20Mar2018,1

So I guess what I’m asking People of Reddit is should I stick out a job that makes me unhappy to please my family or should I go for something new that I think I want? ",20Mar2018,1
67,"I recently got into a realtionship with someone, and she told me that she has depression.

She told me she really loves me but she's afraid she will screw up our relationship. If i ask her why she thinks that she tells me: ""i don't know"". She also says that she ruined the lifes from people before me, But when i ask her friends they tell me those guys used her to get a quick fix.

The weird thing is that when she's not depressed she is really loving and isn't the same when she is depressed.

i don't know what to do with the situation, i never experienced something like this.

69,"just reaching out to anyone on reddit who may be diagnosed as a pathological liar who is willing to pm. i'm coming to terms with my past and am living with a ridiculous amount of lies, may they be small, big, white lies, or very serious in nature. waiting to get in to see a psychiatrist so i can get help, and in the meantime i'm just trying to see if theres hope for me and maybe learn some ways you have handled your personal circumstances. i'm so fucking remorseful for everything and am aware of the endless hurt both the lies and truth have and will cause in my life and the life of those i love. i just can't see a future, and it sucks because at one time i did. i know theres a good heart in this garbage bag i call a body, just can't really connect back to it. thanks.",20Mar2018,2
70,"It seems like the mainstream theory on why conspiracy nuts gotta conspiracy nut is that they can't stand the random chaos of the world, and that they're basically trying to assuage their fears. The idea is that people can't stand the idea that 19 guys with box cutters could cause 9/11.

If you actually take a look at this proposal though, believing in conspiracy theories actually make the world way more uncertain and terrifying and out of control. Think about it: if you believe that the U.S. government is organized and capable enough to pull 9/11 off without a peep from any of what would have to be many involved conspirators, and that they put on a big jetliner-crash show as smoke and mirrors before setting off bombs that detonated at the crash positions, then that gives you far *less* certainty about the world around you than the average person has. It means you can't believe anything you see or read in the news or in the library or on Wikipedia or in the Britannica, and that there is no such thing as scientific consensus or credible sources at all. It means that all news is potentially fake news and that that the government is truly all-powerful. If conspiracists are emotionally motivated to believe in their ""theories"" then they must want to live in the matrix or the Truman Show IRL.

Just a rant I guess, because the question of why conspiracy theorists believe what they do has always bothered me, and this commonly given answer is (speaking of conspiracies, haha [not really]) full of holes.",20Mar2018,1
