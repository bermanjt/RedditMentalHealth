Drained by helping others. Drained by not getting anything, any care, any help whatsoever. I got a few good friends with whom I share everything with, but somehow that s not enough. Idk why I feel so terrible even though I've often met people who've gone through worse and handle it much better than I do right now. Fuck I feel so alone, so unconfident, so uncared for. My ex just doesn't give a shit about me after we both agreed to be good friends and after I time and time again helped her without expecting anything in return. I am falling behind at college, and I have trouble falling asleep. I am still underweight and loath my skeleton body when I look in the mirror. I still haven't worked out although I've wanted to start jt every day for the past 5 weeks. I can't climb to previous elo on my favourite game. I will never be good at anything. I hate life and I just want a fucking break. And the sad part about all this, is that I have it so fucking easy. 90% of the world's population would kill for having the same problems as me, and here I am complaining about my situation. Just fucking end me. ty.",06Mar2018,4

3,"A few months ago a guy messaged me on tumblr and we started talking a lot. Then he gave me his number and we texted a lot. A couple weeks ago he added me on snapchat and we‘ve continued to talk a lot. He‘s cute, funny, and his crazy jells well with my crazy. I openly flirt with him and he responds well to it. 

But in the last week it feels like he‘s closed up a bit from me? In the past we‘ve talked about me going to visit him but when i mentioned it again recently he ignored it and diverted the conversation. He‘s left convos hanging a couple times now on subjects that can sort of be related to romantic feelings (thats so vague sounding, im sorry its hard to explain). I feel like I‘m being swerved on all of a sudden. 

A major problem that‘s always in the back of my mind is that he‘s admitted to me his last relationship ended because his gf caught him chatting up another woman. Part of me feels like I might be just another random girl he‘s talking to for his own ego. But for me, I‘m actually falling for him. I don‘t want to have feelings for someone who only thinks of me as a name on his phone just there to make him feel better about himself. 

I don‘t know what to do. I don‘t want to admit how I feel because I‘m 99.99% sure it‘ll be another rejection and that will end our friendship. I ask my friends and they‘re all over the map on their advice (some are encouraging, others say I shouldn‘t bother with long distance relationships). ",06Mar2018,2
4,"I will miss the history of firearms in the magazine, but I can do without the NRA-ILA bullshit.  

My resignation letter:

Dear Sir or Ma’am,

I am appalled at the apparent money the NRA has taken from Russian interest.  The fact that Alexander Torshin, a Putin ally was granted a lifetime membership to the NRA disgusts me as an Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran and current civil servant.  Why he was able to attend the 2013 national convention and create lasting bonds with NRA leadership is beyond me.  I have sworn an oath to protect the Constitution of the United States from threats both foreign and domestic.  I do not want to be part of your domestic threat to my nation.  

My understanding growing up was that the NRA was about gun safety and sport, not partisan political treason against the United States.  The group has lost its way with far-right extremist that apparently will stop at nothing to see our government divided.  

Therefore, effective immediately upon receipt of this letter, I am requesting that my lifetime membership be cancelled and all of my contact information be removed from your rolls immediately.

I liked Candy Crush for a bit until levels got impossible. I'm currently playing bacterial takeover which is super fun. Of computer games occasionally a game of Civ 5 is fun. 

Most games people like now are super boring to me. I don't care about story, immersion, anything like that. Honestly I'd rather play freecell than Skyrim.

I have known her for about a year. I swear, even though I've no romantic feelings for her, she's the most important person in my life. I can confide in her. We laugh at similar things. She loves culture—museums, films, psychology. We talk about stuff I never talked with anyone before. She is family. 

In all the years of depression, she's the only one to make me genuinely laugh—even at myself.

I am a dude. She's a girl my age (22). We laugh at how people think we're a couple. We aren't. We are both clear with each other that there are no romantic feelings. What are the small things you do make your best friend feel appreciated?",06Mar2018,2

9,"I'm just venting about my boyfriend. he's so passive and I feel like I can do anything and he'll accept it. He's asian so I guess he was raised to be a doormat.  I wish he could be brave?? Like...I can tell him that ""HEY! I'm gonna go fuck other guys and you're not allowed to fuck anyone but me!"" and he'll literally agree with me and I have to tell him that I would never do that but its pathetic that he would accept it. 


He would accept anything, I've tested it and then told him I wasn't serious and I don't like that about him. I'd be like.... HEY! gimme $200! I'm broke right now! and he would just do it even if he's struggling with paying his car. I talked to a person in the mental health field and they explained that being passive was working with his mother and that style of communication worked for him most of his life. But idk...it's horrifically pathetic. I will ask him stuff because I'm curious about what he'll agree with and he'll agree with anything!!! I can be like....hey bro! I'm literally gonna murder u right now (not serious, joking) and he'd probably just accept it. I dont abuse how he is...I just really wish he wasn't like that. I appreciate blunt honesty and he called my last boyfriend verbally abusive....because if I told my ex (YO! I'm gonna go do heroin!) He would tell me that's absolutely dumb and doesn't think that's a good idea. But he thinks being blunt is being emotionally abusive. I really hate it. I guess I am just a big brute.

I have been with my girlfriend for almost 3 years now our anniversary is coming up in July and she is a HUGE Harry Potter fan. Now the latest Harry Potter was a play so there is a Broadway showing of it and my brilliant idea was to get tickets for her and i was planning on proposing after the show. I had this plan all worked out in my head. I worked double shifts at my job for two months straight to be able to afford these tickets and I got them. But here's where the terrible part comes in. I bought them on a day she will be out of town. I know cue eyerolls and everything. I also could only get the tickets on stubhub and the way they work is I cannot cancel the order if i need to switch em I need to resell them and then buy them for the correct day. This is my major major problem. Basically after my long winded sappy story I just need a kind soul to please purchase these tickets for me so I can afford to switch them at this point Im stuck. So if your feeling generous please help me out. Added bonus of helping me out you can see what I presume to be an awesome show. Thanks for listening to my story if everything works out i will update if she said yes or not.

12,"What's up reddit.  I'm a working college student enrolled in online courses.  I work at a flight school as a flight instructor / lower manager.  I have no problem doing the work the professor assigns in a reasonable amount of time.  I don't spend more than 8 hours on end doing college work unless I'm really behind on assignments.  So you could say I'm keeping my head above the water.  Anywho, I'm currently in a boss fight type of essay for my grade level (sophomore / junior-ish), it's a 15 page semester-long research paper that has all sorts of fucky rules that the professor is making the students write under.  No problem, I can deal with rules and stick with the rubric.  

Fast forward to today, I had to submit an outline and 5 page sample of my almost complete research paper.  I quote from the assignment rubric:
*When you initially use a source in a paper, you need to establish the author's credibility and provide the author's full name to your readers. After introducing your source, you present the source by summary, paraphrase, or quotation and then note that the source use is finished with an in-text citation (author, year, p.). Finally, you should discuss, analyze, comment upon sources you have presented.*

*Rules of thumb for source usage in your paper are as follows: 50% of the paper should be your own analysis, commentary, discussion, and argumentation while the other 50% may come from sources. Of that 50% of source use, only 10-15% should be direct quotes; the remaining 35-40 of source use will mainly be by summary and paraphrase.*  

After submitting my work today, a switch flipped in my head.  Through all of these essays I've completed with my head held high, half-assed, and even quarter-assed, the professors all need you to essentially summarize sources. It's all starting to be come the same process for me.  I feel like I've been droning on doing the same shit over and over again.    

look up sources  
ok lets use my own experience as a source  
my own experience and insights aren't posted online in a scholarly article  
find bullshit articles that are vaguely related to the thesis  
write out rough outline on paper  
google docs

I just feel like you can't say anything in a paper nowadays without having some scholarly peer reviewed source saying the exact same thing.  I prefer to let my experience in my field of work talk on the paper.  I feel like I'm providing real, breathing information when I do work this way.

I don't really like it there, i mean, it's a great school and all, but, it's far away from home and i have to take a bus, i'm not used to it, it's hard for me. And there are my classmates. 

I'm very shy, my social skills suck, and i haven't really made friends there. I try, but, i don't want to come off as a weirdo or insistent. I feel like they don't like me. Because of that, i have missed school A LOT. I know it doesn't help, but, i don't feel comfortable there, it's weird. I have constant anxiety crisis, i even take prescribed medication.

14,"I recently had an incident with my senior colleague. I called our cafeteria to check if our daily club activities is already posted on our bulletin board. 
I rang, a man answered the phone (in a heavy tone), I sort of lower my voice than the usual and jokingly said there is no need to scream (I know he wasn't literally screaming but when you are on the other line, it sounded like a scream already, loud voice whatever you call it). He got so mad and said, I wasn't screaming, I just answered the phone ""repeating hello on the same tone over and over again"" 
I thought, maybe he is just having a bad day. I let it go and I said, Okay. I'm sorry. He then asked me ""who is this anyway?"" I told my name and he replied, what you need? Now I am screaming because I am already angry. So, I am surprised he got so mad, but I still chose to calm down (I too am mad already), I told him, if you could kindly check if daily club activities is already on the board? 
I'm not sure if he did check it or not but he just said (In an angry mood and still on the same tone from the very beginning, can't seem to notice the difference on his voice) ""no, can't see anything here. So, I ended up with ""okay, thanks"" and he said, ok bye. That's it. 

A few minutes later, my supervisor called. She said that the man called (with a name this time) and told her to tell me not to be rude on the phone. I tried to explain myself but the supervisor just told me that when I see him I should apologized. All my energy that day just flew away. I feel cheated. Then everyone talks about it in the cafeteria and I just ignore them. When they ask me what happen I would simple say ""whatever he said, that's it"" because if I will tell my side of the story, I don't think they will believe me. They will just twist it, add it, minus it. Whatever. They already thought I was the rude one. 

Now, my problem is. I can't stop thinking about it and I want to stop thinking about but I don't know how to. 

I'm very bad at story telling. ",06Mar2018,5
16,"""Frankly, the United States is under attack,"" said Dan Coats, Director of National Intelligence, before Congress on February 13, 2018.^1 Coats later added that Russia is attempting to ""degrade our democratic values and weaken our alliances."" NSA Director Mike Rogers was also present and said that, ""This is not going to stop or change.""^1

The question is, how should social media users and platforms (esp. reddit), along with the government as related to social media, respond? 

Some context - 

Propaganda has become incredibly sophisticated, and the lack of transparency and accountability on social media allows it to flourish unimpeded. For example, all of the Facebook pages (ie 'Blacktivist,' 'Being Patriotic,' 'Secured Borders,' 'United Muslims of America') that Russian troll farms made during the 2016 election to encourage Americans to fight each other and rage.^2 And rage we did.^3

There is now hard evidence that foreign troll farms have been aggressively operating on Reddit.^4,5 As the US intelligence community has said, there is no reason to believe that they have stopped or have any intention of ever ceasing operations.^6 They must be fought against at some level to save social media, which has become so important to the social fabric of America. 

Social media platforms, especially Reddit, understandably rely on voluntary mods for cost-effective moderation. However, there's no transparency when it comes to moderating Reddit. Mods on sites like Reddit and Facebook are random strangers who could be anybody, making whatever rules they want, and they have the power to promote/censor any posts or comments. And the troll farms know this and are almost certainly abusing the system, along with the usual fare of bot networks and posting propagandist content. 

Beyond troll farms directly controlling mod accounts, the corruption of mods would most likely happen through bribery or doxxing them and then blackmailing; things the Russian oligarchy is especially good at.^7,8

Social media platforms have so far failed to succesfully self-regulate to combat these issues. Meanwhile, the federal government moves slower than molasses, both by design and partisan gridlock. Congress and the executive branch have failed to adapt quickly enough to the Information Age, especially in regard to social media. And users' efforts have been overwhelmed by the intensity of these issues. How should we go forward?

22,"I've been on Reddit for 7 years and as of today I'm done. Ish. 

I was inspired by [this article about the latest outrage against admins](https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/reddit-users-demand-ban-r-the-donald/), but mostly I was getting frustrated with the comments I was seeing in the sub it was posted. ""Boycott Reddit gold!"" and then immediately someone gives them Reddit gold for their troubles, highlighting how ineffective such a boycott would be.

Only by boycotting Reddit can we actually pressure admins to do anything about the problem. So, I made a subreddit for it. /r/the_migration - and why not boycott Reddit itself? Because it's too hard?

Well, I quit once, so I figured I'd share that on the sub. And then I wrote a bunch and figured I'd share it some more to promote the sub. So, here's what happened back around when /r/shitredditsays was a big deal and I was part of that scene.

Don't get me wrong, I have fond memories of that community. It was the boogywoman of the internet and I loved it. Met a lot of online friends there and ultimately grew out of social justice war there. But, back in the heyday of SRS there was a movement within the ""fempire of subs"" to migrate away from the site to an offsite safe haven. That was when SRS was growing fast and seemingly was behind everything, and I think we let that go to our heads. The offsite never really took off like some envisioned.

The Fempire may have been a bust, but I still wasn't going back to Reddit. I hung around Tumblr and 4chan and various IRCs for a few years, missing a lot of the really big drama that happened in that time. So many of SRS's sworn enemies were banned in that time, which I think contributed to their decline. Without the antags, only the most diehard users stuck around I guess. I shouldn't speculate, I stopped being part of that community a while ago. Maybe it's great now, who knows

I came back to Reddit for the Sander's campaign, and got sucked right back into the site.

And now I'm seeing the same problems that have always been on Reddit, but this time feels different. It might be the admin favoritism, or the botting and vote manipulation, or the foreign influence and astroturfing, or the cross-site contamination from /pol/, but t_d feels like a different beast from the stuff back in the SRS days. Not just vile, but bigger and more energetic than the hatesubs that came before it.

So, I made /r/the_migration. Which is hypocritical and very Reddity, but hey, I've been here 7 years after all. Actually, it's funny. I've been on this site for 7 years and I've never tried to actually run a community. This won't really count, since ""members"" are just going to leave, but it's still a milestone. 

Weird.

Anyway, if you plan on leaving Reddit, or you just want to wish people luck, come by. Maybe you want to come back when (not if, when) t_d is gone, or maybe you want to leave forever because this is the last straw. Either way, I hope you share your stories and wish you good luck on where ever you go.",06Mar2018,0

One of the biggest technological developments that has been known to become extremely popular over the last 40 years is the active playing of electronic video games. Most contemporary video games have been viewed as bad for society. Many people believe that video games are just a waste of time and do not contribute to anything except leisure. The morality of playing violent video games has also been a topic that many parents are also concerned with. Even though parents are concerned with the health detriment and violent behavior addressed with playing those games, there is a good amount of brain nurturing that comes along with them as well. I believe that video games are far more important to this society than most would say. People who play games regularly contain a unique, knowledgeable set of characteristics compared to someone who doesn’t. Video games are assisting to create a better society for humans if regulated and dealt with intelligently.

Video games are said to be bad for many reasons. One main reason they are said to be bad is they are known to increase the percentage of obesity in children from ages one to twelve1. People who have become obese by playing video games have become obese because they play video games too often and probably don’t work out or eat well. Another main reason for video games being bad is that they are said to contribute to aggressive behavior and bad language of children. For example, many video games like Call of Duty have many cuss words said when something bad happens; when the children hear those words consistently they are more likely to develop vulgar language. Children who have developed aggressive behavior from video games are probably receiving poor parenting. Parents who let their children play violent video games without explaining to them how to interpret these violent video games are a big reason of why these games contribute more to violent behavior. A very significant reason video games are known as bad is the internal health detriments it causes: such as deficiency of vitamin D, bad posture, and tendonitis. But again, this is due to the overuse of video games, especially in poorly lighted rooms. Without proper regulation and self-control, video games can be harmful to the body and perhaps even harmful to those close to you.

Playing video games with appropriate management and discipline can increase numerous contributions to your health and people who you are close with. These electronic games can be good for your brain, eyesight, emotions, motivation, cognitive functions, and social interactions2. Video games such as action-packed, shooter games like the famous Call of Duty have been said to increase eyesight, hand eye coordination, concentration, accuracy, situational awareness, mapping, and reasoned judgements2. Online video games like this contain a social aspect as well that requires the support of a team to be able to achieve victory. The social cooperation of a well-coordinated team is a positive factor for social interactions among gamers. Even though the players aren’t communicating face-to-face and eye-to-eye, they are becoming better collaborators by communicating efficiently in order to achieve a certain goal. The more people that become better collaborators, the more people will help contribute to a better society. For example in a work place environment there is a need for collaboration between employees so the business can function appropriately and more efficiently.

Another game that has a great impact on people is one called Minecraft. This nostalgic game is a great way to exercise creativity, intelligence, and time management. In Minecraft you can build many things with blocks, which works out your originality and imagination, while trying to survive in an area inhabited by dangerous creatures that come out at dusk. This game lets players create surroundings and tools that benefit them and help them survive, strategize, and explore in the infinite world of Minecraft. With a practice commonly associated with Legos, players use block structures to come up with clever, intellectual designs. This game also calls for a good amount of time management. As the player has a time limit before their character starves to death. In order to keep their character alive they must gather food either from animals or from crops that they planted. The children of the 21st century are certainly fortunate to have been able to grow up playing this game compared to when video games were not as complex.

Video games back in the 1980s were very simple compared to the games of today. The old games didn’t take as much concentration and critical thinking as contemporary games did. They also didn’t take more than one hand and sometimes not more than one finger to play. Games such as Pong, which was first invented in the1970s, was like a 2D Tennis match on a television. In this game, two humans play against each other, each with one joy stick to control their player, while present day controllers have up to 15 buttons, which demands the practice of hand-eye coordination and critical thinking. In addition, older games had less objects moving on the screen simultaneously. Many of today’s players can keep track of more than 10 objects at once, helping improve the player’s situational awareness, and reflexes. So because the games today are more complex, they are improving people more, which contributes to a better society compared to when games were simple, by increasing certain characteristics like situational awareness in places such as on the road while driving. For example someone driving, who has a better awareness of their surroundings will have a better chance of avoiding an accident, than someone who does not have a good amount of knowledge of what surrounds them.

The morality side of playing certain video games is another aspect to how video games contribute to the society. The realistic, violent video games are the main reason of why people look at video games as immoral. Seeing a virtual player shoot or kill another realistic looking player can be viewed as corrupt but only if the person playing the game can’t fully register that all games are not real life and should never be compared to real life. This comes back to the attention of parents. Parents should only allow their child to play violent video games if they know their child is mature enough to know the difference between reality and virtual reality.

With proper management, video games are a contribution to our society. Our society has been viewed by many people as declining because of these electronic video games. However, the society we live in is going to keep on improving with more technology. The more people are exposed to technology, the more the society will advance because the more humans are exposed to something, the more they are able to learn. The way society advances is by learning new things in new ways and applying them to the world. For example the brain exercise that comes from action video games is beneficial to people that are in professions that require precise hand control, such as laparoscopic surgeons3.

27,"Hello, I’m a 17 year old girl. I haven’t had quite a normal or ideal life so far. I just need somewhere to write this all out, because I’ve never done that before. Warning, it’s long. 

Until the age of about 11, I had a pretty great life. However, I spent my 11th birthday in the hospital with my father as he was suffering, and almost died, from pancreatitis. I honestly wish he would’ve died then. He was there for a total of 11 days. We learned that he would have to be on pain pills for the rest of his life. 

Of course, this was the beginning of the end. He soon began abusing these pain pills (he also got more than he should, illegally) and drinking heavily (which he was not supposed to do at all; he suffered from 3 conditions that you cannot drink alcohol with). Eventually, after falling into the pit of addiction and causing absolute deterioration of his health, he took his own life with a gun when I was 14. 

This was obviously very difficult for my mom, my brother, and me. My dad’s side (even my only living grandparent) of the family cut us off soon after the funeral. I haven’t spoken to them since, but they recently reached out and stay in contact with my older brother (but not me). 

My mom remarried too quickly. My dad died in January 2015, she was engaged that Christmas, and got married May 2016. My mom promised not to move my brother and me, but my stepdad did not move either. After almost 2 years, he still lives in a separate house from us that’s an hour and 45 minutes away. 

Almost every weekend since then, my mom has left me and my older brother to go visit him. My brother is rarely home which means I have been spending Fridays and Saturdays alone for almost 2 years. I can drive now, which makes things easier though. 

I often avoid telling people about this because I think it’s so embarrassing. My mom goes back and forth between saying she’s going to divorce him and saying they’re working things out. She’s constantly complaining about him to the point where I can barely even be around her. He has worn her out and she’s not the person she used to be.

My mom said she married him to give my brother and me a father. My stepdad is the farthest thing from a father you could ever imagine. He has no children of his own and cannot comprehend what it’s like to have children. He has no sympathy for what my family has been through and thinks that because I have him as a stepdad, it no longer matters that my father, whom I loved, dearly killed himself. 

For the past few months, I’ve been struggling with horrible depression and anxiety. I’m constantly afraid that I’m going to lose everyone I love or they’re going to leave me because I’m not good enough. It’s so bad that my only goals in life right now are:  Graduate high school, get into college, and not kill myself. That’s it. Nothing else matters to me. I do my schoolwork, then I climb into bed and do absolutely nothing for the rest of the day. 

I recently had to drop out of my regular high school to do online school. I was #1 in my class and could’ve been valedictorian, but I had to give it up due to depression and anxiety. I hate myself for that. 

Looking back, I think it’s all tied to the unfortunate circumstances of my past. However, I feel like it has f*cked me up for life. I feel like I haven’t matured normally or learned the skills I need to be successful in life. I don’t think I can recover at this point even though I know I’m still young. 

I isolate myself and push everyone away to avoid being hurt. I can love others, but I cannot stand being loved by them without the crippling fear that they will abandon me. I don’t even like being seen anymore. I want to give up. ",06Mar2018,7

34,"Throughout my childhood I developed a very rosy view of the world. I can honestly say it was close to the perfect upbringing. The house I grew up in was the definition of comfortable suburbia. My school attracted some of the best teachers, yet we still had the opportunity to play sport and pray in shiny multi-million dollar buildings. My friends were close - when we had shared moments stretching back to nearly the beginning of our lives. I never struggled academically: getting my final school marks was honestly anti-climactic as i’d studied so much that I never doubted i’d get into biomedicine, a subject with the highest minimum required score in my country. 

The perfect house, the perfect school, the perfect marks, the perfect friends.

The one thing I lacked in my childhood, however, was a abscence of failure. In Harry Potter, the bogart will take the form of the nearest person’s deepest fears. For me it wouldn’t be something out of a horror film, or a huge arachnoid. No, for me it has always been a fear of rejection. 

It’s honestly crippling, because unless what i’m doing goes absolutely perfectly, i’ll always feel like i’m failing. It has hurt me in every space of my life. My relationships with women have largely been safe, and sparse. I never initiate. I literally will not act on my feelings unless she makes herself vulnerable and makes the first move on me. My career has lead me to a dead end, because I was too afraid of being rejected by people or companies.  I spent three grueling years in biomedicine, grinding through subjects that I knew I couldn’t see myself doing for the next decade. I spent three more years realising medicine was quite possibly the worst career I could have entered.  If i’d stepped out of that comfortable bubble for just a second, and tried something that wasn’t medicine, maybe i’d be much happier now. It’s been a recurrent theme throughout my life, this fear of rejection.  I’d rarely speak up in class, for fear of looking stupid, even if I knew the answer and had done double the work of anyone else.  My philosophy teacher in high school would often relay this to my parents, Mr L would tell them that “J has so many great ideas in his head.  Yet he never takes the initiative to explain them. Only when prompted will he ever speak. I think not only the class but J as well would benefit from speaking his thoughts more often.”

 That word, initiative, has dogged me throughout my life. I hate it because I never understood why I can’t just do it.  Just do something, anything.  I think i’ve come to understand it now - a lack of initiative was merely symptomatic of an inability to be imperfect. If I spoke up and mumbled something incomprehensible, or mispronounced a word it would honestly wreck me. My heart would palpate and i’d get dizzy before I said anything, in the rare moments i’d decide to share something to the class. This was because, whilst for most people a simple throwaway comment in class was not a big deal, for me the whole philosophy that I based every decision on was at stake, the image that I was perfect, and that anything but perfect was a failure. Much better to remain silent, and let the illusion of perfection persist for a little while longer. I’d only let that inner part of me out in carefully, excruciatingly curated snippets.  A essay here and a compulsory debate there. I would never let anyone see through my meticulously planned exterior to let my true self show. Perhaps that’s why I liked STEM subjects more than humanities, because i’d never have to be vulnerable and expose my personality, never have to show that i’m just like everyone else with imperfections and weaknesses.

So this is a new beginning, it’s the start of a lifetime of resilience. For me the first step towards being resilient is not about recovering from failure.  It’s allowing myself to fail in the first place and to not dodge every opportunity for failure. It might take years to undo decades of conditioning and sure someone different might do it faster or earlier. Thats okay though, because it’s okay to be imperfect.

It’s okay to just be. ",06Mar2018,4

40,"Basically a rant. Bitch steals from business account and lies about it. 


A friend and I had decided to start a small baking business from our homes together. We got a joint account so we could eventually open a store front and buy commercial equipment.

Most of the deposits were from me. I was doing most of the delivering so I'd get the money.

So recently I got a full time job in another field which left me unable to participate in our business any longer. I was supposed to go to one last event to help but she decided on her own to tell me I didn't need to come and could she pickup the large wedding cake stands.

Well, if you're basically claiming all the business assets then I want my share of what's in the bank accounts.

I log in and the amount is way lower than I remember. She says oh that's because I bought something for the event. (she had originally told me a family member had one we could borrow). Ok then, I want what would have been half before you bought that. But as I look over the other purchases fast food places and gas pop up. There is no reason that should be on there, it's a baking business with minimal travel.

She claims her husband took that card by accident (they bank there personally as well). So for the past 2 months he has been buying just fast food, gas and doing grocery shopping. If you knew them you know he doesn't do the grocery shopping. She says she didn't realize he was using it because she doesn't check our account often. Totally plausible, until you see she has moved $300 twice in the past month from savings to checking. If he was using it and didn't know... Then how come you put a business expense on it after all those ""oops"" purchases? 

If you didn't know he was using it why did you move $600 over? Supplies for the event... $600 worth? This thing is only estimated to be 100-200 people. I've been doing this awhile, there is no way you need that much money, especially being the coupon/bargain shopper that she is.

She ""offers"" to take the fast food and gas out of her half... Leaving me with $300. I couldn't do anything that night, but I went in the morning to close the account, I was not leaving her in charge of a bank account with my name on it. $444. That's it. She spent almost $600. Honestly about 75% of what was in there was deposited by me, because I did the bulk of the work. Most of the time I baked and decorated everything. But I knew we were trying for something bigger so I added to it. 

She would have me drive to her house to deco cakes for her family, I didn't compensation for that. I saw no deposits into the account for those cakes. 

As soon as she found out I closed the account she deleted me on fb, took me off as Admin on the business page. I took that as a clear admission of guilt. She's still using my photos I had on there to promote the business. I designed the logo as well. We all know fb customer service sucks so I can't even take my stuff down.",06Mar2018,9
41,"I was building a foundation for our us, our family, but I forgot to take care of you, my love. I lost the love of my life after 12 years because I was chasing success and money.

Is your health important? Yes, I would give up all the money in the world to see you happy and healthy.

Do I want to start a family with you? Yes, I day dream about this a lot, but I don’t know why I couldn’t ever express this to you.

Do I have time for you, us? Yes, that’s why I fight the fight, to survive life. You are my everything.

Why did I stress you out? Because I was worried about the future, but you were right, we had enough to be happy and I should’ve a open conversation about it. I f-up.

Did I f-up? Yes, I put our life on hold to chase something that doesn’t mean anything to me, without you.

Why did I chase money and success? I chased success because I was constantly worried about our future. I realise it wasn’t worth worrying about, if a future with you didn’t exist.

Let’s go to therapy. I want nothing more then to continue to working us.

How are you feeling?
Is everything okay with you, us?
What are your goals?
Do you need anything from me?
What can we do to improve our communication?
Is there anything I am doing that your unhappy about?
What’s some underlying issue we had that was never addressed?
Please tell me about your pain?

I understand why you did what you did. I do not blame you for leaving, for giving up. I was flawed.

The other job: localizing video games for one of the big Japanese video game companies. (No offer, but I have a connection offering to introduce me to some higher ups ‘if you ever get bored of your current job’)

Pros:
* Be living a dream from my teenage years that I always thought would be just a daydream fantasy
* Probably less stressful
* Wouldn’t have to deal with shitty clients
* Probably better resourced and more work that requires collaboration and teamwork
* The other company would probably take personal development more seriously and also enable me to develop into areas that aren’t localization
* Far better environment/job to improve my Japanese 
* I’ve been reading reddit posts about people following their dreams and not regretting it even if they ‘failed’
* Changing jobs would escape being under resourced and over burdened at the now job (likely isn’t going to change any time soon)
* It seems like it’s a life experience and maybe one day I can be like ‘yeah I spent a few years in Japan making games for SE’ and I think people would be impressed 
* Maybe I’d regret it if I didn’t?

Cons:
* My salary would take a huge hit, likely drop by 40% or more
* My now job has an excellent salary and career trajectory - leaving it would have a long lasting impact well into the future
* I can very easily take experience from my now job back to Australia; localization experience is far less valuable
* Changing jobs would have a lasting impact on my investments, even potentially impacting my retirement
* Grass is greener syndrome: doesn’t everyone hate some part of their jobs? There’s no guarantee that the ‘other’ job will be better or live up to my expectations. If I move and find it’s also bad what’s my plan then - move back? (Not gonna happen)

50,"We used to think obsolescence was absolute. When something became obsolete, it disappeared and was never seen again. That belief is tightly bound with the belief in progress, in which ever-better new things keep replacing old things that weren't as good.

But a lot of people, including high-profile professional talkers who are paid to be the voices of the powerful interests who pay them, have been openly saying for about 10 years that we were naive about progress. New is not always better, and old is not always worse. It's a lot more complicated than that. New things usually have some better quality than old things, such as use of resources available today, but also always lack some good quality of old things. Many people now believe that, while it's important to keep having new things, old things are far from entirely worthless.

This has led to the emergence of visible niches for old things. The niches are relatively small and obscure, but they exist. Factories have started pressing small numbers of new vinyl records for a niche market. An old boss of mine had designs for 1930s vintage cars used to make brand new custom cars for his collection, but with modern features such as air conditioning. In other areas, Jesuits are not the continental power they once were, but there are new Jesuits being ordained every year. Armenia is so far from being the small empire it was around 200 BCE that it's not officially a separate country, but there is still an Armenian identity. Eighteenth-century American Liberalism (now called Libertarianism without other significant changes) is still a going concern in niches, as is Marxism (there are still even Marxist university professors!). Schools generally don't teach cursive to their pupils, but if you want to learn calligraphy, you can learn it and find uses for it. And there are still people who can read, write--and speak!--good Latin.

Maybe things have always been this way because social practices become entrenched over time and then simply do not completely die out. And today's atomized world of mutual isolation is an especially rich growth medium for small niches, so we'll probably see more old things visibly enduring in those niches after they have been supplanted in the mainstream by new things.

53,"Nobody willingly started existing. We're just here because a sperm went inside an ovule. We didn't ask for it. 

I believe that life isn't as precious as people make it out to be. We live in one of the infinite universes. Everyone will die one day and the universe won't notice. We're literally some worthless creatures which can think only because we learned how to cook meat (according to evolution theory). We all think we are soooo important because we have self-consciousness, because we have people who care about us, because we have a home, a car, a personal life. I believe that our perceptions about ourselves and the world around us are mere illusions created by our mind and survival instincts.

That's why I believe we shouldn't be too worried about our future. This sounds like something a teenager would say, right? Well, you're right. I'm 17. But give me a chance and let me explain myself. In the end, that's what this subreddit is for, right?

I witnessed a car crash which involved a friend walking when the red light(for pedestrians) was on and a car that was a bit fast last summer. He barely survived, thankfully he's recovering now. Until that incident, I haven't thought about life and death. I was more into theology. I would spend hours researching different religions and their views about God, which was something I did since I was 13. I live in Turkey and I used to identify myself as Muslim so doing that was an eye-opener for me. Things would be different if I didn't have a curious personality. However, after the crash happened, I realized that religions only give people false purposes to live. They say that if you believe in their God and do their rituals, you'll feel closer to God and He will give you his love. You'll love living, because God is life. 

I don't buy that anymore. The line between life and death is so thin that we usually ignore it and pretend we'll live forever. Religions support that mindset by creating the idea of an afterlife or reincarnation. In my opinion, we only keep living because our brain is literally programmed by billions of years of evolution process to survive and reproduce. The problem with accepting that is it leaves no space for meaning and motivation. That's why I went through a period of trying to find something I can cling to to give life a meaning. I'm not saying I was suicidal or anything, because since life is meaningless, it doesn't really matter if you kill yourself or not. I was just generally unmotivated and unhappy.

And then I realized something: I don't really need a purpose to live. I can solely live because of the things I enjoy doing. Sure, they're basically just distractors to keep you from thinking about subjects that have no definitive answers but I feel OK with that. I attend to one of the top schools in my country and my grades are just fine. I believe I'd be the typical straight A student if I lived in USA. So I allow myself to get motivated with my grades, no matter how wrong or unjust the entire education system is. My dream is to study CS in Germany, a country I think that is suitable for me because of the whole social state thing. I stayed in Munich for three months (language course) and it was a nice experience. Other than that, I love reading books. I have a Kindle Paperwhite for that. I love my digital music archive. They're pirated, sure, but I can't find 250 GBs of music in CD format even if I want to. I'm getting into Mahjong. I love smoking cigarettes. I love how they taste and feel. I'm planning to buy an e-cigarette when I have a job though, they're too expensive for me right now since they're illegal in Turkey(It's basically a black market product. Even some policemen vape, so legality isn't that big of an issue but they're twice as expensive than the normal price). We have the shittiest weed ever, so I don't plan on trying marijuana until I turn 18 and visit Amsterdam. I'm sure I'll love that too.

What I'm trying to say is, I feel like I'm not that 14 years old, anti-drug, study-a-cholic, stressful kid that would hesitate to drink beer anymore. I'm much more laid back and generally happier. Of course I sometimes cringe and feel depressed when I see news like ""Netflix will be controlled by [Radio and Television Supreme Council
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_and_Television_Supreme_Council) because of the inappropriate content. We have to protect our kids."", but these news now bother me less. I can't do anything about it so I'll just focus on myself and protect myself from the protectors. That's what I should do. I should climb to the top of Maslow's Pyramid. I should live one day at a time. I should worry less about how to raise my potential kids and how to beat the lung cancer I may get when I turn 50. The only thing that I should worry about is my dog next to me, waiting for me to take him outside for a walk. Of course I should plan my future, but that doesn't mean I should stop enjoying this moment. I'm currently writing this and **this** is the meaning of life for me until I hit the ""submit"" button. Writing about myself like this is enjoyable as fuck, it makes me feel alive, and enjoyments like this are what life is all about. I can die 10 minutes later by getting hit by a car, but I feel happy right now, so that can wait.

I just had enough and realised I don't have to be friendless &amp; slightly overweight forever. I'm going to take control of my life again, instead of playing the victim. ",06Mar2018,53

69,"I've been really into drawing since I was young, but once I went to college and took a few classes and learned real techniques, the ""magic"" kinda faded. I'm not super into it anymore and everyone expects me to be a rich, famous artist.

I thought about getting into other hobbies, like music production and sewing and making video games, but as soon as I understood any of those topics enough to remove the mystery, I lost interest.

I think I only like exploring and discovering the unknown, but that is really unhelpful in the real world, like when looking for direction. Or a job.

What keeps you guys interested in things?

Edit: I honestly did not expect this many replies - my posts usually fall down the drain. Thank you all for chatting with me! I feel a lot less lonely. I'll try to respond as time permits.

To steer the conversation in the right direction, some of you have gleaned that by ""understanding something"" I meant that I totally understand everything and am an expert. That's obviously quite naive. To give an example of what I mean, music was so intriguing to me - what makes people feel and groove a certain way, etc. but as soon as I grasped the basic understanding of the mathematics behind music - waveforms and time signatures and what chords elicit what feelings, to briefly name a few concepts - I kind of thought, ""Oh, that's what it's all about? Well... shucks.""  Obviously I know there's oodles more to learn in that field, but to me, that dissolved a lot of the ""magic.""",06Mar2018,157
