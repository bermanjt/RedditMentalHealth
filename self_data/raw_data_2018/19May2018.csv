0,"So I fell for my best friend a while back. Like stupidly, to the point where it was all I could think about for months on end and I hung out with her at every opportunity. She has a boyfriend, and so I knew if I told her things wouldn’t be the same between us, but I couldn’t deal with being that close with her and just ignoring how I feel. So I told her. She told me she never thought of me that way, that her boyfriend is her priority and that she thinks this complicates our friendship too much. We both decided it was best if we take a step back and stop talking to each other. To add to that, I ran into her boyfriend and while he was mostly cool with me, he told me that he doesn’t know if she’d ever talk to me again, but if she does he warned me that we have to be just friends, nothing more. I told him he has nothing to worry about.

Fast forward two months later. I felt like I was slowly getting over her. I mean I think about her all the time, and sometimes I’d want nothing more than to talk to her, but I was determined not to contact her. The thing is about a week ago she messages me. She tells me she’s sorry about how things ended between us, that she’s had a really shitty time since we stopped talking, that she misses me and that she needs me to be in her life because she didn’t realise how much I meant to her. While this brought all the emotions back to the surface for me, I decide to just try be a good friend and tell her I’m there for her. I know how depressed she can get sometimes, and she seemed really upset. She was arguing with her parents all the time, she’d fell out with a few of her friends (including me I suppose), and she was sure her and her boyfriend were gonna split up that day. I didn’t want to abandon her when she was so lonely.

So we talked. And things weren’t even awkward at all. She went and met with her boyfriend, prepared for a break up, but came back and told me that they’re fine now and the argument was resolved. For about another day we talked normally, and then all of a sudden she just ignored one of my messages. Then when I tried to talk to her later she was only giving me one word replies.

The day after that she was full on ignoring anything I sent her, and I noticed she deleted our Twitter conversation (the ‘read’ sign changed to simply ‘delivered’). The last two days I’ve tried to reach out to her a couple of times and she’s just ignored me completely. In the space of a few days she’s went from telling me how much she needs me in her life, begging me to be friends with her again, to blatantly ignoring me with no explanation at all for her behaviour.

I’d been getting over it, and now I’m back to square one with her running through my head constantly, trying to figure out what the hell her deal is. I’ve considered everything. Maybe she’s still going through shit and doesn’t want to talk, maybe she doesn’t want her boyfriend to know she reached out to me. Maybe she regrets the whole thing and doesn’t want to be friends anymore, or maybe she simply needed someone to be there for her, and knowing how I feel she knew I’d try make her feel better, and afterwards she didn’t need me anymore. Maybe she thought she’d be single and I was her ‘backup’ or something. Maybe she realised how I’d feel and is trying to just cut contact again to save me the pain. I honestly don’t know, and I don’t want to ask because what’s the point? I’m just gonna get dragged into some argument with her which is the last thing I want. At the same time though I think I deserve an explanation at the very least, cause right now she’s just fucking with my head.

I was doing okay without her in my life, and now I’m right back to fucking square one. I know she felt vulnerable and needed a friend, but she knows how I feel and he has to know how the way she’s acting is gonna make me feel. Since she’s been ignoring me I’ve decided just to not contact her again unless she reaches out first, but I hate that things are like this between us. Before we separated with no malice, just both of us accepting that’s how things have to be. Now there’s just awkwardness and tension, and like we left a million things unsaid. I feel like an idiot.",19May2018,1

So, about an hour and a half away from my hometown is a bigger city similar to Columbus. Its a medium size city and it’s known for two things; the university in the middle of town, and the massive amount of drugs that pass through on their way south. A few years ago, when I was barely 20 I was staying in the city with a woman named “Jessie”. I met her one day after having been up for a week, and I think she took pity on me because I reminded her of someone she knew or something. Regardless of the reason, she took me in and kept me fed and sheltered. She paid the rent and electric and was like a second mother to me. I suppose that made her my dope mom. Anyway.

Along with Jessie, there was another guy that stayed with us off and on, we’ll call him “Tyler”. We shared a room and even though he was gay and I wasn’t, the two of us shared a queen size mattress with Jessie after her clients had left and she had changed the sheets. We all got along pretty well, not because we really talked all that much, just mostly because I’d be up while they were nodded out, so I pretty much did what I wanted while they slept. I usually just stayed in bed and watched Netflix while I kept an eye on them. We had a scare with Ty one day where Jessie woke up and he was purple-blue. She jabbed him with adrenaline shots and we carried him in the hospital. He came stumbling back in the apartment door a week later, ready to go again.

I wonder a lot what happened to them.

One day Ty and I had to go get some toilet paper and water for Jessie. He went in while I waited out front, paranoid we were being followed by spies in the trees. As I kept watch, one of the most amazing cars I had ever seen pulled up. I have no idea what the model was but I know the make was Bugatti. I stared as an unbelievably tall white guy with a long blonde pony tail, and wearing flip-flops and no shirt jumped out, leaving it running with the soft top down. As he walked in he saw Ty walk up and asked,

“Is he with you?” as the man pointed at me.

“Yeah, he’s cool man.”

“Good” he said, then he turned to me, “here go ahead and take a look.” He said casually.

I tried to contain myself as he tossed me the keys and I made my way over to the car. There were two of the most stunning women I’ve ever seen in real life in the back. I’m talking Victoria’s Secret Angels pretty. They giggled and waved me over, I carefully climbed in and wiggled my way between them. That’s pretty much where I remained for the next ten minutes while Ty and the guy did business behind the Dollar store. The car was almost as beautiful as the women. In the dark it was hard to tell but it was a darker color maybe like a midnight blue. The inside was the softest leather, with those faint lights under the dash that remind me of mood lights. The wheel looked like either wood or very convincing faux, and the back seat felt like I was floating on a cloud. It was amazing.

I sat and listened to the girls chatter, mumbling things only they understood and just tried to soak in the moment. I closed my eyes and pretended that life was better. I pretended that just for a moment, I wasn't an addict, but was instead a CEO of a major company and that these two women weren't dope fiends, but were independent women working as my advisors, and that I had just stopped in this lot to consider purchasing the franchise.

My day dreaming was cut short when I saw them start down the side of the building, back toward the parking lot, I saw the guy smile and wave me over so I turned and said bye to the girls. As I got out one of them reached her hand out and patted my cheek while the other one blew me a kiss. I stepped out and returned the keys. The guy slapped me on the shoulder and said, “be good kid.” Then he hoped over the door and into the driver’s seat, speeding away.

“You know who that was right dog?” Ty asked.

I stared at him and shrugged. How would I know?

“Dog, that was” he trailed off. “Dog that was THE dude around here. Like, he’s big shit man.”

“Huh.” I replied.

Well, I guess that explained the car and the girls.

What the fuck was I doing with my life?

And as far as the driver of the car, I never saw him again so I have no idea who he actually was, and I cut off everyone I knew back then so I often wonder what happened to them all. I like to think they all got cleaned up and are working decent jobs. Sometimes ignorant fantasy really is blissfully better.",19May2018,1
13,"In 2013 I was hit head-on by a young girl that crossed the median of an interstate here in NJ. We both survived, but I spent 16 days in the hospital and 12 weeks in a wheel chair waiting to heal.

Well, not the actual tracks from that day, but a ghost of them. It seems that the new grass that has grown in the tracks is a different color...plain as day.                                   Sure, I’d like to have a picture of them, but as it’s an interstate, I’d be risking my life to even try, which of course I never would...but wouldn’t that be ironic if I got killed trying to get a pic of evidence of something that should have killed me but didn’t?

I have helped them out with so much. From helping w farm animals to driving them around. Just doing what they basically ask of me.

But meanwhile, Both my Grandmother and Grandfather go  out of their way to stick up for my pos cousin. They give him money. They’ve given him expensive jewelry, and they go out of the way to always talk about him. They always talk him up to be an amazing guy, and all this other bs. But I know what he’s like and I know it’s not the truth because years of being his friend. (I no longer talk to him either because of his toxic relationship w his s o).

15,"i dont feel like i have any true friends. i had a few friends in high school and college who i thought were ""close"" but after college i've felt so lonely. for some context, i'm 24 fresh outta college, moved to a new city about 9 months ago for a new job and since then i haven't really been able to ""penetrate"" any social circles so to speak. moreover, the people who i thought were my friends don't really feel like my friends. for what it's worth, i'm terrible at conversating over text, and so i don't do it. i don't have any conversations over text except for trivial things and coordinating hangouts. but i feel like everyone around me is always having conversations with different people over text. engaging, stimulating conversations that are helping them develop closer 
friendships with people. maybe this is why distance has made my friends and i grow apart. i just don't know how to keep a conversation going. i'm not witty and i don't feel interesting. 

for example, there's 2 kinds of reactions someone can have to witnessing someone spill their drink:
a) oh darn, no worries i'll help you clean it up (boring)
b) oh wow, that glass of water grew some legs and ran away from ya didnt it (fun)

how do i get into the b mentality who is spontaneous and funny wherever we go ? i think this will help me be more interesting and engaged. 

another thing i've noticed about myself is that i'm incredibly selfish when it comes to my friendships. its not that i don't care about my friends, its that when we are conversating i find myself always trying to find a way to see how the conversation relates to me and how i can respond. i've tried actively listening instead of listening to respond and then i can't really come up with any way to interact, even when i'm only offering questions about themselves it always leads to a dead end... this has me very shook when it comes to my love life and speaking to girls. i try my hardest to just treat them like other people but even still i find myself acting differently around women than when i act normal and comfortable around men. how do i overcome this anxiety and project an authentic image of who i am (at this point i'm really confused as to what kind of personality i want to convey.. )

21,"Hey all 

A little over five months ago I stumbled upon a very funny and clever guy on Twitter. I followed him immediately and soon realized what I had gotten into. As time passed I started to notice how our interests lined up, our opinions on politics and religion also did, and countless other things. That's not to say we don't have our differences, of course. 

A little bit over 2 months ago I finally grew the balls to DM him, telling him how funny I thought he was and we started chatting from there. I'd love to say we hit it off immediately, but we have never really talked about what we thought of eachother. 

I don't even know whether he considers me his friend. I am pretty sure to him I am just another of his other countless followers (~4000) that talk to him. I fear he thinks of me not as his equal. 

I hadn't realized my feelings towards him until that very thought hit me, and I became very sad. He kept on talking to me (even if he messages back once every quarter day or so) so I kinda grew out of it. That is not to say we haven't chatted though! Late at night we sometimes spend half an hour to an hour just talking about random stuff, like our views on different subjects, what are our tastes like, creepy experiences we've had, tech, and so on. We have also gotten introspective and talked about deeply personal subjects and struggles. 

Now, I know this is extremely creepy, but I just can't stop thinking about him. What saddens me the most is the fact we live over 5000 miles away, so it's not like I can just ask him out and go on a date together. I feel like we'll never progress out of this, and I'm bummed.

Just in case, I'm clarifying he's both super gay and super single, since I know some people try and reach the absolutely impossible. 

He's also the man who told me not to fear getting out there and showing myself, and I've made very good friends thanks to his advice. I also fully accepted myself as gay, something I had had trouble with in the past.

I am most likely going on a trip to his country at the end of the year for unrelated reasons, so that gives me a but of hope to at least hang out and chat. 

Still, what do you guys think I should do? Give up? Something else? If any of you think I should give more info to solve my problem don't hesitate to ask. 

Thank you so much for your time \^\^

23,"I watched a little bit of anime as a kid obviously, though it was almost exclusively Pokemon and the movie *Spirited Away.* At first, it was because I was too busy with Western cartoons like Gravity Falls and Rick and Morty, and then eventually it turned into this sort of stupid ""plan"" of mine: if I never seen an anime, I might be able to make a day out of it and share my first experience with somebody. 

I'm starting to think that nobody's ever going to actually want to do that, and I'm better off avoiding movie franchises since they only take an afternoon to watch. I'd like to get into anime, but I have no idea where to even start.

Here are a few things I think might help:

- My favorite show is easily Gravity Falls. I like overarching plots, heavy emphasis on character development, and of course humor. If there's something that might click better with a guy who's spent a lot of time with American cartoons, I'd love that.

- My only real exposure to Japanese culture/media is through games from companies like Nintendo. 

- I have a lot of time on my hands, but I don't want to get overwhelmed right away. Don't try recommending something like One Piece for my first time.

- I'm not picky with dubs, as long as the story/jokes are intact. I'd prefer better choice of language and talented voice actors over perfect accuracy in translations.

- The only thing I've seen that _might_ be considered an anime is Gregory Horror Show, which I thought was neat but not really fleshed out enough.",19May2018,0

31,"Lets call her A.
She had been distant toward me for a few months before this event, which was in swimming class st school. She had stopped attending choir lessions, telling me that she is no good, and wants to draw instead.
We used to hang out nearly every single day, and had a whole fantasy playworld.
We held hands and I suppose we were the types to lay in the grass together too. I never thought of kissing her. However, to me she were the most amazing, talented and prettiest person alive.

I was into boys at 11, and I hit puberty pretty hard, alone. None of the other girls were quite there yet.
I’m highly functional autistic(aspergers) and didn’t know at the time.
I moved to the country from the city. (A) was my classmate and we clicked within minutes.
Our main teacher was also a freelance choir teacher, and we would be her favorites before and after school. We had this teacher for only a couple of years.
I have long blonde hair, and have always liked ti wear dresses quite feminine but practical. 
I was very innocent and naive, and my parents beleived in being the better person. Never standing up for yourself, but instead explain.  And accept that they who wish to harm you probably have it worse in life than you. We’re not religious.

When at school I would wear french romantic dresses my grandparents bought me. I’m very beloved and protected by them. They still see me as a child, and are stuck in that time-Saying it was their best years when me and my sis were children.

At school I was told frequently «We don’t wear clothes like that here». I didn’t really care. I told them that’s their opinion, but personally I liked it.

All of a sudden, (A) belonged to the popular girls, and they would start to subtly poke at my confidence. I was pretty confident. Noone could make me cry etc at the time.
I was slim but got pretty obvious curves, and that was not «in» back then. The days of the Miss sixty trousers.
It got worse. 
(A) asked me playfully to keep a secret and duck under water with her, and she gave me a long normal kiss. I broke the secret by thinking it was a prank, and was told I was lying. After the kiss she slowly became cold toward me. I’m thinking it may not have been a prank?
She would «never be at home» anymore or «feel poorly» and sent her mom to lie to me at the door.
Meeting her outside with my bike was our normal hangout. I gave up after 3 weeks.

The girls would stop inviting me to things, and one day my birthday came, and noone showed. I didn’t invite the while class, but it destroyed me. I had prepared cakes and activites with my mom.
I didn’t confront them about it, but would instead be their awkward pet. I used these years to build social skills by testing out social bounderies and social rules. I needs to understand the patterns. Other kids would bore me, so I never befriended anyone. I didnt’t think of this as a strategy, but it definatly did more harm than good. The only life I had was the creative after school and lots of family time which was enough to keep me kinda sane, or so I thought. I got a tiny bit chubby, which finally gave one of the now clearly bullies (L) of the girl group to have something to really comment at. I’ve battled bulimia because this, bit have won over it. And the memory of (L’s) smug face makes my blond boil. L was even chubby herself.
The whole class of 199*- would now turn on me. I’ve been beaten and spat on by the boys. To this day, I don’t understand why. I hit back once, but got scared of how strong I was. I wanted to escape the country. Tante as now my goal. I spent the nest two schools pretty much alone. Some would call themselfes my firends, but I felt numb and no connection, and developed anxiety. 
My talent got kinda wasted. I lost the confidence I needed.
In High School (A) would compliment me after singing/guitar perforences. And at graduation (A) figured, although we never ever talked that I would move back to the city. She was right. She gave a very, very long and tight hug. I was confused. 
Ironically we now live in the same city. She moved here a few years after me, and I’m terrified of bumping into her. I’m not very good at hate, and I dont’t hate her.


I’m an adult now, but all of this still haunts me to this day. I’m working on myself, and am much stronger with a good life and social circle. I still struggle with trust, and the part about people liking me or not is now forever lost. So I connect being invited as being accepted.
After failed birthdays in childhood and teens (yes, I tried again. Thanks, mom.), I’ve never dared to host one today. 
I still obsurdely feel that noone would show up.

I haven’t proof-read as this is painful stuff, so I hope it’s understandable. English isn’t my first language.
It might be a big ol’ mess. I’m open to explaining in the comments.
THANK YOU if you read all this! ❤️

32,"In the midst of an argument with my crush who has dire communication skills, especially over the internet which is the only way we talk now that she’s dropped out of college. She’s said she’s only mad at the moment but I find myself incapable of just leaving the situation alone for a few days. Happened last Monday and I’ve been ignored since Thursday now.

We both know we’d like to take things further but she’s busy with full time work and outside commitments, like a situation with her young sisters that I won’t get into too much detail about. I was ignored after asking to phone her and the original argument stemmed from her not wanting to talk all the time and ignoring me. Now that it’s happened again I feel the intense need to get her attention even though I know that’ll make her angrier. 

In an attempt to work on myself I’ve been trying to keep busy and not pester her until this blows over but it’s very hard. A text I sent on Snapchat about 20 hours ago still hasn’t been opened and even though I know it’ll have the same response, I really want to try again. I’m not very good with leaving situations alone as I’m quite the problem solver so I feel as though pestering her is the only way to apologise, even though that will just irritate her further. 

Any good ways to just not talk for a while or get her off of my mind? I really do love her and have waited about a month to finally see her again but things with her sisters and work have escalated so it’s very difficult. Sorting it out face to face seems to be out of the question for now and if she won’t take texts then I’m in quite the conundrum. Also she’s said she likes me many a time so this isn’t as one sided as it seems, she’s just angry for now. It’s happened before so I’m not fretting us being a thing, just not annoying her beyond belief even though I’d like that haha.

47,"I live in a religious country so basically everyone in my country forced to choose his religion but in reality not everyone is a religious person like me. We that not a religious person tend to kept it secret to our friends and family about it cuz to them its a huge blasphemy and labeled us as a communist yet the majority of them doesnt even know what is communism and there is no connection between non religious person to communism.

So around 1,5 years ago my friends notice me that i didnt do any religious activities like praying and always have rasional point of view. Example is when i and my friends walk at 2am in the morning in campus to get my friends bike they keep telling me there is a spirit that haunt the big tree around my campus so we feel weird walking around here and my reaction is yeah maybe or its just human nature ya know scare of darkness etc. They become more and more suspicious about my non religious behavior finally they confront me about it.

Well at first i try to chaging the topic like ""what?? Really look at my id dude its well written on there!"" But they kept asking and teasing me about again and again. So finally i think well we were already a close friend for quite some they should be understand righttt.

Day by day they changing how they treat me at first it was just a joke like ""ughh im so bored to go praying not like our atheist friend here Lool""
And then it turn out like this:
A: hey come we go pray
B: nah you go first i go catch you up later
A: hey dont become like him a fucking atheist 
Me : *poker face*
B: relax dude i will catch up like hell i want to be like him a disgrace of community
Me: *frowned* the fuck dude really?
B: what? Im not your dude okay fucking atheist!
Me: *hold my fucking anger cuz if i say some weird things about religion i will be fucking done for sure*
A: *just silence*

Well actually not all my friends like that but they are that understand me cant really help the others to stop treating me like that cuz they can be misunderstood too if they defend me the best they can do is changing the topic

Well to be honest i still have confidence on my friends that they will understand about me better but i cant take more of shitty act that they do anymore so i just castaway myself from them for now to calm my head and to forget that thing

It feels like my body betrays me. I get shooting pains in my ovaries at random points in the month and then my period hits and it's the worst pain I've ever experienced. I slept for 13 hours last night because of this stupid body. I talked to my doctor about this pain only to be brushed off saying this is ""normal"". I hate being female. 

Today I will menstruate and do nothing about it. I'm currently bleeding through my shorts onto my comforter. Doesn't fucking matter. No matter how much I try to keep myself clean, I bleed through EVERY MONTH.

My face looks like a fucking landmine. I'm bloated. I want to jump in front of traffic. I told my doctor about the intrusive thoughts and she threw the first birth control she could at me. Get in, get out, like a fucking cattle slaughterhouse. I hate my fucking doctor, but I can't see anyone else. 

Sex isn't even worth it. It's stupid and I end up with a UTI no matter what. I hate this stupid body.

Getting to bleed through my clothes and feel the shame of womanhood gives me power. I conp
grtrol the pain. I am a sinful woman and I deserve to be punished. No food today. 

I can't lead the life I want to lead with this stupid body. I can't be the person I want to be because of this stupid punishment. My doctor brushed off my concerns about the birth control. I don't want to go back there. I hate that stupid bitch. 

I hate that I can't read a book, watch a movie, listen to music, without seeing women getting sexualized and objectified. I hate that I can't have a conversation with my dad or grandfather without them making comments about my body or my face. I hate that I'm one of the only women in my field and I get GAWKED AT.

56,"Naturally as an 18 year old, I am in a period of life which involves self-discovery. I am scared that a traumatizing event has altered my personality and even goals in life. Let me explain.
I like to think I am moderately successful, I have started a few successful businesses, am completely independent, and moved 3,000 miles away from the nearest person I know. I strive for success more than most of my peers and made the promise to myself at 15 that I wanted to be a millionaire by 25.
I was raised by a very religious and normal family. When I was 14 it came out I had let my teenage hormones get the best of me and experimented with one of my cousins because I was curious of what a boob felt like. It appeared consensual, but that cousin went to a therapist that reported me and led to a court case. My darkest behavior got out to all my family. This proved to be a hefty case of humiliation. With this being a family ordeal, I had to deal with seeing the divide I had caused, and it was often a huge weight on my shoulders even seeing family members that knew what I had done. I felt that I would never be looked at the same by my siblings.
After this event I never appeared to be struggling. Socially, I find it easy to make friends. Financially, I have a chip on my shoulder to prove others wrong and learned to not live according to what other people thought of me. I took risks, and it took me far considering my age. I fear that all this growth, though positive, is just a reaction of how I have dealt with this situation, rather than what my actual character is. I enjoy the chip on my shoulder, but I am wondering if this is just furthering the mental damage to be dealt with later. 
I thought that I dealt with this at that time, but here’s why I feel it’s having a lasting effect. As a textbook defense mechanism to humiliation, I think I have a mild case of narcissism and disassociation. I hold myself up to a ridiculously high standard, my goals seem to be more about proving people wrong than actual benefit for myself. I have been emotionally numb pretty much ever since I was 14. I had a girlfriend of three years and didn’t have sexual contact with her for the vast majority of time we were together as a part of my guilt. When I moved across the country she cried in my arms as I left, and I remember thinking, I don’t feel anything while it seems so important to her. In pretty much any event that I could get emotional, it’s ridiculously easy for me to just unplug my emotions, which I used to consider a strength to avoid hurt by others or events, but now on the contrary I am afraid it will hinder relationships down the road. 
I guess this is more of an off-my-chest kind of thing (I have never told anyone about this since it happened), but also, I am wondering if my worries are valid and what should I do about it.

60,"This happened last week. I'm a bisexual girl (but with a preference for other women) who's a senior in high school and just turned 18. For most of high school, until this last semester, I've been focused on academics/sports as well as staying in the closet, so I didn't date or explore my sexuality much. But during the past few months, I was accepted to my dream school, one of the HYPSM colleges, and decided to start coming out to people and having more fun in life. I made a Tinder recently and agreed to meet up with this 19 y/o girl at her place

We first smoked some weed and talked together, then headed into her bedroom. We made out for a little, then she went down on me, but it honestly didn't feel as good as I thought it would and I didn't cum. Then I went down on her and she came, which I was pretty proud of because I didn't think it would happen my first time. Then I basically left right after that

Reflecting on it, I definitely understand why some people say sex/virginity isn't a big deal now. I didn't even tell her she was my first time and I don't wish I did, because the whole process just seemed so much more natural than expected and I don't think telling her would've been necessary. I don't regret losing it via Tinder either, for the same reason. The only thing that surprised me was actually how ""meh"" I felt about it and how I couldn't cum, so I'm hoping that my next time might be a little more exciting",19May2018,1

62,"I was seeing this woman for a couple of months, and a couple of weeks ago she suddenly broke things off because she didn’t want a relationship, which I understood. I found out today that the night before she broke things off, she slept with one of my best friends, someone I consider a brother to me. 
Obviously I was shocked. I didn’t expect this from him. I’m not trying to place any blame on anyone, but I feel more upset with him than her. I knew the relationship wasn’t going to last forever, but I actually liked her, and she liked me too. We never explicitly talked about us being exclusive, which is why I logically can’t bee too upset with her, but I feel like as a close friend, he owed me the loyalty of not going through with it, or at least being honest with me about it (they tried to hide it, but a mutual friend thought I should know, and I am grateful to them).
I don’t know if I should cut them both out of my life. Me and the guy were so close that all of our friends are the same people, meaning that if this gets out everyone is gonna treat him badly or stop talking to him. I’m not vengeful, and I don’t want him to be alone here in college far from home. But I always try to surround myself with good people. My close friends here are like my family, and I expected us to be better than this. I just don’t know if he has a place in my life anymore after what he did, and I would just like any advice on what I should do, whether you’ve been in this situation or not.

64,"My mom has suffered so much the past few years.  Mental health problems, physical medical issues, and substance abuse to cap everything off.  She’s been through psychologists, psychiatrists, rehab facilities, half way houses, and behavioral health clinics. She’s home living with my dad and brother now, but she’s a mess.  Sometimes she seems pretty normal, but when you pull back the curtain it all falls apart.  She handles her part time job well, but she severely neglects herself. She doesn’t eat regularly, she doesn’t disinfect or bandage to a recent surgical incision, she doesn’t take her medication on time.  My dad and brother they do what they can to help, but it’s not enough.  She needs full time supervision, but is resistant to home care or in-patient treatment options.  The last time we discussed these options, she threatened to kill herself. 

In a recent visit, I spoke very frankly with my mom about her situation. At first she was pretty withdrawn, but eventually she opened up about what she was feeling physically, mentally, and emotionally.  Together, we put together a plan of action to help improve her quality of life. We scheduled an appointment to see a speciality about some physical problems she’s been having, we got recommendations for new psychologist to try out, we drew out a “self care” schedule to help her with the basics of every day life.  We shared the plan with the rest of the household, and it felt like progress. 

She started drinking soon after I left, after being sober for months.  She is a mean drunk.  My brother does everything he can to look out for her, but when she’s drunk he’s her punching bag. She accuses him of not loving her. She rages about his girlfriend.  She threatens suicide.  The whole situation breaks my heart.  I know she’s scared and in pain, but I don’t think I forgive her lashing out like this. 

She treats my dad similarly.  He’s worked hard to ensure he can cover her medical costs, but every time he comes home she blames him for her state.  Now that she’s drinking again, I think he’s had enough.  He wants to leave a toxic relationship, but he doesn’t want to leave my mom to fend of herself or leave my brother to shoulder the responsibility.  

And here I am, thousands of miles away, unsure of what to do or how to help. ",19May2018,37
