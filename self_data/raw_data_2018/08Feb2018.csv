2,"The last few times we talked, he sent me a text while he was drunk that was essentially “bye I’m killing myself”. I called him, he was okay. Then I found out it was over a girl he never even dated but just had a good connection with. That made me lose it so I told him to get help and we shouldn’t talk/hang out for a while, but I was more blunt about it. 

Yesterday, after not talking for around a week, he texts me saying how my response was not sympathetic enough and that I should work on that and then tells me that he legitimately intended to kill himself that time he sent the text. I was at work reading this and became furious since it sounded like he was threatening me with his attempted suicide. 

Anyway, after me telling him to get help and again being blunt with him that I don’t appreciate his sense of entitled sympathy from me (I was very sympathetic but I’m also blunt), he says he’s getting help and that what I said to him and how I said it can be thought of as rude and condescending to someone with his mental issues. 

Now, it’s a day later, I’m still upset, I’m depressed myself now, my work suffered today, and I’m really tempted to just tell him I don’t think we should be friends anymore to pull that band aid off. He’s pretty much an alcoholic and his mood swings are a massive problem for me. He’s not a bad guy but I just don’t need it in my life anymore and I think by pulling this band aid off, I will feel better instead of worrying about him. This isn’t really the first time he pulled something like this and expected sympathy from me, but it ended our friendship for a while. Then we reconnected and now I’m in this situation again and I don’t want people like this around me when I’m trying to be fucking positive. He isn’t even that good of a friend anymore and I’ve been slowly cutting him out anyway. 

I’m so lost. ",08Feb2018,0

6,"I am thoroughly in support of gay rights and people being allowed to be transgender, but I held one small differing opinion (that being that the debate over ""bathroom rights"" being really trivial and that demanding to use the other sex's bathroom is only for attention and that anyone who intends assault would do so anyhow, so both the ""for"" and ""against"" sides are trivial) and was banned under ""transphobia"". Upon trying to explain that that wasn't my intent, they chose to ban me from messaging them. Is there anyone above them I can message? Is there a means of making a larger appeal to remove their mod status on the grounds of wrongful bans? They made no attempt to explain, and I tend to be vocal in my community on lgbt rights in general, so their claim of ""transphobia"" has no real grounds.

Everyone always says to join clubs, but there are no clubs I like. People also say to talk to classmates but I never really find the opportunity without forcing small talk.

Now, back to what I was saying... if you're going to expect 100+ teenage girls to tell the truth, you're a goddamn idiot or you've never ever met a teenage girl, or teenager for that matter, your entire life.

I think his lawyer is partially right: there is no way all those girls are telling the truth.  some are lying for whatever scumbag reason.  To fit in maybe?  Because they're evil down to the core, or they get off on lying?  Who knows.  But you're an imbecile if you think that all women tell the truth when it comes to rape or sexual harassment.  Just search the news for women who falsely accuse men for doing stuff to them.  Do it.  Now you don't think maybe 3 or 4 out of the 160+ can be like this?  Do you think that all 160+ of these girls are up to the highest standard of morals and ethics, that they are all outstanding citizens?  they're teenager gymnasts, they're not fucking humanitarians. 
 and among average people, there are lying scumbags.

13,"What’s up, Reddit. Obligatory LTL/FTP/mobile, etc. I have no idea where I should post this. Please let me know if there's a better place. 

__Obligatory TL;DR, given upfront because my story is a REALLY REALLY long one, and because I have never been accused of being overly succinct:__

__The unluckiest, and ugliest, person I’ve ever known in my life makes a poor choice (read: fucked up good) that leads to many broken bones and 18-24 months of hell (read: got fucked up good.)__

But enough of that. 

So begins the tale of a guy I once met who we’ll call Johnny, the events that transpired on a fateful summer weekend, and my eventual arrival at the conclusion that Johnny was, quite possibly, the unluckiest bastard on the face of the earth (or at least, by far the unluckiest person I’ve ever met.)

Many moons ago, when I was a young and rebellious 17 year-old back in my home town, two similarly-aged friends and I decided that we were going to load up about an oz of the most average green herbs money could buy, as well as about 300 oz of the cheapest beer money could buy, and ride the bus across town to go hang out with our buddies and do what teenage boys do alone at a house with no adult supervision on a Friday night. I still wonder how we made it there successfully, what with our party favors haphazardly in tow. But, alas, our trip was uneventful. We enjoyed the evening and our party favors as any teenage boy is wont to do, drifted to sleep in the wee hours of the morning, and all was right in the world. 

However, The next morning, daylight, sobriety, and teenage stupidity all collided in a spectacular fashion, leading to the events that make this story worth retelling. 

__The players:__

__Johnny__ – the star of our story. Johnny was, to put it mildly, the ugliest human male I have ever met in my life. Johnny was firmly-set, approximately 6’2” and 220lbs, and about 25-30 pounds of that was in his oversized head. His forehead was more like a five- or six-head. His eyebrows which were more resembling of an exceptionally long caterpillar having died on his face, than they were like eyebrows. His hairline was already receding dramatically at the ripe old age of 20. His face, due to severe acne, roughly resembled the dark side of the moon. In other words, Johnny looked kinda like [Rocky Dennis](https://youtu.be/Oa7Ttik1Gw4). I should note, none of this was the result of any physical or mental abnormality; he just got ALL the leftover human parts at the God store. 

__Kenny__ – Johnny’s younger brother by one year, so around 19 at the time of the story. Kind of an asshole, but otherwise just a guy.

__Ben__ – Fellow partygoer, sayer of terrible things #1.

__Jerry__ – Fellow partygoer, sayer of terrible things #2.

__Extras__ – People present (9 total including named players) but irrelevant to the main events of the story.

__Me__ – Me. 

[But on with the story already.](https://youtu.be/l1YmS_VDvMY)

Waking from the previous night’s festivities, Kenny and Jerry decided they want to skate up to the corner store for cigarettes (no one in our group had access to a car at the time.) Somewhere in the mix, it was decided that Ben was also going, and as we were at Ben’s house, everyone was going. So, we set out on foot, rolling 9 deep to the store for a lone pack of cigarettes.

Johnny was always a bit of an odd guy. On this particular day, he and his brother Kenny were arguing about something or another, and in the process Johnny wound up walking several steps ahead of the rest of the group, due to his frustration with Kenny. Well Kenny, always one to antagonize his older brother, proceeded to run up and spear Johnny in the back at full speed, tackling him to the ground. They scuffled a bit, we broke it up, on to the store.

We get to the store, cigarettes are procured, and begin the journey home. On the way home, we are walking along a busy main street with traffic flowing 40MPH at capacity, and came to a bridge that carries the road over an almost dry creek bed. The creek is one of those that has about 2” of water flowing in many spots on an average day, but that serves as a flood management creek, so on occasion may go as much as 15-20’ deep after heavy rains. As a result, there was a significant, by my estimate 30-40’ drop from the street level to the floor of the creek bed. The bridge has a metal handrail that was largeish and ovular; think something like [this](http://werkvreugde.nl/cms/images/producten/ovalstainlesssteeltube.jpg). 

So as we start to cross the bridge, Johnny __jumps up on the handrail and starts walking it like a tight rope.__ I should mention here that Johnny was wearing socks and sandals (he was THAT guy.) Think sandals like [these](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81%2Bk5ZFiKtL._UL1500_.jpg). Basically, he was dressed like [this dude](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CIC24AgUcAEOIFM.jpg). Immediately realizing that Johnny was either gonna fall headfirst into 40MPH traffic and die, or fall 30-40’ off a bridge and also probably die, the 8 of us watching in horror immediately began to tell him to get down before he, you know, dies. So he gets down at roughly the halfway point, and as we stood there, the following exchange happened:

&gt;Kenny: Hey Johnny, wanna see if we can jump off the bridge and make it to the bottom okay?    
&gt;Johnny: No.    
&gt;Kenny: I’ll jump if you will.    
&gt;Johnny: Eh. Okay.

So, much to my personal horror, Johnny and Kenny both climbed over the handrail and stood, facing outward into the creek, on the drainage pipe that was attached to the bottom of the bridge. [It was set up basically like this](http://www.urecon.com/photos/bridge_06.jpg) – Imagine the two of them standing on the pipe with their backs to the handrail, holding on from behind. 

It soon became one of those moments that felt like hours, but in reality was probably only 5-10 minutes which passed. As Kenny and Johnny stood there, overlooking their combined fate, Ben and Jerry were antagonizing Johnny, who was to “try” first, to proceed with the task at hand:

&gt;Ben: Just jump Johnny, no one loved you anyways!
&gt;Jerry: Come on Johnny! If you ever had a purpose in life, it was to jump off of this bridge at this exact moment in your life! Do it!

And so on. Really vile stuff, to be honest, but somehow not said overly maliciously or seriously, but rather in a more banter-y, playful sort of way. You get the idea. They wanted to watch the carnage of stupid friends being stupid. I wanted to go home. 

Anyways, so it was decided that someone needed to go check out the “landing zone” down in the creek bed. That someone was me. I slide on down the hill, probably a 30-degree incline (relevant later), and check out the area. There was some water flowing around either edge of the creek bed, and through the middle, a soft patch of tall, green grass, and fairly waterlogged mud from which it grew. There was one large, particularly weathered-flat rock up farther under the bridge that didn’t appear to be in the way of anything (also relevant – I was wrong, it mattered a lot in a moment.) So they called down to ask my opinion, and I just sort of shrugged with a hearty, “Meh?”

Frankly, from bridge level, the drop looked to be at the outer edge of manageable. From the creek bed, it looked like suicide. 

__Enter the Shit__

So, somewhere in conversation back on the bridge, they decided it was best for Johnny to try and hang from the large drainage pipe they were standing on, in an effort to get as close to the ground as possible before dropping. As I stood down in the creek bed below, I watched Johnny first lay down on the pipe, then wrap his arms around in it in a bear hug, and proceed to slip his legs down off the side, eventually suspending himself over the creek bed, hanging with his arms now above him, but still grasping the pipe bear-hug style. 

I was later told, it was at that moment that Johnny and Kenny had the following exchange:

&gt;Johnny: I don’t wanna do this anymore.    
&gt;Kenny: Okay, give me your hand I’ll pull you back up.    
&gt;Johnny: I can’t, if I let go then I’ll fall, my arms are too far apart and I have to keep them pressed together to not fall and die.    
&gt;Kenny: Just give me your hand, I won’t let you fall, it’ll be okay.    
&gt;Johnny: Okay… __*reaches out hand, and immediately falls*__    

From my creek-level vantage point, the next moments played in slow motion. To this day I distinctly remember Johnny falling like a sack of potatoes. I remember him falling feet-down. I remember seeing his feet extended toes-downward, similar to a ballerina in classic pose (I will remind you, wearing socks and sandals.) I remember watching him hit the ground, toes-first, with his back to me. I remember his head accelerating downwards between his knees, and watching his forehead bounce off of the previously-mentioned rock under the bridge. I remember the sound it made. I remember he immediately turned 180° on the ground, sat facing me, grabbed his forehead, and then the blood came.

This. Dude. Bled. The blood was literally POURING off of his face in a constant stream. I would liken it to holding your head under a faucet running at full stream, except the faucet is pouring blood instead of water. His feet were completely mangled, his left foot in particular being about 7” shorter than his right, and about 3x as wide. 

To bring the day’s events to a rapid close, after I frantically called down the rest of the gang, we dragged his enormous, bloodied self up the 30-degree incline hill, called an ambulance, and waited for them to arrive. They had to cut off his sandals there – I had to turn away when I saw his feet, and one person with us immediately lost their lunch. It was gnarly. 

__End result of this event was that Johnny had:__ 10 broken toes, shattered 70% of his right foot and 98% of his left, had a cracked skull, bad concussion, required an ungodly amount of both stitches and staples running almost horizontally across the entire length of his forehead, and required relocation several states away for rehabilitation near family who were able to provide him the full-time assistance he needed, as he was subsequently unable to walk for over 6 months. 

Now, I mentioned early on that Johnny was the unluckiest person I’ve ever met. Sure, a lot of bad luck caused the events which transpired that day, but you can also decidedly say he did it to himself. However, roughly 13 months and 800 miles away from the original incident, Johnny was free from rehab, to the point that he was at the phase of, “Here’s a piece of paper with exercises for you to keep doing at home, call us if you have questions, and otherwise you’re done.” 

Approximately two weeks after completing rehab – or roughly 13 months from the events of this story –  Johnny was riding a bicycle, was hit by a car that ran a red light, and broke both of his legs. 

I never heard anything else from Johnny or Kenny after that.

There were two other random moments in time I crossed paths with ms.dreamy eyes, 1990 the Ostrich Festival, 1992 Melissa Etheridge concert in Sedona.
Ok it's 1997(ish) and I'm at a gas station.  After paying for my gas I walk back to my car and I notice a teal green Camaro (kinda hard to miss)  at the pump behind me.  Before I get back into my vehicle I come face to face with the driver of the Camaro and guess who it is...yup, Ms. Dreamy Eyes.  She looked at me, said hi then flashed that smile..and I melted.   I spent the next few days thinking..what are the odds that I would run into the woman of my dreams at random places at such random moments in

This morning I woke up and was sitting next to my wife in bed, changing some settings on my new phone. Suddenly, I noticed her index finger creep into view right next to my eye. I grabbed it and pushed it out of the way and told her to stop. She did it again seconds later. I told her to stop. She got it close enough to touch my eyelashes. I yelled at her to stop and pushed it away and twisted it a bit in the process. I'll admit, at that point it was out of frustration and anger that she wouldn't stop. I told her I'm tired of her doing this crap so I went downstairs.

She comes down about an hour later saying violence against her is not OK. I apologized and said I'm sorry for grabbing and twisting her finger, and that next time I would just walk away from her if she pulled something like that again. I followed that up with it was still completely unacceptable for her to be putting her finger near my eye like that. She said no act of violence against her is ever OK under any circumstances. I said that I agree. She said she could light my car on fire with my friends inside, and I would not be able to touch her (I shit you not - she said this). I proceeded to say that if she had the keys to that car to unlock the doors on her, I would definitely be doing anything I could to get them out of her hands. She followed up by saying she could punch me directly in the face and I would just have to take it. I let out a chuckle at how ridiculous this sounded, not really believing that the situation devolved so far, and that's when she stormed out. She said she'd be back in a few days.

This is the second time she's done this thing where she tries to put her finger near my eye early in the morning, and I've had the same reaction - last time was about a year ago. To be clear, it isn't trying to rub something on my face or anything like that. She just puts her finger near my eyeball. And while I have nearly normal vision, my depth perception is the one thing that isn't good, so I feel like it really, really gets to me.

30,"Recently noticed that of my three relationships (in the last five years and my entire life), my partner tells me they love me very early on. I usually feel the same romantic / love(?) emotions as well but I noticed that it's been a trend for every relationship.

Quick Summary:

First relationship was my first love. Cliche story of meeting the first day in college and began to date after being friends for a month. He said he loved me about 3 weeks in. The relationship lasted for three years but at the end it was very toxic. Insecurities on his end and my trust issues from him cheating caused many fights, sometimes physical. Friends still mention how he was abusive to me. Terrible break up.

Second relationship (barely a relationship) lasted around two months. It was long distance and he said he was falling in love with me about three weeks in. It was very quick but I also felt like I did have strong romantic feelings. That relationship also ended up pretty bad because he did not trust me at all and constantly accused me of seeing other people when we weren't together (I wasn't.) Realized it was toxic and got out of that ASAP.

And now I am in my third relationship with an older SO (29M) and we have been dating for around a month and a half? He told me he was falling in love with me about three and a half weeks in. I certainly feel the same way and I am almost sure this might be the real deal. He said it's strange because he's been in a few relationships before but it has never moved this fast. I really like him.

So for my question/concern: I am wondering if these quick developments of ""love"" in these relationships contribute to them ending so poorly, or if they aren't related at all. I also am not someone ""obsessed"" with relationships. I enjoy being alone and was single for a year and really liked it. I don't think I am seeking love, necessarily. I want this current relationship to work out but am concerned it will end bad because of how fast it's moving...

Also if any of you fell in love very quick with your current SOs right now, I would like to know how it's going and opinions!",08Feb2018,3
31,"I hate the 10000 word background life stories people write in these things, so I'll get to the point and the add some details and update with answers to questions if needed.


My problem is not really some sort of pain or hardship, more like a life crisis that involves my stage in life and how I don't want to do anything. I'm NOT depressed, lonely, or angry. I'm 35, live in a major city that I love, love the field of work I studied at school and the pay is reasonable, I also do well with women. I'm currently single after ending a short relationship and decided to leave my job at the end of last summer. I could had gotten another job right away, as there are more openings than people in my specialty. I can just ask out one of the many girls in my neighborhood that have thrown hints my way, but I don't. Why won't I do anything?


I postpone everything, I turn down invitations, skip meals, stopped going to the gym, stopped reading. I seat home and listen to NPR or watch sports and sports talk shows. I enjoy and look forward to listening to their conversation on TV and radio, does that mean I need to find more interesting people? few people I know go beyond talking points that they identify with. I pretty much only react to immediate events (ex. laundry, phone calls, go out to eat, meet up with some people for specific reasons).


I'm going backwards here with the background: As I said, I left my job in the summer, I have saved enough money to live on for almost a year. Before that my father passed away, but the feeling I have right now started back in 2015 when I was finishing school. At first, I only went to college part-time, I got no support from my family and if anything my parents were a hindrance. So I did my last 85 out of 135 or 145 credits in 5 semesters, there were many courses that counted for 4 credits and I was a transfer. The last year was difficult, not the content but to do the work. I felt almost nauseous or repulsed by the work and attending school, even though my professors and classmates were all pretty cool. I graduated with almost no debt and landed a job before I even got my diploma, found a great place to live etc. But nothing made me feel better. My father got sick a year before he passed away and I chose to help him, going with him to the doctor and going to his place at least twice a week. At the time I still managed to date two girls, plus two ONS, (no overlaps) and progress at work. Then after months of improving my father passed way when he fell and had a heart attack.


I felt the sense of purpose go with my father, that much I know. Until my adult life, I would say mid 20s, life was pretty crappy: I didn't grow up with my mother and when I reconnected with her in my early 20s I was never able to relate to her. My father was in and out of my life but spent more time with my brothers when he was around. My stepmother treated me like I was the son of Satan and was at fault for all the evil in the world. I was often punished for small infractions, example: I would wash the dishes, forget one plate and was promptly punished by not being allowed to watch TV for the night or worse. Meanwhile, my brothers never knew of any punishments or chores. Worse of all, my stepmother denies that that's how things went down in my childhood. There were even worse examples than that but a lot of bad things did happen to me. I won't share them here, though.


I suspect that I've reached some sort of minimum happiness, now that I'm not suffering I've lost motivation and drive. When things were bad I didn't mind drinking myself stupid with friends and having casual sex with different girls. Now that I'm at where so many people wish they were it seems like there's no where else to go. I know I should see a therapist or something, but I can't over the stigma of possibly being labeled a damaged person and no one I know can relate, everyone is in debt, no job, sick, old, can't get laid, hates their job, etc. I've been thinking of asking here for a long time but I've noticed that other people have some serious problems compare to mine.

34,"here's [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/5u9gw3/killing_people_with_pizza_pt1_the_mostly_sad/) from last winter

So I have a job, complete with benefits and a pension... but I get laid off every winter. I collect unemployment, but earning some extra money is often necessary. Few jobs will hire me cuz my resume screams that Im gonna leave within 6 months. So I deliver pizzas. I work for one of the big three, doesn't really matter which one. It's easy. They're always hiring. Ive done it many times since college. But fuck can it be soul sucking...

I guess what's really just bothering me how petty and shitty the Fast Food Pizza world is. Duh, right? But it's *sooooo* apparent because I have another job, a fucking career, that I enjoy! It's almost a healthy reminder of what's wrong with America. Here are some observations:

* We sell primarily to low-income people. Our food is both very expensive and very shitty. A medium 3 topping can be like $15, has like 3000 calories, and I could eat one by myself in a few minutes. I love rice and beans, seriously, and for $1.50 I can eat 3+ meals with much better nutritional value. I mean, DUH! But it's just sad to see poor people piss away their money on something that's hurting them.
* Local college students buy pizza with student loan money. They're also terrible customers (use a lot of coupons, don't tip, make you wait outside a dorm for 20 minutes, etc). It's sad to think that many of them will end up working in the food service and retail industries some day while being burdened by student loans that they partially spent on pizza! Also, I have a college degree and employ college students at my career job, so it irks me all the more!
* Our franchise owner is a load... like 5'5'' and 400+ lbs. She probably makes $500k/yr, but will die before retirement.
* Our food is terrible for you. I workout regularly and can feel it if Ive eaten any of our crap within the last day or two. I always bring a lunch, but its impossible to resist that laboratory-designed goodness every once in a while... It's well known that Fast Food ain't good for ya, but it's sad seeing our product devoured by hundreds of Americans every day.
* We sell discounted pizza to the local middle schools to get the kids addicted to pizza. It's works very well.
* We're discouraged from working more than 35hrs/week. Several of my coworkers work 2 jobs, 70-80hrs/wk total, to earn $40k/yr for their families.
* There are many fast food lifers. Most of my coworkers, myself included, have bounced around between chains.
* There are fast food families. Usually one family member gets a job that pays alright, say $15/hr delivering pizzas, and within a few months mom, dad, sister, brother, etc all work at that business.
* Minimum wage labor is cheap as fuck. ""The drain's clogged? Have a driver snake it out until its fixed, then send 'em home.""
* Those Delivery Fee's pay for the delivery driver's labor. Ideally, drivers' labor cost nothing and they purely make money for the business. Capitalism 101, but just kinda odd to think about, the customer and employee basically giving money to the business owner.
* Tipping is literally the customer subsidizing the employers' labor costs. Again, duh, but sad and annoying. The GM and owner will act like they helped you make all that $ on a good night, but really it was just the customers' goodwill/luck. Minimum wage aint shit. Only a handful of long-time employees (besides managers) make more than minimum wage and even then they only make like $0.25/hr more...
* Fast Food is the rare industry where felons can make 6 figures. Cool, yeah, sorta. But kinda sad that drug dealing convictions have locked a lot of people into a lifetime of corporate fast food. Not so cool. It seems almost like slavery actually.
* Fast food is very lucrative. The average chain pizza store nets about $110k profit/year. Fast food managers can make $50k/yr no problem and there's a clear career ladder (shift manager&gt;store GM&gt;multiple store manager&gt;franchisee).
* our GM and the head driver are a couple... they fell in love in a hopeless place. They'll likely do careers with our corporate pizza chain. They'll make good money slinging shitty pizza and exploiting minimum wage workers. Nice people, but such a shitty way to make a living IMO.
* Fast food encourages workers to fuck each other over. Example: I often work with a guy in his late 60s. He collects social security. We can't go home til the dishes are done. He likes to milk it for that extra hour of wages. I want to go home. So I'll do ""his dishes"" thus saving the company $15 or something in labor and depriving the old man out of a meal or two... fuck.
* Another story: some employees try to commit time fraud. The logic is obvious: ""fuck, it's a major corporation that makes hundreds of millions of profit/year and what's 20 minutes at minimum wage to them..."" but someone sitting around fucks the low-level manager for having a bad labor variable. He in turn yells at the employees, who then yell at the ""time thief"" who gets back at them by slacking on chores, so some other employee ends up scraping rotten food out of the drain cuz the ""time thief"" was so clever as to change into work clothes after clocking in... Yes, the time thief is in the wrong, but the whole system is seemingly set up to make workers tattle on and be shitty to each other. Sad.

35," I'd agree that our nuclear infrastructure needs an overhaul. (look into that, then tell your elected how you feel) But not in that way. Firing an accurate missile requires lots of numbers, which doesn't make for a very big file if you've ever looked at the size of a thousand page .txt or .word file. And that's way more numbers than needed. Plus that's rocking ASCII format. Imagine just having to communicate one's and zeros!? Very small files. What's more important is that they aren't on the internet. Using antiquated systems that are literally hack proof. But they work. I'd equate it to the critics as being ""why spend the money we don't have on a chainsaw robot that can be hacked, when we have an axe right here. We know this thing works every fucking time.""",08Feb2018,1

39,"Background: my real dad died when I was 9 months old bc he’s an idiot who drove drunk and crashed. My mom met my step-dad, we’ll call him TW when I was 5. They got married, stayed married for like 17 years I think, then got divorced. 

My TW worked for most of my childhood as an over the road trucker, so I hardly saw him. Then when we moved to Houston when I was 13, I saw him more. But we moved back to Louisiana when I was 16, and I moved out when I was 17. I never went back home, and I moved back to Houston. Then joined the army, got our, moved to Phoenix. So I have spent very little time with TW in my adult life. 

I was living in Phoenix with my fiancé and things were going well, I was 22 when I met her, she was 21. We obviously were not doing great with money being in our 20s working retail and whatnot, but we were happy. I was in school, she has her cosmetology license and was looking for work. She found a job at a high end salon and we were all set. We still felt we weren’t making enough though. My dad works on the pipeline, not glorious or fulfilling work, but starting out, at the bottom you can make $1500 a week. 

He asked me if I wanted to come work with him, this was around the time of the Dakota Access Pipeline controversy, he wasn’t going to be working on that one, but I still felt weird about it all. I told him no, I want to keep going to school. I didn’t want to hurt the environment either, because my major was marine biology and it felt wrong to sell my soul for a paycheck, spoiler alert, I did. 

He asked me about 3 months later again, and my fiancé said “it may be a sign that we’re going to run into money problems or something in our life is going to change, drastically.” I’m not superstitious but, I’m a little-stictious, so I took the job. (A few weeks later we found out she was pregnant, my son was born 5 days ago) 

So I’m out here doing this job with my dad, all I do really is ride around in the 18 wheeler with him and haul stuff, help him strap down the loads, unstrap, things like that. It’s easy for the money I get paid, but I used to look up to my dad so much. I thought he was a god amongst men and he was a hard worker and such. But now that I work with him I realize he isn’t at all how I pictured him. He is compassionless, he has no empathy for other people or animals. I’m no vegan, but if I see a dog who is starving you better believe I’m going to feed it anything I have on me. But he just doesn’t feel that way. He’s racist, he constantly says racial slurs towards Mexicans (even though my fiancé is Mexican and his grandson is half Mexican). He makes me so angry sometimes because he is constantly negative and thinks no one can make it unless they’re doing pipeline work because the money is so good. 

He only cares about money, a stray mama dog came up to us today and I just about emptied my lunch box feeding her and he said “someone should put her out of her misery.” And I said “why not just help her and get her healthy again?” And his response was “why am I going to waste my money on a dog I don’t want?” But he’ll get off work and go buy a $200 deep freezer he doesn’t need so he can store deer meat that “doesn’t have hormones and chemicals in it.” But he’ll smoke a pack and a half of cigarettes a day in the truck. 

I just see my dad in a different light now, and I hate it because I used to respect him so much, and now I hate talking to him. There’s more examples but I’m not going to list all of them right now. Has anyone else had this happen to them? You looked up to someone but once you really got to know them, they seem different to you? ",08Feb2018,4

My family has a long history of craftsmen, with my father being a carpenter and my G.grandfather being a watchmaker. 
      At school I take Building Construction and at home I have a lot of hobby's; Mostly due to my lack of friends to hang out with. I collect scrap metal to sell to fund my projects, and those projects include building small cabins in the woods next to my house, making weapons out of scraps, and often times just doing whatever seems fun. When not doing that I research ballistics and clean my gun. (Ruger 10/22)
   I also work on computers and have my own dedicated gaming computer that I made myself. 
    The strange part is that people find me 'weird' because I often make weapons in my free time and the way I act often seems strange. I am well read in philosophies and I self reflect often. I dont go on social media (With the exception of reddit) and I am out of the loop celebrity wise. I usually dont bother with the confusion of peoples drama and I speak my mind. Politically speaking im a heavy libertarian that leans barely to the right (pretty much a centrist in terms of republican &amp; democrats). 
    My sense of humor is often dark, but I often try to add some lightheartedness to it. Humors purpose is to make laughs out of tragedy often times. I self reflect a lot as stated earlier but i came here to tell you this because Im having a hard time finding out what is just so 'strange' to people. I've been called a number of things for my hobbies, one person going as far to call me a 'future school shooter'.

43,"Hi! I stopped smoking tobacco a month ago, I wasn't a true true smoker, but I used to smoke a cigar a day at university, for like two years minimum. Sometimes two or three but principally just one.

What actually helped me is that nobody in my family smokes and they find it quite disgusting and to be a bad habit, so I, who live with my mom, had to keep it secret (just  at university and parties), so I didn't smoke at all near home, due to the smell.

It's been a month and a few days since I don't smoke tobacco, and I feel good because of that.

47,"I'm going to try and be as non-prejudiced as I possibly can while writing this.

I've been married for 4 years now, and have been with my wife a total of 9 years altogether. I knew when I met her she was verry immature for her age but that might be a lot of why I also liked her. 

We bought tickets to hawaii and I have been very excited because I grew up here and couldnt wait to show her around. 

Today is our 4th day here and very little of it has been fun. It turns out that my wife's entire reason for coming is to hike the Haiku Stairs, (also called stairway to heaven). Im completely against it. Its illegal for a few reasons: you have to trespass on people's property to get to the trailhead, and then the entire trail is on Government property and you have to sneak past a guard to get there. 

Getting caught carries a fine of up to $1000 and a Criminal Trespass conviction. It usually also includes 80 hours of community service which means that you have to arrange flights back to Hawaii for sentencing and then completion of the judgement. 

There are hundreds of posts online about people successfully making the hike without being caught, but there are also posts about being caught. Not to mention hiking 3922 steps straight up a mountain with a 1000' drop on either side is not my idea of fun.

We started out talking about it, then began fighting and then last night she announced that this was the worst trip she has ever been on, that shes not happy and when we get back she wants a divorce. Obviously this is childish and manipulative, but im sitting here in the Hotel room with her curled up in bed ignoring me and I'm having a massively hard time leaving and going out on my own. 

I'm sure the right thing to do would be for me to just go explore, but I came here to do stuff with her and feel like shit. 

I've tried talking to her, she says we have only done my stuff and I wont do the only thing she wants me to do. 

Ive offered to drop her off there and then pick her up, she wont be the only one hiking, there are people attempting it every day, but she just rolls over and ignores me. 

This completely sucks.

53,"I don't *think* there's anything wrong with me.

I'm an almost 30 year old guy. I've never had a girlfriend. I've never even been on a date. I have a mediocre (but cushy) government job in a large city where I probably can't afford to live. I have an active social life with a bunch of great friends and a wide variety of hobbies and interests. I'm short, but built pretty lean and try to stay in shape. I have no sense of style, but I try my best to improve. Even though I refuse to admit it, I think I'm a pretty smart person. I may be completely devoid of charisma, but I get along with people and I have an incredibly dry sense of humor that isn't always obvious (but amuses me to no end).

I've tried just about everything. I've tried dating sites, dating apps, trying hobbies that are social, meeting friends of friends, asking friends about their friends, just about everything except cold approaching random people and directly asking my friends to set me up with someone. All of that with nothing to show for it. It all feels so fruitless and futile. I look in the mirror and I don't think I look that bad, but then I see the pictures I have of myself and I really don't blame any girl for not wanting to take one for the team.

I don't think I'm depressed. I can still feel happy. I just feel sad almost all the time. I don't like that I'm getting older or that I've wasted all my teens and twenties not dating, but the thing that gets to me the most is that I feel (almost *know*) that it's never going to get better. It would be one thing if I knew I was working toward something or if it were just a matter of waiting for something to work out. It just doesn't feel that way. In a vacuum rejection doesn't bother me. I get it. But it's all I've ever known and I logically can't find a reason why any decent girl would be interested in me any more. Even still, I try to stay optimistic and not preemptively shut any doors but deep down I know it doesn't make a difference.

The gross part is how little I need to actually feel confident. Just knowing that one cool girl even has the possibility of liking me is enough to give me an overabundance of optimism. I'm actually capable of being a lot more fun and engaging when I feel like someone is in my corner, but sadly I haven't felt that way in ages. I wish I could be that person all the time. It's like being looser and more entertaining when you're drunk, but hard to replicate when you're sober. I feel like I just have a dark cloud hanging over me all the time.

I'm not really looking for anything I guess. I just need to let it out. I sometimes let my self-loathing leak through around my friends, but I don't want to worry anyone. No one wants to hear about your problems. Not for free anyway. I suppose I'm good enough at putting on a happy face for people not to worry, but I hate myself so much.",08Feb2018,3

I can try and try all I want but anytime I meet a girl she either already has a boyfriend, or they're not my type and not interested in me anyways. There's this one girl I know who I used to work with, I have the biggest crush on her ever but she has a boyfriend of 9 years. The kicker here is this girl would be perfect for me! She likes literally everything I do, she's smart, funny, and pretty cool. She's also super cute and adorable. But of course, some other dude is with her and they've been together since high school.

60,"I never tell this story. Not to anybody. I haven't even told Bubba, who inspired it. Not to any friends. So I'm telling it here.


I am a 44 year old construction worker.


Last year I was a 43 year old, hard-hat wearing construction worker with solid brick laying skills. And I'm still (blush) admittedly a virgin to pissing outdoors. I'm only about 5'7, a ""drinks beer and eats nachos in between breaks"" belly on an otherwise normal frame.


I told my friend Bubba about how I like to wake up very early on some days and head to the construction site before work. I'm always alone, and it's beautiful.


He told me that he and his girlfriend used to go, and sometimes, he would get drunk, naked and then piss on our boss's trailer.


My eyes bulged. He giggled and said it was not vengeful at all. It allowed him to be ""one with nature"".


He said ""You should try it sometime, if you ever got the balls. Literally haha"".


Yeah right. I've never even pissed in a pool before.


Then, one Sunday morning at 5:00 am on a dawning, only slightly brisk autumn Tuesday morning...I got the itch.


I don't EVER do anything out of character. Why not just try it out? Nobody will ever know. So I gulped down a few beers and took the 5:30 bus there. Nobody should be there this early on a Sunday.


I actually undressed. I took off my heavy boots and long socks. My t-shirt. My pants. My undershirt.


There I was, shivering (it wasn't THAT cold, just a tad chilly, but the nerves got to me) in nothing but my light blue boxers.


I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and slid them down and stared at the boss's trailer.


Now, clad in only my Budweiser hat and as bare as a newborn baby, I cupped my package with my hands, and I timidly walked towards the 12 × 46 trailer, about 50 yards from where I left my clothes, and I looked up at the cheap paneling.


The smell of dirt. Old monster energy drink. Some other stanky smells coming from the tiny box, as though others had pissed (and possibly shitted) on it before.


Without even thinking, I placed my hands at my sides.


And there I was. Billy the timid construction worker.


Naked. Buck naked in fact.


More naked than the frames of the building site nearby, which was ""clothed"" in scaffolding and plastic.


More naked than Adam in the Garden of Eden, who at least had a fig leaf.


I was exposed. Not just physically, but at the very place I work at.


Inspired, I even walked around the entire trailer, as naked as the day I was born.


My round, bare belly shaking. My white-as-a-ghost ""bubble butt"" that Bubba would also make me blush over that he said I was always ""hiding"" under my work jeans, jiggling behind me. And my huge package (hey, it's a throwaway!) bobbing in the brisk air.


I walked around the entire trailer and began to tinkle on it. 


The crisp breeze occasionally startling me by caressing my bare butt. The tickle of wind on my belly and package as I peed. The feel of the dirt through my bare feet as I stood there.


I truly was one with nature.


Then I returned...and everything was gone.


My clothes. My backpack. My wallet. My money. My credit cards. My ID!!!


Suddenly, I went from a newly-confident outdoor pisser to a butt-ass naked and shivering idiot, timidly jogging/tip-toeing behind a dump truck for cover.


Now I was hiding my body shamefully from behind a dump truck, nervously poking my head out from behind it, eyes darting back and forth, looking for the thief who stripped me somehow even more naked than I already was. I could feel my big, bare, white butt behind me shaking even with that subtle movement.


Now I cringed defenselessly when the stiff, cold breeze attacked my hairy butt-cheeks behind me.


There I was. I had nothing on my body except the hair on my chest, stomach, arms and legs. And my (blush) pubic hair.


Reduced to being protected only by my own body hair like an animal.


At one point, shielding myself behind the large dump truck, in a futile attempt to reason with my robber who obviously was most likely long gone, I even managed to lower myself to poke my head out and squeak out:


""If you're out there, can I please have my clothes back? Can you please give me back my underwear at least? I'm---I'm NAKED!""


After staying there in a panic for 10 minutes, I knew what my only humiliating option was.


I took off running, butt-naked, through the construction site. More like a slightly advanced jog, because I couldn't risk falling in the mud.


I was now robbed not just of my possessions and clothing, but of my dignity.


Wearing nothing but my Budweiser hat and a pink blush on my face. My large penis and balls flapping freely for the world to see. And my goodness, my bare butt must have been a sight behind me.


Along the way, I had to dart behind dirt piles for cover at the very slightest sound.


For a few minutes, I had to hide behind a pile of lumber like a scared, exposed bunny as about 5 contractors came to the site, with no idea that my shivering, naked spectacle was hidden just about 30 feet away. 


I then made a final break for the trailer on the other side of the site, hearing a 40+ year old roofer yell ""Oh baby, nice ASS!!!"" as I tried to pathetically cover my butt-crack with one hand, palm outwards behind me.


I finally ran into my boss, who laughed his ass off, asked me why I didn't stay out there and get a tan, and eventually got me a ride home wearing a towel around my waist and a blanket around my shoulders, where my giggling landlady let me inside after I had to tell her what happened.


Thanks for the tip, Bubba.

61,"Before I start don't get me wrong... I like my build... Even if it is a bit dated. But I truly never found gaming on a PC all that fun to be honest. 

It's not like how it use to be on the Xbox 360 days where every time I come online I'm having a decent time. Gaming on this platform seems... I don't know... stale? I use to be able to make tons of friends playing my favorite games but now it seems like no one really wants to commit to a gaming friendship and that bums me out... 

I Still play with my buds I became friends with in the previous generation but we are all older... most of us have jobs now, some of us have a family now, and a couple are no longer with us... all in all its becoming more and more difficult to party up as the years go by. It honestly makes me want to cry sometimes because I made some really bomb ass friends and I wouldn't trade up for anything. Meeting these dudes and dudettes was the best thing to ever happen to me. My understanding of the world expanded because gaming brought me people to talk to and become friends with from all over the world. 

We laughed. We cried. We fought. We loved. We did everything friends did minus the physically meeting up part because as teenagers and young adults we where mostly broke fucks. As adults we are still broke fucks but that's now because we have bills that need attending to. We may never meet but considering each and everyone's circumstances it's alright and we all understand one another.

 Gaming as you become older feels weird. Least to me it has. The magic of gaming isn't with me anymore. I can't find any of what I mentioned above. I miss all of that. I'll probably find something similar in a different hobby... a different median to find friends. A different lifestyle.

I'll probably pick up knitting.",08Feb2018,1
62,"TL;DR I hate Facebook because of freebooting, the people, the concept, and my mother.

---

...And I have reasons. They're not good, but they're mine. 

You know why I hate Facebook, aside from me being butthurt about them [freebooting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7tA3NNKF0Q), its the people. You see... I got bored of Facebook quickly, so I stopped looking at it. After awhile (months) I came back to it and found a lot of shit. This is also not helped by the fact that I wasn't in a good social situation at the time, I was surrounded by people I didn't quite like. Now Facebook's big *thing* is connecting you with people you know... DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THOSE PEOPLE MEANT TO YOU it will present them to you. Now I didn't have many friends on Facebook, nor did I have the social skills to tell what kind of people I want in my life... I would just add them, indiscriminately. I kept seeing people that I didn't like, talking about things I don't care about, flooding my feed. This discouraged me from using the service more and more until I stop... and don't touch Facebook for afew years. Then some *relatable* thing happened to me, my mother joined, for different reasons.

My mother is a social worker... like her work is very social. She relies on a great public image to make a living, which is great for her because that's her kind of person. I'm not like that. Her IRL and Facebook are indistinguishable, and she gets involved with anything she can. She'd like everyone of my post, comment on my posts, consistently tag me.. It's annoying! She's always there, working, which is fine I need food (common lezbereal). But she also socialized, a lot. I couldn't be myself I had to be my her-self on Facebook which is exhausting for me. She always corrects the real me and my real behavior (i.e she makes half assed attempts to straighten me out, probably I'm not too sure) so instead of changing myself for her, I just **act** like what she want. But that's a lot of effort on me and it's tiring. So I just moved away from Facebook and moved to other places, like YouTube, Twitter, Steam and Reddit. 

Now it gets more annoying. Facebook got bigger, and started doing a lot of extracurricular shit like Timeline, Pages, Messenger, Events and more networking. So naturally my mother did too... and this was still at the time I was surrounded by people I don't like (.. let's just call them ""The Friends Club"", they don't deserve to be named properly). And the Friends Club would use Facebook for their organisation shit, which meant I had to! Now since I was passively ignoring Facebook (Didn't have the app, spammed all their emails, and revoked their Chrome Notifications permissions) I would never get these posts. Then *MY OWN MOTHER* would yell at me ""DAN WHY THE FUCK AREN'T YOU CHECKING FACEBOOK"". Can you imagine that, my 40+ year old mother yelling at her [then] 16 year old boy to use social media more. 

Recently I got out of the Friends Club and joined another group of people who also wanted to use Facebook, so I revived it. Went through my friends list and removed some people I don't talk to, or just don't like. I managed to get my friends count from [idk] 30 to ~10, then to ~20 with new people. I joined their new Facebook group where we got a link to a Whatsapp groupchat which we ended up using exclusively (swing and a miss mom). So I got some solace from that wretched clickhole.

She's still pounding on me to check Facebook, more recently, which is why I wrote this... ",08Feb2018,1
