1,"Sometimes I wish I wasn't a lesbian. I feel like if I liked guys I could get a boyfriend in the blink of an eye 

I went onto tinder and swiped through three people before it ran out of people. There just isn't enough girls into girls around here. 

I know irl is the way to meet people but I don't really go out a lot (like out drinking), I'm terrible at telling who's gay, and I get very nervous with girls. It's not like you can even approach someone in a shop, park, or cafe anyway. I've noticed that when I'm walking down the street and I see a pretty girl walking toward me I want to look at their face and smile at them but I always look down at my feet when they get close. I know I'd achieve nothing by doing this but a girl returning my smile would brighten my day. Low self esteem is shitty 

The longest I've gone out with a girl was a couple of months last year. We mostly did above the waist stuff, both being inexperienced but the one time we had sex was great. I almost wish I'd never been with her, because now I know what I'm missing 

I'm really struggling tonight. I live with three friends, who are all gay guys. Two are a couple and not in your face but very sweet together and I get so jealous. The other seems to sleep with a different grindr dude at least once a week. It just seems so easy for them 

I'm only 22, and I guess people will tell me I'm young and that I'll meet a great girl and all those cliches but I'm just so fed up right now. And I also know I'm sat whining when I don't really go out to the one gay bar my city has but it really sucks. 

I apologise for this rambly whiny rant. I hope I fall asleep soon. I'll probably delete this when I wake up but somehow typing to strangers feels cathartic right now ",02Jun2018,2
2,"Throwaway, obviously.

So let's get right to it. I can't seem to show emotion. My parents know this (I'm a teenage guy, paranoid so not sharing my exact age). I've always been kind of like this, except I've gotten more expressionless as I grow up (I was really excitable when I was small). The only place I'm really able to show excitement or being able to let loose is around friends and immediate family. Otherwise, for example, if I'm talking to my aunt or someone who I don't see very often, or who I'm not as open to, I can't seem to show emotions at all. For example, when someone gives me a gift, it feels REALLY unnatural to fake the excitement because I'm usually a pretty chill person. People probably think I don't like the gift, when I really do. It just feels really unnatural to show the excitement I have and be like ""OMG THANK YOU YOU'RE THE BEST!!!!!!"". Same with crying. Some people like to cry, I don't. When I'm texting and on the internet, people think I'm a completely different person than I am, and when they meet me, they discover that I don't talk that much. Also my parents want me to hang out with old friends who I don't have as much in common with, so I can't let loose around them either. Basically I seem like a boring person, when really the emotions is happening in my mind and i just feel weird showing them. Also pretty much the only emotion I let out is anger, but even then it feels weird to talk it out with anyone other than my close family. Is anyone else this way or am I fucked up in the brain? Okay sorry for spweing all this shit out like this but I don't know how to not seem like the world's most boring person, or a weirdo, or a guy with anger issues.

TLDR: Feels unnatural to show any sort of emotion. Resting bitch face as well.",02Jun2018,1
3,"My friend in high school and I about 1.5 years ago were comfortable with each other and one day ended up comparing dick sizes and over time that developed into jerking off together and it seemed weird to me but I didn’t stop it. Over the next few months we would continue jerking off together and send each other snaps of ourselves. One day while in person he asked me if I needed a hand and I declined. 

After that I was really confused and realized I didn’t want us to sexually engage with him. If that was my conclusion why did I continue on in the vague state of semi gay behavior all that time?",02Jun2018,1
4,"Hello, I’ve been struggling a lot for a long time but especially lately. This is my first post so I’m not sure if this is the right sub. 

Anyways, I feel so lost in life. I have minimal motivation and it feels like absolutely zero self discipline. I’m not sure if it’s depression or what but I don’t have a routine, I stay awake far too late and sleep at inconsistent times.. Some days I don’t eat or sometimes I just eat one meal.. I won’t have any personal hygiene for periods of time.. Any time I’m on track with working toward a goal and something happens to deter it momentarily or if I fail I just shut down and don’t leave my room for days. I just play video games. It seems to be my escape from responsibility and failures/ set backs. 

I left home when I was 18 and didn’t look back to get away from a toxic relationship with my step father. I tried going to school in a new city with no friends or social life. I did not do well. I was fed up working full time with no room to grow in the company and very lost so I joined the military (national guard). They help pay for school and after some training in discipline (basic training and AIT).. I thought, “hey I can do this now.” Went back to school, half heartedly tried.. I felt too good for the classes. Like I was too smart and these general ed classes weren’t worth my time. This is very upsetting because I know that it is a necessary step toward something more challenging and valuable. Nonetheless I have this superiority complex like I’m too smart for a basic 9-5 job for minimum wage and feel upset that someone who is less intelligent as me makes more money and manages me. Don’t get me wrong, I know I’m not even that intelligent but it doesn’t stop me from feeling this way. 


I used to go (on and off go now) to the gym and that was my get away.. actually seeing the results for the hard work I put into working out and dieting was/is an amazing feeling. But again, if something comes along to deter it.. i. This case it’s my ex breaking up with me.. i shut down and haven’t gone consistently since. 

I care way too much about what others think and seek approval/acknowledgment for things. I recognize a lot of these things.. for a long time I held it in but recently reached out to family and explained what’s been going on. Despite it helping me feel better having talked about it, i haven’t gained any progress on instilling any discipline or structure in my life. 

I have an idea of what I want to do, but don’t work towards it.. I just game and escape. Do I just throw out the computer? If it’s not the gaming then I’ll use my phone, watch twitch, YouTube, read articles.. anything to distract myself from the fact that I feel like I’m failing at life and disappointing family and friends that know my potential.. but most importantly disappointing myself because I know I’m capable of so much more. But instead.. for the past 5 years.. I’ve just wasted days, weeks, months... so much time. Not bettering myself or working toward anything . Or immediately shutting down the moment something goes wrong and stop working toward it. 


I deployed 2 years ago to the Middle East for 10 months and that was the most productive and happy I had been in a very long time.. I had structure, a routine, I worked out and made insane progress, I socialized with others who were dealing with the same day to day stuff.. it was very very awesome. But when we got back.. everyone came home to their families greeting them while I just waited for it to be over so I can get a ride back home.. no friends or family. And that’s my own doing because I created that distance. Anyways. Overseas I was productive and happy with that structure. 

I know I’m capable, I know I need to learn to love myself, I just don’t know how. I have to suffer from self esteem issues because I’m constantly worried about what others think or how I look. The sad part is I’m a pretty attractive guy. (Kind of biased, but just stating it’s not because I’m unbearably unattractive). I need help and idk what I’m even asking for. The only advice that seems to be available is just do it. But that’s part of the issue, I don’t just do it despite knowing the consequences.

I hit (what I thought was rock bottom).. no money, no one I talked to, on the verge of getting evicted with no where to go.. so I reached out. And amazingly some of the people I deployed with helped me out.. got me a job, gave me some cash to hold me over, made me call my family. I eventually quit that job because I had a plan.. but a wrench got thrown my way and I shut down. Not knowing what to do I moved in with my grandmother who has been an angel and given me financial freedom and a place to stay. But I’m just leeching off of her and sick of feeling like such a piece of crap. I’m very unhappy with myself yet not actively working on a solution. This is obviously not as in depth as it could be but I don’t want to explain every little detail that happened in the past 5 years in this post. Any response is appreciated. 


Im sorry if it seems all over the place. Kind of emotional and not sure what all needs to be included to give a brief look into my life.",02Jun2018,3
5,"Sorry for the wall of text, tl;dr at bottom.

I'm trying to decide whether or not to continue with the sport I joined this year (cross country). It was my first year in a sport. On one hand, I made a lot of great friends, I became less shy, I was a part of a team, the meets were fun (after my race was over), and I'm in fantastic shape. On the other hand, I hated waking up at 530 am for practice or meets 6 days a week, I was terrible at it, the weather sucks here so running only felt nice when it got kind of cold in December and January (after the season was over), I basically couldn't have a social life during the season-I missed out on football games and other events like that-and I'm just not competitive. I don't care too much if I beat someone or not, and I don't care if I never make varsity.Also, I want to focus on my more important activities, and school will be much harder next year. But I'm worried that I'll regret not doing it and seeing how much better I can do, or I'll regret doing it and get stuck in something I hate.

I'm also not sure what my own thoughts on the matter are because I've had so many people pull me in so many directions that I can't tell if I'm saying what I really think or if I'm just copying what they said because it appealed to me. One of my friends who's quitting has given me many valid reasons for quitting, but my friends still on the team give me good reasons to stay. Also, my mom is against me continuing it, but my dad wants me to keep going with it. I don't even know where I stand, and I don't know what would make me happy. I also want to continue being in shape and continue being healthy, and while I like the shape I'm in now, I can probably just ride my bike every day, and do some sit ups and push ups, which would take less time than our 2 hour practices and I wouldn't be stressing about how well I was doing. It would also be easier on my asthma and my legs, which are prone to shin splints. But there's also my lack of drive to exercise without motivation (like an angry coach) so I might end up just sitting around all summer, which is not what I want to do. I'm just confused on what I really want, and don't want to regret my decision.

tl;dr: I can't decide if I want to do my sport next year or not, because while I had fun sometimes it really sucked at others, and everyone I've talked to is pulling me every which way. I don't want to regret whatever my decision is, but I don't know what would make me happy.",02Jun2018,1

7,"My ex and I still communicate well, and obviously hold the other person in high regards. When seeing him last he said that he still thinks about me sexually and felt like a blowjob would help him move past the breakup madness and allow us to be friends. What does this mean??

He also said he is interested in a girl, and I’m pretty sure they have been dating for months. I still love him and the idea of being friends hurts, but I don’t want to lose contact with him either. Could his desire to remain friends mean that he, too, is having a hard time letting go? Since he expressed interest in a girl but said he still thinks about me, does that mean there is a likelihood of us getting back together?

The more I read into the situation, the more questions I have. Any advice would be wonderful. Thanks!",02Jun2018,1
9,She said it looked old. I cooked it the night before last. It was the last food that I had. My credit card is maxed. I don't have the money for this. I'm really hoping I do well on Monday's job interview. I need to.,02Jun2018,1
10,"I am such a complete and total waste of cognition. I will never learn. 

Many years ago. I met a girl. On a shitty dating site. I was about 15 at the time. Things set off between us at a bizarrely high pace. The only problem, was- big shocker here, she had a boyfriend. Shitty boyfriend, I could read right away like a book, the kind of guy driven only by his desire to stick his dick in things. After a few years of absolutely ridiculous amounts of teenage drama, they break up. The guy took her virginity and dumped her like two days later. Queue the girl coming to cry to me. I support her. Tell her I’m there if she needs me. After talking, and nothing else, for about another year, she gets a new boyfriend. Alright, that’s cool. I guess. He doesn’t seem like the kind of guy that would use her so, it’s whatever. We talk on and off, with some drama sprinkled about to keep things interesting. But again, same thing happens. They fuck, and break up. I’m STILL hanging around, pretty much accepting the fact that I’m in the friend zone at this point. Girl then starts transitioning to a male, mentally. She is going to orgies, posting nudes on every site known to man, totally out of control. I check out of the friendship after hearing she’s polyamorous. Fast forward to about four months ago. I started playing VRChat. Met a girl who seems literally too good to be true. Super friendly. Incredibly interested in me. Friends would call her the founder of my fan club. BUT, she’s married. So I think to myself, “okay, she’s just having fun.” Turns out, she’s bored with her husband, and doesn’t really consider him in her decision making. Needless to say, again, we grew extremely close to each other in a veeeery short period of time. Like, a month in, and we knew everything about one another. Spoke constantly. The problem here was that she was living quite a few states away. It would be impractical to start a relationship. I tell her that. She acknowledges. Now, while all this shit is going on, I forgot to mention I’m suffering from unreal trust issues thanks to my past “relationship”, which was on and off for about 7 years (I’m 25 now). We get into a single argument, and I lose my mind. Like, literally, I seem to lose all sense of reality. I tell her I’m sorry, and I’d we willing to be friends again, and that I can move past my flaws. It would be the first time in my life admitting something like this. She says that things wouldn’t be the same. And now, I feel like I should just give up. So that’s what I do. About two months later, today, she reached out to me. Tells me about her divorce being finalized, blah blah blah. Everything seemed to be going great. Then she tells me she’s in a relationship with some absolute FUCKING loser, who manipulated her emotions twice, in just the short amount of time that we knew each other. God I can’t even type this stuff out without making it sound superfluous. When she told me, I literally froze up. I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t move my hands to type. I didn’t know what to say.


The kicker here? About two weeks ago, the girl #1, the one who transitioned, confessed to me that she was waiting THE ENTIRE TIME for me to move things forward between us. SHE ASSUMED THAT BECAUSE I WASN’T BEING PUSHY, IT MEANT I WASN’T INTERESTED. I don’t know if anyone can fucking relate to that feeling. 7 years of chasing a girl, the love of my fucking life, thinking she wasn’t interested in me, and it was all because I didn’t make the “first move”. 


So, to summarize, I lost girl #2 THE EXACT SAME FUCKING WAY I lost girl #1. Almost 8 years of my life have been COMPLETELY LOST, and when girl #2 said those god forsaken words, it’s like I fucking passed out and spiraled into nothingness. I could NOT comprehend what I was hearing. I do not know what the fuck to do from here. I will almost CERTAINLY need to go back on Paxil, lest I sit in bed for 18 hours a day, and rot away. I am absolutely not fit for this fucking world. I can’t deal with depression from like four different sources in addition to this god damn bomb that was just dropped on me.

11,"I had a very long, very vivid dream last night about being a leader of a large group of survivors my age in a zombie apocalypse, and I want to turn it into a book. How should I start this?

12,"I (20f) am really good at taking care of other people. When I lived with my ex I felt like I was very good at cleaning up our apartment, making us food, and in general just good at taking care of myself and him. I broke up with him around 9ish months ago (due to feeing just comfortable  and not in love) and once it ended I felt as if I couldn’t take care of myself. My house became a mess, I wasn’t eating, I ignore my responsibilities... 
I am diagnosed with adhd, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive order. I would like to think this is not part of my reasoning for not taking care of myself but obliviously it might be. 
After my ex and I broke up I ended up meeting the most amazing guy. He’s supportive and kind and he really helps me a lot with my mental issues even though he has every right not to get involved with that side of me. And although he encourages me to be better, I feel as if I can’t do anything unless I am tying to do it for him. (Ex: cleaning my apartment because I know it will make him happy to see/ or / washing my clothes because he left some of his clothes when he slept over and I want him to have clean clothes to wear incase he forget to bring some the next time he sleeps over) 
I hate that I can’t do anything for myself and when I was having a conversation with him about it I realized that I don’t do it for me because I don’t like myself enough to do it for myself. I don’t feel like I deserve to have a clean house or nice food or anything good. And if I don’t have him( or anyone else encouraging me in such a personally way)  I probably would be a lot worse than I am now. 
A few days ago I realized another way I get encouraged. My problem with it though is that it is such a petty way to be encouraged and idk how I feel about acting in this way. And I want some feedback.
Basically, I used to get bullied a lot. Most of it happened back in high school. A lot of it was through people who I thought were my friends and I ended up breaking the friendship once they became mean to me but I couldn’t fully escape any of those friendships because we were part of the same friend group. Now I have this bad habit of checking up on the people that did me wrong (like my ex and the girl he cheated on me on, and ex friends who became super hurtful and mean to me, to just straight up bully’s) and when I check it’s to see if they are doing well in life or not. 
Now I’m not doing the best in life. I do have an amazing relationship and good job and now a somewhat clean house, but mentally I still feel weird. I’m not interested in any of my hobbies or anything really, nor am I able to talk to my friends about this because I feel like such a brat whenever I think about even telling them how I feel. But because I’ve been doing better at a few aspects in my life that were harder before, when I look at the people who’ve done me wrong and their posts on social media I feel sometimes motivated to do things. Such as when I look at one of my ex friends and she posts about nerdy type stuff now I want to get into more nerdy stuff because we like the same things but because he started getting mean I started avoiding the things I liked because she would do them too and get sorta mad at me for liking them. Or something a little more petty-  when I see the girl my ex cheated on me with on insta and how she’s into the artsy type of aesthetic so now I want to do it more because 1. I’ve always been an art kid I was also majoring in art before I took a break 2. When I started getting into the aesthetic was before he cheated on me so when he did and I stalked her to see who she was and I saw all that I stopped liking it because I didn’t want him to associated anything I did to her. (We had also continued aging after this but when we broke up he went straight to her) 

I’m sorry that this is so long. It’s probably more of a rant if anything. I just want to know if using pettiness as a motivator for my entire life is a bad thing because I can’t seem to do anything for myself. ",02Jun2018,1
13,"If you based my personality entirely on what I listened to your probably think I was pretty fucked up. It's mostly just cathartic tho.

14,"I made a post about this in the relationships subreddit a few days ago but it got removed. TLDR; my mother passed away and my dad's long time best friend moved in. They seem exceptionally close and I even found them in the same bed. Here's the full story if you're interested:

&gt; My parents were very happily married right up until my mom passed away about eight months ago. I'm the youngest of four kids so they never had a lot of time or money for themselves and went a little wild after I moved out. Most relevant, they purchased a ranch, and adopted three horses. My dad and his best friend, ""Clark"" were on the police force together back in the day. They're all the buddy movie stereotypes rolled into one, and it used to be a running (good natured) joke that Clark was his first wife lol. All of us kids grew up with him around and his relationship to all of us, including my parents, was always thought of as platonic. 

&gt; After my mom passed, my dad was (understandably) distraught. It's one of the only times I've ever seen him cry. He didn't sleep, he didn't eat, we had to force him to make decisions on her arrangements, and after the funeral he refused to see anyone besides me, my siblings, Clark, and his neighbor. Told everyone else to buzz off, basically. We all just let him grieve and do his thing, until my sister visited one day about two weeks after and noticed how much he was struggling to care for the horses. My mom was in pretty good shape and did her fair share for them, so her absence put a lot on my dad in that respect. We briefly talked about one of us moving in to help out, but we couldn't come to a decision. All of us were (and still are) in situations where it wasn't plausible. Marriage, kids, mortgages, etc. The house itself has four bedrooms but none of us could really come to an agreement. Lord knows our dad wouldn't fathom rehoming them. We just tried to visit as much as we could, both for his morale and to help with the horses, though my brother (the oldest) stayed weekends for a while to lessen the workload. 


&gt; Fast forward to two months ago. Although things with the horses were straightened out after my dad and my older brother had a schedule, he was still really not okay. I mean, I didn't expect him to be but it was clear he really missed my mom and was lonely. Things in my life were hectic and prevented me from visiting like I should have, but I was kept in the loop by my siblings and found out Clark moved in. This was surprising in a good way; Clark and his wife divorced a few years back and his kids have all moved out so hey, great! My dad will have someone to keep him company. 

&gt; As I visited throughout the next month, I noticed my dad steadily changing. Like, literally from sitting around depressed 24/7 to up, smiling, cooking again, gardening again, going into town again, etc. I was surprised, but in a good way. Clearly something in his life had changed that made him enjoy living again, so good for him. It's Full House but with horses.


&gt; But the more I visited, the more things stood out to me that I just...it's so awkward for me to even think about but I can't help it. They seem *very* comfortable with each other. Personal space ain't no thing. They put their arm around one another or sit uber close quite a bit. With me right there, it's not like I'm catching them in the act. My dad (this is going to sound crazy) almost talks about him like talked about my mom. ""I'm learning how to make ziti today, since that's what Clark wants."" or ""Gotta wash the windows, they're driving Clark crazy and lord knows he's not gonna do it himself."" Which like...okay. Clark also took over for my brother, and with 2 mostly able people on the ranch again there's no need for more help. And the incident that caused me to write this post at 6 in the morning: I saw them sleeping in the same bed. My parents always had an open door policy, as in we never knock or anything. I went in the other morning and heard the TV from my dad's room, so by habit I just went on back there and there they were. Sleeping side by side. The house has four bedrooms. 

&gt; They've always been close, but holy shit. I don't know what to think or what to do. This changes everything. It's not that I wouldn't support him or something, it's just that he was married to my mom for 39 years. They had the biggest love for one another I've ever seen. They seemed so happy. My dad has always seemed about as straight as you can get; there has been nothing as suspect as this. What does it mean? Was he acting the whole time he was married to my mother? My siblings haven't said anything to me but they have to be thinking it.

&gt; That leaves the question: what now? Do I bring it up to my dad? To my siblings? Exactly how would I go about that without ruining our relationship? If they are together I don't want them to have to hide it, but if by some bizarre, Twilight Zone twist they were in the bed for some platonic reason (let's be honest, what reason is there?) there's no way for me to ask without it being awkward, painful, and insulting.

Well. I didn't listen to the commenters. I definitely should have. For the most part it just fired me up even more because I honestly feel that though everyone was well-intentioned, this situation is difficult to place yourself in. I went over to my dad's house that afternoon. Literally just walked right in, find them both in the kitchen, and asked them to their face if they're gay for each other. 

My dad said, and I quote, ""Nina, what the fuck kind of question is that?"" At that moment it became quite clear I'd made a mistake. Several of them, actually. He went on to let me know how rude I was, and then told me he wouldn't have sex with Clark if his life depended on it. I've never been so embarrassed in my entire life. I figured there was nothing else to lose so I mentioned the bed incident. Turns out there was a platonic reason for that (...kind of?). My dad got really serious and admitted he's had a lot of trouble sleeping because being in the bed alone is a 24/7 reminder that my mom's gone. Unbeknownst to me, he's been sleeping on the couch the past eight months just because he can't deal with it. It started being too hard on his back so he moved to the floor, which Clark had none of once he moved in. So apparently they've been sharing a bed since then. 


Yikes. I left with my tail tucked between my legs and I never want to broach the subject again. But do I believe them? I don't know. I just don't know. Does it even sound plausible? I mean, what men would even do that? My dad was extremely defensive, too. I still can't get it off my mind. I'm not that touchy with my friends and I'm a 30~ year old woman. Either way, I don't want to talk to him about it. I'm still so embarrassed, hence why I'm writing about it here so late.

It was two of my really close college friends’ birthdays this past week. One of them I lived with for over a year, the other was one of my very first friends at a 4 year university. Everyone has all graduated and started to move on with adult life. I figured, after graduation I would never see all of them together again. I told ‘em all how much I will miss them and I also have told them all multiple times that, they are all pretty much my only friends. I don’t really have friends/know anybody in my home city. 

After work, I came home and started to relax. Browsing through social media and come to find out: they all got together again for a massive “family reunion” party to celebrate those two aforementioned friends birthdays. 

No one thought to invite me. I thought I was part of the “family,” at least in my mind I was. I guess I thought I was a lot closer to them than I actually was. 

It really is no big deal. Perhaps it wasn’t done intentionally— I was just simply forgot. That still doesn’t feel better. I’m still bummed out. It feels like I just lost all of, what was supposed to be, life-long friends because if they’ll forget me now, they will absolutely forget about me later on. 

I feel miserable about it. ",02Jun2018,4

22,"A couple of months ago I got way drunker than I planned and stole something. I wasn't feeling to good at the time, my dog had just died which made me a little depressed. What I remember is that I was leaving the party and checked if my coat was still hanging there because at the place coats get stolen all the time. I checked if everything was still in my coat and suddenly I thought that I had a powerbank in there that were stolen. I decided to check the other coats hanging to see if someone put it in one of these coats. Well apparently I took earphones from one of the coats and took them with me and maybe some coins but I'm not sure. Now I do not know if I took it by accident but I think I was just mad someone stole from me and my drunk mind thought it was a good idea to just take it. When I got home I fell against the fridge. The next day or when I got home, I saw the powerbank laying in my room so it turns out nobody stole from me since I didn't even have it with me. I don't know why I thought I did when I was drunk. I feel pretty guilty and shitty because it sucks to lose your earphones and I would be pretty mad if someone stole mine. The fact that coats get stolen there all the time, and people just take a different coat when it happens probably helped me get into that mindset. It's fucked up and I want to prevent myself from doing this shit in the future since being drunk is not an excuse for bad behavior. I returned the earphones to the place I stole them from and hope somebody asked for them. I also donated some money to a charity for donkeys in Pakistan to make me feel better. 

A couple of years ago I had a kind of similar experience. I was skiing and after leaving the bar drunk my poles were taken by somebody. I thought maybe someone took the wrong ones and so I took the ones closest to mine with me. Turned out these were my friends. He in return also took other poles home and ended up giving those to me. 

What do you think about these two situations? I personally believe that it is still a shitty thing to do and next time \(if ever\) I am this drunk and I think somebody stole form me I'll just leave it be. It's an emotional reaction but if you steal something because someone stole from you, you are just giving your problem to them which isn't good. If everyone keeps doing that, at the end of the day nobody has there own poles anymore. So thoughts and feelings are welcome. Be assured I still feel pretty guilty, I try to be a good person and wish everyone who doesn't harm me the best in general. The fact that under the influence I did something I wouldn't do sober is pretty scary in a sense. A good reminder to not drink too much or at least think BEFORE you act emotional. I am pretty young and I guess this is a good lesson to learn, trying to at least let something positive come from it.",02Jun2018,1
23,"On a throwaway because i can’t risk any of my friends seeing this. So, I go to a relatively small school with only about 100 people in each grade. Over the years i’ve made a friend group consisting of about 4 other guys. Ever since 10th grade, 3 more people have joined our friend group and we hang out with them all the time. However, ever since these 3 people were added, me and one of my other friends are not being invited to hangout with our friends anymore. Only one friend in that group tends to invite us all over, and he chooses to exclude me and my other friend. We have tried everything and i’m all out of ideas, i haven’t hung out with my friends for over a month now and i’m starting to lose them for good. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not like they all hate me, it’s really just the one that excludes me that dosent like me. They have all tried to get me invited in the past, but the kid that invites people is the most stubborn, stuck up, spoiled, and dumb kid you will ever meet, and they are all friends with him just to have a place to hangout. I really need help.  I understand some people will say “find some more friends” but when there’s only 50 guys in your grade, and half of them are nerds, it really leaves a small amount to be friends with and some people in that small amount don’t like me at all. I dont know what to do. ",02Jun2018,4
24,"I've found that when a life event distresses me I feel the need to write or talk about it at great length. Often this gets me nowhere with people. Usually once I explain my side of things people think I'm overreacting or just plain crazy. I alienate people by saying too much.

Has anybody else encountered this problem? I find if I just do what I know is right without saying a word most of the time things work out great. But as soon as I open my mouth or submit something online shit hits the fan. I've just started to notice this pattern of behavior. What can I tell myself to keep me from going on a rant?

26,"Without fail every birthday after my 18th has been progressively the worst day of my life. I don't know if I can do this again. On my 19th I got the news that I failed out of college. I attempted to go back, ended up dropping out. Since then I've been working hard at rebuilding my life. I have a well paying job that I kind of like. But whatever I do isn't enough. 

My parents visit every year. They take time off work for it. Since they live so far away I can't say no. I originally had plans with friends but I of course had to cancel my happiness to be miserable with my parents.

 Just talking to them fills me with guilt and shame because of how much of their time and money I've wasted. All they ask is ""When are you going back to college?"" And tell me about how my job definitely doesn't pay enough for me to live comfortably (I make $40k/yr). They just say these manipulative things like they are the only people who will always care about me and honestly, I'm starting to believe them. I'm self sufficient but just in case I've always had their safety net. Without that what if I end up homeless or worse? I definitely can't recover on my own from that. 

I'm 24 and have never had a girlfriend. And it's been so long since I last had sex that I might as well be a virgin. Nobody loves me except for my parents and their love is toxic and harmful. I'm completely stuck.

Today is the worst day of my life.",02Jun2018,15
27,"YouTube suggested A Bronx Tale clip to me after I watched a video from Goodfellas. I've never seen that one so I clicked it and read the comments and...yikes. I watched the whole movie but if you're not familiar with it, the clip they suggested is from a part where the Italians beat some black people within an inch of their lives for riding bicycles in ""their"" neighborhood. And pretty much all of the comments are racist. Not that vague racism but in-your-face, blatant, out and out white supremacy shit. Dozens upon dozens of them with tens of thumbs ups each. Very few people putting them in their place.


I've never dealt with racism against me, honestly. I'm white. I think it's possible, but I personally haven't experienced it. But that comment section literally made me want to cry. How is it possible that there are people out there who watched that scene and weren't intensely uncomfortable? How is a space such as that even a thing in this day and age? Just what the fuck. It blows my mind that people are *still* that ignorant and evil. That's literally evil. These are some blackhearted people and they walk among us. It's scary. 

I must sound so stupid talking about this considering it's not directed at me in the slightest. Maybe I'm sheltered, idk, it just really puts me in a blue mood whenever I see shit like that.",02Jun2018,38

I remember about the 3rd or 4th date - I didn’t look into his eyes while he was talking to me. I knew there was something there I never felt before &amp; it scared me - not really scared, but I knew if I did there was no turning back! 
A year later &amp; his eyes still get to me . 

I also remember our first kiss, I was so flabbergasted...  I dropped my phone and fumbled around like a clutz- lol it was embarrassing, I felt like a kid! We’re in our 50’s 

Right from the very beginning We talked as if we knew each other forever, the coincidences kept coming! Everything fell into place, even though we both said we weren’t in a good place in our lives for a relationship. No pressure, just day by day (date by date) it grew organically 

We’ve had many similar life situations and experiences- we share many of the same morals/ethics/beliefs - we have both had our share of hard knocks &amp; both still feel the effects at times - we balance each other out and help each other with the ups and downs that life, emotions, and memories throw at us; With respect empathy and understanding. 
I’ve never felt judged or pitied - put on a pedestal, or knocked down as I have in other “relationships” in fact this is the first time I feel like I’ve really ever been in a truly loving and equal real relationship - I sure could go on and on...

36,"I had a pretty traumatic childhood/teenage years 
I had well intentioned parents but between financial struggles, their own emotional burdens, and my emotionally abusive older brother I cannot separate my experiences in the house from what i know it to be today. 

Today my older brother is not around and my parents are financially stable and happy. But the house still lingers with traumatic events. 

When i was younger I attempted suicide in my bedroom, I harmed myself, I spent many anxious nights not sleeping not eating crying. And now that I’m back from college sleeping in that room is such a trigger. 

After the attempt I started to see a psychologist I still see her to this day 

When I’m off at school I am healthy “normal” and thriving but I digress immensely when I have to spend extended periods of time in that room/house

37,"I am asking the question in general because I have seen people faking things. It may be situations, feelings and even disgust. It is a fact that both women and men may fake their orgasms (women do more, as surveys say) but even out of the bed people fake things.

I have seen people hiring a ride and just fake while paying, like they hardly expected that they gotta pay at the end of it. Some fake their conditions for no reason at all and never think twice before getting into a brawl with that fake situation. I don't know why such crazy things happen. People can live as they are but they never practiced the same. In fact, I have seen it more among the urban people rather than the rural-based ones. Faking the feelings are something that appear absolute crazy! But people do that.

PS: May be I had been into anthropological articles since the morning and all of a sudden these things came to my mind. Truth is, these things happen every day but people, knowing everything, practice the same rather than avoiding it.",02Jun2018,2

41,"Hello! I have misophonia, also known as selective sound sensitivity. What I respond to most strongly is repetitive tapping, pen clicking, and shaking legs. I’m still in school, and people almost never respect the fact that it bothers me, especially because they don’t know what misophonia is and assume that I’m just overreacting. Usually people stop after a polite, “Could you please stop tapping/clicking/shaking? It’s really bothering/annoying/distracting me.” But when they don’t and say something like, “Just ignore it,” I don’t know what to do. I get extreme reactions, such as intense rage, the urge to hurt/kill them to make them stop [I know it might seem like an overreaction but I genuinely can’t control it], and even anxiety, although anxiety isn’t a very common response for me. 
I’d really appreciate it if any of you had some tips on how to cope with this. I’ve really been struggling. 
Thanks. ",02Jun2018,1
42,"This is a crazy story I know, but it's true, and I would never dare tell anyone in real life.

I am a huge geek in college. 4.0, Dean's List calculus geek. I'm a 22 year old senior. Still a virgin (blush). I'm kind of known as being a ""know-it-all"", and one day I made fun of my friend Ashley's pronunciation in front of some guy she really liked, and both the guy, and all our friends, laughed hysterically.

Little did I know, I would eventually pay for it.

I really, badly needed a job to pay tuition during my last semester. I saw a listing for a desk clerk position at a resort that perfectly worked with my schedule, and found out it paid twice as much as any in the area.

I got there and found it was a NUDIST resort. And that even employees had to respect the dress code...

This is insane to me. I am a total geek. I never even take my shirt off with friends at the beach. Just the thought of standing there all day...exposed...just at the mercy of nature...made me blush red.

I am about 5'7, a bit of a ""Studies While Eating Doritos"" belly. A surprisingly big, ROUND bubble butt behind me that my friend Ashley always teases I'm ""hiding"" under my ""nerdy khakis"" and not exactly the biggest package in the world (Hey, it's a throwaway!). Plus I was lily-white from the neck down.

The idea terrified me, but in the end...the money won out. And I actually worked a full semester as naked as a jaybird, wearing nothing but my glasses. I would just tell myself, hey, my bottom half is hidden by the desk!

No guest will ever see the goods!

I only told my friend Ashley because she was out of state with her longterm boyfriend, and she thought it was hilarious of course. But I only told her the type of resort, never told her the name or where it was. It's even very discreet to look up on Google.

Finally, one day I absentmindedly thought I was sending an email about a shipment, but I CC'd Ashley on an email that had the address.

Guess who showed up giggling mid-shift in the early afternoon while I was blushing and bare-assed naked behind my front desk?

""Hehehe are you really NAKED behind there? Like you have NOTHING on?! hehehe""

""Oh my God, you're actually getting tanned!""

""Do you have a fig leaf, at least? hehehe""

At one point I was distracted by another guest (40 year old woman), and Ashley snuck behind my counter, grabbed my neatly folded pile of clothes (even my sneakers and socks!) and said ""Have a nice ride home, virgin boy!"" and SPANKED my bare butt as hard as she could as the guest laughed and Ashley ran out of there holding almost LITERALLY everything I had.

I started to chase wearing nothing but a blush on my face and a hand on my package (she turned around and got quite a laugh out of THAT image) but I stopped at the front door she shut behind her, as I chickened out about running through the parking lot in my birthday suit in broad daylight. The entrance (and what would have been my subsequent streaking through the lot) is clearly visible to the highway. Plus, what if she had her cameraphone in her car? (Cameras and/or phones aren't allowed to get into the front entrance)

Anxiously, I stood at the front entrance, naked and helpless, trapped by my own modesty, hiding my bottom half behind the front door and poking my head out, nervously waiting for her to walk back up laughing and give me my stuff back.

As I waited, the female guest said ""She got ya good across both of those cheeks, honey! And it looks like you're drivin' home NEKKID tonight! hahaha""

I faked a laugh, and stood there bare waiting for the relief of my friend returning my clothing. I could feel the gaze of the guest on my exposed butt.

Suddenly, I hear an engine roar, and there went Ashley speeding off in her car past me yelling ""WOOOOO!!!"" while swinging my boxers in a circle like a victory flag out of her car window. She then tossed my car keys out of the window and onto the pavement.

I just watched her drive off, with my package exposed in the cool air conditioning, and my bare butt-cheeks still stinging from her admittedly hard slap a few moments ago. She didn't just have my clothes. She had my phone, my wallet, my money and my ID!!!

I then blushed and sheepishly scampered out into the bright sunshine to grab my car keys and run back inside before anymore incoming guests got an eyeful. But I did hear a long beep from the highway which made me gasp.

At least I knew I had, at the very least, a towel in my car and an extra pair of sneakers to wear on the ride back.

That doesn't mean it wasn't humiliating walking back to my desk, defeated and bare, with my penis flapping in full view of the giggling guest. The first and only time a guest at that resort saw my full bare body. Especially when she said ""Wow, STILL a virgin, honey? Aren't you graduated from college by now?"" as I walked past her as my face burned lol.

Feeling even more naked than usual the rest of my shift, finally we were closing for the night, and I when I got to my car I saw that, to my horror, Ashley went in there and cleaned it out.

No towels. No sneakers. No clothing. Nothing. Not a garbage bag. She even took the freaking floor mats out.

The resort was all locked up. No way back in there now.

Since I lived very close by, only about a 5 minute drive, I actually took a deep breath and got into my car and actually had to drive home naked and blushing. Ever drive a car with bare feet? Simply awful. And then I had to slump down nervously in the front seat when someone pulled up next to me at a red light!

Luckily, she left my belongings in my mailbox, but not a stitch of clothes. She mailed them to me later to make sure I had to make the naked walk of shame into my house!

I had to exit the car, run butt-naked across my front lawn, past the front of my house, get my bare butt through the gate and get into the backdoor.

I was the victim of the ultimate prank!

**Questions:**

Do you feel the main character's vulnerability?

What parts are funny and why?

What parts were visually immersive for you?

Does the girl go too far or is the prank harmless fun? If it goes too far, what part is too far exactly?

Did any parts make you cringe imagining you in the boy's shoes? (or bare feet lol)
