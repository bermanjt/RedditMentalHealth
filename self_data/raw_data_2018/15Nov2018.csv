3,"Hello r/self, I've been holding a lot of shit in for quite a while, and I would like to hear of ways to help cope or to help deal with what's going on in my head. 

It started about 4 years ago, I met a wonderful girl, and the obligatory ""this is the girl I'm going to marry"" worked its way into my mind over time. Of course it didn't work out and we spent the next ~2 years going through an off and on relationship, which utterly destroyed me. When I finally pulled myself out of the situation there was no good side, no right side, just a shit ton of hurt feelings and broken promises. For a good amount of time after that I just live life through chemistry, the ""can't think about it if you can't think"" mentality.

I tried dating after that for a bit but just ended up being a few regretful flings for the most part. Finally about a year ago I found someone who I connect with on a very personal level and we have fostered an amazing relationship, but I keep noticing that nomatter how much I love where I am and who I'm with I really do miss this girl still. I still drink and smoke excessively to cope but it's not fair to my SO or for me to be in this mindset still.

I am truly happy where I am, but even after 4 years just the mention of her name turns my whole outlook on the day to a bitter-sweet sadness. My question to anyone who reads is what am I missing? How do I change my mindset or cope better with any of this? What do you do when sadness creeps up on you about any past event? I understand ""the past has no barring on the present"" but I'm tired of just *waiting for it to pass* 

I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting,
Thanks in advance.",15Nov2018,1
4,"I go to ship an defective item back to Amazon, so I had to print out a shipping slip. I don't have a printer so I go the library, I print a larger size because I figured I'll play it safe and make sure everything is legible. I come to find out the packaging slip they put the print in is small, so I should have printed out a regular size. Fine, it's my first time returning an item to Amazon, I made a mistake.           

The cashier at the post office decided it was because I was stupid and talks down to me, making it a point to check the package. Apparently, in 2-day shipping, they just stick a sticker on the actual item and ship it ASAP rather than put it in a box with packing peanuts or those little air bags they use. But this lady probably thought I mishandled the item and didn't know it's 'supposed' to be in a box. Well, that's how I got the item and that's how I'm going to return it. She wasn't overt with her judgement but I've dealt with enough cashiers in this town to know that they are ""above us all"" especially if you have some brown in your skin. I made a mistake, but making me feel like I'm stupid for it? Fuck you hoe.         

Whatever, I go to get groceries. As I am leaving, I pass by the front of the store, people are walking in and out, going to and from their vehicles. I drive slow and stop to let people walk by. The area in front of the building is a 'no stopping zone' to prevent lazy people from stopping at the doors and blocking all the types of traffic. This lady drives up behind me as I am stopped for a little old lady, waiting for her to cross. The lady in the car decides she'll just drive around like an asshole. So I speed up as soon as it's clear, and get in her way (we were all driving very slow, so when I say speed up, I mean like 2 KM/H) she stops and gets behind me (hopefully) realizing she's making an asshole move. It's not the first time it's happened. I was stopped at a stop sign turning right. I had my blinker on, waiting for the oncoming traffic to pass. A lady in a pickup pulls up next to me. It's a 3-way intersection, either turn left or right. Right lane turns right and left turns left. Pretty simple concept right? This chick decides I am stopped, like parked? At a stop sign? With my turn signal on? SHE TRIES TO GO AROUND ME turning right. I purposefully get in her way, making her hit her brakes, because I had the right of way. If she hit me, she'll be paying.            

I see terrible driver's in my city all the time. How do these people have a license? Stopping in the middle of the road and then suddenly turning on their turn signal for 1.5 seconds and instantly turning as opposed to how you're supposed to turn: turn signal on to let drivers behind you that you're going to be turning, the driver's manual says to at least give a half a block's length notice but use your brain and figure out a reasonable timing -&gt; NOW you can apply the brakes -&gt; wait your turn and turn.         

Rant over. I feel better.",15Nov2018,1
5,"On the one hand, it's great that I could still find a career designing games or get people to buy my art or make a billion podcasts whose merch people buy. It's nice to know that I'm not a hopeless case even though I just turned 30 with no non-shitty job in sight.

But that also means I might still have a decade or more of putting up with shitty jobs that barely pay the bills, don't even put a dent in my student loans, and take huge bites out of my self esteem. I might have another seven or eight years of seeing the success of my old friends and family while I still struggle to find time and energy to work on shit? I might be bartending for another decade? I might be in my *late 30s* and still fending off questions of why I don't go back to school? (because I'm still drowning in debt from the first time I went to school, *Karen*.)

7,"I know it's shallow for me to care so much about what I look like. But I've always wanted to be one of the pretty girls, for as long as I can remember. I'm not a bad looking girl. I've been told that I'm pretty by plenty of people, including good looking people. I dress well and work out. But when I look in the mirror and take pictures, I see those imperfections that bother me so much. To the point of obsession. I spend hours thinking about getting plastic surgery, and have already got fillers in my nose and botox in the jaw.

For example, I hate my round face. Even though I'm slim, I have round chipmunk cheeks. I got botox to try to slim my jaw down, but it wasn't enough. I'm contemplating having my buccal fat removed, because my face is still so fat. Once I have the money, of course. When I take pics with other people, my face is fatter than everybody else's even if I'm skinnier than them. I use a photo editing app to slim down my face in all pics I post on Instagram and Facebook.

I thought I was pretty for a while, but then realized that maybe I'm not.  It seems that most of the time that I'm attracted to guys, they're just not into me. Maybe it's the type of guys I like, or maybe it's that I'm not pretty enough. It makes me feel shitty and wonder if I like guys that are better looking than me, and that's the reason why I never get the guy. I can't help who I'm attracted to, but am never into the guys who are into me. I've been straight up rejected by guys who chose another girl instead right in front of me, and it really hurt my self esteem each time it happened. I know I shouldn't need some jerk I don't know's validation, but it makes me feel so ugly. 

I know I sound like a superficial, vapid individual to those reading this post. But I know I have more to offer. I'm an honest, decent person. But I'm really insecure when it comes to how I look, even though I try hard to be pretty. I don't give a shit about what others look like; I'll be friends with anyone as long as they're a good, respectful person and we get along well. But when it comes to who I'm attracted to, I'm rarely attracted to anyone and am only attracted to guys who are possibly out of my league (physically). So maybe I'll always be single.. That's okay. I just want to learn to be happy. I wonder if I can figure out how to be happy without getting the cosmetic procedures that I want to get done.",15Nov2018,1
8,"So as the title suggests I feel everywhere about this and might have a hard time following a single train of thought... 

I’m 20M, my father was 75M.. until a year ago you couldn’t tell his age, he was a beast of a man, always doing things by himself, up to 74 he was still knocking down walls and building sheds, a proper manly man.. then we got the news...

It was devastating, dad had lung cancer, we never as a family did emotions, dad taught us boys don’t cry from childhood so it was especially difficult, we made jokes and carried on. I cried daily, in private.

As a side note I have dealt with depression and so had previously been to classes and been taught coping methods, this support stopped when I felt I was coping better and that was a couple months before the news, attempts to re-access support was met with resistance because ‘I was dealing with things in accordance to a regular reaction’ I occasionally messaged McMillans when I gathered the courage but generally ignored the issue when I could..

Anyway I was finding things so difficult to deal with, my mother (50s) and brother (22) live at home and so looked after dad, and I moved out to live with my gf (20f) in a house halfway up the country, we live with shitty people but that’s another story.

So dad got worse, with lung cancer you can expect that, I was appalled to learn just two months ago (when father seemed fine) that he had difficulty keeping mobile.. I cried my eyes out a month ago when I heard he couldn’t climb the stairs alone, and me and all my brother (20, 22, 44) and sister (45) all started visiting on the weekends starting two weeks ago, when we heard he was bed bound. We all openly cried with each other and were frank, it was definitely helpful..

This weekend I visited with my sister.. there was a lot of crying and an event that caused me complete lack of emotion.. my father needed to piss, we’d sent my brother and mother out just for time out the house. My dad (though not being able to talk) shooed my sister because he couldn’t have his little girl helping him, so I was left with the skeletal body of my father who hadn’t eaten in two weeks, to pull his trousers down. Then (despite being told I wouldn’t have to) taking his nappy down as he wasn’t able, and helping him piss into a container.. all whilst having to get instructions from him, clearly agitating him through not understanding for 10 minutes, and hurting him, tryna lift and pull clothes off steroid sealing skin... that was the last interaction I had with my father, he passed Saturday morning. Although I had cried constantly up to that moment, I couldn’t manage any tears when mum came down and gave me the news.. nor for the next four days whilst I returned to work with supportive colleagues, though the Didn’t know the situation. I finally caved and told my team and boss and have been given nothing but support.. cried all day too.

I just feel still so angry, I think my last interaction has tainted everything. I said what I wanted to, but am so fucked off with it all, I can’t understand why I’m more angry than sad and let that deep into any interaction I have issues with. 

I don’t know what I’m posting in hopes for.. maybe I just needed to vent. I feel so lost and like I haven’t let things sink in yet..  I’m fully expecting to see him, bright eyed making his usual jokes when I go back this weekend.. i can’t concentrate on anything and my emotions are everywhere.. any words from anyone is welcomed. 

Many thanks for listening this far",15Nov2018,1
9,"I had a surgery at the end of 2016 and as I was waking up I overheard the nurses saying that I was pre-diabetic and that it was a shame because I was so young. 

Since that day I’ve busted my ass to lose weight and get healthy and lost 150lbs. Not only that, but I got a clean bill of health from my doctor. In fact, when I went to see him again months after the surgery I’d lost ~90lbs and he legitimately didn’t even recognize me and thought his office made a mistake in saying I was a returning patient. 

Health is important but the main reason for the change in life style was that I wanted to stop feeling suicidal and miserable and ugly all the time. I wanted a social life. I wanted to date. These were the main reasons behind the change.

And a lot of progress has been made. I don’t mean for this to sound cocky, but I have a ton more friends now, I can get dates pretty easily and I can get them with women I actually find really attractive. 

I dress a lot better and my social skills have gotten a lot better and this has all lead to me losing my virginity and having sexual relationships with women who wouldn’t have even looked at me 2 years ago.

I can honestly say that people like me now. And I could even say there’s lots about myself that I like and that I’m proud of. But there’s two things that still hang over me and make me feel worthless sexually. 

And they’re my penis and my body. 

My penis is average and I know the science says average is fine but I’m also a large framed black man. Women of all races that I’ve dated and had sex with (black women, white women, Latina women, and Asian women—but mostly white women), all expect me to be this dominant, rough sex partner with a giant dick and thanks to how I look in clothes, they also expect this perfect muscular body.

The persona they expected was very difficult at first but that is at least a learned skill that I’ve been able to figure out. But I obviously can’t make my dick bigger and no matter how much I lift and how strict I am on my diet (and I’m extremely strict about both. I haven’t missed a workout since I started and I haven’t even drunk anything other than water since that day in the hospital when I was waking up from surgery), I will always have this excess, flabby skin.

I even have to be careful about how I wear pants because the excess skin “muffin tops” if I’m not mindful. 

If I could at least have a decent body, I could cope with the penis size thing. But the excess skin that still makes me flabby and pudgy makes me want to die sometimes. I’ve put in so much work and this ghost will follow me around for the rest of my life. 

People who I’ve spoken about this to always bring up the surgery I can get to remove the skin. 

I’ll hopefully be starting medical school next fall. There is just no time at all for that surgery/recovery in my life until I’m 40. So I just feel hopeless. 

It hurts worse than being a fat virgin to have a woman you like and are attracted to be super excited about having sex with you until she sees you naked and her mood OBVIOUSLY changes. 

It even somehow feels worse when these women end up liking me enough to want to continue the sexual/dating relationship but whenever it comes to sex, I can tell they’re gritting their teeth to get through it. 

I honestly feel like I’m only really good for oral and digital sex and like I’ll never be what any woman truly, earnestly wants. 

I’m tired. I’m tired of putting in so much effort only to come up short in ways I can do nothing to fix. Maybe this is too important to me but this is making those old suicidal feelings resurface. 

I want to be wanted and I don’t think I’ll ever be satisfied just being accepted. I don’t want anyone to look at me and think “well I like his personality and he looks nice in clothes so yeah I can still be in a relationship/have sex with him” ",15Nov2018,1
10,"I love the feeling of falling asleep. I love being comfortable in my bed. Today I slept 16 hours which is normal for my days off at work (part time). I ignore hanging out with people close to me to sleep. I’ll stay in every weekend to lay in bed and be comfortable. I can’t stop this has been happening for a year. 

Occasionally I’ll workout and play video games but I’m never up long. I usually can only go three hours before I crawl into bed and nap. I can’t see this problem going away soon. 

I feel like I had a productive day if I binge watched a show or gamed for a couple hours. I’m usually not even tired when I sleep but I can pass out even when I’m wide awake. 

Apparently sleep addiction isn’t real but I feel like I honestly have it. ",15Nov2018,1
11,"I recently became a Manager of a restaurant and employees are a mix of college kids and older people (working in kitchen).

Lets talk about my personality first, on the outside i give off an innocent and maybe ""too nice"" vibe. I am somewhat introverted, have social anxiety and i care way too much of what people think of me and my self confidence is quite low.

I absolutely feel so bad once i feel like someone gives me pushback or attitude. Today one of my employees gave me a weird vibe..usually hes nice and friendly to me but today felt really weird and i can tell he wss probably talking shit about me. I get that everyone gets talked about but im not sure what i did to make him act that way towards me. I rarely ever tell this one whst to do since he worked here way before me and knows what to do and i always do my best to stepp in and help out whenever he needs me. 

I felt like complete utter crap and wanted to gtfo. My boyfriend is the assistant manager and i told him i had to go..

I am not good enough for anything.
I care too much about what others think of me

12,And not to get off on it. I just can’t do the whole self harm thing. I just want someone else to hurt me and make me feel worthless. I thought about taking boxing classes as an alternative but I don’t want to push back and defend myself. I just want to be wailed on with pain. I thought about tattoos but that sound expensive. Guess I’ll just go find a sadist to low key beat me up. I’ve been before with friends who are casual goers so I could do it. It’ll seem normal. ,15Nov2018,1
14,"I thought if I could just mind my own business, no one would be bothered by me. 

I live with my parents and our financial situation is slightly below average. We can survive comfortably. I also have brothers but they are living off on their own. 

I've been saving money for my own selfish reasons when I could have been helping out with my family. I gave money when I could but would hold back because I was secretly planning a trip. 

Come a week before I leave, I tell my parents that I'm going on a trip for work. I told them I was going interstate, when really I was secretly planning to go overseas for a holiday. I straight up lied to them because I knew how they'll disapprove of me going and be very upset knowing our current financial situation. 

As being the youngest of the family, my parents dote on me a lot. And seeing me go interstate for a ""business trip"" scares them. So much so that I get constantly lectured about my safety. 

I don't hate my parents. In fact I loved them very much and vice versa, even though I'm a piece of shit for lying to them. 

Anyway, seeing as they think I'm going for work, they let me off hoping that'll get a good cut of money for work because of it. 

You see my plan was to limit the money I gave to my parents to help out (as I was setting most aside for the trip). Then say that I'm going overseas for work. And once I came back I would give my parents a bigger cut (which would make it seem like I made more). And everyone lives happily ever after.

Oh how I was wrong. This is no fairy tale after all.

My family thought I was going interstate for business, not have fun overseas. I made it my mission to keep all a secret. But I let the ego and excitement of an overseas trip get to my head and I carelessly posted on my Instagram story

Thing is none of family members have Instagram accounts, so I didn't think much of it. I thought ""it should be fine. Nothing would get leaked."" I am such a fucking idiot. 

Once I land, I got a couple of messages from my mum saying why I haven't picked up the phone or answered her. I told her that my phone died and I was flat out busy with work. When in reality, I was just on a 10 hour flight. 

Given the communication situation overseas, my parents only ever contact me through WhatsApp, so I thought as long they don't call me through telecom network, my secret is still safe. 

I don't contact my parents and if I do it's only a short message. So you can tell they are worried sick. And it also doesn't help that my keeps constantly dying, so I can't constantly keep tabs on communication. 

Fast forward 3 days into my trip, I get a huge load messages. This all happened while I was asleep, I didn't respond to any of it. When I woke up I went through my messages. And here's where things went from 100 to 0. 

The messages unfolded like this:

1. My mum has been admitted to hospital and needs an operation because of kidney stone and cyst (someone PLEASE tell me if this life-threatening)

2. Messages from various family members (dad, brother, sister in law) asking me why I'm not responding. 

3. They start to get suspicious of my absence so they start digging up information on my true whereabouts. And remember how I told you I carelessly posted on my IG story. Well it turns out it got leaked to my family. 

4. Cue the shit storm. My entire family is livid with me. They found out. And given the situation it's not a good sight to see when they see you having fun where you said you would be working. To them it seemed (and to me as well) I abandoned my mum and family.

5. My dad refuses to talk to me, one of my brother wants to beat the shit out of me. And the rest are overwhelmed with emotions of anger and disappointment.

I don't know what to do. I don't know what to say. I'm so overcome with shame and self disgust. I can't even the bare the sight, let alone talk, to my dad. There's absolutely no point in trying weasel my way out of this one. I've come to realise I'm the most selfish inconsiderate person. I feel anything I say or do will be useless and all just lies. 

I don't know what to feel. I have mixed emotions of self hate, anger, sadness and a whole bunch of shitty feelings. I tried calling my dad, and when he picked I couldn't get any words out of my mouth. When he answered I could tell in his voice that he was so so so disappointed and disgusted with me. He hung up as I was stuttering. 

I tried calling one of my brothers, he told me not to talk to him, because anything I say is just lips service and crocodile tears. 

I tried calling my other brother, and luckily he's level headed. But as soon I began talking, I broke down crying. I let loose my feelings of self hate and how I'm sorry. 

After the calls, I cried some more. Then I started to think about what my brother said and who I really am. 

Now I'm having an emotional battle with myself. I don't know what to feel. For one, I've come to realise (to me at least) that feeling sorry for myself is a selfish action in of itself. I feel like I don't deserve any sympathy and calling myself these names and hating myself is undeserving of me. I deserve much worse. I'm not if it makes sense or not but it's the best I can describe it.

I mean is anyone really truly selfless. And at a time like this, I know I can't be truly selfless. I'm having conflict with myself. Most of me wants to go back to see my mum but I can't afford it. But at the same time, I know somewhere there's a tiny little part of me that's ""happy"" knowing I can't afford to go back because now I can't cut this trip short. And knowing I have this tiny miniscule feeling, I feel like I want to vomit of how disgusted I am with myself l thinking like that. 

I truly don't know what I am anymore and it seems my whole life is turned upside down because I decided to think about myself. I thought if minded my own business, no one gets hurt. 

I can't enjoy this trip anymore but a part of me wants to. I'm not sure how I should be feeling or what to do. And I'm definitely not prepared of what will happen when I get back. I feel like I wanted to disband from my family and live a solitude (is that selfish as well?)",15Nov2018,1

With that out of the way, I’m gonna begin.


So about an hour ago, I decided to watch YouTub vids. So, as usual, I grab my headphones, plug them in, click on a video about a Super Mario speed run, and watch away.


Buy something is missing. The YouTuber’s voice. The music is there, but SOMEHOW the voice is gone. Call me crazy, but I’ll say this under oath if you want to.


I decide to do some tests to see if that video just lacks the creators voice. It’s supposed to have his/her voice because it’s that sort of video, but it didn’t.


So I go to some videos that I know for a FACT have the youtuber’s voice (Pewdiepie videos), and go to some only music videos (Destiny soundtracks).


None of the Pewdiepie videos had Pewd’s voice, but had the music if there was any. All the Destiny soundtracks were fine.


Weird.

18,"I live in Southern California, moves from NorCal. I feel as though I romanticized leaving and going to SoCal. My friend gave me the opportunity to go. That we would be roommates splitting rent. So I agreed to it and we’ve been living here ever since.

But my friend doesn’t like the culture here. He says that people here aren’t as down to earth as in NorCal, and I tend to agree with him. His girlfriend doesn’t like the musical theater program she’s in, and he doesn’t like his, so they’re both going back to NorCal.

I feel as though I need a sense of familiarity, and my friend was that for a long time. During our acid trips, we built ideas off of each other and I owe a lot to him for keeping my trips good. We got so close and our lives so intertwined that I learned so much from him. I’m going to miss him.

I haven’t made very many friends here. I met the love of my life and we’ve been together for a month and a half. It’s one of the best relationships I’ve ever had and I wouldn’t trade anything for it. But it’s pretty hard for me to make friends because I have high functioning Asperger’s syndrome and that makes it hard for me to connect with people. I know a lot of people at acquaintance level but no one who I’ve really connected with as a friend.

His PC is gone and it feels really empty in this room. I always preferred when he was gone and it was time for me to spend with myself but I don’t really know how to be alone. I’m moving in with my girlfriend after next semester, probably in August, hopefully sooner.

I love Southern California. But I don’t think I could stay here for that long. I’m probably going to leave after I’m done with my associates. I want to go to Sonoma state for music.

I need to get a job so I have things to fill my time and I don’t just devolve into a fucking depressed mess, and so I don’t have to keep asking my mom for money, which I feel terrible about, but it’s been difficult trying to get a job here.

22,"So tonight I asked my ex who I dumped to get back together with me. We had dated for a year and have been apart a month and a half.


Backstory, skip if you like:

I dumped her primarily because her insecurity was negatively impacting our relatioship. She lost her trust in me and I increasingly lied to her to protect her feelings which only made things worse.


Now after a very hard 90 days and a lot of self reflection I realized that there was a lot I should have done in the relationship. I should have been honest and respected her trust, and kept the promises I made to her. I know that our problems are fixable so I want to try again.


Tonight:

When I asked her what she thought she told me bluntly that she really doesn't know how to feel, but that since she has been single she has learned to love herself and is the happiest she has been in years. She said she will think it over and get back to me.


She says that I wasn't weighing her down and I'm happy that she learned to deal with her insecurity, but I'm scared that she doesn't want to be with me anymore. She also said that she is worried that if we get back together her insecurity might creep up again.


I miss her so much and I want to try again, but I'm so scared that she doesn't feel the same about me.",15Nov2018,1
23,"I have a 20-year-old cat. Back when we first got her we didn’t fully understand what declawing does to a cat so we had her front claws removed. We have since learned a lot more and stopped the practice. I feel really bad about it. Anyway, she’s wobbly. It’s really important to know this. 

For the past several days I’ve come face-to-face with how inept at I am at knitting. I’m truly a beginner. I’ve had to rip out and restart four different projects, all of which were rated easy or “piece of cake” by Ravelry. It’s really bad. I know how to knot and purl. Otherwise it’s a total disaster. But I really want to push through with this hobby so I’m not giving up. 

My previous attempt at a scarf was just garter stitch but had so many stitches on a single row that I grew exhausted with just that row. My tension was insanely tight to the point that it’s hard to knit into the stitches. I eventually gave up on it and started another garter stitch scarf after several of the earlier mentioned rejected patterns. I have thrown my needles and thread across the room. I have been yelling and ripping out pattern after pattern.

Finally, I just started following a super easy ‘knit with me’ video on YouTube. The scarf had the perfect number of stitches, I wasn’t getting tired. My tension was on point with the needle-bending tightness gone but not so lose that it was ridiculous. I’ve been working on this scarf for the past two days. I got so excited and happy every time I looked at it. It may have been simple but it represented progress. 

So I was knitting more of it tonight. I had my legs out on a stool. My 20-year old cat decided to come visit me by using my legs as a bridge. Except she wobbles so she fell and didn’t have front claws to steady her. Instead of gracefully jumping to the floor she grabbed my leg and her back claws dug in to my shin at a weird angle. Sharp pain ran through my leg. I grabbed her and moved her to my side really fast and then looked down at my knitting. I had dropped at least two stitches. But my lack of knowledge means that I just made it worse the more I tried to fix it. Eventually I ripped apart the whole thing in a blind rage. And then I broke into a sobbing fit. 

I guess I have even more to learn. I’ll restart tomorrow. 

TL;DR: My knitting aspirations are destroyed in a blind rage after my cat accidentally slips and uses my leg as a scratch post. I’m really sad. ",15Nov2018,1
24,"My “mom” abused me growing up as soon as my dad left the family. This lead six of my seven siblings having negative feelings towards me as well. I was my fathers favorite child and he never tried hiding that. He got into drugs and ended up leaving when I was 5 years old. We ended up moving every few months, living in temporary housing and I ended up switching schools 19 times. I gave up on trying to make friends because of this have felt incredibly alone my entire life. I have never had a real friend and my family strongly disliked me.

My “mom” ignored me my entire life and let my siblings gang up on me, sometimes even joining in. In most houses I had to share rooms with two other brothers, and I was always the one sleeping on the floor while my brothers had the beds. My “mom” was never physically abusive towards me, but she allowed my brothers to be. In order to get my license, I had to walk to two full time jobs, taking up my entire summer to pay for my car, drivers ed, and to pay coworkers to get my hours done in order to take the road test. My “mom” drove all of my other siblings to work, taught them to drive,  and even put them on her insurance plan and co-signed for their cars. She also got social security after my dad eventually died and I never saw a penny. As soon as I got a job, I had to pay for everything from food to clothing. Again, she still paid for my siblings necessities when they started working. She also kept me locked away on my room on a night that the only brother I liked visited. He was in the army stationed in another state so I rarely got to seem him. He ended up dying a few months after and I never got to see him again. 

I ended up get emancipated as soon as I turned 17, moved 2,500 miles away, deleted all of my social media accounts, and changed my phone number. I made sure nobody I knew before could ever contact me so I could start a new life. A few weeks ago (about a year and a half after I left) I got a text from my “mom” and I have literally no idea how she found my number. She was apologizing, asking me to forgive her, and saying she’s changed. I know she has some serious mental problems but I’m not sure if that’s a good excuse to ignore everything she’s done to me. She’s getting older and has been really unhealthy all her life so I would be shocked if she lived for another 10 years. If I’m being honest, part of me just wants her to die already, but another part of me is afraid I’ll regret never saying anything to her. She probably doesn’t even know she had the right phone number. 

I just felt like it would be good to actually write this out and say something. I don’t expect anyone to actually read this but if anyone does, feel free to let me know what you think.",15Nov2018,1

Please take this as a warning of what NOT to do.

I am a complete idiot and let my husband handle 100% of our finances. He was the breadwinner in the family, ran his own business, he handled the income, the bills, the taxes, the mortgage, anything that had to do with money, he was in charge. At the time, I was stupid and trusting and I hated dealing with all that anyways so I happily let him take on responsibility for that aspect of our lives while I dealt with the house and the kids and the day to day scheduling. Everything worked out great and ran smoothly, at least that's what I thought.

A few months ago, my husband was killed in a car crash. I don't want to get into nitty gritty details, but the condensed version is that after his death I discovered that we were not only broke, but in debt for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Secret credit cards opened in my 3 children's names and in mine, a second mortgage on the house, multiple loans taken out in his business name, payday loans, every bill we had was 2-3 months overdue, you name it, I found it. I also found evidence of infidelity and gambling. Every account we had was virtually empty. The police have since told me they think his death was a suicide. He didnt even try to brake or swerve. He ruined our lives and then bailed on us, and I allowed him to do this by willingly giving up control to him.

 I have a lawyer and we are working on sorting things out but he said it will take years to get out from under it all and our credit at the moment and for the foreseeable future is trashed and probable bankruptcy is on horizon. We are losing the house and luckily my sister is going to let us stay with her while I attempt to pull our lives back together. 


Dont ever let someone else control your finances, no matter what.

TL;DR: I gave my husband full control of our finances and he plunged us into hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of debt, then killed himself, leaving me to pick up the pieces.",15Nov2018,1

30,"I used to do some of that weird shit that guy's son did when I was younger too.  I would take my mom's underwear out of the hamper and piss in it(that was around the time I discovered my omorashi fetish)when I was in junior high, though I grew out of that phase after only a few months(never did that with my sister's stuff, though i'll admit I couldn't help checking her out whenever she wore shorts, she never noticed though and I stopped doing that as I got older, I also did that with my cousin who was older then me).  I also liked looking at cartoon porn, and frankly I don't see the issues with that, even if it has kid characters in it, I say better for someone to be getting off to cartoon kids then photos or videos of actual kids.  So I feel zero guilt for jerking off to erotic art of say Loud House(and all the people who say that doing that makes you a ""pedo"" can eat my ass).  

I'm grateful I didn't turn out like that kid, it helps that at the time I was in high school social media wasn't really much of a thing yet(I graduated in 08, just before social media really hit it big).  I had some girls I was friends with, but I never came onto them inappropriately or anything like that(mainly cause I went to a school for special needs kid, who knows, maybe it would've helped that kid if he had gone to a school like mine)

Also i'll be honest, I did start to lose sympathy for the dad when he started spouting that asinine ""both sides are just as bad cuz antifa"" bullshit and I definitely groaned when he said there were ""no good choices"" for the 2016 election(seriously i'm baffled as to why people treat Hilary like she's satan, she's far from perfect but she would've absolutely have been a better choice) so i'm beginning to wonder if he was really this perfect angelic father he made himself out to be, maybe he contributed more to his son's downfall then he'd really like to admit.

My own father certainly wasn't one to admit being wrong about certain things, many times he'd insist he told me to do something, even though he'd never once mentioned it that day, but refused to admit that he could possibly be wrong and insisted it must've been me that didn't listen.

So I met this girl like five months ago in a language learning application. I saw we were from the same country so I said fuck it. Let's talk.

We had good chemistry in fact she was a bit flirty by telling me how smart I was and she liked men like me and would send me hearts and stuff. But I was very busy so stopped chatting and just followed each other on Instagram.

Time passed by and I wanted to talk to her again since I had time to talk . But she stopped replying. Even so, I realized she stopped following me on Instagram.

Also I told her why I was absent and a bit depressed. But she didn't reply.

Last time I just asked her to ask me if I was a tree. She asked me. But didn't continue further conversation. Now I send her memes. And occasionally texts. Like one or two every week. So she doesn't block me. 

I know she reads them and that kind of excites me. The fact that she ignores me drives me crazy. It's like a drug when I get the slightest fraction of her attention. And I need more I need to talk to her about books and shit. She's so smart and interesting now I just regret stop talking to her but I was really busy and a little sad..


Pd: I know I have issues. And even though I'm a creep. I don't tell her creepy stuff or anything. I honestly like her mind more than her beauty.

36,"I'm trying to write down and tie together experiences of years past. I don't really know what to do with them but the urge to share a tidbit rises every now and then. I'd be eager to hear anyone's thoughts. Here's a section I wrote tonight about a leg of a motorcycle trip in India.



Beyond Pang was a high plateau without man’s mark save for the road itself and the occasional cluster of abandoned and fallen structures. The road was paved, but hardly smooth and though we were able to gain some speed, we were weaving constantly to avoid dips in the pavement. The road gradually rose to Taglangla, the Second Highest Motorable Pass in the world at 17582 ft, higher than the cruising altitude of most regional jets. The sign marking the pass said it all “UNBELIEVABLE IS NOT IT?”

I’m lucky the road was paved, because a few thousand feet below Tanglangla my rear tire went flat. The rear of the bike was squirrely with the inner tube busted, there was no way to offload or rearrange my gear to lessen the problem. At the same time, I was choking on diesel fumes from Indian military convoys that were passing by both ways. The view was incredible, and somehow I felt wholly able to appreciate it despite the scenarios running through my head that might lead to a fresh tire or that might lead me stranded on my own in such a cold, high place.

Heading down the pass was much harder as long gentle curves turned into narrow switchbacks and hooks as I descended towards the northernmost point of the Indus River Valley. Two days prior, we were burning in a sun bleached desert, the high pass was overcast and cool, the valley below was suddenly lush by comparison. What’s more, it felt like we had left India behind and ridden straight into Tibet. “Welcome to the Land of the Stupas” a BRO (Border Roads Organization) sign said. The architecture was reminiscent of Nepal, but the mountains changed even more, we passed jagged, vertical, purple and maroon hued rock formations unlike anything I’ve seen before. 

I rode forty miles on that flat. All the way to a janky metal bridge over the Indus River and the wild-west/Indian/Tibet remix of a town that was Upshi. For a few hundred rupee my tire was fixed and we all were able to regoup, eat and refresh. The town itself was silent, seeming to be populated with more dogs than people.",15Nov2018,1

I would constantly move when I was young, leaving me with little to no friends which made me even more desperate for a companion.  Eventually moved in with moms new boyfriend and his son. 

His son, let’s call him Ledge, befriended me quickly and treated me like a good friend. Hungry for this sort of thing, I was willing to go along with whatever it took to keep it going.

Which is why I never told anyone that he raped me multiple times in private, when my parents were both in the house unaware.

I blocked it out since I was young, but a few years ago it all came rushing back. It destroyed my self esteem, my ability to be social, which especially hurt since public speaking was my passion, I sweat like crazy if I get nervous, and I feel constantly anxious throughout the day.

I turned to Xanax to cope with these feelings, and became addicted. Took more than 200 during a 9 month period.

Present day, my mom and dad know and support me with therapy, they don’t speak to my step brother anymore. But he still was able to leech off my grandparents for a house right next door. Sometimes he visits my house to see my grandparents for money or food. I no longer do Xanax, I only smoke weed.

Having to see him on a daily basis killed me before, but now I’m able to persevere. I’m still terrified at times but it isn’t my fault, and I can acknowledge that now. 

It’s not a huge step to some people, but for me it’s everything. I hope I can continue to grow as a person and eventually overcome my fears in hope for a better future. ",15Nov2018,1

- Scrotum itches are not scratched, it's a pinch and roll maneuver.
- Gonads kinda do their own thing in the scrotum, especially when you're in an awkward position. They can kinda ""bloop"" up and you have to reposition them manually.
- The penis has an annoying tendency to slip out of the weewee hole in your underwear, which is really uncomfortable. You can't really put your hand down your pants in public, so you put your hand in your pocket, reach your fingers under the underwear leg, then pull forward while scooting your butt back. This puts the turtle back in his shell.
- Unexpected boners are flipped *up* into the waistband of your pants (using the pocket method mentioned before), making for a smooth and flat contour. If you pulled my shirt up at this moment you'd see my little buddy poking his head up. When this happens it's also necessary to arch your body back a bit to keep the boner firmly in the waistband.

They were sort of unlucky in the respect that their fellow Czech friends succeeded earlier than them and made it out to the suburbs in NJ, while they made do in Staten Island. Although incidentally, they moved there because SI was still very rural in the 1980’s. Our townhouse unit had a picturesque green scenery that was unfortunately ruined with more townhouse eyesores that were built there shortly after my parents moved in.

I grew up in what Lion would call a “high prole” environment, where parents worked as teachers, cops, firemen and had the working class ethic accompanying it. I was seen as the “nerd” of the neighborhood since I was very good in math and was at the top 1% of my class. Despite this, my parents didn’t focus on putting me to special schools as they wished for me to focus on practical applications (get a schooling good enough for a good job, think of basically getting a good enough schooling for Rutgers). While I was bullied, I was still friends with people in my neighborhood. It was not uncommon for me to be invited by my “gang” for baseball, basketball, swim pool meets, etc. While I wasn’t high social status, I was still seen as part of the “gang”.

Obviously, this group was more salt-of-the-earth and concentrated on popular culture, going-ons with the Yankees, etc. While it was easily accessible for us to take the subway to the SI ferry and go to Manhattan, our group only went for a few times and that was mainly to see the Yankees. Otherwise, our group never really went for cultural outings and the like. It was more movies, pool parties, neighborhood parties, etc.

I did get an inkling early on how upper middle class life was as my parents regularly visited their successful friends in NJ. I got along pretty ok with their sons on these playdates, but I could tell the environment was not as salt-of-the-earth as I was used to in SI. The living seemed more atomized and didn’t have the community vibe as I was used to in SI. I also could see the environment was more competitive in terms of academics, sports, etc. From my perception, people seemed to focus more on their track teams, academics, etc. than on a relaxed living I was used to.

One big thing that stood out were the suburban girls. My parents had two Czech friends who both had daughters. The talk of hypergamy about girls and such? I saw that very early on. There was a bitchiness, stuck-up quality to them that shocked me very much. True, there were bitchy girls in SI, but they seemed pretty rare. Girls in SI could be mean, but it was more of a salt-of-the-earth variety, not the entitled way I saw the NJ girls carry themselves.

What was even more shocking were the Czech girls my parents took in. My parents regularly hosted friends who came to visit from the Czech Republic when they wanted to travel in the US. Some of these had daughters. They were a real pleasure to interact with! They treated me very nicely and like an actual human being. There seemed a quality to them that they were natural while the suburban girls were very artificial. It mitigated the feeling that there was something wrong with me for the girls in the suburbs to act so stuck up.

Eventually my parents succeeded in their businesses and saved up money for a house in NJ. We actually rushed to move out as my townhouse neighborhood was starting to fill up with “low-proles” and NAMs. My parents were careful to select a neighborhood in NJ where the high school was one of the top 10 in all of NJ.

The move and high school years were some of the worst years of my life. I had been the top person in my school, but now I was in a high school with Indians, Chinese, and upper middle class whites. My grades suffered when I realized I was no longer the top student and I had to work hard to bring them up again. The new environment was very demotivating as everything was so atomized. The only way to make friends in such a suburban environment was with playdates, something my parents were not used to. I only managed to make friends from the tennis team I was part of and the quiz bowl team. I had thought of myself as a nerd, but the nerds outcasted me with their snark. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I had brought my working class mentality which didn’t rub well with the upper middle class one. Everyone took poorly to the salt-of-the-earth humor I had.

I also noticed early on that people had all these “fake” personalities and were passive-aggressive. In NYC, we could mess with each other talking with PC humor, but in my new environment, it rubbed off poorly on people. The implication was that you were an uneducated boor with such talk. I didn’t realize how insular suburbs were because of such things as helicopter parenting, groupthink, cognitive bias, etc. I frankly didn’t know the extent of such insularity until I saw the SJW phenomenon starting in 2013 and realizing they were a product of it.

My time was miserable in the suburbs, but because of my high intelligence (my IQ is 152), I managed to get good grades and go to a prestigious STEM school. I was still miserable as I was still surrounded by upper middle class types. My friends were usually foreigners, intellectuals, or the odd working class person who like me was lucky to go to the school.

All of these experiences left me with a sour taste and confusion. It wasn’t until the rise of the red-pill and blogs like these that I could make sense out of this new class system, a system that Charles Murray wrote about years earlier and to which I’m kicking myself for not reading him soon enough. I now have been able to fit in with upper middle class/hipster types since I know how to fake the socializing, but to me it still doesn’t feel authentic. I still have 1-2 working class friends who I’m grateful for as I can drop my PC exterior and feel authentic around.

73,"After I \[28F\] get off work I have a couple of glasses of wine while cooking dinner, maybe get a little tuned up once or twice a week while bowling or singing karaoke. Hunting camp is always a blast, heavily filled with Jaeger. But ever since I stopped drinking, I'm more sluggish, tire easily... I gained 5 pounds. I crave sweets and I never usually eat sweets. I usually have a great diet and eat small meals but now I'm all about stuffing my face. And omg the candy and ice cream. Halloween leftovers are almost gone (we had one trick or treater, so plenty of leftovers). I saw my friend who quit drinking a while back and he gained so much weight! My mom said that's because when you quit drinking you start to crave the sugar and sweetness. That's happening to me. I'm going on a cruise in 2 weeks and need my beach bod back! I did so good getting to my perfect size before our wedding 4 months ago, and I feel like I lost all that work, just from not drinking... it doesn't make any sense. I thought when you stop drinking you're supposed to feel great! The best you've ever felt! But sadly, I feel like I have a cold, I have no energy, our sex life has dwindled.... 

Anyways, I'm gonna have some wine tonight instead of eating half a carton of ice cream. Then I'll hike my ass up a mountain elk hunting this weekend. Hopefully I'll get my bod back before the cruise (and an elk, the season's almost over!).",15Nov2018,1

My family, my roomates, some old friends, my ex who I've been reconciling with, and my teammates have all wished me a happy birthday and I am beyond grateful. I've been coming out of a semester's depression where I felt absolutely worthless and alone, and just a simple act of wishing me a happy birthday has helped me realize that there are people in my life who care about me. Like what the fuck? I’m going to cry! So many people remembered my birthday, people care about me! I’m just so grateful. Hope you all have a great day.",15Nov2018,1
76,"I am a racist. I was taught my whole life to look down on people who were not white. Examples are me being told I would be given to a black family if I didn’t behave, beig told the Confederate flag was the “best” flag and “our” flag, being taught to lock the car doors when we were in N-word town, and being told I can’t watch N-word TV shows (except for Sanford &amp; Son.)

It worked too. I can distinctly remember telling a girl I didn’t like her, and the reason was her skin color, and I once didn’t buy a toy because I found out the hero underneath was darker than me. (Which is funny because my best friend was African American and my best friend after him was an immigrant from Mexico.) 

This thought process persisted for a long time. I carried this ignorance until really when the “hands up, don’t shoot” movement started. I saw guys my age being killed because of their skin and I realized the racism in my heart. Around this time too I became an avid advocate of the removal of Confederate Flags and monuments. 

Now I fight these feelings every day. It’s a sincere struggle I have to not look down on other people. When I’m driving I almost always assume all bad drivers are black, and I find myself more afraid to be in areas where the majority of the population isn’t white, although I confront these thoughts and I always do what I know is white. 

Recently I was joking around with some black friends and I mistakenly called one my friends the N-word. I instantly apologized and I actually cried in private because of how bad I felt. They all laughed though, and I laughed about it later too. I really should’ve been told to shut up, but I learned that it was a way to get a cheap laugh. So I did it again later. And I regret it. And I think I hurt one of my friend’s feelings and I feel like a piece of shit. 

I’m legitimately feeling bad for what I said, because I want to have respect for other people. I haven’t knowingly judged anyone in a long time, but the tendencies I was taught are still there and I’m going to rid them from myself. It’s a process but I have to do it. ",15Nov2018,1
77,"During my time in school getting my bachelor's in marketing, I did not get an internship or a summer vacation since I took classes in every semester available to graduate on time. So after I took the advice of other college grads who jumped right into the workforce to go traveling for awhile out of school, every interview I had with a decent job turned me down due to either lack of experience, internship, or the fact that I chose to take time off for once.   


So I took a local job in the meantime running escape rooms at 10$/hour until I could get a better job. Sounded like a decent plan at the time, except that I ended up injuring myself getting carpal tunnel syndrome in both arms from a combined load of working overtime to run their escape rooms using their computers, using my computer at home, and playing guitar. So naturally I had to quit that job due to my nerves breaking down and reduce my guitar playing by about 98% of what it used to be.   


A year later, and even after continually exercising and applying for marketing jobs to this day I feel like I have gone no where at all. I moved to a new town with my parents, have learned coding a bit in C# as well as some game design skills, and have been delivering food with Uber. But now my car is becoming more expensive to drive than I can earn money with Uber, as I have to pay for gas, oil, and a new part every month to replace. My savings are dwindling. I have not found a surgeon that will work on my arms, and stretching with physical therapy will only do so much. I know I cannot tell any prospective employer that I have this condition, as it would not help me being hired. I can't tell them that I grew up with ADHD either. 

At this point I don't really know what to do except to continue the grind, but there has to be **something** that I can change to make a difference. I'm not having much joy in doing things anymore, almost to the point where sunsets don't seem as nice as they used to. Most people that have given me advice to this current situation so far have told me sub-par axioms such as ""It won't last forever."" ""Your situation is not unique."" ""Life's tough. "" ""The job market sucks."" ""Go back to school and get a Masters"" (which to me just means *get* *in debt* *and spend money you don't have)* The more helpful people have helped me get interviews and shown me more job websites. Regardless, I'm still grateful for both types' of efforts. I don't expect anyone to have all the answers.  


So I guess what I'm saying is, maybe *don't* take time off after school? ",15Nov2018,1
78,"I used to be the quiet kid in high school, I used to avoid interactions with other kids and spend most of my time on my phone and playing video games back at home because I had no idea how to approach others and, as a result, I had no friends.

Naturally, this attitude towards life lead to a lot of bullying and abuse towards me from the other kids. They’d beat me, slam me against lockers and generally act like assholes. 

I always felt sad and always isolated because I thought that I will never get along with anyone and the only people that acknowledge my existence were bullies.

However, one day, these two brothers, who I’m gonna call them by their last name that is ‘Hosayn.’ The two Hosayn brothers had apparently recently transferred to my school recently and they generally kept to themselves the short while that they’ve been at my school. One day, for reasons I still don’t know today, I approached them and actually greeted them. They acted shy at first, just like I did I guess, but they eventually opened up and we actually started having a conversation. It was a short conversation where we just introduced ourselves, talking about hobbies and such. They told me that they were into video games too and I asked if maybe they’d like to come play some at my home sometime. They both nodded and we went our separate ways after the conversation.

The Hosayn brothers would later become my friends, maybe even the first friends I ever made since I was in elementary school. They’d come over to my house on weekends to play video games and hang out. This went on for months and I’ve seriously never felt better before in my life since I finally had real friends.

However, one day, this all came crashing down.

The group of bullies who always bullied me approached me in the school corridor. I was expecting them to start cursing me as they always do, but they stopped feet away from me this time. I looked at the group of bullies and I was shocked to see the Hosayn brothers with them, standing with a look as concerned as mine behind the bullies. The guy who I consider the leader of the group looks back at brothers and tells them “Hey, this is the guy that we usually fuck with. Do your thing.” The brothers step ahead of the other bullies and look like they’re about to beat me up. One of the brothers grabs as his the other one is continuously punching me in the stomach. This goes on until the group of bullies tell them to stop. The brothers let go of me and walk away with the group of bullies, the one who grabbed me looks back with a guilty look in his eyes while his brother never even turns his head.

The school day ends and I walk back to my home with bruises. I felt hurt, more mentally than physically. How could those two do me like that? I thought I had real friends but it always ends like this. Guess I should’ve known that

83,"This is an important piece of advice my family keeps shoving down my throat. In the past I have barely listened. I was recently in a car accident and left wheel chair bound. I am now forced to follow this piece of advice. A wave of relief has washed over me since being forced to slow down. I can’t go car shopping, I can’t go to school, I can’t join the military, nothing. All of those things I can’t even think about doing for another year. It’s very disheartening because I am the type of person to knock things out and I get antsy super quickly if I can’t check things off my checklist.

Everything will work out in the end. I’m terrified that I won’t be able to do anything for a year but I have learned to accept that I will resume life next year and everything will work out soon enough.

84,"I feel like a complete psycho. I have never been one to care about what my neighbors get up to; we live in a fairly quiet neighborhood and all of our houses are spread out so we usually just nod and pass on with our day. 

But this house is all I have been able to think about for 3 weeks. 

My suspicions first arose when my husband and I were chasing down a stray dog that had been injured; the dog ran through our backyard and looked like he had a broken leg. My husband took off after him into the neighbor's yard. (There are no fences in our neighborhood so all the houses are open and connected.) Once my husband caught the dog it was exhausted and clearly badly injured, so I suggested we cut back through a couple yards since we ended up a few blocks down the road.  So we come up to this house, it's actually right behind our house (their backyard and garage is facing us) and start passing through the side of their property and that's when I notice how out of place this house looks. There's a metal gate on their front door step and every window has ""THIS HOUSE IS UNDER SURVEILLANCE"" ""NO TRESPASSING"" and ""BEWARE OF DOG"".

Listen if it was just one sign, I wouldn't bat an eye but this is every single window COVERED in these signs. Also instead of curtains or blinds they clearly have sheets and towels pinned up on their windows. Now at this point I hurry my husband along and really start thinking about this house and the people I've seen in it. They never keep up with their yard work, maybe once a month they will cut their grass so that their dogs have space. Their dogs are both pitbulls, and while I have no issue with pits, I know they are usually guard dogs. These dogs are very quiet as well. They do not bark and when they are let outside they are quickly brought back inside. I have maybe seen them three times in 5 years. The same applies to the people that live there. I never EVER see them. Maybe a handful of times since I've lived there. Two of those times they were burning a rubbish fire in their driveway. 

Now of all this could be dismissed. I can get over having weird paranoid neighbors. But there's one thing that really, really, fucks my shit up.
Their garage door is always fucking open.

I know it doesn't sound that weird but I'm talking about *all the time*. I work odd hours so most nights I get home around 1-2 am. Garage door is open, lights on. 

I wake up about 9:30 and have a cup of coffee. Garage door is open, lights on.

Leave for work about 4 PM. Garage door is open, lights on. 

Okay you get the point, but they have STUFF in their garage, it's not like its empty. The only time I've seen it closed is when tornados came through a few weeks ago. My only guess is that they are airing out their house. But all the time? It's currently in the 30°s  here. NONE OF THIS MAKES SENSE. 

Like I said before, I don't care what my neighbors do, I've lived next to odd people before, my last downstairs neighbor was a drug dealer. I know the vibe. This is just out of place in this neighborhood. Its quiet, and extremely safe. Most of my neighbors are 60+ so usually we're the ones out of place. All of this weird stuff just keeps adding up, my only guess is that they must either be making meth or maybe have a grow house? Either way it would need to be aired out for heat/smell. And that would explain the security and weird behavior. I'm not just pulling this out of nowhere, our city has a HUGE meth issue and recently there have been busts in quiet, nice, neighborhoods like ours. 

I don't know what to do, really. Just don't want my house to get blown up in a meth lab explosion. Should I report it? Am I being *that* super paranoid neighbor? I am at a loss.

More then anything else, I’ve been told my entire life that I choked/should be a stand up comedian.

90,"I am a twenty-eight-year-old woman. I’m married and a mother of two daughters. My husband is a very normal, regular guy. Hard-working. A great provider. He has no idea whatsoever about my past. He does not know why I hardly ever see my family anymore. He thinks it bothers me and wants to “do his best to help me fix it”. See if he can “patch things up”. Little does he know, I have zero interest in being okay with them again. There is a reason I fled that environment. 

My father and mother were eccentrics from day one. My father was forty-two years old when he met my mother and married her the same year. She was just a twenty-one-year-old at the time, and a former student of his in college. Over the course of the next ten years, they had five children in pretty quick succession. I was number two. When I was born my father was 45 and my mother 24. He was a very fierce environmentalist, he was an early supporter of animal rights and he was very… intense. Ever since I was little, I remember how he would often break down into passionate speeches on the fly about how mankind was destroying earth and how we needed to mindful of our waste, etcetera. The irony of him being a father of seven (he had two grown daughters from his first marriage by the time I was born) never dawned on me. He was an intense man. Bright blue eyes. Steely. Salt and pepper hair and beard. Back straight as an arrow and skin perpetually suntanned. 

Meanwhile, my mother was meekness personified. She looked a bit like that girl from the Manson Family, Creepy Fromme. Like red-haired, freckled, tiny petite body. The two of them were nudists. And from an early age they dragged us all along on their trips. I grew up on nude beaches. Body painting other kids. Running around rivers butt-naked as the day the Lord my father didn’t believe in made me. It was a lovely time, believe it or not. We didn’t get damaged by any of it. Not at first anyway. It wasn’t until I reached my teen years that the weirdness began. I hit puberty at some point, as most of us tend to do. And I was hit… pretty hard, to say the least. Pretty early, too. Let’s just say I didn’t exactly inherit my mother’s petite frame. More like my father’s dark and swarthy, well-built half-Greek self. I was very womanly… very early. And, to my great shame, very hairy too. Naturally I didn’t like to be around naked people all the time at this point.

Finally, I built up the courage to go to my parents and tell them I was uncomfortable going to nude resorts and vacations any longer. That I wanted to wear clothes around our house more, too. 

“Are you telling me… you don’t find it empowering to be naked?” asked my father. His tone of voice was full of disappointment. He shot a sideways look at my equally disturbed looking mother.

“Darling, they got to her…” he let out, after a dramatic pause, “modernity got to her! Society has put shame in her heart where before, there was none!”

I tried to protest. I really did. But he was off on a rant. 

“No child of mine will walk around clothed inside my house! We are a clothes-free family! It’s bad enough that they make you wear clothes at that goddamn school we have to send you to… but damn it in this house, I will NOT tolerate clothing!”

I knew I was powerless to stop him. Resist him. Father was just too powerful. His will was as steely as the hard eyes with which he looked at the world around him. 

So naked ol’ me it was… I was fourteen by now and it kept getting more and more awkward for me. Especially as around the house, I noticed my father and my older brother getting… visible excited sometimes during the most random of times. And much like my father’s power of persuasion and his body, all of his parts were… equally well made. It was honestly terrifying. When I was fifteen and my brother seventeen, my brother started getting increasingly touchy feely with me. So did my father, but he always without exception left the room when things threatened to get heated. My brother, evidently, did not. He would wrestle me down the floor the way we would in elementary school. Which is fine when you are five or six. Or maybe even when you are ten. But being a teenager, especially one who has nudism forced down her throat… well, let’s just say it gets awkward real fast. My brother was like a miniature version of my father. And the sensation of having certain not-so-miniature parts hanging out and touching my naked skin was confusing. Having him get hard before my very eyes was even worse.

My brother tried to make a move on me. He groped me. So I pushed him off. This is where playtime ended and I sensed it had become something scarily real. I resisted. I made a big scene. Ran to my parents and told them what happened. I had expected to be met with furious anger over my brother’s misbehavior. Instead I was yelled at… my father paced rapidly across the room, dick swinging, brow sweating and wildly gesturing with his fat hairy fingers as he ranted on about how “he tried so hard to be a sex positive family free of the constraints of society” and how I was “such an uptight, clearly brainwashed little girl who didn’t get it”. Something inside me broke. I knew I needed to get the fuck out of here. But where could fifteen-year-old me go? My brother kept staring at me. Almost glaring. Like a mad dog who had his toy taken from him by his cruel owner but was hellbent on retrieving it the nearest chance he got. 

That summer, I learned to sleep with one eye open. And, also that summer, I walked in on my brother and my younger sister having sex. She was twelve, mind you. He was sixteen. My youngest two siblings, just kids at the time, were standing behind them. Looking on. My parents were right there, looking on. Visibly excited as they held hands, smiles of contentment mixed with arousal on their zany faces. I screamed. Ran the fuck out of there. None of them said a word, or ran after me. They just looked on as if in a trance. I ran and ran and kept running. Didn’t take anything from the house with me. Well, besides the clothes rebellious little me dared to wear that day. I ran for dear life. Pinching myself when I finally slowed down to catch my breath. I was freaking out. And even when I pinched my forearm black and blue, I never woke up. I went to the house of a maternal aunt. When she was about to send me out, I had to tell her everything. I just broke down right there and then. And a flood of words came out of me. 

After I told her, she just stood up and hugged me. She made me promise to never tell a soul, and in return for my silence (for the good of the family) she would take care of me from there on out until I was a legal adult. I took her up on her offer. Blended into her family of four kids around my age. I never did tell anyone. Not my cousins. Not my uncle. Not even my husband. And I never will. Because if I do, I will have to face the uncomfortable questions I am not ready to face. Like: why did I not save the others? Why did I not tell on them, report them to authorities, have my siblings taken away from there? Instead I just… disappeared. I don’t know what my aunt told her husband. Or what the two of them later told my parents. But I know they went to my parents house the day after I ran away. And I know they came home teary-eyed, heads bent.

94,"With a population of ~329,000,000 in the United States and all its overseas territories, 0.6% of the population would put the number of transgender people in America at about 1.4 million. This would mean that the population of US transgender people is larger than the individual populations of the smallest 10 states.

0.6% means slightly over 1 in 200. Depending on the model, New York subway cars are usually rated to fit a maximum of between 180 and 200 people (usually about a quarter seated with the rest standing) and during the average NYC rush hour, they often hit or slightly exceed that. If you have ever ridden a New York subway during rush hour, odds are fairly reasonable you've ridden with a transgender person in the same car as you.

Conservatives keep saying that it's ridiculous to expect society to reorder itself to accommodate the needs of such a small amount of population, but they also say that we shouldn't abolish the electoral college because it gives tiny states like Wyoming a voice in national politics. Well, there's three times as many trans people as there are citizens of Wyoming, so all I'm saying is that they should probably give trans folks at least two senators.",15Nov2018,1

97,"Magical and religious thinking still permeate our society. Even in ""enlightened"" atheist institutions.

We should question even, no, *especially*, the most fundamental premises of our value system. What we consider good and evil: Are they based in something other than perpetuating the self interest of the claimants?

What if most of what we consider ""common sense"" is ""nonsense?"" Engineered to contradict itself so that the rhetoric can be manipulated like clay... And maybe our intellectual and moral ideals are geared to destroy us for the glory and advancement of a system we don't even *want*.

Civilization is like an aggregate organism. The constituents begin to lose individiality until they can no longer function without the colony. Humans are not joined physically, we are joined psychologically and behaviorally. You can choose to think for yourself, or you can submit to ""common sense"" and quite possibly lose the capacity for see truth that doesn't first pass through the lens of history. You may have to accept that your actions must coordinate with a group, which must consider other groups, which form an alliance, etc. there's just not much to be gained from buying into the ""popular"" view of social politics  which have evolved much more quickly than our slow, biological refinements, aside from a false sense of self rightiousness from ""doing the right thing,"" which is usually only ""the right thing"" in the context of what pop morality is telling you *was* ""the right thing"" back before we *wised up* and realized that the *right* thing was actually the *wrong* thing... See? Perfectly logical: this used to be good, so that means now its bad... OK?

Take it one step further: what we used to think was weak, is now strong! And there's nothing more shameful than relying on strength, like some kind of weakling!

Every generation the rhetoric changes... it has to. Because every generation assumes the previous one is scamming them, and that the following one are soft and gullible, when the truth is they're *all* being scammed by popular media, religion, feminism and ""wokeness"" to believe that they're all trying to get over on each other *in order to prevent them from autonomous function.*

How will you accomplish anything if you have to ""stop the gays,"" or ""silence the racists,"" or ""end sexism"" or ""get rid of the niggers"" none of which are reasonable or even possible goals... That's right. Most ideologies are treadmills to keep you turning a wheel, but you have no idea *what the wheel is actually attached to.* In fact the stated goal doesn't need to have anything to do with the action the ""movement"" actually produces.

All these ""isms"" are based on false premises. Language has been slowly eroded until anything can literally mean anything if people misuse it enough. Thus, nearly everything we know is wrong! If you haven't tried to deconstruct any of your ""own"" assumptions, there's probably no hope for you... but don't worry. Nothing matters anyway, and if things get too bad you can just die and all your problems disappear!

In summation: society promotes bad ideas and we've been conditioned to pick one thats ""real"" over ones that are ""made up,"" but for a long time now they're all ""made up"" because people keep figuring out ways to redirect the perception of reality up its own ass.

Trust no one! Especially YOU!",15Nov2018,1
98,"A close friend of mines mother committed suicide a couple of weeks ago. Before hand, we haven't seen each other in 2 months. He's always had a thing for me but I've always seen him as a great friend and nothing more. What I am trying to make him understand is that being a great friend to me is way more deeper then any dynamic I could think of in my life.




Anyways, I was with him the whole night it happened. I watched his family grieve the lose of a mother, a girlfriend, a human. It was heavy, dark and bleak. The thought of a mother taking her own life while she still has 2 sons in their early 20s maturing and evolving, is disturbing. I never thought I see a day where I'd be mad at someone for taking their own life but I kind of am....




The thing is, during those 2 months, I was very suicidal. I even put a date for October 23, 2018 that I am allowed to take my own life if things haven't been better. But I had a wisdom teeth extraction the next day and didn't want to make a failed attempt. I wanted to make sure it was painless and immediate. I didn't have a means to a gun. What kills me inside, is that she took her own life by the gun. 




I've been doing the best I can to communicate with him. Let him know that I love him and I care about him. He has his other friends and he knows he is loved and cared for. But god has it been a completely different air. It's like a bittersweet emptiness is floating on his close friends. I feel like I am incapable of even imagining the sort of pain he is going through. It hurts so much to think about it. 




But how am I doing? Honestly, after this has happened, I feel even more yearning to end it. But I absolutely can not do that to anyone. My family, my realized friendships after this has happened, especially him. It would break everyone I knew. But I fucking want to leave. I want to end it. I have no motivation to do anything to improve my life. I just want to sit, and sulk and do drugs until I've taken too much and OD. I just want to leave. I just want this pointless and incredibly stupid reality I am stuck with to end. I don't want help..



There isn't going to be any closure for my friend. He is going to be left wondering and contemplating and there is going to be so many missing time slots that his mother was suppose to fill. He will always have something missing. He's going to have to learn to live with this absolute hole of darkness and that fucks me up. 




TL;DR -- best friends mother committed suicide and I want to commit suicide even more now but now I can't do that to anyone. I feel so bad that I still want to die. ",15Nov2018,1

100,"Soo.. where do I begin?

Though my dad has not beaten me, he has constantly threatened me, told me I am useless and used it as an opportunity to make me like a tool or even slave for him, tries to shame me and humiliate me whenever I disagree with him, takes other people's words out of context and used it to his advantage to make it look like people agree with him, also when I told my teachers that my father is abusive, my father was able to deceive the teachers, me and my mom into thinking he's changed. My father has also stolen my money, without reason or warning. I don't understand why he would hate me; I have never disrespected or insulted him, I never took his money, I get fairly decent grades (I've only gotten one F in my entire life) and I usually do my best.

Up until now, I thought that my father changed. Well, today, I've changed my mind. At around 9 PM, he barged into me and my mother's bedroom (I don't have my own bedroom, I sleep with my mother, this is because I apparently am not worthy of personal space due to me not being perfect at school), saying a bunch of insults, both directed at me and my mother, but mostly me of course. He practically admitted to not changing and to wanting to use me as a tool and not really as a goddamn child. Let's not mention the fact that I have an injured back, possibly breathing and eyesight problems that have never been resolved or even thought about despite the fact that I have told my parents about it, and they know. Anyways, after a few minutes, my dad found me and my mother crying and then things just kind of went downhill from there. He yelled at us aggressively, saying that we are rude to him, that he isn't making any mistakes, that we won't do good in the real world, and then announced he'd be leaving. My mother went crazy and tried to get him to stay, but my father just took the opportunity to act like an asshole. My father will likely be leaving this night.

113,"Hello my fellow Redditors, I am a part of my school's student government and recently an idea has been proposed and we need some tweaking to the rules, so I turn my attention to you guys and gals to see what everyone thinks about this.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea is to add a ""Big Brother"" system to the school (All boys, just FYI). The idea is to match up Juniors with Freshman and Seniors to Sophomores as a guidance sort of system. Our main goal is to mix and match students of other races, religion, and cultural backgrounds together to encourage diversity in the student body. We wish to make our school population (Around 350ish) more accepting of each other and promoting a family/brotherhood to strengthen our relationships all around, ranging from everyone who has graduated in the past to future students.

&amp;#x200B;

We consider that, just due to students leaving as they go through their school career that they may transfer, leaving more Freshmen/Sophomores to their upperclassmen counterparts. We have considered giving more than one underclassman to the older students as long as they fall under certain guidelines such as:

1. Having a 3.0 GPA or higher, we want to make sure everyone who would work more than one younger student into their schedule has showed responsibility with studies with one/none in the past to make sure they keep up their own grades before helping others.
2. Less than 10 disciplinary marks in the current semester, this one feels obvious, but we don't want an older student with bad behavior rubbing off onto a younger student and having said student replicating the behavior.
3. Personally willing, we wouldn't force this onto anyone who didn't feel comfortable.

We would also ask of students for feedback, both lower and upperclassman to see how the system works personally for them, and allowing for students to get, at the consent of both students, to transfer to other students. In case that didn't make sense, if a younger and older student are not able to collaborate well due to past experiences together, or whatever it may be, if they both request to change partners, it would be allowed.

&amp;#x200B;

We have also taken into account that many of students would not feel comfortable with a younger student when we assign them, so we would worked that into a point to be brought up next meeting, and we plan to take surveys from both the Junior and Senior class to see who would be comfortable taking a student in general, and if presented to them, more than one. Like stated earlier, we do not want to force this system onto anyone who doesn't feel comfortable taking part.

&amp;#x200B;

For the Juniors who get Freshmen, they would keep their student as they both move on to Senior and Sophomore year, respectively. As for Seniors who take on a Sophomore buddy, the Sophomore would take on a new Freshman assigned to him as he becomes a Junior and his Senior graduates and moves his own way in life.
