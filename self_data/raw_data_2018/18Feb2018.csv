3,"Hi everyone, sorry if this is rambling. On the surface, I have a great life. I'm the eldest of four children; my parents are mostly supportive, well-off and still in love after 20+ years. I'm at a great university getting good grades and I seem to be securing myself a good future. I'm in a loving relationship of almost 2 years. 

Still, on the inside, I feel incredibly unhappy. Whenever I'm alone, my mind turns to existential thoughts: what the fuck am I doing here? Why am I doing all this? Is there any point in going on?

Whenever I'm unhappy, I can't help but feel like a spoiled brat. I have everything; why can't I be happy? I think it's due to my lack of support but it's almost a vicious circle: I don't reach out to people because I feel like I'm too fucked up, and I'm fucked up because I don't have many people to talk to.

What should I do? What can I do? ",18Feb2018,1
6,"So I just moved into a new flat with two people on my course in university. I met their other flat mate a girl, we all agree to go to the club. I begin drinking vodka at 4pm, I’m fine up to 9pm where we arrive at our friends flat and have pre drinks. I begin drinking a lot more and say some stupid shit, I could tell I was annoying people. We leave at 12 to go to the club and this is the part where I blacked out. Apparently my friends decided I’m too drunk for the club and that they’re taking me back to the flat, I get angry and start getting aggressive with my course mate. The girl from my flat apparently tried calming me down and I apparently pushed her away and raised my hand like I was about to hit her(the worst thing I’ve ever done). They get me in a taxi and we go back, apparently I was saying super weird shit, acting really cringy and just being a total idiot.

I’ve spoken to my flat mates, they’re not laughing about it, more or less just agreeing that I was totally fucked and should never act like that again.

I’m now here, can’t sleep. Scared to face my new flat mates and course mates, I don’t think this is one I can just laugh off. I wouldn’t dare hit a woman, I can’t believe I did this.",18Feb2018,2
8,"Dad, who has an interest in curling and has been following it as a spectator for years and now especially during the winter Olympics, heard about some curling club offering free tours of their facilities. He raved about it being a great social outlet and mom seemed open to him visiting the place but warned him that it's best he stay on the sidelines and watch others curl (play), that he's better off staying off the ice because he has inner ear problems and balance issues. He swore he'd be careful and not let himself be talked into signing up for a membership. I told him the same thing - watch out, nothing in life is free, you know they'll try to sell you into signing up. So he goes to the club and guess what? An hour later I'm doing grocery shopping and get a call from his cell phone. He asks is mom at home? I tell him yes, in fact I was just speaking with her...why? Then he declares that he took a fall, was checked out by a doctor on site and is being brought home. I respond dad what happened? Are you ok, do you need me to come pick you up? (I was 10 minutes away from home but ready to leave the groceries and run out the store to go help him). Dad replied: no it's ok, I just want to talk to your mom (his wife). I hang up , go to cash and walk to their home. I get there and dad is telling mom what happened...it turns out that he did sign some registration and that the club members urged him to get on the ice and start sweeping the broom...all this with him wearing sneakers. Then apparently the gameplay sped up, he couldn't keep up and bam, he face planted and hit his forehead against the ice. Mind you he's 65+ and not very athletic.

The people on scene helped him up, a doctor tended to him, someone there drove him home (I would've gone to the hospital with him but he refused apparently) and now he has a bump on his head. My mom was no doubt upset when receiving his call about the fall...now I don't know if I'm more upset at the club for letting an older man with improper footwear onto the ice or with dad himself for putting himself in danger unnecessarily. Mom will monitor his health in the days ahead and I'll check in with him too...I don't know if I should notify my siblings of what happened or leave dad to recover himself (with mom at his side). So far he can still think and talk normally but I remain concerned.

11,"Hi guys - sorry for the new account...

Here’s the deal:

I am in my mid thirties and I work in accounting. I did not go to school for accounting - I didn’t finish a degree at all. I fell into this job and was promoted quickly, and then my company was bought by an enormous corporation, a.k.a. Monster Corp. My department, along with others, is the first round of layoffs. My job ends over the summer.

The thing is, I really do not like my job. I don't like accounting. I don’t like math. I dropped it after my sophomore year in high school, and algebra is the only college course that I ever dropped. I’m good at numbers math, and I’m really good at noticing trends and patterns, as well as finding and fixing errors and anomalies, which makes me good at my job. That is not to be mistaken for a natural aptitude for, nor an enjoyment of, being a glorified data entry specialist.

Even still, I would have stayed there until I retired because I liked the core company, I mostly like my co-workers, and I have decent pay and benefits. I would have been on a fast track for promotion and a decent career in finance, despite my lack of degree. With the acquisition, even if I weren’t losing my job, I would not be promoted to another position in Monster Corp without at least a bachelor's, and preferably a master's - even my favorite intern has a master's.

My peers seem interested in applying for open positions within Monster Corp. The only thing that I know for sure is that I will not be doing that. Even if I thought they would hire me (if I had to apply for it, I wouldn't get hired for my current position that I excel at because I don't hold a degree for it), I don’t like the company - it is a fantastic company for people that are not me, but it is a soul sucking nightmare for me. I hate sitting in a cubicle. I hate busy work, and I hate feeling like I have zero purpose other than to collect a mediocre paycheck to pay for a mediocre life until I die.

I could continue the trajectory, bank on experience, and find another uninspiring finance job in another mind dulling gray cubicle with stained carpet at another corporation of faceless suits, while dumping as much as I can into my 401K and hoping it doesn't continue to tank until I somehow owe them money upon my forced retirement. Or I can pivot hard.

I decided that maybe I'll go back to school. I can realistically probably finish my bachelor's in a consecutive year, more or less depending on credit transfers, and that's pretty low impact time-wise. I cannot stress enough how much I really really do not ever want to work in another cubicle farm office environment another day in my life - in the same way that I decided years ago that I would not wait another table, I don't ever want to do this kind of work again. 

I thought about compromising - using my financial experience and going back to school for marketing, which would give me a practical and strong skill set coming out. I know that I sound like a petulant child, but I'll be damned if I am going to put myself in huge amounts of debt to wind up in another office job doing some variation of the same thing that I already do, restarting at entry level. If that's what I plan on doing, the way that I see it, I might as well just save my money and buy a flipping Hyundai. In white. Maybe even splurge for leather and a sunroof. Fuck it, get two. Live on the edge. You know.

If I go back in time, the only thing I ever wanted to do (besides create) was to go to school all the way through until I obtained my PhD in psychology. I obviously did not do that. I also am not going to do that now - that's in the ""would've, should've, could've"" pile. I could potentially go for a master's, if I can line up enough grants and loans to get me through a full program, but something that I realized as a teenager that hasn't changed much through now, is that a bachelor's degree in psychology only really serves the purpose of learning a life lesson in the form of crippling debt. 

I have not failed to see the irony here, in that I am currently spinning out, yammering on about my desire to counsel other people through mental difficulties. Don't care; moving on.

With a master's, I still can't do much in my state outside of HR and school counseling, but there are states where I could obtain a license to practice clinically. It will cost a lot of money, I will have to work while doing it, my relationship will have to absorb some stress, and we collectively will have a mound of student loan debt for a very long time.

I feel like this could be a huge, life tanking mistake, but at the same time, I am so incredibly miserable playing it safe. I've been playing it safe for a while now, and I've gotta say, it's pretty shit. It's getting me nowhere, I'm bored all the time, my mind is dying, and mediocrity makes my skin crawl, in case I haven't already made that abundantly clear. 

I'm really pissed that I'm losing my job. But since I am, I 
want to be a little selfish and take the time to consider what I want to do along with what I should do. All that I have really decided is what I don't want, but in reality, that means nothing when your bills are due. 

My long-winded question to all of you is:

Is it worth it at this point (35, no kids, 2 dogs, long term SO) to completely change course, go back to school full time and restart a career in the opposite field that I am currently in? Or should I just be a good little adult, get some antidepressants and stfu about it?

13,"I’m feeling proud of my son right now. 

His daughter had a birthday coming up and I asked what she wanted. She said she really didn’t need anything, she just hoped I’d make her birthday cake and she wanted strawberry shortcake. (I make a cake for all the grandkids every year). 

Her parents asked her what she was hoping for and she said she really didn’t need anything and spending the day out doing her favorite things was plenty (trampoline park with cousins and aunts, science museum with just her and her mom, movies with Grandma and grandpa—she’s got a big family so alone time with parents is rare.) 

I got her some potted succulents for her room because I noticed they’re on her notebooks and her phone background. She was over the moon and gave me a handwritten thank you note the next time I saw her. Her parents got her a new bike, and she was so excited she was almost in tears. She genuinely wasn’t expecting it. 

I taught for years and I’d never be surprised to hear kids bemoaning their 20 person themed birthday party because they didn’t get enough presents or they didn’t like their present because it’s the wrong brand or color. My own kids could even be that way at times! 

I’m just so happy she’s going to go through life feeling blessed and content with what she has. She’s so much happier for it and finds a deeper level of joy than a kid who’s constantly expecting *things*. 

I love my family. I’m so relieved everyone’s happy and healthy. 

I am so so so proud that my son raised his kids to see the joy in life and have glasses half full. He worked so hard to be able to provide for his family, choose the right life partner, and bring his kids up the right way. He’s just knocking it out of the park. ",18Feb2018,1

16,"During Summer 2015 I did an internship at a time traveling dating service. I still get a lot of questions about how these work so I thought I'd write an introduction to the concept in the form of an FAQ I can link people when the message me.

## What do you *do*?

tl;dr: We sample time based on a set of observations we think will shift the distribution toward outcomes where you and a match meet and form a fruitful relationship.

Time is similar to a  [directed acyclic graph](http://www.allisons.org/ll/AlgDS/Graph/DAG/), except it is continuous instead of discrete, and probabilistic instead of static.

From each frame (i.e. point in time) there are an infinite number of paths forward, including futures from previously adjacent frames in time (what we colloquially call alternate universes). Each individual observation (e.g. the temperature of a point in space) has a distribution sampled in the next frame.

Normally all observations are sampled from each frame to determine the next, so we end up with very likely events and rarely do pockets of air do things like instantly change temperature by 100 Celsius. With time machines we can ""pre-sample"" only *some* observations before advancing frames, and the rest of the observations will be sampled with our observations as givens. The real calculus of time traveling dating services is coming up with the right set of observations to presample to set up a frame outcome distribution which when sampled, is likely to yield a frame that realizes your abstract desired outcome such as ""falling in love"".

## Can you help me redo my failed relationship?

tl;dr: Most services will advise you not do this because it won't work. Your relationship will end badly again. Many proprietors won't even do it because it leads to bad reviews.

One of the most interesting things the corpus of data we've gathered from time traveling dating services is the distribution of relationship outcomes between the same people over many timelines. What we know is that after having been in a relationship for 2 months, 91.04% of timelines yield the same relationship conclusion each year among classes [unamicable end, unamicably continues, amicable end, amicably continues], and 99.93% yield the same outcome each year among classes [ends, continues].

 On the bright side, if you do find a proprietor to do it for you the lesson is relatively cheap because calculating the observation sample set for branches of the past has been trivial since the 70s. Some people go back just for the sex.

Also note you are unfortunately not eligible for past travel in any jurisdiction if you have ever been convicted of a felony.

## Can you help me meet x person?

tl;dr: It's just too complicated.

Only a few high level goals (such as traveling to the past) have known algorithms to generate sample sets. Most of our sample set tools are actually based on your brain--we sample into universes where you are more outgoing, more attracted to other people, and happier. No one knows how to set you up with your celebrity crush or introduce you to your high school sweetheart again.

## Won't there be two of me in the other universe?

tl;dr: This is 40s sci-fi bullshit.

When you time travel only *you* time travel. You will have your old body back. This means:

1. You cannot travel to another body.
2. You cannot travel to before you were born obviously, and it is illegal to travel people under 25, or back more than five years (anything older than 5 years ago is permanent) (unless you have enough money that laws don't apply to you).
3. You cannot travel into the future.
4. Dead people can't be traveled.

These rules are an extension of the little-known fact that the observable universe is actually not inanimate but a medium of agreement between a network of transient deterministic sentiences.

## How do you make money?

tl;dr: Large projects for the rich af.

My intern project was to build an observation set for a wealthy af lady that would be likely to get her son into an Ivy League School. It took me and two more experienced engineers three months and a cost a fortune in simulation runs, but we mark up large custom projects by 50% to subsidize the standard mental health sampling services for regular customers and past travel for those who lost loved ones or became paralyzed/seriously injured.

## How hard is it to craft an observation set?

Fucking hard, jesus christ. During my internship I kept getting my scalar for the sample mesh wrong (it's very difficult to set) and would just spawn a weird material where I'd mistakenly scaled down the mesh and the timeline would otherwise continue unperturbed.

My full time coworkers did most of the harder math honestly. I have to finish grad school before I could calculate a full set on my own. 

## Would you recommend it?

Yes!",18Feb2018,1

However ill share it here...

Over a year ago I was just browsing Facebook music groups and such. I ended up meeting three of my NYC friends on a music group discussing music and such...

Fast forward a year, 
One of those said people became good friends with my cousin and myself. He ended up taking a bus to Boston from New York City and it was the first time all of us met in person. It was rad as fuck. We showed him around the small towns of Massachusetts and of course the city of Boston. 

Let's skip a few months forward. 
I myself love traveling and have gone too new places, such as Washington State and Florida as an adult.
I have never been too New York City and my friend that came to MA invited me down...
I drove from my small town in MA all 6 hours down to NYC.. 

It was rad AS FUCK. He brought me to a few parties in Queens where I stayed. I never been in New york city in my life. And it was INSANE.

The whole experience of driving too a new state and new city was amazing. 

New York City was awesome and pretty much everything I expected. My friend's friend threw a party for us and at that party, I ended up meeting a friend I met on Instagram two years ago and she was awesome. 

The point I 'm trying to make is that internet friends CAN be real life friends. Its fucking awesome meeting and hanging out with your internet friends in real life.

And that's the biggest single challenge facing anyone of modest means. Whole industries have sprung up with only one real goal, finding the right people scattered around a huge world. This is why finding people pretty much always costs money--and usually a LOT of money, too much money for someone of modest means. But the sad thing is that finding people is almost always used to hurt those people by squeezing money out of them.

36,"I'm a 2nd year resident physician in a major city. Lately, I've been dealing with severe depression and burnout. It came to a point where I had to take a leave of absence from work because I couldn't deal with it. I was suicidal. Strangely, I actually created this account when I was strongly considering suicide, but never got myself to post something. Things eventually got better. I started therapy and pharmacotherapy. I wanted to go back to work. Still, I felt discouraged and unsure about my future. I was doubting myself. I've never really failed before in my life and I started to question a lot of things in my life.

This week was my first week back at work. Things were going okay, I was getting back into the routine. I actually enjoy being at the hospital. On Wednesday, I was on call. Which means I was working overnight after my regular day at work, admitting patients from the ER and doing consults. Then came this woman in her 40s, previously healthy with no past medical history. She had these vague symptoms that had started 1 week prior. She actually went to three different clinics before presenting to ER and she was kind of dismissed everytime and no one really worked up her case. Anyways, in the ER I heard her story and I saw that she had some lab abnormality. Immediately, my instinct was telling me that her condition was actually serious, even though she didn't appear that sick. I ran some more tests and by then I was actually pretty convinced that she had a very rare and lethal condition (90% mortality untreated). I had her admitted to the ICU and arranged for her to start treatment, which is actually pretty invasive. 

My diagnosis ended up being confirmed and her lab values are now improving after being on this treatment for a few days. Not only am I proud of myself for catching this rare diagnosis, but it also feels surreal to have made such a difference in this person's life. I received a lot of praise from my superiors at work but, most importantly, this patient was very grateful to me. I went to see her on the ward 2 days after I admitted her and she was tearing up. Since then, I've been feeling a whole mix of emotions. Pride, but also a sense of purpose. I feel like I've re-discovered a part of myself that I had loss.

I'm in no way trying to brag by telling this story. I just had to share it here because I really feel like this experience put things into perspective. It made me go back to the basics of what I'm doing and that, in the end, medicine is about helping people. To make a difference. And I feel like I made a difference this week.

I think things are going to be okay in the end.

37,"Hello! I am thirty six years old and am passionate about entrepreneurship and helping people to succeed. I have several projects that I’d like to bring to life (among them, an import and export business and a mentoring program for disadvantaged youth). I would like to find those who can help (partners too).

A while back, I stumbled upon a similar message by one 13-year-old trying to get help with his ideas. We have become friends and for several years, I have been his mentor and contributed to him changing his life dramatically for the better, and possibly getting on a track to doing extraordinary things. Now, I also find myself stuck and in need of someone to show me the way. I hope this message will reach such a person.",18Feb2018,0
38,"Not in the guns and violence sense, but as an addiction. Honestly, I don't game very much. I go through phases where I get really into video games, and then go months at a time without playing any. But I've noticed that when I get really into a game, whether its Civ 5 on PC or Battlefield One on my ps4, or whatever, for a period of a week or two it's the ONLY thing I want to do. For those couple of weeks, everything else in life is just an obstacle getting in the way of going back to play that game some more. I'll text my friends, but I don't really want to leave the house and hang out with them. I actually get annoyed by jobs coming in (I'm a freelancer) or chores that need to be done.

But the fact is, I'm almost 30 and living very hand-to-mouth and I should be spending all the time I can on making money, studying new skills and improving my situation. That all goes out the window for a while when I find a game that really clicks with me.

So this was just a thought I had, and wondering if other people have this issue to the same degree or have better techniques at balancing gaming and real life?",18Feb2018,0
41,After three years of doing computer science I've come to the conclusion that I really hate coding. I don't know if I really ever enjoyed it or if I just freaked out and chose it as I didn't really have a better idea of what to do with my life. This all came to a head while doing a coding assignment one weekend and realizing I would rather down a bottle of pills then do another line for an hour much less the rest of my life. A change is needed but I don't know if perhaps it's too late for me and I have no clue what I would want to do. So I ask how did you find what you wanted to do.,18Feb2018,2

44,"Okay so I basically ended a really close friendship over text because the friendship in general was giving me way too much anxiety. Admittedly, I kind of blindsided them but I’d been thinking about doing it for a while. I don’t really feel bad but a lot of people keep on telling me to reconsider it. Am I bad person for doing this? ",18Feb2018,0
45,"I'm fucking sick of it, she doesn't give a fuck. My head's been a mess for the  longest time but today was one of the days I didn't give a fuck how miserable or down I looked, I had no energy for it. She made a few remarks towards my sister and i saying she clearly mustn't have been a good mother so everyone else could hear (step sister and step dad and my sisters fiance). Then later She asked in the kitchen what's wrong in a loud tone right next to me as if she wanted everyone else to hear in the living room so I said ""idk"" and she then said in a screechy voice and same volume ""what?"". At that point I flipped and punched myself in the jaw twice before leaving the house for a cigarette. I told her earlier I felt psychotic and have talked with her many  times over the last 1.5 years about my mental state. I feel both shameful and hateful at the same time. I don't trust anyone anymore, she says she worries about me but on the surface she doesn't seem to really give a fuck. I was close to killing myself last year and when i told her months ago she didn't seem phased by it. I literally feel lost right now I'm seeing a psychiatrist in March, I thought I was paranoid schizophrenic and I still might be but the more I've tried to figure out what's wrong the most lost I seem to be. All I know is two relatives are diagnosed bipolar and ive had people ask if I'm autistic. Yet autism and schizoaffective (schizophrenia and bipolar combined) seem to look similar on the outside from what I've read. It feels like the only way to prove how much I'm suffering is by killing myself and I know that's a selfish thing to say but that's how it feels.

I haven't been the easiest growing up I'll admit. With her cheating on my dad when I was 3 with my step dad whome she's still with I always related more to my dad but in the later years began relating to my mum more. Now I'm at the point where my father's possibly getting divorced from my step mum and going through his own struggles and I don't feel like either of them give a shit. My dad and I relate a lot but that's also a negative because we drive each other up the wall. He's offered to move in with him for two weeks just to see if it helps but I feel drawn away from the idea for some reason. ",18Feb2018,0
46,"I'm still looking for new subs to join and came across this one and thought I'd just say hello!

47,"I used to play a lot of Runescape...

I got the max cape (all 99 stats in the game) and was on the grind for XP. I had a lot of fun and memories doing so, I met some interesting people while in high school. I put a lot of time into and spent a lot of time talking to people in clan chats and Skype.

I wouldn't say I regret my time with it though...
sure I put a lot of hours into it, but it allowed me some social interaction when I was a pretty lonely teen.

I just downloaded it again just to load it up and see it. It's just like a weird feeling. Like walking in your old high school or something, seeing everything in my bank and all that just the same as I left it years ago. 

Just uninstalled it though, kind of made me feel sad. All those times I thought I was ""wasting my life away"" but really I enjoyed my time. I've grown up a bit, don't really play as many video games as I used to. Though all those naysayers saying you'll regret not living life, I think the definition of living life is dynamic and doesn't have to fit your model. ",18Feb2018,2
49,"She put the poor guy in a tiny bowl. Luckily I love fish and have read a lot about proper betta care, so I will be going to get him a big ass tank and all the other things he'll need to be happy. 

I'm just really pissed because she should have asked me first. Like I didn't think it was rocket science to ask the parents before you buy a child a pet. People just think betta fish are there to look at and that makes me very sad, so now I have to go spend a bunch of money on him.

Anyway, if you guys have any advice that would be great. I've never actually owned a betta before so I'm just going off what I've read on /r/bettafish  and /r/Aquariums :D

[Here's](https://imgur.com/a/lBtfI) a picture of the two. My daughter named him Blitz!

Update: We went to get a 35 gallon fish tank for him from my father-in-law, and he gave us an orange bristlenose pleco to take with us... *sigh*

I'm in love with him though. Once I get them all settled in I'll post pictures and you guys can help me name the pleco!

50,"I’m a delivery driver at a pizza place and get paid roughly $5/Hr plus tips (people don’t really tip here though :/) and only get part time hours. My manager always talks about how good I am and how i’ll make more money later when I get to manager(she’s offered manager spots to half the store). 

What really is making me think about finally quitting and finding something else is that one of the other drivers quit so I went from 16 hours to 23 hours a week and she told me that she wouldn’t hire another driver so we could keep our higher hours. Flash forward a week and she hires this kid on as a cook with one driver shift a week so i wasn’t the only one closing, now 3 weeks later and he has the same amount of hours as me all as a driver...

51,"Anyone who thinks the internet has already fully developed itself into the way it is and always will be, is completely wrong.
It is still BEING born. The internet is like the baby form of AI.

People are talking about brain to internet (BCI) implants and stuff like that, becoming the big next boost in science.
but it's actually also the opposite which might become a huge factor:
It will not be the brains creating a better internet, but the the internet creating a better brain.

Right now, the internet brain is rediculously stupid.
It has a lot of processing cells which are very strong but they are not well linked together.
The speed at which they can communicate is very slow.
It's like a 4.3GHz processor, all the time been limited to a 1Hz clock speed.

Imagine how the internet brain may become conscious after receiving a massive speed-upgrade.
The technological advances which a super brain could produce, would be so much more superior than what human brains nowadays can accomplish.
WHAT IF the internet computer network, can suddenly internally communicate, using quantum entanglement properties for data transfer.
Ping between cells will be 0. Zero. Infinitely small; eliminating the biggest limiting factor in the network's communication speed.
This technology can greatly accelerate the advancement of AI.

The technological advances which a super brain could achieve, would be so much more superior than what human brains nowadays can accomplish.

-----------------

I also think that maybe this approach can make the development more efficient:

Create an application which connects many computers on the internet and also create a community which will become dedicated to running this application.
(or better yet, force computers to take part in the network, wheather they want to or not. - a.k.a. virus)
Give the computers the ability to talk to other computers on the network. Just like a human brain talks to itself.

Please take note that this is not the same as creating a supercomputer. It's not only the calculating power of a computer which matters in this example.
It's the amount of computers there are on the computer network. The more there are, the more self-aware and contious the network can become.
Because computers nowdays have much computing power (think about crypto mining),
that power can be used to simply simulate itself as being composed of many thousands of mini, virtual computers.
This will exponentially increase the amount of possible connections in the network.

Now, combine this technology with internet and quantum communication, and there is your AI.

The internet is the biggest change which is ever going to happen in human history, and we are lucky to witness this during our life time.

55,"Don't really know how to describe this but I need to get it off my chest. Summer 2017 was the best of my life. Everything was perfect. I was 20, living in Vancouver with a group of friends who I loved. We worked shitty jobs to pay the rent and spent our time drinking, going to the beach, or chilling on the porch smoking joints in the summer evenings. 

I lived like this for 3 months and it was bliss. I'm back home in Ireland now in a college course I hate, and there are so many aspects of my life that I should be happy about but I am feeling unbearably nostalgic on a daily basis. 

I cannot stop living in the past and I'm only 21. 

Doing every day tasks, my mind will suddenly replay a memory of walking down a street in Vancouver, the warm sun on my back and my best friend by my side, eating a Five Guys burger and not having a care in the world. Or I day dream in lectures about lying out on the beach with the snow capped mountains surrounding me. 

I just want to go back so badly. 

I can't afford to right now. And it crushes me that it will never happen again. That whole friend group, young and in college, living together for three months in Canada. Even if I went back it wouldn't be the same. Ireland is my home but it's back to reality, the same shit ever day, and I can barely stand it. 

My friend group from Vancouver were Irish but they're all living 3 hours away from me so I never see them anymore. We only ever talk on messenger or snapchat. I can't just walk into one of their rooms in the house for a chat or smoke a j on the porch with them. 

Living in the past, and having such an unbelievably good time, is making me so unbearably depressed. Please help me with any advice you might have. ",18Feb2018,1
