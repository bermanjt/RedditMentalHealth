0,"I've crushed on a friend of a friend for years now and in June it was finally the right time and place for me to go for it. I began by starting our own friendship outside of the circle, sharing interests, talking often, and flirting a little bit. He was apprehensive because of the mutual friends and I understood. I'm also much more romantically experienced than he is so while he finds himself awkward and nerdy and saw me as some real cool kid (hardly!), I found him sweet and endearing. It's not like I didn't know exactly how he was over the past 2.5+ years. I liked him for a reason! 

We'd talk every day and he'd initiate as often as I did, but never had plans come to fruition. I asked friends and reddit for advice and everyone said he's probably just not into me like I am into him, and if he was he'd make sure we were hanging out. So it seemed like the odds were not in my favor. I decided I liked his friendship anyway so I stopped flirting and trying to get him to meet up. It was pretty chill and platonic until one night he was likely drunk (and so was I) and initiated the flirting pretty hard, we met up and ended up spending the night together. I had to get to work very early so it was a quick goodbye.

We kept talking daily and I'd try to make plans but he'd never commit. One day he said he was bored and asked what I was doing. I told him I'd come by but he said he didn't want to go anywhere. Hanging at his place wasn't an option for a myriad of legitimate reasons, so it was then that I just decided to give up completely. I would just be his texting/phone buddy and see him when we were with friends, just like before. I was surely done flirting and figured he just wasn't into it for some reason.

Of course, just as I decided that he asked if I wanted to come with him for a hike on one of my favorite trails. Of course I said yes, still figuring it would just be a friendly thing. The next day rolled around and I did my thing, not holding my breath for him to come through. The day went by slowly but I kept busy with chores, and he finally texted me in late afternoon saying when he'd be there. 

We met up and had a lot of fun just walking and talking. I showed him my favorite spot along a river. It was secluded and beautiful. We talked like old friends but every time I'd get close he'd move to a different spot (we were standing). When the sun started getting low we walked back to our cars. I gave him a hug goodbye and hopped in my driver's seat. I didn't want to end it like that but I also didn't want to push him. I made some small talk while standing in my door. He said we should do this again next weekend and I said sure thing.  My windows were down and right as I was about to back out of my spot he walked up to my door and said some cute shit to me and leaned in for a kiss. It was sweet and I won't ever forget it.

I drove home fucking ecstatic! I'm still giddy thinking about it. All day at work I had a huge grin on my face. I don't even know where it's all going but I like it. I don't mind taking things slow. I'm just happy he likes me :)",07Aug2018,38
1,"I got hired for one internship on the spot and got the notification I got hired for another one I applied for after the interview. One requires more than the other and seems less personal than the one I got hired for on the spot. Both are for remote positions in fields I want to be in. One would be only for 3 months and the other would also be for 3 months, but with potential for hire.

Neither requires many hours so I feel like I could do both along with my Lionbridge job for 5 hours out of each week. Total, I'd have to work about 20-25 hours per week on top of a demanding school schedule. These are remote positions and I live on campus so I feel like it'd be possible for a few months but I'm just wondering if it's worth doing?

With the other internship, I didn't expect to get it on the spot on top of getting an email about another internship I applied for. Is this something manageable or should I consider dropping one?",07Aug2018,2

3,"Hello.. I’m 16 years old and I want to change my eating habits. I want to eat healthier because I mainly eat rice with meat or beans, cereal, and hot pockets throughout the weeks. I come from a Hispanic family so dinner is probably going to consist of the same thing. When my mom makes a salad I would eat it except... I don’t like any vegetables. I gag when I try to force ANY vegetable into my system. Same goes for MOST fruits. So how the hell am I supposed to eat healthy when healthy foods like salads and fruits (except for maybe apples, grapes, bananas) are disgusting to me? Can I really substitute rice for something else? How about snacks? Hot pockets are super unhealthy, I don’t know what else to try out instead. Also, I eat whenever I get hungry. Even if it’s 1am or later... should I set a schedule for eating too? I’ve heard of fasting but have no idea how it works or if it’d be good to try at my age. Thanks for reading/answering!",07Aug2018,6
4,"I’ve quit social media before in the past and I enjoyed it. After a while though I always got tempted to go back to it and gave in. The most recent of those times I only got back instagram (purely to browse not post) and reddit. But now I have games on my phone too. 

Once I even sold my iPhone and got a £10 flip phone (old school 2001 vibe) and it was good but just too inconvenient for modern life, I missed the basics like Google and Spotify etc. so I got my iPhone back. 

Basically, I need to find a way of getting rid of social media and not using my iPhone constantly even though it’s right there in my pocket, and instagram (or whatever) is just a download or google search away. I’ve done it before, but it never lasts. 

I spend literally all my time either on my laptop or phone. What I don’t do on my phone, I do on my laptop and vice versa. I get incredibly bored without technology. But I need a break and a cleanse so I’m gonna have to try again. Anyone else tried this before / is going to? I don’t really need advice I guess, just wondering what other people think of the matter.

5,"The first is that you need to release the past and move on. Donate, trash, burn the things you’ve accumulated in your relationship and remove that energy from your life. 

The second thing I’ve felt, understood, and will do my best to honor is that you can’t expect to keep someone next to you when you know that they deserve things you’re incapable of giving to them. I’m talking about two different people in these situations but I hope this person knows that I care for them and the ways they tried to help me through these passed months. 

Releasing these attachments will make room for what’s truly meant to be in your life. And theirs. ",07Aug2018,1

7,"I’ve been meaning to write about it but haven’t got to it because of all the left over emotions I had, but here goes.

In my high school you needed to have 60 service hours(volunteer hours) in order to graduate. I decided to start early and there was this event a church has every year called Polka day and they are always under staffed. So I said why not. It turned out to be the best/worst decision of my life.

I had arrived early and thought about just helping the supervisor help out with the hotdog buns and chips. Out of nowhere this little blonde girl came in and started helping. Eventually we started talking and told her what high school I was going to. At the time she was in 6th grade and was thinking about going to my school. I told her of all the things we have and pretty much sold her on coming. After the grueling day was over we parted ways but became friends and vowed to volunteer at this same holiday every year. I saw her again the next year.

It wasn’t until she came as a freshman a year after that where I had changed. It was the exposure effect. Seeing her daily made me feel like we could be a thing. I heard rumors she was dating somebody, so I backed off until she was single. Once she broke up with that guy I started to do more things with her, including the yearly musical. That’s when things started to spiral out of control.

I ended up getting her number and would text her weekly. I couldn’t hang out with her cuz I had a busy schedule, also not having a car really puts a kink in things. As my junior year ended I started to think about her a lot. And coming into senior year, it was all I could think about. Almost every day my daydream consisted of her and my grades fell for it. At this point you could say to just ask her out. Well over the break she met some stoner guy and my fate was sealed. I was the guy longing for a girl that would never be single. I started getting depressed and because she was in my mind too much I was damn near suicidal. I talked with everybody except her.

I didn’t go to junior prom but I did want to go to senior prom so I decided to ask a friend of mine. She accepted. As I was heading to class another friend of mine came up to me and said,”you should ask [her] she would really appreciate that.” You see in my school, freshman and sophomores could only go to prom if only a senior asked them. I told her I’d think about it and went to class. I kept thinking about it throughout the week (she said it on Monday of all days). Saturday night the boys and I decided to watch Warm Bodies (in which I didn’t know the zombies’ name was Romeo), but after that movie I made my choice. Life finds a way and as soon as we left the theater there she is! I ask her if she will go to prom with me and she said yes! Suck it stoner!

Unfortunately those emotions that I had previously, resurfaced. Not only that, prom was the weekend after the musical and guess who was in both, both of us. The days leading up to prom were the lowest days I’ve had. I never dated a girl but this was darn close and teenage hormones were all over the place. I stayed at my friends house the day before just to calm down I was so out of it.

Well the day came and she was stunning like a small rose and I her white-suited thorn. I texted her days before that if her boyfriend was coming that this night is just going to be her and I. She agreed. But somebody didn’t get the memo, cuz he ended up standing at the end of the dance floor with puppy dog eyes and wouldn’t let us dance comfortably. I danced with her for three songs until I handed her over to him. I left the ballroom and stood on the balcony to get some air. She came over and asked if I was alright I said yeah (I wasn’t). Looking back I was being immature and wanted her and I to act like we were a couple but we were not. After prom there was an after party that I went to and she couldn’t stay. I hugged her, said our goodbyes and let her go to him. I spent that night crying thinking of everything I could have done to have her be there not as a date but my girlfriend. But sadly that isn’t the reality.

During graduation as I received my diploma I heard her yell as my name was called out. She was in the crowd and I started to look for her but to no avail. After the ceremony ended, I ended up finding her and she told me how proud she was. I thanked her for coming.  A couple days went by and got a letter. It was from her and she said all this touchy feely stuff about how it was amazing to have met her and she thanked me for taking her to prom. It was after this letter that I texted her and told her everything about what had happened those years prior. The tone in her text made me feel that she was shocked and mortified.

That was five years ago. It wasn’t until last year that we lightly chatted. She’s a state away, dumped her stoner bf for another guy and plans on marrying him. As for right now I haven’t talked with her since, despite being Facebook friends. After turning 21 sometimes those feelings come back in my drunk stupors, and occasionally would have dreams of me saving her for all these weird scenarios my mind comes up with. But they have long ended. In another life maybe we would have been together, but in this one we aren’t and probably will never be. Oh well.",07Aug2018,1

11,"These past two years of high school have been a fucked up ride. I did a lot of drugs and cared little in my work (somehow I still managed to graduate). These drugs have been really affected the way I process and retain information, even after being sober for about 6 months. When I try to read now, air just read the words and get nothing out of it, nothing like I used to be before everything. I can’t read books anymore because I can’t process the words fast enough. This is not only a problem for my enjoyment out of literature but college is just going to tear me up. If I can’t read I won’t be able to last. Is my brain going to stay this slow? Or with effort will I be able to recover? Also, are there any activities or practices that will help me improve the speed in which I process things. My memory is also out the window, which I’m sure is in the same area as my processing speeds. ",07Aug2018,1
12,"I've posted and deleted this a few times around reddit, that's how much it's messing with me.  tl;dr is clear path basically park to myself, doing sprints up and down it but I also air drum to the music.  I'm a drummer, when the endorphin high kicks in from the sprints it's a crazy high and I can't help it.  I'm a drummer so it looks controlled, I've received comments for it before but nothing negative, mostly amusement.  Anyway this couple in their 50s shows up about halfway through my workout, sits at a nearby table.  The woman smiles at me a few times.  The guy smiles at me as well, I catch his eye while he's doing this so give a wave.  He gets on his phone so I just feel awkward, like I would anywhere for getting ignored for thinking contact had been made but was a misread on my behalf.

I keep up with my routine, then I see a park ranger truck coming down the road.  As soon as I see it I see the couple getting up from their picnic table and walk back to their vehicle, when they get to it they both smile at me, get in and leave.

Park ranger vehicle parks in the lot by me facing me, but nobody gets out.  I keep up with my exercise, after ~10 minutes they get out and start walking to me.  I think they are going to ask or warn me about a wildlife thing, so I stop and take out my earbuds.  They ask me what I'm doing (it's obvious though), say they got a call about someone moving fast and looking like they were on drugs, they ask me if I'm on drugs or alcohol.  I'm shocked but say no, they ask if I have any drugs or alcohol in the vicinity, I say no.  At that, Ranger 1 goes back to the vehicle and gets in.  During this Ranger 2 turns sideways like he's keeping me and his partner in his peripheral vision, once his partner is in the vehicle he goes back and gets in.  I'm still stunned and confused, so I just stand there waiting expecting them to come back.  After about five minutes, Ranger 2 gets out, walks to the nearby dumpster, throws something out, goes back and gets in the vehicle, and they leave.",07Aug2018,1
13,"Something that bothers me almost everyday is that I have scars on one third of my body. I put them there but now I want them gone. What really irritates me is why I even cut in the first place. All I wanted was one friend and it bothered me so much that I began cutting and scratching myself. 

Now In my mind I sacrificed my skin for other people. I know that’s not the case. And I don’t feel bad for myself. I put myself in this position however I am angry. Angry that I did it and angry that I even had to be alone in the first place to feel those type of emotions.

Every time I leave the house and see people wearing shorts or sleeveless shirts I just want to scream. Because I have taken something good away from myself and now I’m permanently disfigured. And for what? A shallow friend who wants to talk about whatever guy they are into. If only I could go back in time. But when you make your bed you have to lie in it.

I figured they were trying to do yard work, or were putting up flyers.

23,"If today you find that your energy gets expressed in all kinds of stupid ways, it’s only because it’s not flowing in the right channels. When it doesn’t flow in the right channels then it gets invested into all idiocies. So, what do you do? You gossip. Have you ever tried to estimate the kind of time that you spend in gossip? Or, day dreaming. Just sitting or lying down. Just randomly thinking. And mind is wandering here and there, going to different planets, different galaxies. Doing unthinkable things. And what we we doing? Lying down and sleeping.

Why does that happen? That happens because there is energy but it’s being squandered. You’ve not given it the right channel. Then there is no intensity on your face. Then there is only stupid idiocy. The face itself tells that life is being wasted. And it is so pathetic. One life, one youth, and slipping away.

When your energy and attention is flowing in the right channels, then you have no time left for gossiping and complaining, for random squabbles, for picking up stupid fights, or feeling hurt. Who has the time to feel hurt? Life is so precious. And there are a thousand things to do. Who has the inclination to complain? There is so much coming my way. Why complain? Instead, take what is coming. Then life is rich. Not the life of a poor man.

Most of us live a life of poor man. Life can be very very very rich. But not when you say “Either this, or that”. Life is rich when you say, “And. And. And”. And, “And” does not mean that I’m greedy for more. It only means that I’m available to everything. I’m not closed. When the opportunity comes knocking, I’m available. When the sun rises, I’m available to look at it. When the stars shine, I’m available to dance under them. When the birds are singing, I’m available to listen to them. I’m not closed. When I’m besides a river, I’m available to enter the river, I don’t say “Oh my God what will happen. River? Good boys don’t go to river.”

30,"About me, I am a college student, (though it is the summer for about two more weeks). I have very low expense compared to my income, plenty of savings (about 30,000 in cash and $20,000 in investments)). I think that I am addicted to making money. 

I am frugal with my money and don’t make money to spend and flash, I don’t participate in consumerism, and I save about 70% of what I make and invest it. 

This same post could be me bragging about myself but that’s not what I’m doing. I actually I feel like for one reason or another I can’t just “chill. “

Currently I work part time at a clothing store , I drive lyft, and I am working on a website/blog that I hope will make me profit a few years down the road. I also have money from various streams of income that are too complicated to bother explaining but in all total about $18k a year in addition to the part time and lyft driving. 

I am very financially literate and spend my spare time reading and educating myself on anything finance related, whether that is stocks, possible business ventures, investing strategies, or information on taxes. In fact, I am actually double majoring in finance and economics. 


Despite being very financially comfortable, I still get up at 5 AM to drive lyft from 6-9, usually work from like 10-5 at the clothing store, drive lyft again from the second I walk out of the door until about 8. A few night a week I work out from about 830 to 930. If I don’t work out I’ll work on my website until I fall asleep to wake up and do the same thing. I’m essentially putting in 14+ hour work days on the regular. And it’s for no reason, I have zero financial anxiety but just can’t stop making as much money as possible. The only thing that can seem to stop me is spending time with my girlfriend. 

The thing is, is that I’m not unhappy or anxious, it’s like making money is a hobby and a borderline passion for me. It’s like trying to maximize a high score for a gamer. A gamer will grind on his game day in and day out, watching videos when he isn’t playing to see if he can pick up something new, when he isn’t playing or watching videos, he is thinking of ways that he can be better, or planning his next few days on the sticks. A gamer isn’t trying to get anything out of being good at the game except simply being good at the game and beat his previous high score. 

That is how I feel about money. It’s like I can’t stop thinking about how I can make more money. And it’s not even to buy stuff. Literally when I am driving or it is slow at the clothing store, I’ll brainstorm assets that I can purchase or just think constantly about openings that I could possibly start a business in or skills that I could invest in myself to make more money. 

I know any type of addiction is not good. I am worried I could grow into one of those greedy, money-hungry types if I’m not careful, but I’m really really really hoping that my actions now will just set me up to relax and just live off of the great attention i paid to money in my younger years.

31,"When I was a child and everything I had learnt was new and I was at the beginning of the learning curve of life, I couldn’t help but believe the world I existed in was limitless and infinite from a creative and imaginatory perspective. 

But then, as my days started to get repetitive and the same information passed by again and again, that huge unknown existence that sat past the gate of my own boundaries became thinner and tinier. Jadedness and failure to respond to stimuli became the normal. 

Then, at a certain age, the wonder of it all, halted altogether, because although there were new experiences to be had, they just weren’t as wondrous as I once thought they would be. Everything became underwhelming and there was no magic in anything. The colorful and mysterious world had now become finite and small, predictable and repetitive.

I guess it's partly that I missed out on being 13-16 and partly that I associate my curves with him, but it makes me sooo uncomfortable to look womanly. Showing off my body like a teenager is fine with me--shorts and (modest) crop tops-- but accentuating my hips or waist or chest or boobs makes me feel trapped and molested and just too mature. It's hard to avoid now, too, because my peers dress like this and it's in fashion for my age group to dress sexy (think about how late teens &amp; early 20s dressed in 1999!).

And lately it's not even just me, but I feel kind of...angry...when I see women doing this sometimes. I don't want to be angry at the way others express themselves 🙁 I even read a trans girl's struggles on Reddit about how she wishes her hips and chest were bigger and it made me annoyed..? I don't even get why I would feel like that. 

The worst/important part is that lately my family and friends have pointed out that the way I currently dress could be improved on. It's true; I get a lot of clothes from Goodwill and some of them obviously belonged to old ladies that weren't even my size. My boyfriend and his family have been encouraging me when I wear something nice. He wants me to dress classy and maturely. I really appreciate his mom liking my clothes, too; she always tells him that I dress poorly 😅 

So I've been trying to dress more maturely. I'm torn between loving the approval and feeling disgusting. But I guess I'll have to grow into this someday anyway. There's this dress that inspired me to write this post, as my boyfriend almost begged me to get it for the wedding but I haven't been able to bring myself to buy it because of how it makes me feel. It has no straps, just armbands so your shoulders are exposed, and it's stretchy but tight over your chest and arms and then the rest of the dress is really long. It feels like a constant blood pressure test and a constant reminder that I have boobs. And it's long so you can't run or stand with your legs far apart. I don't know:/ 

Wanting to run away from this, but the pressure of growing up is gaining on me.

So thanks for listening. I just wanted to tell someone. It's such a first world problem. And I know I don't HAVE to dress maturely. It just makes everyone happy and there's a lot of pressure to do it and looking mature is helpful",07Aug2018,1
35,"I suppose it's a little one sided my thoughts when I write this. I doubt I'll consider writing down my thoughts when I'm happy. Strange how people like to write out bad emotions rather than good ones. I guess when you write them down you are removing them from your body. But then it's recorded down for my future self to cringe at later. I'm writing down an overall summary rather than what's going on around me. I don't know if I should keep my writing tangent or focus it in a bit. To make it specific like events or people around me. I just realised I can write whatever I want. I don't have any guidelines to follow. It's my right, it's not like 1984. I can write whatever I wish. That makes me smile. The laughs are becoming more frequent, it might be a seizure, it might not. It happens most often when I'm alone, I burst into a near uncontrollable laughter. I feel like I have to supress it around people. It's definetly weird. Not normal. People will think I'm looking for attention.  I love the sun. I also love when it's gone. I love almost all weather. Strange. When you write down thoughts you think of thoughts you've never really thought before. You get a better grip and understanding of what you actually think. I have conflicting thoughts sometimes, I watched a documentary about the brain. How the two hemispheres interact. It was very interesting. Part of my brain hates people and the other part like a them. I'm not quirky or different. I don't think I am. I don't know how other people think or what they think. I don't know if what I think is normal or not. But then again, what is normal? Does it mean the majority? I hate myself then I'm ok with myself. I try to self improve myself by going to the gym. There's nothing wrong with self improvement. I have a feeling that people think I'm weird and don't like me. It doesn't matter though. All that matters to me is myself. It may seem selfish, but... I don't have a but, the most important thing to one's self should be themself. If the most important thing is one's self then I should analyse myself. I don't know how many people do this, it's likely pretty bias to analyse yourself. But then there's also the feelings of conflicting thoughts. A part of my brain believes I'm the scum of the earth, I don't deserve love or respect. Then there's a part of my brain that says I'm alright. Maybe every person is too complex to simply analyse. People are so complicated yet so simple. It's an oxymoron but that description seems right in my head. I will likely never understand myself even though I am myself.  I was thinking about what it means to be a man. Everyone is driven by primal functions and desires and a man's basic primal function is to protect and collect resources. Biologically speaking men are expendable, that's why men are sent out into wars and why in a disaster women are valued over men. Men serve the role of protector, sent out to fight. That is why in every single culture women are valued over men. It is also why men collect resources, the world was a dangerous place and this resource collecting had it's risks. Many try to seek a sense of worth, because if they have no worth they are nothing. In this ever competitive world, where education is becoming more expensive and the worth of the education is decreasing creates and ever expanding number and worthless men and low status men. Collecting resources in the modern day is no longer dangerous but it is harder. The average wages have been declining and the buying power of those wages are also in decline. The pool of men who are going to be successful is getting smaller. If A.I have their way evenually most jobs will be taken reducing the pool of successful men to an even smaller number. What is the world going to look like if 3/4th of the population is no longer needed. Women will be somewhat immune to the inital consequences but not indefinetely. Right now there are no enough successful men to go around and women have taken notice. ""Where did all the good men go?"" They ask. Well there are so many answers to that question. It is the easiest time to survive in human history but it is also harder to succeed in women's eyes. Success has always been a relative concept and the bar has been exponentially raised for the past hundred years yet the means of success have been seadily shrinking. The simple answer though is society doesn't need them anymore. I embrase this beautiful fucked up world.

Both girls and boys start out in the womb as female, it is only a few weeks into fetal development that they develop into boys. Boys and girls then start out life after birth in the majority of cases raised by a woman. Their world view for the first few years is feminine, as they get older nothing changes for girls. The world view taught to them by their mothers continues to be valid. Boys on the other hand as they get older go through an early life crisis wherein the feminine world view becomes invalid to them. Just as boys when through an internal change in the womb to become male. They must go through an external change in life to become a man. Men have to go through a process to differentiate themselves from women for are for all intensive purposes the base line of our species. So even at an innate biological level a man's world is one of conflict. Partially resulting from this man are naturally neurotic than women and can tolerate greater levels of harrassment, violence and stress. Many women who venture into the world of men are often shocked. What they see as bulling, mistreatment and injustice are just par of the course of being a man. Men talk shit to, make fun of and harrass each other, the difference is women are not equiped to handle it like men, not on average anyway. The world of men and the world of women are two very different places.",07Aug2018,1

For awhile now I've had really bad depression. I have an amazing fiance who tries to be there for me though and help but I do see a counselor. As a child living with a single mom...I was very neglected emotionally. It has affected me more and more I've realised as I've grown up and being on my own.. cause I still feel stuck in these awful patterns. I've noticed that I think I'm afraid of being happy cause of childhood and how I was raised. It sucks it really does. I am on anti depressants. But I do have a lot of anxiety. I am actually scared to go to sleep because I'm afraid I will wake up being feeling awful and depressed :( I hate it I just want to be happy. I can't believe I'm scared of what tomorrow will bring. Everyday is a constant battle I feel like. I want to choose to be happy but I constantly get upset over things. I'm getting married in 2 months I should be happy! I mean I am happy about that but I've caused so much arguing because I have many issues emotionally and cant relax and just let my guard down. I hope all this makes sense. Question though..is it normal for depressed people to be scared of the next day or how they will feep?. My goal is to be happy and not get upset this week but like I said I'm scared once I fall asleep I'll just wake up and my brain will forget everything and I'll just feel crappy and unmotivated and unloved when I actually very loved I know.

53,"* I posted this in r/advice and wanted to spread awareness/discuss here also..*

{Warning: Dark}

This is obviously a throwaway account because I don’t want my friends or family knowing about this as I’ve kept this to myself since it happened and I’ve come to Reddit because I’ve seen Reddit five people good advice in the past.
If this isn’t the appropriate subreddit please let me know..

I was 8 years old and like any youngster I was on my laptop a lot. Very innocent and wanted to meet new people and didn’t go outside a lot so thought a chat room was innocent and went into one. 
I had been on them for a few weeks and knew to avoid guys being creeps and most guys stayed away because I did in fact have my username as my age and it was a webcam one too..

I got a pm from someone who claimed to be a mod and told me to be careful and I said i was ok. (This is person is important later)
Days go by and a user pops up saying someone in the chat room has put a nasty virus on my computer and the threats were getting higher, being an 8 year old this scared the shit out of me. I immediately asked the stranger what I was supposed to do. He gave me his msn messenger email and we spoke on there. His name was Jason. 
Jason told me he worked for the FBI. (I know right?) He told me a lot of hackers had my information and the only way to get the threats down was to skype with them so they ignore me and the threats disappear and when the threats reached 0, Jason would be able to track down their IP and arrest them..

I get sent the first username to add on skype and at first it was just talking and Jason was updating me on the threats going down and when it hit 0 the guy I was talking with on skype went offline as if in fact his internet was cut out and tracked down and arrested.. this made me believe everything Jason claimed to be saying about the hackers. 
Jason kept sending usernames to me and the convos were innocent at first then it got very dark.
One guy asked me to take my shirt off and I messaged Jason in a new tab on my laptop but he told me he can’t tell me what they ask me to do and scolded me for telling him I felt uncomfortable. He told me to do whatever they told me to do so the threats would go down. I told Jason I was gonna just go off the laptop and I was threatened that if I did then my internet would turn off and I would be tracked and arrested and that I wouldn’t be released until 18.  That was a lot of years. 
Being 8.. I listened to him. I had to sit in my room naked doing sexual things to myself and so stuff and dress in my school uniform for these guys. I felt so sick. 
Every time the threat level went down which Jason told me when it hit 0 the user I was on skype with would go offline as this meant their IP was tracked and they would be arrested for hacking. This made me keep believing and I was terrified of my family finding out because if I didn’t do this then the “FBI” would come to my house and arrest me. 
I went back into the chat room after days of doing this and the mod that messaged me to be careful popped up and said “you working for Jason?” And I said yes and she replied “me too.” I told her I was feeling uncomfortable and she told me not to worry about it. 
I continued to do the skype calls and asked Jason when it would stop and he agreed that I’d do one more and I could quit.
I get the username and go on and I really wanted this to stop so was already past my breaking point. The guy asked me to do more explicit things than what I’d been asked to do before. 
I was told to touch myself and lay in my room in the webcam camera naked and find objects to use. I was told to orgasm and I had no idea what that meant and I couldn’t even do it as the guy told me how and still couldn’t. 
I got up into the pm section and asked the guy to just put the threat level down so I could leave which bear in mind they were supposed to know nothing about a threat level and I was bait to get them to put the level down so they could be “tracked and arrested”. The guy laughed and said “Jason is fucking stupid, do as I say. The threats are never going down”.
I asked him this because it was taking longer than usual and I was crying and didn’t want this anymore. 
I signed out of my account and turned off my laptop for days...
I still have not logged into the actual email account (Not msn because nobody uses that anymore) but the actual mail outlook of things. I’m too terrified.
I know now that I was obviously tricked brutally into something more.
I want advice on what I should do. 
Should I go to the police now or talk to someone professionally? Do I tell my therapist? What will happen to me?? 

EDIT:: During the skype calls I couldn’t see the guys face but I heard camera clicks as if my photo was getting taken. I was told to pose in different ways and their excuse for this was “this  protect you online and we’ll get a notification if your in a chat room again because the computer  know your face”

56,"The following is a very brief study of the relationship between creature cost and it's combined Attack and Health stats. 

In order to develop a better understanding of the Magicka efficiency of creatures, I studied a sample of 134 creatures selected with the following criteria in mind:

* The creatures at each magicka cost with the highest total body stats would be chosen
* Creatures from each color would be included at each Magicka cost 0 - 12, when available
* Each color should be represented by at least 18 creatures
* Creatures that have offsetting negative effects would not be included (e.g. Blighted Alit, Lumbering Ogrim...)
* Unique Legendary cards would not be included
* The Magicka cost would be compared to the combined total of Attack and Health

This study yielded the following formula:

&gt; B = 1.52m + 2.02   (r^2 0.853)

So, roughly speaking, a 2 Magicka creature should have 5 'units' of body, meaning 3/2, 2/3, 1/4, etc. And a 6 Magicka creature should have 11 'units' of body (e.g. 6/5, 4/7, etc.)

While this is probably already apparent to veterans of the game, I'm posting this for two reasons. One, to help newer players understand how much they are 'paying' for a summon ability or keyword. For exapmle, Mantikora is a 10 cost 6/6 with ""Summon: Destory an enemy creature in this lane."" So, if you back out the cost of the body, you are paying 3^1/3 Magicka for that removal. 

Secondly, this will serve as an important baseline going forward when we calculate the implied cost of various keywords, draws, and summon abilities.

An interesting side note, each color has a slightly different cost curve. This seems to demonstrate which colors are more creature based and more tactic based, though not obviously so.

&gt; RED = 1.95m + 1 (r^2 = 0.91)
&gt; BLUE = 1.27m + 2.8 (r^2 = 0.76)
&gt; YELLOW = 1.15m + 3.4 (r^2 = 0.85)
&gt; GREEN = 1.22m + 2.7 (r^2 = 0.89)
&gt; PURPLE = 1.53m + 2.6 (r^2 = 0.81)

57,"My parents have cats. They like hunting, and my parents don't know how to stop them. They tried collars with bells but that didn't work, and the cats somehow removed them after a couple weeks. 

Neither of my parents play with the cats very much - I read online that you're meant to play with them for at least 10 minutes each day. Plus, my mum's tidied most of the cat toys away since they were kittens so they can't even play with those anymore. I think maybe they hunt because they are bored.

Half an hour ago, mum saw one of the cats was playing with a pigeon in the garden. The back of the pigeon was missing. The cat was toying with it, but also eating the bits that fell off. I suggested that we should kill the pigeon to be more humane, and also to stop the guts and feathers getting spread across the garden. Mum agreed but didn't want to do it, so I said I would.

I got a shovel, we scared the cats away in case they got territorial over their kill. I missed the pigeon at first - it was just alive enough to evade my first swing. Then I hit its wing, then I hit its body twice and it went still, but I could see that its head was still twitching. I hit it again hoping just to stun it but I felt its head flatten under the shovel. I remembered that bird bones are lighter and weaker so that they can fly more easily.

Previously, I've never killed anything larger than an insect or arachnid. I know that it was already dying but I was the one to deal the finishing blow. I think about death a lot. It keeps me up at night. I think this will keep me up at night too for a while.

I still don't think mum is going to play with her cats. I'd like a cat of my own so that I can play with it all the time, but I don't think the flats I live in allow pets. I try to play with my parents' cats sometimes when I come over but it's quite hard to find the toys because they've all been tidied away.

Feels mean to say, but I hope mum realises that she was partly responsible for the pain that the pigeon went through.",07Aug2018,5

It was pretty fun, a bit of drinking, different friend groups mixing pretty well. About halfway through the party I started talking to a girl who was pretty nice we'll call her Flynn. Soon Flynn and I start talking to her friend who is very pretty and I kinda liked her, let's call her Sling. So Sling, Flynn and I are talking. Sling is a bit more flirty than normal but me being autistic didn't notice. Flynn needs to go to the bathroom so we go to it. It's just me and Sling talking outside the door. I end up needing to go too so when Flynn is done I go. When I finish my friend comes to the bathroom and says his dad is waiting to bring us home. We leave.

Fast forward a week or so and Flynn and her friend let's call her Eve are staying at Flynn's house (could be Eve's idk). Eve starts snapchatting me basically saying Sling liked me and wanted to kiss me outside the bathroom. And we all know what that means if you catch my drift. I realise this and remember Sling said she might throw a going away party because she was leaving for Dubai. She never throws one and I see on her Snapchat story she is now in Dubai. I realise I missed the only chance to kiss a girl I liked and possibly lose my virginity.

TLDR: I had the chance to kiss a girl I liked and possibly lose my virginity but missed it cos of autism.

I want to die, sometimes i hope ill pass in my sleep so i wont have to do anything. I dont see a future for myself in any career, it all sounds boring, i want a reason to live and to do stuff, but i just cant find one, and i always come to the conclusion of whats the fucking point when ill just die by the end of it while regretting everything. Why dont i just die now and not waste any fucking time.

I feel like a failure to my parents, they believe ill go places, make something of myself. I feel like no one who makes bad decisions and has bad habits and feels like shit and is miserable 24/7.

I just needed to put this out there. Im not asking for pity or any bullshit.",07Aug2018,7
68,"I feel a lot of anger and not much else. The attempt itself doesn't seem real; it seems more like a book or a movie. Something in me can't wrap my head around what happened. It's like the lines of fiction and reality have completely blurred here. It's been 3 months, and I'm scared I'll always feel like this. 

Survivors, did you feel this way? If so, how did you get past it?",07Aug2018,4
69,"As the title states, I am in the hardest part of my life.

Since October '17, I have lost a job, and then been awarded 2 new ones, each with higher pay than what I lost.  Sounds good, except the whole starting 2 new jobs in under one year part.  Pay is good.  But expenses and difficulty has nearly killed me.

Sunday was the culmination of it.  We have been attempting to sell our house all year.  Starting in march, we have had 5 different purchase contracts come up, and each failed, for different reasons.  Our property does need a new roof, and I have factored that into negotiations, but poorly qualified buyers and people who generally just want move-in ready have put up contracts, only to back out late in the game.  In the meantime, our family rented an apartment, at nearly the same cost as the mortgage, and we moved.  I have been servicing a rent and a mortgage and all the associated bills since June now.  Meanwhile, another reason for me selling was the clean up my own debts and finances, as we have nice equity in the home.  Gradually, that dream has faded, and it was how I would finance my recently graduated from high school child, who was ready to attend college.  Now, she will be attending a junior college instead.  She is sad, but my wife and I hope to keep her motivated.  Of course, some of that is on her too.

Anyway, my stress level with a new, higher level executive position and a house that I'm moving back into, and finances that are dangerously close to peril came to a head on Sunday.  I was moving stuff back into the house alone, and suffered heat exhaustion and severe dehydration.  I was taken to ER by paramedics, who did a full check to make sure we didn't have a heart issue or anything else.  I am glad to say I received an all-clear on that.  it scared my family considerably, and all of the neighbors of 14 years who saw it all happening.  I feel bad for scaring so many good people, but I've communicated with them and let them know I'm grateful for their concerns, and I'm ""ok"".

Physically speaking.

Mentally, I'm at the end.  I have not seriously considered suicide, but I have wondered if there is a way out.  I am currently working to nail down a refi on the property, in an effort to get some work done on the house and heal some of the financial damage I've done since late last year.  I feel that it will work out, but I still am on the hook for 2 months more rent, and 2 continuing the mortgage.  I can handle that.  What I cannot handle is one more ""thing"", one more financial stressor or pressure item.  With one entering college, which we can handle, and a home we are coming back to that needs some expensive repairs, and still paying out the rent, we have extreme financial pressure.  I am grateful we both have adequate paying jobs, but there is no room for error.

Oh, and to top it all off, I attempted to raise some capital by posting some old collectibles that were in my mom's attic on ebay.  I did sell them all, for a whopping grand total of about 2,000 USD, which would help, except that one of the buyers is complaining that I did not accurately describe the item, and has now placed an ebay hold on half of that capital.  I am dealing with that, but I'm at the point of fury over that one.

I just wanted to share this, and to ask if anyone has had similar financial concerns or has had a tough patch in their life that went on for more than a couple months.  This is approaching a year now for me, with no joy, no laughter, no happiness.  I attempted to work things out for the good of the whole family, and have damn nearly ruined myself in the process.",07Aug2018,9
70,"I moved to Missouri less than a month ago because my husband got a job here. I registered to vote almost immediately because there was an upcoming primary and a right-to-work referendum on the ballot. I also got my in-state license quickly because this state has a new voter ID law and I didn't want any issues, although I still have the temporary license that is printed on paper because I haven't received the permanent one in the mail yet.

I take my right to vote pretty seriously, so I spent quite a bit of time reading up on my options and making sure I was registered. Everything looked good on my secretary of state's website, so this morning my husband stayed home with the kids while I drove the car to the polling place.

I waited in line for about 10 minutes. I handed the poll worker my temporary ID and she looked confused, then asked for my birth certificate or passport. I explained that this is my legal ID; I received it from the DMV and it is an official government document. She seemed satisfied. But she couldn't find me on her list, so she started looking for me under potential misspellings of my name. Nothing.

So I step off to the side while another poll worker asks me if I'm sure I'm in the right place. I am; I looked it up several times. Then he calls his help line, and they inform him I didn't register in time to vote in this election. I needed to have registered 30 days prior to the election in order to be eligible to vote.

I didn't live here 30 days ago. How could I have possibly registered in time for this election? Thirty days ago I was living in an Airbnb because we didn't have possession of our house yet.

I'm so angry.",07Aug2018,3
71,"As a girl I have never in my life graded someone by numbers due to their looks. It’s very bizarre to me that guys do this on a daily basis or that that is their first reaction to meeting a woman. “Oh she’s a 6.” It must be something automatic, like a classification factor, but it’s just super weird to me.  
  
Is it cause guys can’t relate to girls on like an emotional level? I always classify guys by how well I get along with them. “That guy and I get along well, so I like him.” Then again, I am like a 5 on the scale and have never had deep interest in looking beautiful.  
  
What about all the guys that marry 4s or 5s? Are they unhappy? Wtf.

76,"I'm a 38 year old guy and I've become so obsessed with having the body of a 20 something that I can't enjoy my life. I'm constantly dissatisfied with my body. I scrutinize myself constantly both in the mirror and by taking photos, and I compare myself to other guys I see online (often doing that split photo thing). I exercise and run frequently, but if I have to miss a day, I go into a near panic. Recently I hurt both knees (possibly due to bad form while working out) and so there's a real risk I won't be able to work out any time soon. It's like I feel my gut expanding right now.   


Mainly I just think about this stuff constantly. I'm constantly aware of my stomach. But I know I don't have a gut, and that I'm probably in better shape than most people. But every time I see myself in the mirror or in a photo I just see a pasty melting marshmallow. ",07Aug2018,1
