Recently we decided to try video chat. He was being his usual silly self but was doing things like dancing on the camera and playing with a stuffed toy (he was kissing and snuggling with it... saying ""my bear"") while it was funny/amusing... I can't help but wonder if it's somehow a flirty/interest thing

I'm not very experienced with guys so I've no idea. He has said before that most people don't see this goofy side of him, normally he is quiet and reserved.... so would this silly behavior just be some thing guys normally do if they are bored or something or is it likely something more?

1,"Here's the email he sent everyone before taking pills:

*""Write something, even if it's just a suicide note."" So that's what I'm doing: writing a suicide note. 

My heart aches. Everything hurts like hell, and yet I could not get help. The blame goes to my parents. I told them I was depressed. They didn't care enough. No, they didn't care at all. They didn't think to worry about my feelings. They got frustrated at me for interrupting their lives. Perhaps they though I was better off dead, that maybe they could enjoy life then. 

And now, I get to the meat of the matter. r/enfpcorn, I love you. What I feel for you is unique-I've never truly felt love for anyone, whether it be my parents or my siblings or my friends, before. And so I didn't know how to express it. I don't know whether it is my fault, or yours. The blame must partially go to you, because I cannot control the chemicals that made me love you. Fucking chemicals. At first, it was a wonderful feeling, seeing you smile or laugh or even swear at me. Haha. Then I realized you didn't love me. The happiness turned to despair. Whenever I saw you, you yanked me back into the same depression. Yet, I couldn't stop myself from looking for you, because the absence of you hurt. Seeing you was worse-seeing you happy without me, not knowing what pain your rejection has given me. I hate loving you. I hate my brain for making me love you. I'll take care of it soon. I hate you. I love you. I don't know whether to wish you a happy life or hope you rot in hell. 

I wish I believed in a god and an afterlife so that I could watch you after my death, and see if you mourned me. But I don't. This cruel world doesn't deserve me.*

I feel so guilty. I always thought of him as a friend, nothing more. I wanted him to find the right person, and I knew it wasn't me. He had such a bright future-he was incredibly smart, incredibly gifted, and was supposed to go to JHU next year. And he threw away his life because he loved me. He always told me I was the only person I ever cared about. The thing is, I could never return what he felt for me. He threw away his life because of it...",15Apr2018,46
2,"I keep telling myself that I only have to live with my parents for one more year, and then my life will be better. They’re not “overprotective”, because they’re not doing these things to help me; they just want something to control and manipulate. I’ve survived 17 years of this, but it feels like it gets worse every day. They’ve scared all my friends away. I can’t leave the house except to go to school and work. They go through my room and my backpack multiple times a day. They’ve broken and thrown away my things. They unlock the door when I’m in the bathroom. I have diagnosed health problems that they blatantly ignore or claim I’m making up. They come into my room while I’m changing. They check my grades obsessively. They tell me that I’m pathetic for not being on any teams or in any clubs, and then when I do join a club they mock me and all the students in it. They tell me that I’m never going to amount to anything, and then they wonder why I have no motivation. I’ve talked to police and social workers and therapists, and none of them have been able to help me. When I finally found a therapist who believed me, my parents immediately stopped scheduling my appointments with her. I don’t want to give up after making it this far, but each day feels like a year, and it’s getting harder and harder to have hope. ",15Apr2018,180

4,"I'm from New Zealand originally. In 2012 I moved to Australia because I didn't get into the university course I wanted. I moved to Northern Victoria where I had once lived, And couldn't find work. 

I moved to the big city (Melbourne) and worked Kitchenhand jobs until eventually the kitchen I was working in hired me as an apprentice chef. I wasn't interested in becoming a chef, But Chefs work long as fuck hours and I wanted to save up to go and see the world. 

I traveled until I fell in love with the country of Viet Nam, and found a awesome job helping out at a beach resort. I worked with the owner and General manager, A belguim dude, and together we made the place REALLY popular. I worked first in customer entertainment; I designed a nightly program of thing to do, drinking games, movie nights etc. Then I helped out with the marketing: I got them on social media, Insagram, Facebook marketing etc etc. I designed some wicked cool teeshirts. 

The old GM left, and they promoted me to be in charge of the place. Sure, the work was hard and the pay wasn't super much, enough to survive and maybe save a couple hundred a month, but the weather was fine and I had lots of friends. I was living the dream. 

Eventually I left, I made the place really popular and my boss wasn't interested in paying me more. Which really sucked. I would have stayed there forever If I could have been saving a little bit more. 

I figured I could take the skills I learned and apply them elsewhere. 

My wonderful girlfriend and I were offered the opportunity of buying a beach bar, we really wanted to do it! But we didnt quite have the money. So we figured the best idea would be to head back to Australia and look for work. 

I've been applying for jobs within Tourism Hospitality, Because I love that industry and I'm good at it. It's what I want to do with my life...But I've only had one interview in the month I've been here and I didn't hear back (I thought it went really well). 

My old kitchen gave me a shift, And said I could work there more if I wanted too. But the truth is after working a job that I loved...going back into the kitchen SUCKED. The boss is a real prick and abuses the staff. He paid me $18AUD an hour but made the point of saing his wife wanted to pay me less...Like...Why even mention it?


My girlfriend is still abroard, The plan was for me to go to Melbourne, Find a job, Get stable. And then she'd come over. Because she can only get a Visa for one year. 

I'm failing to find work, I'm depressed, I feel like I had it so good previously that I'm going to be miserable going back to the grind. But she's depending on me to find work. I just feel so lost. ",15Apr2018,2

And yet all I can think about is my ex.  It's like some terrible curse.  Not an hour goes by that I don't think about her and the times we spent together in out 3 years as a couple.

We have always lived in apartments and as you know pit bulls are a big no go in almost every complex. We have had people dog sit for us but everyone has bailed on us cause they are basically taking care of him for free and they get tired of him after awhile cause he likes ripping things up or digging thru trash (like any other dog) but since he’s a guest of course they don’t like him doing that. So we stress all the time about this dog and recently we brought him to my new apartment only to get fined $300 since the maintenance man saw him and snitched us out. I am so frustrated since we don’t have the money to pay for the fine let alone keep the dog. I have begged and begged my boyfriend to get rid of him or give him away to someone who can take care of him but he won’t budge. I’m so tired of this ongoing fights cause that isn’t even the worst part, I am the one stuck taking care of him. I pick up his poop and feed him, I take him on walks and clean up after him when he has an accident inside. (Keep in mind this is my bfs dog like I didn’t even want him in the 1st place because I knew we couldn’t afford a dog. )My bf swears he does his share of the work but I proved him wrong when I told him I would pick up the poop and leave the bags of poop for him to throw in the big dumpster. Only to see that my bf just lets the bags of poop pile up and I eventually end up throwing them away because it’s disgusting, I don’t know what to do I have had enough of all this unnecessary stress.",15Apr2018,4

12,"So I am asking about how to stop being pissed. The story starts like this:

- I have been 5 years in this desk job. Long story short, somehow several workers my age left me out several times for together outings. That happened already several years ago, thats why I am not close to them in general.

-  one worker was asked to teach four of us pricing. Eventually, that worker only taught two of us, cuz he is closer to those people. So whatever, no big deal.

- that worker gives us extra work to help him, like folding papers or gluing. It is good to help each other, not like that simple stuff bothers our regular work. Ok, no big deal. But i noticed he never asked me direclty or even talked to me or mentioned my name. He only asked someone else why they did not share the workload with me. That other person only said I seemed busy doing something. I overheard it, no way i didnt hear. I just thought ""why dont you ask it yourself?"" i didnt say a thing cuz he didnt even bother talking to me.

- somehow there is this bitch senior worker sitting behind me who is not even my boss in any way and our work is never related to one another, maybe she saw i never initiated to help gluing or folding and she saw other two people doing it and she offered to help them, she took the paper load on my desk without even saying a thing as well!! No insturction, no hi, no calling my name, no looking at my face, just placed it right there. Annoyed, ok whatever, i did it anyway. 

- Then someday folding again, someone next to me just placed it on my desk. My boss asked that guy why the folding was not given to the production dept, he said so its done faster cuz production dept was busy doing other things. Anyway so i asked the guy who gave this work to all of us wtf to do (altho it looked obvious, but i just asked so he would talk to me and not expect me do just cuz they throw work on my desk without acknoweldging my existence). 

- i took two days off. The next day, paper load was on my desk to be glued. I saw the cabinet, there was done /glued paper on top while there was a special undone one for me to do. I was pissed, cuz its work they asked for help, not my job, and NOBODY bothered talking to me asking for help or anything. Just placing it there. So i asked someone next to me who placed it there, she is younger, she only said it was distributed to everyone. Now, if the point of this work is to finish faster than giving to the Production dept, why waited for my 2 days off and made sure i did it instead of they finish it without me?

- Another day, bithc senior worker got called to do a report about something. It was related to several customers, one of them was mine. But she faced her face to these two other coworkers and i sat the opposite direction, and she just purposely said what to do in a loud voice while made sure to never look at me, mention me or anything. If i didnt hear it, i rpobably wouldnt know i would have to do anything. LIke, wtf , why cant she be like ""ok chakchakdrop, its your customer too, so you guys have to do x, x x,x"" nope. She just got the phone, and went to those guys and said things out loud. So after she was done, i asked her again, ""what to do?"" so she could at least look at my face while saying it. And on that day, i did what was told, but it was already 5pm to go home, other worker was not yet done doing it, and she had to give the report to the big manager, she sent that, i thought my job was done and i hated them anyway, so i went home. Not like anyone asked me to stay or anything. If i liked them, maybe it would be just expected for me to stay with them til its all confirmed to be OK. Anyway, that day they ended up staying til 7 pm and i went home already at 5pm. I bet that made her hate me more. Then next day below.

- Then i was already depressed at work cuz i virtually talked to no one already. And i started feeling very ocastraized. Then i dreaded going to work and finally did one mistake that day. The mistake: a younger got asked by boss through text about my customer and i was already planning to leave work midday that day, and i didnt help her find the archieve cuz i thought ""yea cant be bothered. im leaving anyway and i hate you all"". Anyway this bitch senior worker sitting next to me came out and get me. She spoke loudly ""I cant take it anymore. even her job she doesnt want to do. What do you think i tell this to boss? Seriously i cant take it anymore""says her to someone else. Then she repeated the question if she should tell boss about it. Iono wtf her personal problem with me, she said that just to make sure i heard while she never ever talked to me . So passive agressive and kinda declared a war that she doesnt like me.

- Then a few days later after boss back to office, i told her i wanted to be transfered. And couldn't help but sobbing while telling about it.  Boss told me to calm down, then several days later we had a meeting talking about it and i told her everything, and she told me to rethink so it wont become something i regret cuz i didnt have a job lined up.

- Long story short, i have decided to quit still to marry to my bf overseas. of which the process i have started. 


TLDR: coworkers stopped talking to me. Ocstrazied me. But when given work (not mandatory work, they asked for help) they just placed them on my desk without saying a thing to me or looking at me, as if i didnt exist. I stopped initiating more, that made one bitch senior worker hated me more, more than she strangely already did. She then attacked me indirectly verbally and that pushed my button to ask my big boss to transfer me to another dept. I cried . But now im quitting.

the question/advice i need:.... i hate it so much that the bitch senior gets what she wants now that im quitting. She gets what she wants to get rid of me. How to find peace with it and how should i behave at work now that im quitting and work there for a month still?",15Apr2018,1
13,"I've been depressed (more or less continually) for a few years now (only diagnosed recently). I've never gone for help despite my doctor's wishes, bc the way I've worked through the really rough patches has been music. The more depressed I get, the better the music I make (at least I feel). For this reason I've avoided help, despite my further deteriorating mental health, both in the moment and over the course of the last few years. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

15,"I was driving home today, and it was raining fairly hard outside. As I came around a turn not too far from my street, I saw a young woman walking alongside the road. She was carrying a bag and didn't have an umbrella,  jacket, or anything else to shield her from the rain. I was good half mile from any houses or buildings, so she had to have been out in the rain for a decent amount of time and would still have to walk a ways further.

I immediately thought to stop and ask her if she needed a ride home or where ever she was going. I wasn't going very fast and had a good 20 seconds or so to think before I passed her. I don't know why, but for some reason I just kept driving. I didn't have any good reason to ignore her. There wasn't anywhere I needed to be or anything I needed to do; it was still early in the afternoon, and I was just heading home to relax the rest of the day. I had nothing to fear, I'm a middle aged male and this is a very safe area. I didn't even have to give her a ride. I had an umbrella in the car that I could have given her. I didn't need it at the time and had plenty more back home. I wouldn't miss it. But I couldn't even be bothered to do that.

I pretty much immediately regretted it after passing her, and it's been eating at the back of my mind for the rest of the day. I knew what the right thing to do was, but I'm such a lazy selfish ass that I couldn't be bothered to take a few minutes to help out someone clearly in need. I have no idea who this person was, so I can't even tell them I'm sorry or make it up to them somehow.

Normally I would keep rebutting his commentary but tonight I didn't. I just put down the phone, let out a sigh and breathed in a deep breath and though 'I am not responding to this anymore'.

I feel guilty because he will probably think I am ignoring him or he might not think anything of me at all, who knows. 

The point I am trying to make is that we get to decide when and when not to respond, we don't get to decide how we feel about it though.

This is great in real life as I have a wide variety of experiences and can relate to many people. On social media, this is just maddening. I can't create any kind of cohesive ""sense of self"" when it comes to Instagram or Twitter. Facebook is a bit easier because I basically only post clean cut stuff. On Instagram and Twitter I feel there is more room for self-expression, and with this freedom, I find anxiety. I will post something more provocative or edgy one day when I'm feeling that way, and then later worry about how it's perceived when I'm feeling milder. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this, and if so, what you did about it. Should I just delete social media entirely?

28,"This wasn't on reddit, so admins can stop caring immediately beyond lessons learned. Mods for NSFW reddits probably already know this, but listen up anyway.

Its easy to spot most illegal porn. Obvious child stuff is taken down so damn fast, and I want to say 9 out of 10 times I saw an animal in the thumbnail, it was beastiality.

But you know what surprised me? How well developed some teenagers can be.

The poster in question would post basically the kind of stuff you see on /r/gonewild. Nothing too crazy. Just regular nude selfies. Pretty innocent, and she looked hot. Most importantly, she looked above 18.

Nobody would have ever thought differently until a mod received a PM from a friend of the poster. She said she was underage, and only posting because her family life was rough and the attention made her feel better. Obviously, we took it seriously, but had no further proof beyond a PM.

So it was brought up in the chat, and we all set about scouring her profile for hints. I took it a step further and essentially doxxed her. Found a youtube channel with the same user name, and a video of her at a middle school lunch table.

She was 14. fourteen years old by her own video admission on this channel, but also had an extremely well developed body. Like puberty happened overnight and turned her into a 21 year old.

Needless to say, we scrubbed her submissions, and I am pretty sure all of us checked our own personal stashes of porn to make sure we didn't save any of her stuff.I still feel filthy remembering some of the things I thought about a young teenager.

But what disturbed me the most, was the realization we haven't a clue how old most of our posters were. Obviously, MILFs and GILFS are legal aged. But if you have ever enjoyed ""teen porn"", there is a good chance at least one naked body was underage. Sure, we could verify and privately hunt down social media profiles to determine if they are legal, but not all of them are self uploads. so searching the username might only turn up a guy sharing his favorites (or catfishing).

Again, I was a moderator on a small forum. Managing a much bigger website where the content curators cannot keep pace with the uploads? 

They can't be sure everyone posting is above 18, thus they put that responsibility on the user. Read the terms of service for your favorite site, and you'll see what I mean. Lots of ""takes no responsibilities""

So today was my 19th birthday and I was really looking forward to celebrating this day with my girlfriend, family and my piano teacher who is one of our close familyfriends. We had arranged a get\-together where everything was cozy and ""hygge"", as we say here in Denmark. Then somehow we ended up talking about politics. I was aware that my father has some right\-wing populistic opinions when it comes to Arabs because he had had a couple of unpleasant experiences with Arabs in his shop. Anyway, my father began discussing Arabs and exclaimed how he thought that ALL Arabs should be deported and sent straight back to Iraq and Syria where they ought to fight for their land \- finishing of by saying that he really hates Arabs. As if that wasn't enought, my mom and piano teacher were just approving of his hateful racist comments, even though they themselves are part of a Polish minority in Denmark \(It has become a common viewpoint in Denmark that Poles have come to the country to work illegally or to steal bicycles\). My girlfriend and I protested by saying that deporting a whole ethnic group is just ridiculous and incredibly narrow\-minded. It really made my father's face flush when we said how it would obviously violate the United Nations Declarations of Human Rights and multiple other political conventions, and that it would be a much better idea to ensure that all foreigners become integrated in the local communities across the country. He dismissed everything we said by stating that the United Nations Declarations of Human Rights is no longer suited for today's world and needs a couple of changes and my mom just went along with what he was saying. I just couldn't believe that my parents had sunk so low and I was extremely embarrased that parents had been so ignorant and unpleasant in front of my girlfriend. Now, I'm just trying wrap my head around my parents' appalling views \- I really thought better of them. What the hell has the world come to? \[Sorry if my English was bad in any way. Was writing this in a rush\].

\(TL;DR: At a family get\-together with my girlfriend, my parents began talking about how ALL Arabs should be sent back to the Middle East \- and they acted like complete jerks\)

I just felt like I had to get this of my chest.",15Apr2018,1
40,"One moment they are posting about paranormal shit the other day they are like ""lol you can't post that shit here we are too cool for that we are totally not scared of the possibility."" Sigh. 


Seriously that's my view of these sorts of things I am simply open to the possibility not a religious nut or anything.

42,"Way below you can find out a little more about me, and what my life is like at the moment. It's a post I've made before in this and other subs. I'm going to ask for something different in the beginning this time though.

I've written upwards of 45,000 words for my alternative history novel, I have plenty of it mapped out from beginning to middle to end. I know the characters pretty well. I know what's going to happen for the most part to all of them and I know the format I want the chapters to take. I'm seeking a buddy who maybe would let me bounce ideas off them, help make suggestions to me for where to go with the scenes I'm stuck on. You don't have to be a writer although that would surely help, but, just have a wild imagination and a love for time travel, science fiction and history. Interest in US history would be a plus. 

The premise: A group of acquaintances who get tangled in criminal activity and in order to get out, one by one they each start faking their deaths. I'm using it as a vehicle to talk about the ugliness that is the child sex trade, something I've been passionate about raising awareness of for a long time. It's also very sci fi. Futuristic with lots of time travel and space travel.

The main character wants to be a writer, (like me haha) so he starts interviewing people to get ideas for a story. He finds this one guy to talk to who is about to be executed for treason, and the inmate leads the main character to important information that proves the government is involved in the sex trade. The inmate got framed for trying to expose the information himself and that's why he's on death row.

Where US History factors in is in the info that the inmate provides. Turns out he has a couple of journals dating back to US President Gerald Ford, and before that a white house servant from the Madison administration in early 1800s. It also touches on a lot of other eras and historical figures, like Alexander the Great, prehistoric Mesopotamia, ancient Greece and Rome, the US Civil War and Revolution, WWI and Nazi Germany etc.

My overall goal would be to turn it all into a graphic novel series focusing on the journal of Gerald Ford. Each issue would focus on a different presidential administration, and cover events concerning sex crimes that happen under their watch. Since it's alternate history I make several changes as well, like Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun and Barry Goldwater all becoming presidents, MLK Jr. And JFK surviving assassination attempts, astronaut Sally Ride becoming Vice President and so on.

Any writers or artists willing to chat? Or anyone really.

That being said. Back to my original post.

Sitting in a physical rehab hospital healing some gnarly wounds, bored out of my brain, feeling mentally exhausted and a little alone. Okay, a lot. I'll probably be up late again like always. Wanna burn that midnight oil with me?

There, now that I have totally reeled you in with my extremely awesome positivity, wanna get to know more about me?

Wrestling fan, lover of horror and sci-fi, traveling, camping, the supernatural (like ghosts. I haven't seen the show), comics, super heroes and villains, astrology, Snickers bars and large cats. I'm a soon to be published writer if I can make a June deadline to have my first draft done by then.

I'm strange in the sense that, my favorite James Bond was the one nobody remembers because he was only in one film: George Lazenby; My favorite US President is the one no one remembers because he died 30 days into office: William Henry Harrison; my favorite character from Armageddon is the one no one remembers because he only had about four lines before he died: Noonan; and my favorite Doctor of the reboot is the least popular and most underrated because he only lasted one season: Nine.

Do you get so psyched about planning your next Halloween costume a year in advance? Do black and white movies and classic rock bands thrill you? Does the thought of road tripping across North America or backpacking through Europe and Asia excite you? Jackpot! Also, I'm incredibly fond of greasy junk food and cuddles, though not necessarily at the same time.

I'm a nerd. Not the genius, useful type who can fix your computer or tutor you to prep for your trigonometry mid-term. I'm the the fun kind who reads plays video games (crappily), writes fanfiction, watches Firefly, cult films, chick flicks, slasher movies, is obsessed with time travel, the paranormal and has a major brain boner for history, most notably the US Civil War but many other places and periods as well.

We can talk about where we both live/have lived, where we want to go, what we want to see and do.

We can talk about writing, maybe be accountability buddies to keep on each other every day to be creative. I could really use someone like that, because I am nowhere near as productive as I'd like to be at the moment. As you read this I'm probably (or at least intend to be) trying to focus on some historical research for a huge deadline that I'm way behind on, so I should be pulling an all nighter. Keep me company maybe? If you like cartoons, beards or tattoos, yasss! If you like awkward introverts, even better!

Also, if you can help me start learning Irish Gaelic, or wanna learn it together I'll love you forever.

Also, if you need to vent, I'm a great listener, too.

44,"just some background, I am not an alcoholic but well on my way to becoming one. I abuse alcohol and do not give it the respect it demands. My life is starting falling apart because of it and I do not like the person I become when I drink.

I have a family history of alcoholism and exhibit all the behaviors of someone who is prone to it.

I am quitting until I can get a grasp on who I am, my issues and until I can trust myself to handle it appropriately. If that is indefinitely I can accept that. 

Any advice, questions or if you would like to join me feel free to drop a comment.",15Apr2018,6
