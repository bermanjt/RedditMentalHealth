He doesn’t even want dinner. I don’t know what made him this way and I’m beginning to think of the worse. I’m afraid he got laid off, again. I’m afraid he’s ashamed that he found out I’m on a dating app that his coworkers could have found me on or that I drink. I’m afraid something happened that won’t be fixable. I don’t know what to do and the way he’s acting it makes me think it’s something I did wrong.

I have been with my boyfriend for almost three amazing years, he is the most amazing person on the entire planet, and I love him so much. He’s been inviting me to his family functions for the past years, and every single time I had made an excuse not to go. I am severely overweight, but he is not. I am afraid that if I do you go to family functions, his family will judge me and wonder why he could be with someone like me. Someone fat and unattractive. I’m tired of making up excuses as to why I can”t go over his house. This holiday his family is expecting me, and I don’t know how to break free from my anxiety and just go! Please help Reddit.

3,"So I’ve decided to quit my job and I already put my two weeks in. My last day is the 28th and I’m realizing that change can be hard. I haven’t worked at my current job long (less than 6 months) but it’s very taxing on me imo. I have little time to do what I want to do, I feel unmotivated to even do what I want to do (which is definitely a “me” problem considering that I know that I don’t always have to “feel” like doing something before I do it but hoo boy does it make life easier), my body physically hurts from the work that I’m doing (I wake up some days and my hands feel swollen), the coworkers have terrible outlooks on life which is very draining.

I want to pursue my goals and dreams and stuff but I feel like this job is holding me back. However it’s still kind of scary seeing as though in a little over a week I’ll be unemployed. I’m 23 and just in an odd point in my life.",19Dec2018,1

5,"I've been going through a bit lately, as a result my room has become more and more cluttered and messy and today I finally decided to sort it out. I cleaned everything up, tidied up and got everything looking neat but for some reason I felt like I needed to do more. I have a bunch of art. Pieces and other stuff that I've hanging in my walls and I felt like I needed to get rid of them. Not because they were untidy of anything, there was. Just something inside that made me feel like I need to get rid of all of it. I started taking them down one by one and idk why but it hurt me a bit on the inside. I can understand some of it might seem a bit childish (a Star Wars poster and batarang shaped wall lamp). I'm 23, but still they always felt like they were part of me. It's almost as if they represented bits and pieces of who I am and of the goals I hoped to achieve. Most of the stuff is down now and my walls are bare. I feel like by taking them down and getting rid of them I'm giving up on those goals and ideas that I treasured. On the other hand I feel like I need to do this to move forward but at the same time I don't want to forgot who I am and lose all of those hopes and dreams I had when I was younger.",19Dec2018,1
6,"I spent the better much of 2018 obsessing about a guy I met in Feb 100% convinced we were meant to be but I couldn't do anything about it due to the status quo. 

The feelings I had for him didn't make sense and I felt like I was losing my mind.  For months I had a literal hole in my stomach, nausea and barely could sleep and all I did was think about him. Sometimes I would cry over how terrible the feeling was. 

A month ago I started having chest and back pains and saw a doctor about it, she suspected liver and gallbladder problems and I was advised to stop drinking coffee until after my ultrasound because I did drink 4 cups a day and black. 

By the time my ultrasound came around I was feeling so much better and there was no inflammation in my chest anymore. 

After that I stopped drinking coffee altogether and didn't have a cup until a few days ago and then the sickness started immediately of nausea and the feeling of a hole in my stomach; then gradually the chest and back pain. 

It is only now that I did not connect the feeling to the guy I like but rather to the more logical explanation that I might be allergic to coffee.

TLDR I spent this year convinced I was lovesick turns out I am just allergic to coffee.

8,"Some background: I’m the eldest brother at the age of 17 in a decently large family. I don’t have any sisters so it’s just me, my mum, my stepdad, and my 5 brothers.


Out of my 5 brothers there is one that I’m worried about, my 10 year old brother who’s close to going to high school. A few years back he began falling behind heavily in school and showed no signs of advancing from year 3 onward and his voice has remained in a higher pitch than most boys, which has caused us to put him in speech therapy. While his other friends grew up he kind of got left behind causing his friends to leave him, making him an outcast in his class. He got diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum. He is currently in his final months of primary school meaning he is going to high school next September, and I am worried about him. 


He’s a small kid, He’s short and incredibly skinny. And I’m worried that in high school he isn’t going to manage. Academically he is years behind most kids his age and physically he can’t defend himself. I was bullied when I first started high school but I was able to overcome it, I fear he won’t be able to. I just want the best for him and I want to try and give him anything that will make it a little bit easier for him in the years to come, but I don’t know how. 


Personality wise he’s one of the most ignorant people I know and will actively ignore you if you say anything that he slightly disagrees with. He’s prone to temper tantrums and has developed a habit of raising his voice at other kids. 


The fact that I haven’t been able to help him and just be a bystander all these years has made me feel like a failure of a brother. I’m sorry if it’s all badly written but I just needed to vent as I’ve bottled this up for a few months. If anyone could offer some advice I’d appreciate it.",19Dec2018,1

17,"I have worked 30-35 hours a week and taken 17 credits for the last three months. My GPA this semester was a 3.4. I have had two weekdays off since June - one of which was my commencement.

Two weeks ago, in a class where I was the only nonasian and only undergraduate (accompanied by four masters students and three phd students), I gave my presentation on my half-semester long project to the class FIRST and aced the class.

I have been full-time at school for 11 of the 13 semesters I've been enrolled in college, and I was working full-time for the other 2. Since the day I graduated high school, I have worked at least 20 hours/week during all semesters.

I have failed and retaken two classes. One of my degrees is in math - which I achieved despite getting a D in Calc I the first time.

I have had my ex-boyfriend of five years cheat on me and then leave me for a girl who ""had more time for him"" (despite my constant efforts to spend time with him and his pushing me away). I sought help from a therapist to deal with the aftermath.

I found an amazing guy - on Tinder, of all places - who made me food and helped me with chores the last three months while I desperately attempted to finish school.

I dealt with my parents sending each other explicative-laced emails and texts, despite me being 20 years old and them having no reason to speak to eachother anymore.

I moved on-campus freshman year at my university where I went in blind and knew absolutely no one from that city or anywhere around. I found an apartment situation with (initially) strangers for roommates on my own at 19, and lived there until earlier this year when I could afford to live on my own (22 now).

I drove for Uber to make extra money throughout school.

I started an extracurricular club in my sophomore year that had 20 steady members at the time of graduation.

I have a full-time, salaried, short-term incentive (i.e. bonus) eligible job. My last exam was Friday 12/14, and I started Monday 12/17.

18,"Not all at once. It started with ""Let's take a break. I feel like I need to focus on myself and I'd be a better best friend than girlfriend to you right now.""

So I went along with it and we went from texting each other constantly to maybe a couple times a day. And she would only reply to certain texts.

So I decided to do the same and go a day without replying to her at all. Then I get a text from her that she feels bad that I want a relationship and she doesn't.

I told her it was okay and she never replied. A day later I told her I missed her. 2 days after that I asked if she'll stop talking to me for good. It has been a week since then with no word from her. 

I would have appreciated a ""hey this break thing isn't working out, bye!"" But now I just don't know what's going on. Are we done? Does she just want some space for awhile?

Anyway, it just sucks to go from texting all day to nothing at all. Also, it was a long distance relationship, but she flew out here every couple of months. Plus right before the break thing she was supposed to move here because she had a job lined up, but she didn't want to miss one last christmas with her family (totally understandable). The employer did not want to wait another month and went with another candidate.

19,"Typing this to vent.

I am a 25 y/o male that has never had any meaningful romantic relationships.

I was diagnosed with Apergers and became a late bloomer. I was very anti social until rather recently when I decided to grow up and mature.

I have always longed for a romantic relationship but every single time I have tried, I get somewhat close to something and then fucking nothing.

This year I have been ghosted by two girls we started off somewhat nicely and now disappeared.

Im fucking sick of this.

I always feel I am trying to improve and be more mature, trying to take better care of myself and understand that not everything in life is love and sex but it isn't enough. Every time I fall for someone and it falls apart its slightly worse than the last time.

I feel that all my effort is for nothing. I will never be loved. I will die a bitter old man resenting the fact that I never got a loving relationship.

At this point I am close to an emotional breakdown. I haven't ever been in a major depression or considered suicide, but I am afraid that if this sequence of unlucky strings carry on, I might fall into a depression and end up harming myself.

I used to suffer from dysthymia which is a chronic type of depression, and I dont want it back. But this string of rejections might take me back there.

I graduated from college Saturday and she refused to attend the ceremony. We got into a huge argument about it. She blocked my phone number and my dad said not to worry, she’ll probably unblock it when she’s over this phase.

28,"My son got sent to the hospital for a fever and possible appendicitis. His mom text me, she only said they are at the hospital because his appendix hurt and had blood drawn and he had been there for several hours. I thought maybe his appendix burst or a myriad of problems that came to mind because parents tend to worry when you tell them their kid is in the hospital. I headed over shortly after to meet them.        

As I was walking in, a paramedic was walking around doing whatever, I didn't care, I was looking for my kid. Who has time to care of others when your child is in the ER? Anyways, it's a fairly narrow walking area with curtains on 1 side and a wall on the other. He had more than enough room to allow both of us to walk past each other. He decided he's going to walk in the middle, and push me to the side. I'm not going to let that happen, especially when I'm worried of my kid. So I decide I will stand my ground and not scrunch to the side just so he can walk in the middle, and I was willing to bump shoulders if he kept it up. We pass and he moves over the proper amount that you'd expect any average intelligence, average person to do.           

My ex works with paramedics so she probably knows them all and is friends with them. I don't care, I stopped having to care as soon as we broke up. They are not my friends, they are her friends. They are strangers to me.       

I get to the room they are waiting in and it turns out my kid is OK.           

I mention that the paramedic was being a dick and was going to try walk into me. Right away she goes into the gaslighting. I'm wrong, he's a paramedic, he has the right of way, what if his patient was choking, he's got a job to do etc etc. This backwards logic had me stunned, I couldn't logically think why it was wrong what she said to me, but in my gut, I knew she was in the wrong and probably just siding with her friends.         

I thought about it all evening and I've come to the conclusion of why she was wrong. My kid was hurt and I was going to see him. Ask any parent ""what would you do if someone was trying to stop you from helping your child who is possibly hurt?"" They'd tell you they would do anything. I doubt he'd be willing fight me to the death just to help some stranger because it's in his job description, because I would fight him to the death if he got in the way of my hurt child and I. Any proper parent would say the same thing.       

To boil it down, she was saying his job was more important than me seeing my kid who I thought could be hurt and in pain. As I said, I was so stunned that I could articulate why that was flawed logic. It was so backwards that it brained my damage.             

---------------------------------             

Different story, but still involving her paramedic friends:           

My child had blood drawn and an IV. They removed the IV. He had never had an IV or blood drawn since he could remember. So the bandages were a new thing to him.          

Ex's paramedic friend comes in to chat.       

For some reason, the nurse, doctor and my ex were stuck on the idea that he didn't want to move his arm because of the bandages, that they thought that he thought he couldn't move his arms or his bandages will fall off or something. But actually, he was trying to figure out how he was going to put on his jacket without accidently ripping his bandages off.       

I could see this, and tell him that I will help with the jacket. The paramedic butts in and says ""oh, he's fine, he can move his arm"" I said ""no, he's worried that he'll rip the bandages off in his sleeves"". What I should have said was ""mind your own fucking business, this is my kid, I will decide how to handle this"".        

Can someone explain this logic?",19Dec2018,1

It made me so happy and filled me with so much hope. Over the course of the next week, we admitted that we both still had incredibly strong feelings for each other and that we neither of us wanted to be completely out the other's lives, so we decided to slowly reintroduce each other and try to have non-couple interactions that didn't have the same problems we had when we were together. It wasn't the smoothest ride ever, but it was so amazing to have her back, even if we weren't a couple. We kinda struggled to figure out where the middle ground was between friend and partner, and due to our mutual attraction and immense care for each other wound up in a state was pretty close to basically just being a couple again. We were both holding on to hope that we could heal, start over, and be together again. Like, *really* together. This goes on for about 3 months. There were issues but nothing awful. Then, four days ago, there was an incident that made me feel like we were right back at square 1. It dug up old traumas and left me hurt, confused, and scared. We agreed that we needed a bit of distance, and not to speak to each other until after our upcoming therapist appointments, which were scheduled for the same day. Barring last week, I hadn't been to therapy in a year, despite 2018 being the time in my life I needed it the most. Today after 3 agonizing days of contemplation, of heartache, of being at absolute war with myself, I told her that I didn't think it was healthy for us to continue spending time together anymore. I knew that if I told her in person and saw her crying and begging, I would crumble and give her whatever she wanted, regardless of what it might mean for me. Anything to see happiness in those beautiful eyes that I loved *so fucking much*. This realization only confirmed why I needed to do this. Throughout our time together I've sought her wellbeing even at the expense of my own. So, because I didn't want to put myself in a situation where my willpower would fail me, I decided to do it over the phone in spite of my distaste for that. I tried to call, but I was crying a lot and trembling a bit so using my voice was almost impossible. She eventually text me, and so I texted her back. What followed is now competing for the worst experience of my life. For almost an hour, she cried, and begged, and groveled, and said she'd never love anyone but me. That she'd never be happy without me. Just like she did in July. I would rather have the skin slowly torn from my body than have to hear that again. I knew I was causing her pain, and it made me sick. It made me feel like a lower than dirt piece of human garbage. I've always had a special kind of anger reserved for anyone that hurt her, and now that scumbag was me. I came *so close* to taking it all back, to telling her that I would stay with her and care for her and protect her and that we could have a life together, but by some miracle I stuck with my decision. I've only ever cried like that twice in my life before, and both other times were over her. I feel like utter shit, and I'm so fucking worried about her that I'm losing my mind. She almost killed herself in the summer right after we broke up, and this was shaping up to be worse than that for both of us. Its like there's a raging beast inside of me screaming to go drive to her apartment and take it all back and fall crying into her arms. I can't stop thinking about every cherished memory I have with her and how enmeshed she's been in my heart. I don't know what to do with myself. I'm a wreck. My mental state has been shit even before all this and now I'm wondering if I'll ever care about someone as much as I care about her.

Anyone been through something like this?

34,"Being around my mum always puts me in a bad mood. Sometimes she is objectively annoying – I see other people being equally irritated as me towards her behaviour (I’m not going to specify what behaviour cause that’s not really the point), like my sis and dad and her friends, but for some reason they can still tolerate her and even enjoy spending time with her otherwise while I just can’t. I can’t remember the last time we went out for dinner together or did something together alone and we were both happy about it. Even when she’s trying to be nice and understanding, and I get where she’s coming from, but I just don’t, I just can’t stand her

I had a theory that it was because of the way I grew up. My mum is the one who raised me as an only child. Our personalities have always clashed. We didn’t understand each other and we were never interested in the same things. But I was always expected to listen to what she had to say, even if it was completely irrelevant to me or she had told me the same thing over and over already. I wasn’t allowed to feel tired or like I wanted to be alone or didn’t want to talk, because I had to ‘learn to be sociable’ even if that meant sitting and staring into space blankly while she talked about something completely uninteresting for hours. I’ve been conditioned to always be focusing on her and what she’s saying whenever she’s around, and it’s exhausting. It also doesn’t really help that I developed depression and anxiety during my teenage years and she didn’t understand it and thought my lethargy and irritability was because I was being lazy or anti-social or disrespectful. For these reasons, I feel like I hold a lot of resentment towards her that I can’t release because if I tried talking about this with her she wouldn’t understand and couldn’t accept it.

My mental health improved when I moved away to another country. My depression basically disappeared. For once I felt free and like I wasn’t being stifled. During this time, my mum and I rarely talked except for some texts and maybe a monthly phone call, and it gave me the space to get out of the I-hate-my-mum-she-sucks-unconditionally juvenile headspace and start trying to understand and be kind to her. I managed to tell her ‘I love you’ over the phone once, which I haven’t said since I was like 7, and I was happy and she was happy. I thought I had matured. Now, though, I’m back to visit for Christmas and it’s all gone downhill again. It’s so hard for me to think of her positively while I’m actually around her even if she did nothing wrong.

She doesn’t deserve it. She deserves a child who likes and understands her, who will go out shopping with her and happily talk to her for hours about lemon water and TV shows and Jesus. But somehow we got stuck with each other, somehow we share half our genes and a blood obligation towards each other despite being completely different people.

Or, you know, maybe this is all just an excuse for me being a shit person and an ungrateful child",19Dec2018,1
35,F22 as of tomorrow? Today? D19th. I've gone to a lot of religious churches and stuff. I'm in the midwest and when I was younger even went to mosque. I like that the best.

37,"I moved across the country for this program where I knew only one person. I was juggling a full time course load, working 8-20 hours a week, and a 16 hour internship. On top of that I had started dating someone when I first moved here and he cheated shortly after Thanksgiving.

I went through final papers and projects with a shattered self esteem.

I got a 3.9 gpa!! My first semester of undergrad was 2.9.

I’m really really proud of myself, but come from a pretty toxic community where I can’t be proud of any accomplishments without being ripped apart out of jealousy and insecurity. Figured I’d celebrate with Reddit instead!",19Dec2018,1
38,"When I was 16, I was rejected by a girl I cared very much about. We were very close and even though I was young and wasn’t great at reading signals, she constantly suggested that she felt the same. I had never cared about anyone like that before, and since most other people in my life treated me like garbage, it was nice to feel like I mattered to someone.Then I watched her lose interest in me, then fall in love with my close friend. He asked her on a date five feet away from me. The weekend after that, I got rid of my swooshy hair and even shaved for the first time, while crying in the bathroom. You see, on that day, I promised myself that not only did I have value, but that I’d make sure everyone could see it.

I started by getting familiar with the word yes. I agreed to any new experience: hangouts, food with friends, concerts, school football games. I even snuck out of the house to go to an NHL game once. I started spreading as much kindness and positivity as I could to others. And I even got a girlfriend. I’ll never forget  one day, when that original girl who rejected me told me that she wished her boyfriend was more like me. Little by little, people started treating me like I was worth something.

So now I’m 19. I’m in the best shape of my life and I have the fashion and hygiene to match it. I’m a very hard worker and I wake up determined to make the most of my days. I carry myself very confidently and I go out of my way to talk to strangers and crack jokes with everyone. I try to be a positive force in the world. I’ve recently started getting “checked out” by people I see in public. That girl from way back then broke up with her boyfriend and went out of her way to reach out to me and apologize for toying with my emotions(I told her all was forgiven and we were cool, but after that encounter, I decided I still want to keep her out of my life) And what’s weirdest of all, the people in my life treat me like an asset, as if without me, their quality of life would somehow lessen, which I still can’t quite grasp the idea of.

But through all of this self improvement and all of this growth, I still feel like I’m losing. I still can’t talk to girls I’m interested in and I often debate whether I even want to date right now. I feel like I’m going to wake up one day and regret my life. I’m constantly stressed that I’m going to let all of the people who value me down. I feel like I’m juggling all these people who expect me to be this rock, this constant force of kindness and responsibility and positivity. It seems like no matter how much I’ve shown the world my value, I still can’t truly show myself.

40,"Obligatory first time poster and this happened around a month ago.

**Context**: A math presentation is coming up: the group controls the class and teaches for the day. Simple, yet common presentation at my school. I am assigned by the teacher as 1 of the 6 leaders (she choose this based off the 6th highest-ranking students in her class). I was initially going to go with my best friend (who is also my only real friend in the class), but since I’m a leader and my friend was a leader, we obviously can’t have two leaders in the same group. But once my classmates get to choose which group they go with, they avoid me. My friend already had his group with some other people, and everyone else goes into their own groups, and some even have 5 members (even though the teacher explicitly tell everyone to only have 4 in a group). I have no idea why nobody wanted to come to me: maybe I’m not as well-liked as I think I am, maybe it’s because i try to stay as one of the quiet ones who talks only when the teacher calls me, hell, it could just be because everyone in the class already has their friends and groups and cliques. And I’m not sure if the teacher noticed this, but she took the already established groups, and let them choose which topic they wanted to cover in their presentation. Obviously, everyone chooses the easier ones (I forgot to mention how each group has to choose from a list of 6 math topics we learned in the semester). Once the teacher sees me, she asks “Where’s your group?”, and I simply say “I don’t have one.” The teacher then says to the class that every group with a group of 5 has to send someone to my group. Nobody wanted to come with me, until eventually, 3 more people come to me. At first, I was depressed as shit about the fact that nobody wanted to come to me until the bitter end, but I quickly got over that as I simply thought: “Who cares if they don’t come to me for this stupid project? Besides, everyone’s probably going to forget about this project in a year or two, anyways.” Say what you will about thin kind of thinking, but I find that it lifts my spirits up and makes me hopeful for the future. Besides, this in no way will affect me in a year or two in college anyways. Also, my group got last dibs on what topic we got, so we got the hardest topic.

**The Story**: Weeks pass, and the deadline for the presentation is about to come up. I have most of my part done, with the exception of a few small touches, but my group still needs to finish their parts. Between the day I got my group and the day we were going to meet, everything had been going surprisingly well. If anything, I thought my group was going to be the Jackson 5 of Math groups. But no, everything has been going fine and no problems were brought up apart from the small logistical and mathematical problems. Until, one member of the group, out of nowhere and without being provoked, decided to verbally attack me. What happened was that a member of my group (Who shall be called AssH (Yes, I capitalized the H intentionally))  was talking about other groups. I’m fine with people talking while working so long as it doesn’t distract them from actually working. Then AssH, out of nowhere, says “You know, if it wasn’t for Anonymous Teacher, nobody would have gone with him” (him, obviously, referring to me). There comes a time as a leader (in insignificant group projects that won’t affect me in the next year, and in real life) where people begin to question you, your leadership and your validity as a leader, whether your a good or a bad leader. And your response will determine what others think of you as a leader. If your response if good enough to shut down any doubts, then the perpetrator of the question will usually try to shove it under the rug and pretend like nobody even questioned the leader. And if your response is bad, then your response will spread like wildfire and everyone will meme you in a bad way because if your response. So, I realized that that time had come.   Trying to give AsH the benefit of the doubt by thinking I might have by chance misheard what AssH said, I simply asked him calmly “What did you say?” AssH immediately tried to backtrack, and gave the typical response “Nothing.” Another member then ask the same thing: “What did you say?” I then knew that real shit was about to go down. 

My group and I are now curious: “What did you say?”. He then finally squared up, and said “I said that if it weren’t for Anonymous Teacher, then nobody would have gone with him.” Immediately, he tries to backtrack and justify what he said by saying “But it’s not because of you. It’s because, you know, I was in a group of smart people. And....” I knew where this was going. I was furious, yet for the first time, I tried a different approach: Attack, but calmly. Normally, I would usually try to leave the room and question myself for hours on end. But this time, I choose to fight instead of flight. I cut him off, and I ask AssH: “So you think I’m stupid?”. I mean, if someone is going to backtrack what they said, you have to be able to make up a somewhat decent excuse as to why someone would say such a thing so that I would probably buy that excuse. AssH then says: “What? No, it’s just because everyone had the simpler topics, and.... yeah” I mentally calm down, and I simply tell him (it was the only thing I could have thought of at the time): “Okay. If they’re (the other group leaders) any smarter than I am, then why didn’t they choose the harder topics? I’m pretty sure if they’re so smart, they could have done the harder topics very easily” At the moment, I thought that I had set myself into a corner. There are a million different things AsH could have responded with. But, surprisingly, it worked. AssH begrudgingly agreed, proceeded to shut up, got back to work, and just because I am for some reason still nice to AssH, I tell him: “You know, I like your honesty. I like a person who is just straight up and doesn’t sugarcoat anything.” I mean, you gotta hand it to AsH for even having the balls to say something like that. And since then, I has never been bought up again. But to me, this isn’t simply a one-off, forget about it ordeal. It’s not because I want to hold a grudge against AssH (sorry if I make it out to seem that way). Hell, AssH probably forgot about this anyways. But it’s simply about the fact that for the first time, I manage to respond kindly, calmly, and with words instead of emotion. I had never been in this kind of situation, yet I managed to come out of it verbally alive. To say the least, this is a personal first I am proud of.

TL; DR ) AssHat in my group try’s to verbally attack me as leader, I somehow successfully stay calm and kind during the argument (which is a personal first considering I would usually showcase a few million emotions besides anger, emotions you don’t want to show when being verbally attacked), and I manage to somehow shut AssHat up.

57,"I've had a rocky relationship with my critical parents the past few years when I was under and unemployed, lived with them for about 4 months but have since moved out of state and life is better now that the distance exists.

Three weeks ago my parents visited my sister who lives in the same region as I do (we both moved out of state for jobs/relationship in her case).  Sis lives an hour away from me and despite that, we met up only twice in the past 8 months.  I guess I should try to nurture a relationship with her, but it's just not happening.   Anyway my parents spent all weekend with her, helping her out but won't say with what - no worries, that's between her and them.  Dad wanted to drop something off for me which I appreciated and we met up at a coffee shop before they headed back home on an 8 hour drive.

During the meeting, they asked me about work and the problems I was facing (micromanaging boss), it was me ranting to them, and them rolling their eyes (I was tired, so that didn't help my mood).   Dad wanted to know my Christmas plans 4 weeks in advance, while I'm someone who prefers to go with the flow and make last minute decisions.  He wanted to know how I planned to travel back to his state and where I'd stay over the Christmas holidays (I have 5 days off work).

He suggested I take the bus (8-9 hours) or train (6-7).  Flying is another option but cost prohibitive.   I told him I might take the bus but we'll see.  I don't like to be cramped in a bus with 50+ people and one tiny toilet, having loud people coughing on you and bothering you, but I had to admit it's nice not to have to do the driving, even if it does take 1-2 hours by public transit carry your luggage each way to even reach the inter-city bus terminal.  

Ultimately I decided to drive as I have to drop something off to my storage unit and would like to rent rooms at 1 or more airbnb property if I don't stay with my parents.

Three days ago dad, after not hearing my plans for weeks, followed up by email with photo showing the Christmas tree he had set up.  Nice!  But I knew that was his way of prodding me for an update.  I didn't reply instantly and then he called.  I let it go to voice mail as I wasn't in the mood to have him argue with me how I never listen to his advice, my mom saying, but I thought you said you'd take the bus, etc.  Dad then texted me with hello?

So I knew I couldn't stall much longer and texted him the plan:  I would drive and book an airbnb room the first night, then asked if I could stay at their place for Dec 25-27?   

Dad's reply:  

&gt;As previously discussed, you're welcome to stay with us.   Even the first night as long as you don't arrive after 9pm.  
&gt;  
&gt;We'd like to eat Christmas dinner early by 5:15pm (yes, he wrote that) with (members of the family)  
&gt;  
&gt;Don't bring anything to eat that you want to store in our fridge, only bring what you'll consume on the way here.

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly, I don't want to stay with them at all.  I'm thinking of coming for Christmas day and only if everyone else is around, but sleeping elsewhere.  Why?  First of all it would be 5 people sharing 1 bathroom.  It would be 2 young kids screaming and jumping on my bed.    Third, it would be my parents prying into my life, judging and complaining how I ""never"" listen to their advice, starting with the predictable whining from my mom ""but I thought you said you were going to take the bus?""   No mom, that's what you and dad wanted, not me.   

Truth be told, I'd rather take my chances with strangers I meet on airbnb, preferably those who have pets, spend time with them, than with my own family.   Is that cold hearted?   I already know mom is going to whine about me limiting my time with family, how important family is, how I'm wasting money on airbnb rather than just come lie on the sofa bed in their basement, etc.  

What would you do and how would you address the fact you want to be elsewhere for the holidays, not shack up with mom, dad, sis and the kids?

Colour Journal 4:

Where I live, it’s bitter cold outside, the kind of temperature that will gnaw at your skin. I have to wear millions of layers to protect my body from freezing up. 

Even worse, the wind whips up a frenzy in this below zero weather, cutting at the tips of my ears.  

This winter weather takes a toll on my physical and mental state. However, I live through these times, driven by the anticipation of a new land and the prospect of green coloured grass. I mean, what's a little torture when you can experience all that green goodness. 

That leads into our new topic for the day. 

Lucious, smooth, eco-friendly.

The colour green.

I know what you’re thinking, and I hate vegetables too. But kale, lettuce, cucumber, all the greens are what help us humans exist on this planet. Without the nutrients provided from the healthier side of the spectrum, we’d all be either dead or living unhappily. The red proteins that satisfy our taste buds cannot be forever indulged. 

There must be some kind of green stick going down your throat.

This goes the same for many other references to real life such as a health bar inside being displayed in a video game. The more HP you have, the longer the green line is, the less, the shorter it is. 

We just can’t live without green. 

In culture these days, white is considered the light in the ever-flowing darkness, an angel in the depths of hell. 

However, that is not correct. 

Why?

Imagine this. 

A snowy land, ripped to shreds by centuries of below zero weather. The last remaining humans have either sheltered themselves off in underground caves, or trek the cold mountains in search for proper land. You and your group of survivors endlessly climb icy slopes, completely exhausted by the excruciating weather. Half of your team has died of in the passing years and the rest are on the brink of mania. The children are desperate for food, and the adults are desperate for peace. Everything has fallen to ruin, and you're not sure if you want to continue to exist in this failed world. 

Then one day you stumble upon a patch of grass. 

It’s not the brightest or most colourful shade of green, but it’s most likely the only one left. 

You’ll treasure that spot in the ground, and nourished it until it spreads all over the cold wasteland. 

There will be some days where you feel like giving up, where you feel like dying, where you feel like that spot of green is not enough. 

But because you found it, found it in a swarm of white snow, you won’t give up. 

And knowing that, even if it’s a glimmer of hope inside a cosmos of despair, you will make it out unscathed. 

Green is not just a colour.

It’s what keeps us humans going.

As long as we keep it in our hearts.

They weren’t like rude or anything but i was feeling like i was distancing them with my behavior.

Ever since then i started to hate myself a lot,insulting myself and randomly remembering every time i’ve done something cringy.

I feel like i’ve completly fucked up my relationship with that group and i cant stop hating myself for that.",19Dec2018,1
62,"When I was a kid I was always bored, fucking always! I never liked to do anything, I’ve been spoilt my whole life which probably didn’t help. I began to realise that causing issues and getting attention for being in trouble made my world more interesting, I’d bite and kick and hurt my nannys until they either quit or in secret sometimes would smack me across the face for being such a shit, I loved it; to cause such an emotional reaction, even as a kid I knew that if I could drive an adult, an adult who’s devoted their life to taking care of children, to the point where they felt no other choice but to strike me, I knew I had emotional control. I’d steal the neighbours cats and help her look for them, knowing fulling well I’d hid them  dead in a shoe box somewhere. I’d kill other cats sometimes, I think I killed 4 all together, it was unfortunate, cats are great creatures, hunters at heart, I own a cat now. Great thing. Anyway. I killed a few other animals like fish, hamsters, birds, but it wasn’t like a hobby, I liked the emotional reaction I gave people.

I’d like to see someone distressed or distraught over something I did, whether they knew I did it or not. I swapped my sisters medication for something that would have no affect on her (can’t remember what) and watched her slowly slowly go back into a state of mental illness, I was 13 when I did that. I did the same to my mom by hiding (and taking/selling) her Xanax at 14ish, since she’s a total junkie watching her go into a panic over her pills calling her doctor obsessively, ugh amazing.

I wish I could say I grew out of all of it, I don’t kill cats anymore though. ",19Dec2018,1

65,"I'm a computer science student from Turkey. Being someone from outside of EU/EEA or North America already puts me far behind any other candidate just because of visa sponsorship requirements. I could apply for thousand internships internationally and can rejected by all of them even if I am a potential candidate. However I did apply for hundreds of internship position. Only one returned with an e-mail saying they want me to solve coding problem on CodeSignal. I miss the deadline due to confusion of difference in time zones.

&amp;#x200B;

I flipping hate myself right now. It was not some big company that everyone wants to work someday. But at the end it was an internship in a country I'd like to move in near future. Most of 'internships' in Turkey is hard to get in. You need to know someone with an authority; a manager, a senior in HR etc if you want to do an 'internship' internship which you can do something relative to what you study in school and real work experience. I or anyone from my family don't know anyone like that. There are places that I can show as an internship on paper but in that option you just make copies of some documents which is totally unrelated to my field. I don't want that.

Crazy thing is shes 27 and hes only 20. Supposedly hes mature for his age.

 I only saw her as a friend for some reason. Maybe her style didn’t click with me initially? Idk.

Told her I wanted to date but she said she only saw me as a friend. Guess its only fair since I did that to her.

68,"I'm a postgraduate student, have a full time job, and zero friends around 99% of the time. I haven't engaged with anyone socially for about a month - at all, and I really mean at all - and before that it was another 2-3 weeks. I go weeks and months without needing to interact socially.

I live in a share house but we keep to ourselves, which I love. I have tons of books so I read, watch documentaries and shitty youtube videos, cook nice meals, everything - without the pressure to have to hang out with people. We all like each other but we just don't hang out.

I talk to people at work, quick conversation or two, but after I leave I most likely won't talk to someone (unless a cashier or something) until the next day. I don't have any social media, don't talk to anyone there either. I text a friend who lives abroad a couple of times a week. Also, I moved to a new city about 6 months ago, so I don't have a social network here.

I love people, I love my friends, whether in the country or the ones abroad, and when I go out or do happen to meet people socially I really enjoy their company. I find it easy to strike up conversation with strangers, I'm quick with jokes, it's merry all round. This isn't an I-don't-have-social-skills problem. About once a month I end up having a one night stand so that takes care of that. The rest of the time it's my trusty ol' girlfriend Lenovo Thinkpad.

I turned 30 two weeks ago, did it solo. I went for a 30k hike, cooked an amazing steak and mushrooms meal with homemade fries and watched boyz n the hood. Great time. Last week I walked 8k to a beautiful little movie theatre and back for the premiere of a documentary I've been waiting to see (it's called free solo, hilariously enough). I walk everywhere, I don't take public transport, I like to get to look around at things.

There isn't necessarily a problem here, but I worry that it's getting to ridiculous levels. I've always been a bit of a loner, but I also love other people. The fact that I can go weeks without any actual conversation or real interaction aside from short pleasantries seems strange and possibly detrimental in the future since other people seem to enjoy frequent interaction and it's necessary to maintain relationships. I worry that it will progress to the point where I'll become a complete recluse without friends, never have a real romantic relationship, or the need to ever talk to anyone.

Is anyone else similar? I haven't really come across people who feel the same way so I'd like to get a little insight. For people who enjoy frequent interactions, what do you get from regular contact with others? how would you view someone like me if you knew me? Do you see any future problems for this type of behaviour? I'm just curious overall and interested to hear people's general opinions and experiences.

TL;DR: I speak to no one. This is pleasing to me. Am I a future crazy cat man?",19Dec2018,1

Even in my cloudy sleep-deprived state, I could still recognize it was probably a mouse. I was terrified and wanted to scream but couldn't. Eventually I just flung the blanket off and went into my living room, and proceeded to get no sleep. I've only gone back in my room for fleeting moments and have no idea if the mouse is still in there, if it's gone into my closet, or if it's gone entirely. I don't know what to do.

73,"A few days ago, I turned 24. I’ve never been as pensive and reflective as I have tonight. Last year, things were good. I graduated in May and began grad school a few weeks after. In true post-secondary education fashion, though, I went downhill from there. I couldn’t manage my stress at all, my health took a heavy toll, and my sleeping schedule went haywire. I’m perpetually tired, irritated, and I can’t shake the feeling of a foreboding cloud of depression looming over me, unearthed from my teenage years. I’ve even lost my creativity in my writing. That’s my life, I guess. 

To 23: There are things I wish I wouldn’t have done, people I wish I didn’t hurt, and chances I should have taken. If I could go back on time, I’d mend every conversation, close every loose end, and disappear when I could. You fucked up a lot. 

To 24: Be better. Be calmer. Be nicer. 

I wanted to make a list of 24 wishes for me to, theoretically, look back on next year and see my improvement, if any. 

For posterity and in no particular order: 

1: Take care of yourself. All the oddities of your health in your late teen years will fester and bite you in your ass. 

2. Wear sunblock. Seriously. You look like a tomato every time you go outside. 

3. Relax and breathe. Stop stressing about the future. 

4. Rebuild the neglected friendships you deserted after you graduated college. 

5. Get a win in Fortnite. 

6. Practice being patient. 

7. Take care of your grandparents. They’re not going to be here much longer. 

8. Be kind to your brother and your mom. 

9. Reach out to your dad. However you feel, chances are he feels a million times worse. 

10. *Actually* try in school. 

11. Stop blocking people out. 

12. Go back to church. It doesn’t benefit anyone to pretend to be a nihilist. 

13. Make time to read the books, articles, and magazines you like. 

14. Take a walk around the neighborhood when the weather starts to turn colder. 

15. Smile more. Who cares about wrinkles? (I do.)

16. Spend more time with your cats. 

17. Don’t feel indifferent because all your high school friends are in committed relationships or expecting a child. Your path is different. 

18. Mow the lawn. Seriously. You’re old as hell now, and you still haven’t done it once. 

19. Be nice to yourself. Leave the past alone. 

20. Go out. My goodness. Stop being such a recluse. 

21. Get your driver’s license and fix all those issues. 

22. Start working out again. 

23. Make a difference in the world.

24. Don’t waste your youth chasing kites. 

And for good measure: break the heartbreak. ",19Dec2018,1

76,"25 years ago, as an early teenager and over the course of several years, I was very close friends with someone who is 7 years older than me. About 10 years ago, this person ended up with a ~30 year prison sentence for sex crimes (about 20 years left on sentence). 

Looking back, we had what many would deem to be occasional inappropriate physical contact. However, I never felt like a victim and would not approach this communication as a victim. I feel compelled to reach out not only as a familiar voice, but as someone who may still be able to see this person beyond the horrors of the crimes. A friend. Who knows, perhaps even someone who could be of use with whatever is the therapy protocol. 

I have not communicated with this person in probably 17 years. I have never really (that I know of) experienced communicating with a prisoner before, let alone a person convicted of serious sex crimes. I feel compelled to reach out every now and then, I just want to make sure, if I in fact do, it is not insensitive or detrimental in ways I may not comprehend.

Thoughts?

79,"Hey all, I’m not sure where the best place to ask this is, so I’ll ask it here. 

For background, I (17F) have a mom in the hospital due to some complications from kidney failure. She’s been in and out of hospitals for a few years now— it’s only gotten worse. Last year we got lucky and she was out of the hospital just around Christmas, but went back in shortly after. However this year might not turn out like that. Maybe she can get out the 23rd, but it’s unclear. 

How should I try to celebrate Christmas with her? She is divorced and there aren’t a lot of people on her side of the family. (Like, I have an uncle in another state, that’s about it for extended family.) Her friend, who has actually been taking care of her after her health failed this spring by a large margin is in a different hospital due to irregular heartbeat, so there aren’t a lot of people around to celebrate.

I'd just moved to NYC and was going through a divorce while also getting to know the woman who would become my second wife. Before that, I was trying to have a career that I cared about.

I grew up in the Louisiana system, and as far as I am aware it is a goddamn atrocity what is happening to our children here (not to blame any educators or staff, that is not my intent). That is why I wish to educate myself with knowledge from others, so that maybe I can better understand why things are the way they are and what needs to be changed.

Final thing I'd like to say: it is my personal belief that education is the #1 most important thing going forward in this world.

I have found that I tend to lean towards a form of humor that is ludicrous in its self-aggrandizing and is done with such bombastic swagger that it cannot be taken seriously. That is really the bread and butter of my humor. For instance, it is me complaining… yet again… how I was passed over for People’s Sexiest Man Alive issue. We all know the reason why and that is because I refuse to play that whole game. All that social politicking to win that elusive cover spot is beneath me. 

Another example is when I was talking about how the biggest problem with my car is that I always have to drive around with my windows up because, otherwise, women are just tossing their panties inside when I drive. Because we all know that nothing gets a lady’s engine revving like a 4-door 2008 Honda Civic.

86,"This is hard to describe because it's more than one thing and not consistent. But the basic problem is that I frequently have moments where I feel physical discomfort, like I'm not okay being in my own skin.

It happens most when I'm forced to think about my own body - like seeing a medical diagram, or when someone points out my adam's apple or the veins on my arm (they're both big.) Or when I accidentally clack my teeth together (I can't touch my teeth together deliberately or accidentally without feeling horrid, even thinking about it isn't nice). I actually put down John Green's new book ""Turtles All The Way Down"" not a chapter in, because it starts with such a visceral description of fear and nervousness, describing the protagonist's body, that it triggered all of the discomfort.

Sometimes even fine motor skills make me feel sick - I remember that I couldn't do textiles in school because the precise action of trying to thread a needle made me feel physically nauseous, it was so uncomfortable for me. The focus on one thing. I have the same reaction for breathing exercises - I've never been able to do them without feeling disgust and discomfort. When someone tells me to focus on my own breath, it's the opposite of relaxing, it's stressful because I don't *want* to think about my breath. It's part of me and I can't deal with it.

I think the underlying theme is that any action that requires extreme focus on a part of my body or something involving my body makes me uncomfortable to the point of feeling nauseous.

I often have tics, as well - sometimes in my eyes or cheeks or another part of my face, sometimes in my arms, shoulders, legs, etc. I've had tics throughout my life in different parts of my body - eventually they shift to a different part, they never really go away. To deal with the discomfort I have to do things like touching different parts of my hand, yawning, rubbing my face, stretching different parts of my body, changing my body position etc.

The problem goes away once I stop thinking about the thing that makes me uncomfortable. Writing this right now I feel extremely uncomfortable - when the symptoms are at their worst I might feel a knot in my stomach, although I've never yet been physically sick because of it.

It probably goes without saying that I am extremely squeamish about the obvious things as well - blood, gore, sick etc. are all repulsive. I can't look at a needle when I'm having blood drawn.

I've had this problem ever since I can remember, and I've never known what it is or how to deal with it - it's not something I can easily take to a doctor because it's so vague and not exactly life threatening. If any part of this resonates with you and you've experienced similar feelings, or you know someone else who has, **please comment and let me know**. I really want to find other people who know more about what could be the root problem here.
