4,"The damn cigarrette beetlea are making the porch unbearable to sit and relax. I'm pissed at my gf for being lazy and thinking washing the clean dishes in the diahwasher would trick me into thinking she did something today. I been giving medicine and running to the store and back because she felt ill and asked f9r 5 minutes of time to do some diahes. Whatever. C9oking and cleaning while she sits up and plays xbox. Cool, shes sick, she needs to rest, got that. But man its hard flying solo when you work 50 hours a week answering calls from broken people just trying to get by. Emotionally draining. Passed that my brother is on an acid trip spree with no end in sight and my best friend is moving in with the source of a lot of past drama hes had and I just wanna cook some god damned rice and eggs and slather them bitches up with teriyaki and yum yum sauce and drink my whisky to cope. Kinda wanted to do something besides household maintenance but whatever those days are needed. Also. Trx coin. Got big hopes and scoping the patterns trying to figure out whats going on. All stocks and crypto went up across the board and follow a general path. Like a small circle is playing the game and the rest of us are jerking off to ""go to the moon! Lambos and doughnuts"" but it aint our decision, nor our collective input that matters really. We're all in the same tube being directed by the high and mighty inner circle that pushes the ups and downs making that 1% even more c9ncentrated. Makes me feel oike a lot of shit is just futile. I just want a house and a car voth paid 9ff so I can do some god damned wood staining projects. Simple stuff making ugly wood things into pretty wood things with stain and laquer. Thats all I want. I want to cash out around 150k from trx and call it a good day and stain some fucking wood.

9,"So I’ve had a definitely atypical path in life. After graduating high school I started a career in a particular field. This was my dream job and the only job that I ever wanted. However it is an ultra competitive field. It hasn’t panned out and I am 23 now and ready to turn the page and start the next chapter. 

But I’m not sold on what the next chapter is. I’m not *that* worried about it because I think I am going to be a full-time student and have saved a little money. (About $45k). 
It’s just like, what the fuck will I do? How do you provide for yourself with no degree or meaningful work experience except in a very specific field that isn’t really transferable?

Where/how the fuck will I get Heath insurance? I’m not sure if it’s hyperbole but everywhere I read is people lamenting over how tough it is to get ahead. I’m feeling like I have a huge head start with my savings and the fact that my school will be largely if not completely free. But I’m just like shit..What the fuck am I doing?

Sorry if that wasn’t the most coherent but I’m just in one of those big transition times.

I don't have a car, my mom's an alcoholic so I left and never looked back, my dad's fine but insists I go to college, and my step mom hates me. I don't want to go to college, I want to save some money for a few year and spend my twenties traveling. Now here's the thing, I just had a friend of mine pull a full 180 on our plan to move to Califonia this fall, Iive in Michigan btw and hate it. I don't have any friends that are my age that I could move with, except for one person who isn't sure if they are getting an apartment, other than that maybe I have no plan, if I don't go to college I'll be kicked out of my house. I can afford to live on my own, I don't need much, I'm a simple guy. The problem is that if I live on my own without someone to help with rent and such, I will have no way to save to travel the country other than winning the lottery. Also that is the only life I see for myself, I hate the idea of living a ""normal"" life I feel it's a waste of droning on day to day just to pay your rent, I don't care to be rich, I just want to live life without chains holding me down, I don't care about risks, if you don't risk anything you will never enjoy life.

13,"I'm a girl with a rare form of Turner  syndrome and I have been obsessed with shrinking for such a long time.  I've read posts from girls with the same fantasy here on Reddit. They  had so similar fantasies so my girlfriend and I brought it up with our  relationship coach. We had such a good conversation about it and I found  out so much about it.

I think it all  started when I was a little girl. I always got so much attention and  care for being smaller than the other girls. I was always told I was so  cute and little. I loved the extra attention and I guess that I  subconsciously associated being small with being loved. When people were  mean to me I subconsciously associated it with not being small and cute  enough. I still have these feelings. I have always imagined that one  day my girlfriend will shrink me and put me in her pocket and take me  everywhere. From then I will always be right next to her and I will  never ever leave her side. We will literally be together forever.

Anyway  I started to consciously want to get shrunken when I met my girlfriend  \(then BFF\) when I was little. We are both obsessed with dolls.  Eventually she started calling me a doll and treating my like her doll  and I started acting like her doll. It was prefect because I always  imagined myself as one of the dolls when we were playing with each  other. That was when I realized that it would be so cool to shrink down  to the size of a doll so I could really be like one and my girlfriend  started to think it would be cool to shrink me. I think we wanted this  because I seem to have a submissive personality and my girlfriend seems  to have a dominant one. I'm not sure why exactly our personalities are  like this. And what I mean is not the kinky whips and leather stuff.  What I mean is that I have always thought that getting shrunken would  change me so that I would pretty much exist to make my girlfriend happy.  I will always be with her to play with her. My girlfriend thinks that  if she shrank me she would be able to do everything for me and my life  would pretty much be all hers.

So I  think that a lot of girls fantasize about being a doll but then grow out  of it. I think we never grew out of it because we share the same  fantasy and reinforce each other. The fantasy became stronger and  stronger over time because it sort of came part way true. When I started  to wish to be shrunken and she started to wish to shrink me I was not  that much smaller than her. Because I have Turner syndrome and because  her parents are really tall I am now 4'5"" and she is 6'2. So the wish  sort of became true. Just not enough.",03May2018,1
14,"So many things have happened. I haven't been able to say anything online, but I'm so miserable right now.

I can’t believe this is my reality...I’m not exaggerating one word. I don’t have any memories from this year other than work and my course assignments...

Sucks to think about all of the memories I could have had if I had friends. How all of my stressful moments would have been less stressful if I had a friend to talk to. Sucks to suck. Fuck it all.

I haven’t dated in a long time because I have nowhere to start. I don’t have any friends and I’m sure any girl who gets to know me will be taken aback by the fact that I’m a friendless control freak who cares about their grades too much.

18,"I used to drink. Like, a lot. I'm a few years sober now. 

A lot of my drinking was done in the city of Oakland.

I used to live in a really shitty neighborhood I moved to without knowing much about it. It was the sort of neighborhood that sounded really bad at night. Without exaggeration, gunshots were an almost nightly occurrence. There were a few traphouses next to my apartment complex, and the street on front of them constantly had people hanging out there. There was yelling, laughing, fighting, screaming. Once there was a shootout close enough for me to hear the exchanged gunfire, and yells from the dudes involved saying ""COME OVER HERE AND TRY THAT SHIT NIGGA."" 

I had this outfit I used to wear if I had to go out at night. I'd put on a camouflage jacket, a fitted cap, and gloves. I would do stuff like walk the other way if I saw someone sketchy. One time, coming home with drycleaning, I hid behind a car while this guy was circling on a bike in front of my complex until the guy left. So, that gives a good example of what it was like and how I tried to adapt.

I started dating a girl, right around Christmastime. We went to a local drinking joint and got drunk. We rested our heads against each other as songs from the Weeknd floated around the christmas lights above the bar. She wasn't that used to drinking and got wasted, and let me know that it was time for us to leave.

She asked where my car was, an old cadillac I was borrowing from my grandparents. I pointed to it but said I shouldn't drive. It's fine, she said. We can just go hang out in there for a bit. I get in the driver seat and she straddles me, and starts aggressively making out with me. Then she opens the door and pukes out the side.

Fuck, I thought. I need to get this girl home. I shouldn't have been driving. I didn't know where she lived, and took her to my place. I circled the block a few times to make sure no one was outside and then hurried her inside.

This was our third date or so. We made out more, but we agreed in our drunken state not too have sex. Now, this isn't the kidnapping I mention in the title. This is just to give some context of where I was at.

We start dating, I move to a better part of Oakland, get a better job. We fall in love. And then, we broke up, in a shitty way. Break-ups for an alcoholic are a devastating affair. It's hard to process things when you constantly drown yourself in booze. The world turns melancholy.

I stopped working, started living off of money I had. I lost days, and days to drinking. Regular hours of sleeping became a thing of the past, I'd stay up during the nights. Any sleep I had became worthless, unable to achieve REM sleep.

It became a matter of making sure I had booze from the 6 hours from 12:00AM-6:00AM that stores were closed. 11:30AM runs to the store in my street camouflage, bottles tucked into my inner jacket pockets, hands resting on them like the scabbard of a sword. I didn't know how to fight, my body wrecked from booze and cigarettes, but I didn't care. I remember seeing a hooded out dude cross the street to get away from me once when he saw me sauntering around like that, and felt proud.

It was a sort of mania, with the lack of sleep. As much as I wanted to intimidate people at night, I am also mostly gentle by nature and not a complete villain. Yet, I got this idea in my head one night that I would go out and patrol Lake Merritt in my night outfit. I'd encounter whoever I did, maybe prevent crime or something. It was insane and stupid. Yet, I put on my cap, gloves and camo jacket around 2:00AM at night and set out.

The Lake was totally empty that time of night as I made my way around the south end of it, smoking cigarettes in a reasonably sober state. Then, I came to a wooded area near the north. I heard a female scream.

""HELP ME!!!!""

I perked up, immediately filling with adrenaline, dread and fear.

""PLEASE GOD HELP ME!!! I'M BEING KIDNAPPED!!!""

I didn't have any sort of plan. I took off running into the woods towards the source and shouted at the top of my lungs ""FREEZE!"", trying to emulate a cop. 

I looked around hurriedly for whoever it was. I wasn't hallucinating, I was sure of it. There was only the silence of the night, a few cars on the street on the next block, maybe a few football fields away through the wooded area.

I ran to a safe place and called the police. ""I think I just heard someone being kidnapped."" 

I got scared after I heard the tone of the dispatcher, and their acknowledgement that they would send the police. I ran back to my apartment a mile or two away, cigarette scorched lungs huffing, carried by the remaining adrenaline. I drank the rest of the wine I had at home and fell asleep.

I don't know what became of that person, I don't know if they were actually being kidnapped. I just went back to my horrible routine of drinking and never followed up with the police, nor saw anything in the news.

My life was dangerous and miserable then. I am so glad to be sober. I see my actions as clumsy but brave in a time of complete personal darkness, and it reminds me that somewhere inside I still wanted to help people. I think, inwardly, many who suffer from addiction still have their humanity and the desire to do good, despite the darkness clouding their every day, their moral decline, their horrific benders. 

I look back at the surreality of it all that bottled up to the point of needing to share, and I quietly thank God that today I have the stability to live a quiet, peaceful life on completely different terms with reality, and with more adherence to my deepest morals.

Thank you sincerely for reading.

19,"The loss of my (now former) fiancée was my result, as I told her I had had enough. I moved out. And I found out she had been snooping into my iCloud stuff even months into this separation. 

She doesn’t know I know what she did. Because I don’t care that she knows. Not anymore. I changed all my passwords and updated all my systems. She has no more access to my stuff. 

But I have still to process my grief. I tried the first couple of weeks. And since I am a Graduate student, it resulted in a really stressful semester of playing catch up, as I felt often lethargic and in somewhat of a depressed state. 

I asked myself, “When? You cannot hold on to this and not process it. You can’t cover the sun with the tip of your finger”

I negotiated and pleaded with myself until I found a compromise: once I complete every school assignment (including my thesis during this my last semester in Grad school), and after the Defense Committee, I’ll grant myself permission to grieve her as much as I want.

I am a few days away from feeling comfortable enough to process this grief in healthy ways. And what’s exciting is to think I have grown a bit since the separation. That this school-induced stress was a catalyst to finding out new things about myself.

I'm aware I'm not necessarily as bad off as most, but I'm struggling. I'm afraid of people forgetting about me. Lately, I feel a friend hasn't tried to hang out at all. He has a job that requires him to work five twelve hour overnight shifts a week. On his days off, he doesn't break his sleep schedule, which is understandable, yet we still fail to hang out in some way.

I stay up late, so it would be easy to play a game at least. However, it still doesn't happen, and I try to reach out and do at least that. It seems there's no interest in hanging out, unless multiple friends want to do something, which is fine because I get to socialize.

To make matters worse, I ran into my friend in public, and we chatted a bit. I found out he gets out and hangs out with people from work at a bar. He doesn't drink, so I don't get the appeal of going to a bar to hang out with people he sees twelve hours a night at work. 

There's no reason he couldn't hang out with me and our group of friends more often. I find it ridiculous that the only time we all hang out as a group is when we watch movies, which I was invited to watch Infinity War and couldn't go because of work, even though I tried to make plans before.

My other friends tend to be busier too. I have another friend who works overnights and was also involved in watching Infinity War. I play games with said friend all the time, yet I get bored of the games we play. I feel that friend understands me more, but I find it hard to express my frustration about this situation because I have in the past and am afraid of overdoing it.

Also, I have another two friends who are married with two kids. They are busy with family, which is understandable. I hang out with them from time to time, yet it's hard to not feel a little lonely in those times.

Fortunately, my mom is always around, as  well as my dog. They keep me company, but the company doesn't always quench my feelings of loneliness because I value friendship, and the state of my one friendship makes me feel like garbage, especially when he makes little effort to hang with anyone in the group. I could him approach about it, but it never gets anywhere because he is too prideful and doesn't seem to ultimately care about anyone.

I've been so mad at times because of the situation I feel stupid because people probably think it's silly to be mad about it. It's gotten to points I want to sabotage or make life harder for him, but ultimately, I care so much I could never try to ruin anything for him without feeling horrible.

Anyway, I sometimes think something is wrong with me. Maybe I'm pushing people away. Maybe I'm socially awkward. Maybe I have some kind of disorder. These types of thoughts that something is wrong with me also mess it all up too. It's just all hard to let go.",03May2018,8

31,"My mother tries to control my life every time although I am a 22-year old male. It got harder, when I started to smoke cigarettes. She wasn’t very amused about my decision. Yesterday I went to my room and just saw her looking for cigarettes in my backpack. I suffered from nose bleeding the last two days, so she got concerned and blame the cigarettes for that. Mothers concern very fast when their children are ill or have some other issues but disturbing a 22-year old persons privacy is not okay!

I felt very uncomfortable because in my backpack were things, that belonged to my privacy. She found the cigarettes in my backpack, some bills, an opened pack of condom (without the condom) and other things. I really got sick because it was very terrible to see my mother saying something about the condom packet. I usually love my mother, even when she’s a control freak and don’t allow me to enjoy the freedom I deserve. But after that incident I am done with her. I don’t see her as my mother anymore. She is now something like a witch for me, who tries to destroy my youth and. She often shouts at me, to my brother, to my cousins or other people who don’t act the way she wants. She is one of the raspiest persons I’ve ever met.

I just wanted to say you, that you all should take care of your privacy like a treasure. Our privacy is a gift to spend some time with our identity and not with the person you pretend to be in public (If you are pretending to be somebody different in public). It’s even very healthy to spend at least 20 minutes with yourself and just doing what you love for example: reading, playing videogames or even smoking cigarettes. You have the freedom to do whatever you love, and this is the reason why life is worth living. If you have the same problem as me and don’t have much privacy, then fight for it! Life is too short and to beautiful to give away one of the most precious things you have: Yourself.

32,"The other day, someone asked me, ""What do you like about yourself?"" It took me almost ten minutes of sitting in silence before I said, ""I like that I am compassionate."" I was asked to go into that deeper, and it was honestly one of the toughest discussions I have had in a long time. It was a self\-realization that I don't actually like myself as much as I thought I did. 

I'm 27 years old, and I am about to graduate from my undergrad. I have been working at a brewery as a manager for 11 months, have trained multiple people and I'm a good employee. I get paid $8/hr. I have never gotten a raise, even though I have attempted to ask for one. Every time I do, I get told I am being paid a living wage where I live because it is under the table. I have been wanting to look for another job, but with school, suffering with PTSD, depression, anxiety and fibromyalgia it has been a struggle to just focus on taking care of my day\-to\-day needs, let alone full on searching for a job. This week I begin my search for a new job, hopefully one where my value is recognized. Unfortunately for me, I don't have a car or a license. I have been trying for over a year to learn to drive and people offer to teach me, I get two weeks of classes and they fall off the planet. There really isn't mass transit where I live.

I am a surviver of child abuse and when I came out to my parents as gay they kicked me on the street and haven't talked to me in ten years. I'm completely on my own. I have thankfully been able to make some good friends and I count that as a huge blessing, because some people don't even have that. I recognize that my life could be much worse. I used to be homeless. While homeless I was raped and later when someone offered to help me I was severely taken advantage of. I've been in abusive relationship after abusive relationship. I have finally broken free of that circle and I'm so happy about that. My life has been a rollercoaster. 

I'm embarrassed of my life because I just can't seem to get on my feet. I have $63 to my name and this has to last me the rest of the month. I'm happy I was able to pay my bills this week so that I will continue to have electricity and a roof over my head, but how is a person supposed to survive off of $63? I don't qualify for food stamps because I'm a student and because of being paid under the table it looks as if I have no income. 

My apartment is horribly managed. My landlord lives overseas and the way my building works we have a manager, but every time I go for help he tells me he is only able to do maintenance on communal areas. I haven't had a working shower since January. My apartment is infested with cockroaches and no one is doing anything about it. Since I do not have money and my job severely underpays me, I have no savings and I feel trapped. I can't move without money and I can't move until I get a car, but I have no money to get a car. I'm limited as to where I can find a job without transportation and the only jobs I can get to by foot are retail or food. I live in a state where minimum wage is very low and servers only get paid like $2/hr because we are expected to live off of tips. I'm also limited what work I can do because of my physical health and I'm just overall very frustrated. I'm scared because I soon have to start paying back my student loans, but I can't even provide for my daily needs, so how am I supposed to cover that? 

Honestly, something that makes me more sad than anything is the fact that my story isn't uncommon. In a country where it is supposed to be the ""land of equal opportunity"", ""the land of the free"", ""the land of the brave"".....it's all a lie. There are hundreds of college graduates living without jobs, without healthcare, without family, without friends, without basic necessities. The bachelor's degree is the new high school diploma. It seems like anymore to get a job one has to get a masters degree and live totally in debt. I'm tired of being told to pull myself up by my boot straps. I feel stuck in a structure that I can't get out of and I'm embarrassed that I'm almost 30 and I can't make it on my own. Society is only focused on money and that's all that matters. It's going to collapse. It's just a matter of time. What happened to the value of human life? Human life now has a dollar sign associated with it, and if you don't meet a certain standard then you just aren't anything.      ",03May2018,5

34,"We've been in the same middle school for two years and never spoke to each other, recently I wrote her on Instagram and since then (like three or four months ago, maybe more) we're chatting every day.
We hung out with some other people a couple of times and one time just the two of us (sometimes we met by chance, but I'm not counting it).
I feel really good with her, and we talk literally about everything, but she has a boyfriend and I don't really know what to do.
He's really possessive and jealous, he want she to tell him everything she does, who she's with and when she's going out, and he get mad if she hang out with other guys, even really close friends.
She told me several times she wants to break up with him, but when she tries he makes her think only about his qualities and the good times they had together, and then she feels guilty.
I don't expect her to be with me, at least for now, but I want her to feel good and don't be always down and/or anxious because of a psychopath boyfriend.
What should I do? I really like her and she might feel the same for me, but I'm not sure about it and I don't want to screw it up.

39,"First thing, i'm not the stereotypical man that will have ''niceguy'' written with neon over my head. I've always been very independant and i'm averagely succesfull concerning girls. I had no problems breaking out with my gf after spending 4 months with her due to i going overseas for half the year in a couple weeks. Our relationship was fairy light so i wasn't invested that much on it. There is another girl always willing to fuck when i ask her, but otherwise i never really see her.

Now on my main subject. I have a very close girl friend since multiples years and one of the only ones i stick with regurarly. She's on pair with my males bestfriends. She knows almost everything on my life and i've always been super comfortable with her. She's my go to when i have an immediate story to tell or when i need an opinion on something. Hell, when i fuck somebody new she's the first i text about the event, even before texting the dudes. She's also super independant so she enjoys my stories, specially cuz she knew me when i was still a virgin . When i first started to hang out with her in college we were drunk buddies, nothing much else. We still are. I also viewed her more as a friend in the beginning so no absolute feelings, other than the fact that i found her attractive. The only thing that happened was me straight asking her like 4 or 5 times to become fuckfriends in our first year in college lol. I was pretty stupid in the past. She's never been really interested and always seen me as simply a good buddy so she always declined but didn't take it wrong. We've always kinda laughed off it how badly skilled i was before, now that i grew up. 

Back on the present, 4 years later. I don't know why, since i broke up with my gf i started having dreams at night of me and my best friend. Some of these dreams we were making love. It kind of triggered some feelings for her but strangely that wasn't as sexual arousal as just an extremely warm feeling. She's the only girl i'm really close with and i realized how much i feeled ''at home'' with her. Last night we were drinking and she complained how sexually frustrated she was as she didn't had anybody for months. That was the strike that made my mind melt. I proposed that i knew somebody that would do a great job and as she got interested i started describing myself.  She laughed but declined the offer, as by now she would definitely find it awkward to have an experience with me after all that time. And well, i kinda insisted that night and was intrusive,  taking her by the arm to talk to her in private, away from the group, to tell my own desire for her. I was insisting why not, and i was unable to take no for an answer. I was downright douchey ignoring the guys and completely focusing my night trying to convince her...how much a hole i digged myself in. Insisting always just make it worse damnit. I kept arguing how good friends we were and with how close we are she was cold and bitchy for cockholding me for complaining about her sexual frustration and still refusing it with me. I then asked if she wanted to get drunk together with me only tomorrow(well today), and she wasn't really pleased with the idea and i kept insisting for it. I then telled her to fuck off as to why she didn't trust me to just spend a night drinking with her after all these years. I don't know how uncomfortable she must have felt.

I woked up this morning completely confused on my feelings. I wasn't able to speak with anybody today and really i fucking wished i could open my skull and take out the sentiments logbook my brain is writing so i could understand the words to describe the sensation. It's a mix of shame, rage, jealousy for the next guys she's going to get with, emotional loneliness and disgust for every other part of my life right now, however relax my life is right now. 

My head got corrupted man..i want something with her and can't accept atm to just let her alone. ",03May2018,0
40,"Hello everyone, I’m going to tell you how I go through life with regarding relationships or friendships. From high school till now almost 3 years out I still believe everyone hates me or people try to be nice and not rude. When I mean everyone hates I not saying they calling me names and shit along those lines I just think they rather not deal with me. I have a couple of friends online and play games with for the last five years but irl is a different story. I don’t get along with people my own age but older kids or people I’m great with. Why do you think that I think people hate me? Is self confidence? I don’t think this is bad because I’m perfectly fine with not having friends but I do want them but I get out often plus I’m not 21 to go to the bars around me. My parents and sister think I’m fucking nuts to not have irl friends and girlfriend yet. ",03May2018,2

He didn't take it seriously, or he's a complete asshole, because he thought it's a good idea to try to hug her all the time, y'know, he was just trying to be as close to her (mainly physically) as he could. I don't even know why he did that.

I saw nothing wrong of this and felt pretty good and confident after shaving. But that has changed as my balls don't look healthy, my ballsack has sagged up and become dry and gotten a redish and pinkish colour. My penis also feels a little dry and crusty and this worries me that I might have gotten an infection. I tried googling this problem but was unable to find an answer that sounded similar to my story. They only thing I found with a similar problem was something the scared me, the answers to that question said that the person might lose their balls if they don't go see a doctor. I am asking you guys and girls who know anything about this if it is a serious health hazard and might leave me hurt if not treated or if this will heal over time.

46,"so over the summer last year after junior year of high school I had my first long-term girlfriend. I had dated before, but never for more than a few weeks. Just little stints with girls that always seemed to be fuller of red flags than a Beijing mayday parade until that summer.

 Anyway, she was from a tiny tiny tiny town about an hour from where I lived, but it was July so it wasn't an issue: my family was comfortably middle class and driving out two or three times a week was fine. 

Once school started things changed a little. I could only see her on weekends, and as summer turned into fall my romantic life shifted from lying in the grass in the damp, humid summers of upstate New York toward dinner dates in the smallish cities around us - riding down in the morning for my rugby matches, then breaking off from the team with her to go to some upscale coffee shop or pub downtown. I must have eaten at every place worth eating at there last year.

when I was with her I had a reason to get through the week. I finally felt like I had some energy to go out and do things - in the fall I had to juggle my school's cross country and my own rugby commitments, but I was somehow able to, and I would say she was part of the reason why.

But I'm not anymore.

I remember every detail of that weekend. It was right before we got out on Thanksgiving break; that Saturday she and I had gone out with my parents to a Thai place right on the river at night, and overlooking a dirty alleyway I finally got her to try sushi. We went as a group then to a coffee shop on main Street and just talked for hours about how I had more or less followed exactly in my father's footsteps - going to the same college, playing rugby, meeting a girl from the same sort of little mining town. 

That was the last time I saw her.

 On Sunday she had a field hockey practice, and when I got the news she had gotten a concussion I didn't think anything of it. She was always getting injured in that sport, as an experienced track guy myself I would help with massages and stretching when she was feeling sore. 

But this injury was different. for a week or two she told me she would be fine, but she couldn't ride in a car without throwing up to get to school ten minutes away, let alone an hour to my house. 

After a long month or so of this, in late December I decided enough was enough and drove down to see her at her house. Her town was really not much more than a gas station and to get there was an hour long hike through terrible, unplowed country roads in the winter so I hadn't had an opportunity to go all the way down in a while.

But the girl who answered the door when I knocked was not the one I had known. The extent of the damage done to her was difficult to gauge over snapchat; when all you have is text the little intricacies of interaction are gone. But when I saw her I knew she was gone. there was just such a lack of presence and lack of understanding, I can't even describe it. It would take her a minute of processing to answer anything I said.

when I got home I cried myself to sleep.

she was gone. I tried to keep up the relationship for another few weeks but by the time Christmas was upon us, it was clear that between her injury and the distance between us, we were over.

During the winter I buried myself in my work, and it was mildly successful. If I never had time to think, I never had time to cry about it. That one comic about ""just keep moving, working out, doing laundry, don't let the existential dread set in,"" was pretty much my life from January until April of this year. 

But now that the weather is warm, that rugby has started up again, and that I'm now driving to my old haunts around the state it feels like everything I used to enjoy just brings me back to last summer, and leaves me crying with nostalgia and regret. 

I obviously never actually dealt with that breakup, and I think it's because it didn't feel like a breakup, it felt like a death. The girl I loved didn't just stop loving me, she's more completely mentally gone. I still wish I could have stayed with her and been by her side through this, but honestly I was too far away and she too damaged to be able to deal with me in her life. 

I thought I had moved on, but I haven't. I still wake up in the middle of the night feeling alone, and driving home with music on sometimes a song will come on and I'll be crying again. 

At this point also my ability to try and find a new relationship is more or less nil. I leave for college in August, there's just no time to fill the void left before I'm out of here for good. Instead, it seems like the plan is to just sort of mope around and wait for the fall and bitch about it to Reddit. Maybe I'll feel better again in a couple weeks, maybe not. Wish I knew.",03May2018,2
47,"The thought alone of going into his class sets my teeth on edge. I am one college student enrolled in a class with a total of 5 students. My professor is undoubtedly an intelligent man but for the sake of ""inciting conversation"" he plays the devils advocate and puts down certain view points. The class is meant as a conversation, and it's not like any of us are inherently wrong with what we take from our reading but it never seems to be what he wants. I constantly feel belittled and stupid and it makes participating in this class an anxiety inducing experience. I can't hide either, when it's such a small class size. I already have poor self esteem and have made significant progress since highschool and can't help but feel that within a semester has set me back significantly by seemingly never giving us a break. It's not his fault for the way I feel but the way he teaches is not necessarily inducing participation among me or my peers. I don't know how to deal with this kind of person except to avoid them.

52,"I was shocked to recently learn that over 50% of college campuses employ a rigid system forcing students to engage in the [most nefarious form of cultural appropriation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/collegeprose/2012/08/27/americas-foreign-language-deficit/#2186b0f14ddc).  Yes, over half of college campuses require that young people learn a foreign language, regardless of whether they are of that culture or not.  Saying their words, using their phrases, often watching their television shows and reading their literature.  

This kind of disrespect MUST end.  Sure, the people in other countries SAY they are fine with it, but that is just because they don't understand what an insult it is to have their language trodden on by privileged Americans (probably white, amirite) showing an interest in it.
