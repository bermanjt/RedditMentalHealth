Can you give me some ideas? What did you like at your wedding or one you went to?

1,"To my closest friend I‚Äôve ever had. 

Thank you so much, and I‚Äôm sorry. You‚Äôve listened to me when nobody else would, talked me through things professionals couldn‚Äôt, and you‚Äôve defended me from others when I couldn‚Äôt do it myself. 
You took the roles nobody else fulfilled in my life.  Like a parent, like a brother brother. You treated me with respect and nurturing like nobody else has. 
When I started to internalize that you cared, I pushed you further and further out of my life. I was horrible to you. 
I‚Äôm sorry I pushed just a little bit too far, and I want my best friend back. Even if we do begin talking again, our relationship won‚Äôt ever be the same. It‚Äôll always have that tender scar, and fortified emotional walls. My heart hurts, and it‚Äôs all my fault on this one. I‚Äôm crushed. üò≠

Apparently Beth took a ton of sleeping pills last night and she just told her about it, so now Anna is trying to convince her to go to the doctor. No idea how recoverable that kind of situation is, but I've encouraged Anna to do her best in convincing her and not give up.

But what next? Assuming things go south, I have zero clue how to deal with someone who just lost a friend. I've never lost a loved one before, and never had any friend who has lost someone either (only acquaintances where a ""My condolences"" suffices, not anyone I ever talked to regularly)

I can't even imagine how she'll feel if that happens and have no idea how to act. I don't want to stop talking to her but I can't exactly be joking around and stuff like usual. And since we only know each other online and are on different countries I can't really hug her or be there for her.

She already has a boyfriend, (and probably wouldn't like me that way anyway), so there isn't really a chance. So I need to get over her, preferably without having to avoid her like a lot of suggestions I've seen have said to do, because I do like being her friend (not because I imagine any chance, but because I legitimately like being her friend). Besides, I see her a lot in school, so avoiding her would be tough even if I did want to.

10,"As someone in my early 20s, I thought I would be going out with friends and enjoying my life. Instead, here I am asking strangers on the internet for advice on how to make friends.

A bit of a backstory of me; I live in a small town that is roughly a 30 minute drive from the city. Our bus system included a 2 buses that leave town before 8am, and return after 5pm, for people commuting to work in the city. I also do not have a car.
Along with this, I have struggled with mental illness for years, and my anxiety (especially social anxiety) has worsened over the last year. 
I have my best friend, we get together as often as we can, but aside from her and her boyfriend, the only other people I have contact with (aside from my immediate family) are my co-workers (most of whom are closer with each other that with me as they have worked together for years). 
The other friends I had used to invite me out every weekend. Unfortunately my boss has me work early mornings every weekend, and since I could never go out with them, either because of work or lack of transportation to the city, those friends eventually stopped contacting me altogether.

So now that you have an idea of my situation, here is where the advice comes in. How would you recommend someone in my situation make new friends? Because of my anxiety, just going up to someone and talking is very difficult for me, especially since I automatically assume I‚Äôm being severely judged, which makes me extremely self-conscious, which makes me more hesitant around other people (honestly I feel that way just typing this, but at least here no one knows who I am). I‚Äôm so tired of being lonely all the time, I‚Äôm tired of having no one to talk to, I‚Äôm tired of being so afraid of being judged that it makes me afraid of other people. Any advice would be appreciated.

If you're born white, rich, pretty, intelligent, with a loving family, healthy or any combination of multiple of the above your life becomes exceedingly easy.

You'll be handed chance after chance, you'll be treated well, you'll make a good impression by default, you'll rarely be denied anything at all.

Now being born poor, a minority, not no smart, ugly, to a single parent, with health issues, life will be hard on you. Everything you do will be a struggle, you'll be arbitrarily denied chances, you'll be stopped, you'll be frisked, you'll be judged harshly without a reason.

This is the world we live in and it sickens me, it sickens me that conditions outside our control dictate our lives.

you know what really sucks? i've had \-three\- near death experiences in my life and i narrowly cheated death each time, it's like...why the fuck did i try so hard to survive if i was just going to end up being so suicidal. tbh i blame those goddamned EMS techs with their quick response times for not letting me die with some dignity \(sarcasm, if you're actually an EMT shoutout 2 u because you do a great job\)

On Reddit, you'll see people posting their hatred for Amy Schumer almost on a daily basis. 

Outside of Reddit, I never hear, read or see anything about her. Based on the things I have read about her in Reddit comments, I assume she is a relatively unfunny one trick pony comedian, so I guess I wouldn't like her shows. What I don't understand though, is why Redditors feel the incessant need to constantly post about her. What's up with that? If you don't like her comedy, just don't watch her shows. Why do redditors feel the need to constantly post about her? Am I missing something? Is there a world out there where she is the number one celebrity and everyone talks about her on a daily basis? Because I sure as hell am not a part of that world: I have literally seen or heard her name mentioned maybe two or three times outside of Reddit. Yet if you believe Reddit, she is fucking everywhere.

I have no opinion on her. I have never seen one of her shows. And if I did, I probably wouldn't like them, because her style does not sound similar to my preferred style of comedy. But I don't hate her or anything, I just don't watch her shows.

Does this hatred tie in to Reddit's tendency to latch on to a dozen topics which they either bash or praise in literally every fucking discussion? It's so dull and boring. The same topics keep coming up every single fucking discussion. You don't have to spend a lot of time on Reddit to know what they are. Redditors hate, among other things, anti-vaxxers (so do I, but why bring them up on literally every thread?), the city of Gary, IN, Amy Schumer, TapOut clothing (fair), third wave feminism, and Comcast. Redditors love, among other things, Elon Musk, weed, the trivia fact that Cleopatra lived closer to our times than the construction of the Great Pyramid of Gizah, Star Wars, straight razor shaving, and craft beer.

It wasn't so much a fetish for me at first, but it was necessary for our marriage as I am unable to satisfy her needs completely and she loves me too much to leave me. Until now, things have been good. My wife has had dozens of lovers and a few long term boyfriends. It's a mutually beneficial arrangement - my wife has her fun, and I have learnt to enjoy watching her. I enjoy selecting them for her as I feel it helps me improve my own performance.

Until now, I've been good friends with all my wife's boyfriends. I'm not bi and my wife has admitted it would be a turn off for her to watch me service other men, so that's never happened. Usually they'd just meet me in my lunch hour at work and I'd grab us all a coffee or what have you.

A few months ago she met a man at a work function and by all accounts they hit it off immediately. At my wife's request I tend to give her space with new boyfriends, so last night was the first time I met this guy. I don't want to go into detail, but he forcefully penetrated me. My wife asked him to leave immediately. We sat and talked the whole night (mainly just me crying and her comforting me).

This is a breaking point for us. My wife has broken up with him and will be visiting him one last time this weekend to tell him never to contact us and not to lay a finger on me again. It looks like our cuckolding adventure has come to an end.

Just need to get it out there, shes so open, caring, she seems confident and content in her life, and I honestly aspire to be like that, and in the future want someone like that. So now shes on my mind 24/7 and I cannot shake it.",11May2018,3

The development of exponentially more robust means of telecommunications in the last century, or so,  set alongside the steady rise of Consumer Culture in modern society has drastically changed the way we experience life and the world around us. Alone or paired, intentional depictions of sexuality and advertising are two things today that have become virtually impossible for a functioning member of society to avoid. It should come as no surprise that their tenacious and widespread integration into everyday life was one accomplished hand-in-hand. 

[The example of sex in advertising I‚Äôve chosen for this post](https://linx.li/selif/5gtjz6kg.png) was part of an Herbal Essences ad campaign more notorious for its television commercials than anything else. Even without the added stimuli television provides, I think this particular paper ad does just as good a job at evoking whatever emotions the Herbal Essences marketing team most likely intended it to.

Right off the bat, this ad features two pretty obvious examples of sex in advertising that also happen to be two of America‚Äôs favorite past times:  sudsy babes and exaggerated female orgasms. That aside, many more common examples of sex in advertising are also observable.
 The model here is a typical example of Western culture‚Äôs‚Äù ideal‚Äù or ‚Äúsexy‚Äù  woman: skinny, curvaceous figure, long blonde hair, straight white teeth, manicured nails, blemish free skin, and impossibly symmetrical brows; a dime a dozen in the world of advertising.
The completely ambiguous age of this particular model is another common technique utilized by advertisers who wish to draw attention from individuals of various age groups. The model in this ad could arguably be pegged from anywhere between 28 and 45 years of age.

 The sexually provocative pose being struck by the model is certainly one of the tricks here, albeit, one of the older ones. She‚Äôs also completely nude, dripping wet, and showing quite a bit of skin. Always a bonus in drawing the eye of unsuspecting consumers. What more could a truly effective advertisement offer besides gorgeous, ageless, wet, buxom nude women? Herbal Essences answered that question for us almost twenty years ago:
You probably have also noticed by now that the model in this advertisement also happens to be lost in an uncontrollable fit of orgasmic pleasure, the likes of which only the most prodigious line of hair soaps and body washes could ever possibly deliver. This ad has got it all right?

That‚Äôs only the beginning. The model is only there to get you to look at what else is happening in the ad. To the left of our sudsy babe is the delightfully clever hook, ‚ÄúOur new moisture rich lather turns H2O into H2Ohhhh!‚Äù Four letter ‚Äòh‚Äôs‚Äô are added to the second H2O in order to assure any possibly concerned or confused viewers that the model in this ad is not currently experiencing a stroke induced seizure, but that she is indeed totally cumming her fucking brains out. In advertising, it‚Äôs important that your message be clear and unambiguous. Unlike the age of [Nancy O‚Äô Face, here.](https://linx.li/selif/5gtjz6kg.png)

Just in case the image wasn‚Äôt pornographic enough, Herbal Essences went ahead and placed a nice thick, large image of their own phallic shaped body wash container, tilted about 45 degrees shy of where the dick would be if our model were sitting on it. That, or the bottle‚Äôs placement could be meant to represent a climaxing penis, as well as the mythical ‚Äúdual orgasm‚Äù. The synchronized orgasms of both the bottle and model even complements the model‚Äôs sudsy shoulder suspiciously well. It must have been meant to work on both levels! Inter-coital inter-climax and synchronized post-coital inter-climax. These guys seriously overlooked this advert‚Äôs potential to sell face wash though. Either way, with ads like these, who needs porn? This one‚Äôs got it all right here. That, or I‚Äôm over-analyzing.

To the bottom right is your typical series of meaningless buzz words and other useless product jargon, as well as two more inferences to the orgasmic pleasure this product grants, ‚ÄúOHHHH YES!‚Äù And finally, aside from the butchering of any credible meaning the word might have ever had, the use of the word ‚Äúorganic‚Äù in the very last phrase ‚ÄúA TOTALLY ORGANIC EXPERIENCE,‚Äù aside from being completely untrue, makes absolutely no sense, and is also awfully close to the word ‚Äúorgasmic.‚Äù If any sincere coincidence exists within this advertisement, that could be the one, only because I know how Americans love the word ‚Äúorganic,‚Äù amongst others. I wouldn‚Äôt put it past those clever marketing guys, though. They might have missed the face wash thing, but ads like these don‚Äôt just reek of sex, they reek of genius. A soul is a small price to pay for the enlightenment the Marketing Gurus who thought up this masterpiece must have achieved in life. 

Herbal Essences is a shampoo manufactured by Clairol, a trusted name in all things hair and personal-care. Historically, Clairol‚Äôs success in maximizing profit margins by utilizing strategic advertising methods has been rather impressive. Few commercial products have managed to swale public opinion and squash cultural taboos the way Clairol has been able to. In the 1950s, Clairol introduced the first at-home hair-coloring product America had ever seen. 

Through a clever ad campaign, the corporation was able to change the idea of hair-colorization amongst America‚Äôs women from one reserved only for inelegant ham-fisted bimbos, to a popular practice, albeit still a secret one at first. The sales figures observable six years after the release of Clairol‚Äôs at-home hair color kit are proof enough that by the time, most women in the US had managed to color their hair at least once.
In the 1990s, Clairol was able to do it again. Herbal Essences was a relatively successful ‚Äúhigh-end‚Äù hair-care product in the 1970s and 1980s, but advances in technology meant its formula would become a much more typical one, removing its ‚Äúhigh end‚Äù status. For years the brand‚Äôs sales waned, so in 1995 Clairol decided to give it a unique revamp. 

Between 1995 and 2001, as a result of its orgasmic ad campaign, and targeting a younger demographic, Herbal essences was able to grab a pretty significant share of the shampoo market and helped increase Clairol‚Äôs annual gross by more than one billion dollars. Did the sex sell for Herbal Essences? Big time. 

It sold so well, in-fact, that Proctor &amp; Gamble, who held the largest share of the market at the time, made the decision to purchase Clairol entirely. Crisis averted. While P&amp;G were able to drive Herbal essences sales margins even further, the brand has never been able to supersede the likes of Pantene or the undisputed best-selling shampoo in the world, Head and Shoulders. I‚Äôm sure P&amp;G doesn‚Äôt mind though, because they own both. Market cannibalism at its finest.",11May2018,0
52,"I feel like a cuckold at my job. I was brought in to oversee the affairs of part of the company, but this guy who previously reported to my boss but now 'reports' to me is actively insubordinate because he feels threatened about me trying to take his job. My boss won't do anything about it nor let me reprimand him, so I have a guy who constantly is off for things and doesn't tell me and who constantly throws me under the bus for stuff. When he fucks up and i bring it to his attention, he gets super fucking defensive.

It fucking sucks. Next job i'm going to make sure i have direct power to sanction people who report to me.",11May2018,3

I didn't do the homework I planned to do, the girl I'm dating seems to not be *that* in to me, I did nothing all day long and I thought that the volunteering work that i do was closed because of a national holiday but it wasnt so now I was even less productive. It makes me want to off myself, but at least I got a picture from this fabulous sad cat that made me laugh really hard, so that's definitely a ray of sunshine today.
