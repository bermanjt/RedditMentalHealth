1,"This is a throwaway account so excuse the random account name.

I've been under the suspicion that my mom has been in an affair for the last two months. Ever since I came home from uni this past christmas, my mom's been ""out"" more often and stays out really late on friday and saturday nights. I found this strange because she never did this before, like ever. When I ask her where she's going she just says she's going to a ""friends"" house. That was fine for a while until I realized she would never tell me what friend she was seeing. I've even tried to be subtle and insist on her telling me, but she's brushed me off saying it's simply just a friend. 

Just today I confirmed my suspicions when I found a valentines day and birthday card to my mom from the other guy stating that he has never been happier now that they're together and all type of jazz. My dad has been working overseas for a good part of the last decade, but has always treated my mom in the best way he can and visits a few times every year and buys her nice gifts for any special occasion. This is what devastates me the most... They were immigrants and came to Canada together with me and it seemed like neither of them would ever do such a f***ed up act like this. I still can't even believe it.

What makes this a thousand times worse for me is that she is my boss at the accounting firm we both work at. I've dreamed of getting this job and was so grateful being accepted, and I now deal and talk to her every single day. For the time being I'm also living at home to save some money, so now I will know exactly when she's going to see this guy and for how long. It's pretty much like rubbing it in my face. I've gone through every single emotion I can think of -anger, disgust, sadness, frustration.. I just don't know what to do. I am so close to confronting her about it but am worried that it will become a living nightmare at work and at home if things go sour. My current plan after some self-debating is to just try my best to be strong and continue my life as is. If I end up cracking at some point, then I guess I end up cracking. But I really hope that this affair will simply die out or my parents deal with it themselves without me being involved somehow.

Sorry for the long post. I literally have no one to talk to about it and needed a place to vent before exploding from not being able to tell somebody, even if its a complete stranger. I don't want to tell any of my friends or girlfriend because everyone always respected my mom and it would truly change the way they see her which would worsen my feelings and my emotional state. 

TL DR: Found out my mom is having an affair and am completely devastated. She is also my boss at my new job I was planning on keeping for the foreseeable future and still live at home trying to save money. I don't want to tell anyone so all I can do is vent here in the meantime.",02Mar2018,1
2,"This will be a long one but I need to get the thoughts out of my head and in front of my eyes and what better place to post it than anonymously to a group of strangers aha.

The short story is I’m lost. I don’t know what I believe and I’m scared shitless about not existing (like after death). 

The long story starts in a quantum physics lesson. I was bought up in a strictly Muslim family (the kind that will probably sent you to a psycho conversion camp if you showed any signs of disbelief and I’m a 19 year old girl so cultural sexism rules that I’ll be treated much worse than the male equivalent yay) so my religious practices were more for the sake of keeping my parents happy rather than my own interest- I believed everything my parents told me without question because I wasn’t supposed to question things, that would be an act of defiance. So anyways in this quantum physics lesson, we’re learning about atoms and how they’re made of protons, neutrons and electrons and how those are made of quarks and leptons or something like that and in turn those are made of up down and strange and so on and it really stuck with me for some strange reason. 

It wasn’t an immediate eureka moment but rather a glass that’d been filling up drop by drop my whole life and this lesson was the final drop that caused the entire thing to spill. It may sound ridiculous to some but I guess to me it made humans seem less like superior spiritual beings and more like a bundle of programmed reactions made of the same thing as everything else. It sort of dehumanised humans if that makes any sense- it made me feel like we don’t have souls or a greater purpose or anything like that.

And now I just feel so fucked because I’m in this limbo where I want to believe in something but my brain just won’t have it and it’s always bringing in rationale to every belief. One thing I don’t want is to believe in something for the sake of believing in it. I want my belief to have evidence and logic which I can’t seem to find right now and that terrifies me the most because what if I screw up and die before I even find out what I believe and turns out there’s a deity who’s gonna throw me into the pits of hell for something I don’t even know.

Second. Why is it always the people you're supposed to trust in your house that steal? It's always like a cleaning service or hospice nurses. 


What really bothers me is they know I'm a veteran. the military paid for my move since I just got out. And they thanked me for my service before they left. That kind of thing already makes me uncomfortable.

5,"Years ago, when I was beginning to get into my previous romantic relationship, my brain was programmed to be so selfless it bordered on being unhealthy. I would be so absorbed in wondering what my partner was thinking or feeling that I’d forget to consider my own emotions. This went of for years and the relationship ended very badly. Through talk therapy, reading about my psychology and just mentally changing my behavior I was able to turn my selflessness around. However, now that I’m beginning a new relationship, I fear that maybe I’ve taken the change too far and am now exhibiting selfish behaviors. How can I find balance when I’ve only experienced the two extremes of the spectrum?

6,"I am in my mid-thirties, married with kids and employed full time. I have been so lonely even with people around me. I have been fighting depression and it has been steadily getting worse and worse and so I have been isolating and holding people at arm’s length because I am afraid to let them see that I am not okay. It is getting harder to hide that I am not okay so I don’t let them get close enough to see. The only adults I see regularly are my co-workers (who I definitely do not want to know about my depression) and my husband who gets stressed out by my depression. The friends I have are not people I see regularly—once every couple of months—so they don’t know to ask how I am doing and I likely wouldn’t answer truthfully if they asked. I used to participate once a week in a group hobby where I saw and socialized with people who I genuinely liked and valued and who seemed to like and value me but that fell apart a year ago and I lost those people. I have been increasingly feeling like I am invisible and like I have no value, like I am carrying around this huge burdensome secret and I have no one to share it with. 

So, when my therapist told me that I have value and I deserve to be able to talk to friends and tell them how I am feeling, I just broke down. Right now, no one in my life seems to value me. I could drop off the face of the earth and it wouldn’t have a huge impact on anyone other than my husband and kids. And I feel so lonely. I can’t just go out and meet new people because I am vulnerable and emotionally fragile right now and I have social anxiety so getting to know new people, with all the attendant little micro-rejections, is extremely stressful and makes things worse. But, I feel like I if I could regularly spend time with people who I can feel comfortable with and who genuinely value me as a person, it would help me to start to pull out of this downward depression spiral.

12,"Hey all,

Not too sure if this is where I should post but I guess writing my thoughts down might help. 

I’ll try to make this quick and concise. At the end of last year I broke up with my ex (3 year relationship). This resulted in my confidence being zapped and I guess brought my motivation down as well. I was lucky, I was finishing up with uni soon after the break up, so I could take time to myself and recover over the holidays. 

Over the holidays I met a guy at my new job and he taught me all about i, I guess, confidence, how to talk to girls etc etc and explained it in a way that I understood. So basically over the holidays I studied what e preached and was ready to put it to practice to potentially find a new SO when I uni starts up again. 

It started up this Monday. It’s been a hectic week. The first day I initiated conversation with a girl - I would’ve never done this before. And then the next day I got clear signs of attraction from another girl (who is actually really cool). So that’s that, impressive for me, right. Well I didn’t stop there I decided to make some friends. So yesterday I threw myself into a group of people (mix of boys and girls). It’s was the funnest 2 hour lecture I ever had. 

By the end of the day it seemed as if they really accepted me, they were all talking, It felt amazing - I haven’t been part of a friendship group since about 3 years ago. 

Today in class, we had to find groups and I went over to a pair of really attractive girls that I’ve been eyeing out since last year and had them laughing and talking. This made me feel like I was invincible, I’m finally approaching attractive girls I would have never before! 

I guess what I’m over thinking now is today when I saw that group, one of them said hi the other didn’t really pay much attention, I was sitting relatively close to them but I was just with another friend. At the end of that lecture I got up to go talk to me “new group of friends” but it seemed as if they all got up and left and went there own way, It was kind of just me and one other guy. 

I feel, maybe I’m not meant to be sociable, maybe I’m a nice person but not someone wants to be around a lot, maybe I’m annoying. Maybe I’ve been alone for too long... I’m not too sure. 

All support is appreciated. 

All the best! ",02Mar2018,1

14,"i would rather have my eyes clawed out than experience this any longer. 

i had a good, tight knit, friend group all throughout grade school (what we call elementary school in Canada) and high school. once we graduated and went to university, we split. i've known some of those guys since I was a little kid, and to just split like that makes me think the friendship wasn't as strong as I thought it was, even though all hung out often. 

i'm 21 now. for the past three years i've not had any close friends. sure, there are people I know, but I we don't really hang out outside of school, or even really at school very much. i play in bands too, and I guess my bandmates could be considered friends but we don't hang out other than a weekly or bi-weekly practice/show.

i *never* used to feel lonely. the reason the friend group split, was largely because of me. i started isolating myself from everyone in my final year of high school. i'm just an introvert; always was okay with being alone and not doing anything on weekend nights. but now it's getting to me. 

i am introspective to a fault. it's to such a degree that I have felt severely disconnected from the world many times. going for a walk in nature always cures me, but the pain of not having anyone there with me in those woods hurts so bad I just feel like sitting down. i've felt like crying so many times, but the tears just won't come. 

i have at least identified a major source of my unhappiness and loneliness: no romantic partner. of course, in cases like mine, there is always a girl. 

i noticed her right at the beginning of last semester; we had two classes together. i'm not sure about love at first sight, but I did immediately feel something for her. by the second or third day I was completely smitten. a not so minor crush had developed. 

what did I (and still do) see in her? a very quiet, introverted, sorta loner who completely met my ideal in just about every way; from her face to her hips, her voice, and even the way she walks. 

so throughout the semester, i'm making it very obvious I like her. basically doing everything just short of telling her. she caught me checking her out a few times, and once early on in the semester  rolled her eyes at me, which I thought was cute. 

soon enough there were some hopeful signs: she begins to sit in spots near me at the library in between classes which she never went to before; she stands near me; she looks at me and quickly looks down when I catch her; suddenly the wall behind me becomes very interesting to her: the obvious signs of a shy girl ""in like"" with someone.

we did speak, but only short conversations about school. during the two days of exams, she continued to stand by me. on the last day, after the exams were done, she was pretty much waiting for me. she kept looking at me with these eyes that said ""ask me out."" i didn't. there was a reason for this, and it was a simple error in judgement relating to something else but about her. massive regret set in later that night. i wrote some very long journal entries about the whole thing. 

now this semester we don't have any classes together. i've decided to ask her out provided I see her alone (i've seen her a few times - still look at each other), but I still feel like i've fucked up massively. i know you can say, ""well there's other girls out there,"" but I don't *want* other girls; i want *her*. 

i don't get over things. it's to the point now where I have been writing non stop journal entries regarding her for the past three days (that's some shit nobody will ever read). i simply cannot stop obsessing over her. i feel like in the event that she ever says ""yes,"" I will have already ruined it before it began. it isn't an innocent crush anymore, i've twisted it into something else. 

i don't fuckin know. this tab was open for over 5 hours. i feel like it loses steam about halfway through but whatever. maybe I just needed to vent. i know it's long, just comment on whatever part you can. ",02Mar2018,2

16,"I had a dream I was in a hotel room, a fancy place with marble floors and frosted glass walls everywhere. My room was both immaculate and modern and at the same time impossibly cozy and quaint, like a bed and breakfast. A hallway led to a wide curving room with a foaming white tub in a nook. By the nook was a wooden cabinet, kind of battered, and I opened it. It had pullout drawers of magazines and books, and most of them were erotic reading material clearly intended to entertain naked bathers. They were soft and a bit tattered from use, but the effect wasn’t icky, it was communal and comforting, a nod from the proprietors that a traveler might fancy a wank or at least an erotic daydream in the bath.
 
I disrobed and wrapped a giant, plush white towel around myself, and then I turned and saw the front desk. Right there. It was right fucking there, around a corner in the same room. This wasn’t my room after all, it was a lobby. I looked around for my clothes but didn’t see them, and I could hear the staff greeting guests just feet away. At any moment someone could turn the corner and find me mostly naked with a small book sporting a vintage sepia nude on the cover.
 
I walked across the lobby toward my room, and the whole hotel turned into a fishbowl arena with me the sole point of focus. The desk staff, two coiffed women with a stiff air of customer-service grace, told me in friendly icicle voices that the tub was open to all guests, and they smiled and looked away courteously. Their failure to laugh or commiserate with me was damningly cold, and I hurried to find my room but when I got to it (it was very close), I realized that the entire front wall of the room was thick transparent glass, the kind with the aquamarine tint of a windshield.

You go to the store. You see a $20 sweater and a $50 sweater. You buy the $20 sweater, it's *cheaper*. 


But the $50 sweater is locally integrated. From the cotton to the factory, to the brand. It's all made within a 20 mile radius. A cotton farmer sends cotton to a fabric factory. The fabric factory sends it to a clothing brand. The clothing brand designs and makes the sweater and sells it. 


Meanwhile, the $20 sweater is globally integrated. The cotton comes from India. It gets shipped to Bangladesh. The fabric factory in Bangladesh sells to China. China makes the Sweater. An American brand puts there name on it and ships it to your store and sells it for $20. 


Every step of the way, the cheapest labor was sourced. The cheapest cotton farmer. The cheapest fabric factory worker. The cheapest sweater maker. The brand pays the lowest for marketing employees. The store got a tax break to be built in your area. 


So you've undercut yourself. You not buying the locally integrated product means less incentive for employment in the local area. 


That means the local brand shuts down. The local factory has no one to sell to. They shut down. The local cotton farmer has no one to sell to. They shut down. 


All these employees start applying to work where you work. 


There's now more labor available then demand. Your wages stay low. 


You make less. So now you buy cheaper products. Next year, when that sweater gets a hole in it. You'll buy the $15 sweater. Why? Because your boss never gave you a raise. 


Cheaper products via globalization is a fiction. By buying cheaper we've undercut our own labor price. But that means we can't afford more expensive, local items now and the death spiral continues.

45,"TL;DR at the bottom for anyone not in the mood to read a story.

So for this entire week, my friend in Uni accommodation had been acting very out of the ordinary. Monday and Tuesday he was normal, but he kept talking about conspiracy-like things, seeing correlation in things that were going on in his life right now and from what he said, almost sounded like he thought he could control what was happening - but I didn't pay too much attention to it at this point as he was being pretty normal.

On Wednesday morning, I messaged him asking if he wanted to come to the gym and he didn't respond, but I thought he had just slept in. I go to the gym, lectures, the library and then come back in the evening - still no sign of him, which was strange. I check my computer to see that his girlfriend had added me on Facebook, so I accept. Within seconds, she messages me explaining that the night prior he was on Facetime to her saying very worrying things and had basically broken up with her, and that I should go check on him. So I go check, and demand he tell me whats going on. 

He reveals that he had indeed broken up with her, but for no reason. He then shows me that he had smashed his Macbook in a fit of rage, his phone was broken and he had no contact with anyone but our flat (he is an international student, has come to Uni from a long way away). He then goes on to start talking about people coming after him, seeing figures around him, saying that he can see things are about to happen and that he is facing some sort of entity before he can get ''better'. He also acted extremely paranoid; locking his door, closing blinds and windows. This is head frying and I am extremely worried, so I make him get into bed and sleep, as well as making him drink water. 

I phoned his girlfriend to tell her the situation, who then told his parents who were then apparently on their way - for this reason, she told me to keep it quiet until they arrive as to not make a scene, so they could take him home to get help. I thought that was fine, so stayed with him to make sure he slept fine, drank water and wasn't scared or panicking. I stay the entire day with him, during which he wakes up and falls asleep, occasionally talking - through this I learn that he had taken LSD Thursday past, hadn't slept since that (6 days at that moment) and was going on some trip in an alternate reality where he had to face challenges and fight these negative things in his life, but that it'd be okay. Eventually he falls into a deep sleep at like 12PM, so I leave to go sleep myself.

The next day I wake up early for morning class, and slip a note of concern under his door, saying I'd come see him later. I come back in the afternoon to the note under my door from him, saying he was so thankful I was there and that he is doing fine now, that I had nothing to worry about. I felt a sense of relief, so I went over that evening to hang with him to see how he was doing and he was indeed back to normal, so we chilled, watched TV and talked about what had happened. I left his room around 10PM to go sleep as I had early class, thinking everything was okay.

Fast forward to this morning, and I wake up way before my alarm to the sounds of one of my flatmates screaming ''GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME! YOU ARE FUCKING CRAZY MAN, CRAZY! YOU NEED TO LEAVE!'' I switch into this adrenaline-fuelled mode, rushing out into the corridor to see the guy standing there in a tizzy, along with one of the accommodations maintenance guys. Both explain that my friend has been wandering up and down the corridor half naked all morning, disorientated and locked out of his room, trying every door and entering people's rooms (thus why the guy was shouting at him). The maintenance guy also explains that while doing work, my friend stole his drill, ran to the bathroom on the opposite side and started drilling a hole in the wall, trying to get into his room (his room was next to the bathroom). 

At this point we need to phone security, so we do and they arrive after a few minutes. Security are asking him his name (which he can't remember), where he lives (couldn't remember, but he lives on my floor) and why he's wandering around (didn't know) - I had to convince them he lived here by convincing them to enter his room and get his student ID, which they did and confirmed he was living there. He reveals to us that he has been locked out for ''quite a while'', but he had been heard wandering late at night (5AMish) concluding that he was locked out all night, and had been wandering the entire night.

They then asked him if he had taken anything that night or the morning - he confessed to taking LSD, weed and drinking during the night. The feeling of shock, anger and pain I felt is something I have never felt before when I saw him in this state and heard him say what he had taken. This guy, who I thought was my friend, had hidden his drug use from me the entire year, lying about it and on top of this, had stolen people's things on a drug trip - food, alcohol (mine included) and even a PS4 game and a vaporizer. Security at this point concluded he needed to go to hospital, so they have taken him there and to my knowledge, he was still there. I would be visiting him right now but I went home because I work at weekends.

I'm still processing this situation, but I am just so pissed off and disappointed that he did this, lied about taking drugs, stole people's stuff in our flat and has pretended to be someone he isn't. Due to him taking these, he has likely fucked his psyche up permanently, will be expelled from University and potentially even get criminal charges for using Class A drugs. Just as I thought University couldn't get more ropey, it does. This is one to tell the grandkids (not).

TL;DR - Friend has been on an LSD-induced psychotic trip the entire week, and took it again in combination with weed and alcohol last night, putting himself and our flat in jeoprady. He is now in hospital and will likely be expelled and prosecuted. On top of this we had conlcuded he has been the one stealing food, alcohol and a vape over the year, despite denying it.",02Mar2018,3
47,"I've been taught English since I was 6, though I only started using it as a major language from the age of 14-15.

""What's the problem?"" You might ask.
Though my English is decent, my pronunciation is not satisfying (word initial consonant clusters like spl, spr, str, and skw are hard for me, especially if whispered), and how I speak changes if I was speaking with myself vs. when I'm speaking with others, from a not-bad American-British amalgam to English with a bit too much accent (not as bad as ""do you ezbeak english?"", though), and it's getting on my nerves. I probably do this shit to avoid people looking at me with mockingly, gets me frustrated and stuttering.",02Mar2018,3
48,"College freshman Dean’s List geek here.

I sort of have a soft “rivalry” with Brandon at my school. He’s a 6'5 frat guy who plays football, and I’m a 5'7 calculus nerd.

He mentioned that his best subject is history, and I said “Well it’s my worst, but I’ll still score higher than you at your best.”

He said why not make it interesting? Whoever gets the highest score on the midterms gets to make the loser do whatever they want that night.

I said “Are you crazy?! You’re on!”

I barely even studied. I got a 97.

My face went white in shock when he showed me his 98.

Okay fine, what stupid thing do I have to do?

He said “No big deal, James. You just have to run across the football field tonight at midnight.”

“Okay fine.”

“Naked.”

My face turned red and my jaw dropped as everyone around him laughed.

“Yeah, right. Haha. What do I really have to do?”

He said “You have to run across the football field at midnight tonight. Butt-naked. Not even socks.”

A cute girl said “Oh baby! I know my plans tonight!” and laughed as I struggled for air.

Even my friends Heather (just a friend, she has a BF) and Jason laughed.

Again, I am a huge geek. Obviously a virgin.

""You're not serious are you?""

And at midnight that night, there I was. With about 10 cheering students on each side of me, standing at the endzone of the football field. I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and dropped my fluffy, white robe to the ground.

I running across my own college football field.

As naked as the day I was born.

Wearing nothing but my glasses and the pink blush on my cheeks.

I am lily-white from the neck-down. Not fat but a “studies-while-eating-Doritos” belly shaking as I ran. My “bigger-than-you’d think” bubble butt jiggling behind me. And my…ahem…small package flapping in the breeze.

About a dozen students, Brandon's friends and a few of mine, screaming ""WOOOOO!!!! Check out that BUTT!"" and laughing.

The loudest roar of laughter was when I ran back past Brandon and he said ""Look everybody, it's the genius!"" and SPANKED my naked ass hard as I yelped out loud.

Not only was it LOUD, not only did he perfectly get me across both bare cheeks, but oh my goodness did it STING.

I just continued and ran towards my pile of clothes I stripped out of, with my bare, white butt stinging behind me and tears in my eyes from how much it stung.

I will never bet again, or tell any of my friends back home!!

49,"Think of a toxic friend that things they're better than their peers. That was me but not anymore. Since then I've apologized to the right people and whether things will heal over time it's hard to tell but I've distanced myself for a long time because I didnt want to be that way anymore. Ive spent a lot of time to myself, alienating myself from my other friends for the most part because not even those seemed right.

While taking time to myself I've come to realize that my ""best friends"" were actually going to me what I did to others. these people I only spoke highly of and when finding out they had been talking shit behind my back it his my like a bullet to the chest. Yet... I deserve it. I knew I deserved it. Ive felt shame for the longest time but didn't play the victim or say anything to these best friends because I honestly didn't feel like I had any right too.

It's come to the point though where I'm left undecided on what to do. The things they're saying behind my back are horrible, things that if people believed it and it got around enough it could actually ruin a man's reputation or even life. They've exaggerated a story I told them and have blown it up to immense proportion. Shall I do what I've been doing throughout this time of introspection and just let it fade out or should I confront them? 

Im not sure on how severe their shit talking is but what I've been doing is looking back at how I have been in the past with my other friends and seeing if theyre the same based on how they behave around me. Also, relating to the last part, has anyone done this before? Where you try and evaluate or analyze current friendships based on how previous friends acted or how you acted in the past? Reading back on that it seems obvious and a no brainier but throughout my life I've found it difficult to make friends and I'm currently seeing a psychiatrist next week due to paranoia. I do want to go but at the moment I'm starting to feel like all of my symptoms have been relating to this and now that I'm taking some time off work and to myself, things are falling to place. I just don't know what to do though, if I go to a Psychiatrist, my current friends will probably gossip about that as they already know and try and make connections that aren't there. 

Any advice would be so much appreciated, I just feel lost. And its my fault",02Mar2018,2

52,"About a year and a half ago I had total PTSD break down, panic attacks, nightmares, general anxiety, depression/suicidal… Unable to take care of myself other than just physically. I was very fortunate to get through that with therapy and the help of some friends. Now it’s been about six months since I would say I have been fully well &amp; recovered. I’m working overnight shift and took on a pet sitting gig that turned out to be much more than expected, so I’m not getting much sleep, I had been sick (cold/flu) off and on since December, and now issues with my job have me looking for a new one… I made the mistake of listening to some of the music that I used to listen to when I was at my lowest, Which triggered me more than I would have thought possible… Now I feel that I’m on the edge of a breakdown. I have so much to be thankful for right now - my life has turned around 100%. I know much of this is just the basic lack of sleep. I was just hoping that by writing it all out and venting here might help a little bit. If you read all this, thank you :) ",02Mar2018,0
53,"I'm mostly writing this to remember a truly wonderful day that I was lucky enough to experience. In the last few years my good days have been rare. This day was one where I just felt that deep, warm, orange colored happiness which I often experienced as a child during summer break, lying in some tall grass and feeling sunrays hit my skin.

It was actually a very cold and snowy day. I wake up after a good night's sleep and truly good it's-too-early-to-already-wake-up-sex in a remote mountain hut with my boyfriend. We're here because we're both finished with our exams and have a few free days before returning to a stressful semester. While a fire is crackling in the furnace we eat a late but cozy breakfast and I'm not even worrying about it being a bit unhealthy. After a few hours, we decide to drive to a near village with the intention of exploring it, visiting a spa-like place and going out to eat afterwards.

People, if you have never been in a thermal bath, sauna, steam bath and all that other relaxing stuff, you really need to put this on your to do lists.
 
It's wonderful. We swim and cuddle together in warm pools while having a beautiful view of the giant mountains around us. Other people and my insecurities about my body did not matter one bit. We relax (naked!) and sweat in different saunas and steam baths. We even participate in a salt-scrub-ceremony, where you leave with baby-like smooth skin. We dare to quickly jump into ice cold water only to get out after a few seconds to warm each other up again. After leaving the place, I truly feel like I was just reborn. I just feel so calm and relaxed, I feel beautiful and confident, kinda like a big fluffy blanket was put around me.

We decide to go to an Italian restaurant and get some pizza, because I haven't allowed myself one for a long time. While I'm sitting across from him, he tells me how beautiful I look (and I'm not even wearing any make up)... and I actually believe him. The pizza is wonderful and I'm not feeling guilty at all, I just feel great. There was nothing that day that nagged me, that made me sad, that annoyed me, just nothing!

After a short and stunning night walk (the stars!) through the village, we decide to head home. We turn up some great music while driving and sing and dance to it. I show him some favorites of mine and he loves them. I can't stop smiling.

In the hut we cut up some ice cold juicy oranges and drink glasses of white whine. We both get drunk and just talk. We talk, talk, talk. I almost tell him that I love him. We brush our teeth outside (the only running water is from a fountain outside the hut) and just gaze at the stars, everything is silent because there's so much snow! Somehow it isn't even that cold anymore. Afterwards we put a lot of wood in the furnace and cuddled each other to sleep.

I know, this sounds an awful lot like I'm bragging and maybe just a tad too corny (I'm sorry!), but days like these are an absolute rarity in my life. Days where you're just comfortable with being alive and being you, comfortable with the people that are in your life. Days where all your problems seem to be too far away to bother you. Days in which you actually feel like your growing and doing just fine.

Times are rough for me right now. The days are heavy again and he just left for a semester abroad. I'm trying to cope and I figured that actually writing down a truly great day would calm me down a bit.",02Mar2018,7
54,"Hi everyone,

I'm extremely depressed right now and here's why.

I dated the love of my life [23F] for 2 years when she suddenly broke up with me last May. I felt sad and alone all summer long and even well into winter. I had been on multiple dates and had sex with multiple women in the months following but, I couldn't get over her. Until late December a friend of mine set me up with her friend [27F] who was recently single. I was finally happy again. I felt normal for the first time in a long time.

I was so excited to meet someone that finally made me forget about my ex, somebody I saw a future with. We spoke over text for 3 weeks before we went on our first date. She loved everything about me, my looks, my job, the fact that I own a property, etc. She was excited and saw a future with me as well.

We began dating officially at the beginning of January. Things were going well, she seemed very into me. We made many plans, I met her parents, her friends, she invited me to a wedding this coming April. We were moving fast but I was okay with it because I knew it was what we both wanted. I thought I'd never find someone who would make me happy again and make me forget about my ex.

Problem was, I was so nervous that I'd mess it up that I could never be myself around her. I always felt extremely insecure that she would up and leave at any minute. I'm not sure why. But because things were moving along nicely I continued to keep a wall up. I refrained from opening up to her in fear that she might see something she doesn't like.

Last week, after dating for 6 weeks, she ended it. She told me she didnt feel a connection and did not feel the way she needed to about me.

I can't blame her. Who could feel a connection to someone if their guarding who they truly are. The reasons for me being so guarded are extensive, so I won't begin listing them. The bottom line is that she saw a future with me. She loved everything about me besides my personality, the thing that matters most. I feel like I missed a slam dunk and it now feels like I'll never be able to find someone to like me, that I like back. I feel hopeless.

I'm an attractive man, it's never been hard for me to get attention from women. However I am very reserved by nature, let alone with someone I'm already afraid of losing.

I come to you /r/self for help. I want more than anything to not feel so reserved. Not feel so insecure about talking to women that I like and being able to open up and show my true self to them. I feel like I have so much love to give but no one to give it to.

How can I get over this fear? How can I be more interesting and confident?

Everyday that passes I know I'm getting older and I feel like there is less opportunity to find someone to fall in love with. And that's what I want more than anything in the world.

I want to get to the point where if I see this girl again she will be completely amazed at my change. I want her to see a new person.

Please tell me how.

55,"I'm in 8th grade, so in two years I'll be in high school. I have two options. The first one is a pretty prestigious school, but (it's gonna sound childlish) It's ugly as heck. All concrete. I'm very affected by my environment, and the midle school I go to has big green spaces. 
The second one seems perfect. Big, green, and people I know are in there. But it's way less prestigious (even if it's still a private school), and most important, both are catholic but this one is episcopal. As a transgender student, it makes me very, very anxious.",02Mar2018,0
56,"I'm 23 (living at home) and my parents are in their mid 50s. My parents would fight occasionally when I was younger but it was rare, maybe a few times a year. 3 years ago, my mom started working with my dad at his small business (it's basically just them two that own and operate it) and their fights have gotten much more frequent. They probably fight every week at least, always about the same fuckups my dad did in the past. My mom always instigates the fights and they just consist of my mom very angrily yelling and my dad while he meekly defends himself and apologizes.  I can tell it's having a very negative effect on their marriage and their daily lives and my mom has threatened divorce a couple times but hasn't made any concrete moves. I honestly think they have a more toxic relationship than most divorced couples. But the weird thing is on days they're not fighting they seem like a ""normal"", happy couple.

Just wondering what it's like for you guys. I have no idea what's ""normal"" when it comes to shit like this because I think people (including me) are extremely reluctant to talk about family problems to their friends.",02Mar2018,1
