0,"Well a friend from high school is throwing a new years party tonight, problem is a previous friend was invited. She was a close friend for about a year (talking almost every day) before completely ghosting me, then she got mad when i asked why and began talking bad about me to all my other friends saying i was a freak and annoying, this was all after she continually baited me by inviting me to events just to uninvite me just to toy with me. This left me really hurt inside for months. I feel like if they go to this event and I dont she will talk about me badly to my friends, but if I go and she is there I dont know if I would be able to handle it as I would have to engage with her. what should I do? (its been about 8 months since this incident)",31Dec2018,1
1,"So, I tend to be more of an empty face when I be with my family, and also an airhead. Also, when someone when someone in my family try to have a conversation with me it mostly be straight answers. (I don't really trust them to cry about my dramatic hidden life yet) like my answers are always fine, good, and yes. That's why my uncle call me lifeless and without a soul. (He's kinda eight about it.) 

Because I sit on my phone all day and never smile kids think I'm a scary guy, which is false. But then they annoy me and then I tend to get mad. Because of that they think I'm negative and scared of me. Expect good kids, they are the ones who know I'm good because they never get me mad. But when a kid see me all day they say YOU ARE NEVER SMILING YOU ARE NEVER HAPPY.  which is true, but what should I do about it? I'm an 18yo introvert without any social skills. ",31Dec2018,1

I have decisions to make, and am at a loss as to the best course of action.  I just feel...lost and alone at the moment.  Probably doesn't help that I'm sick and taking care of kids while I'm sick is apparently too overwhelming for my husband, so I told him to go ahead and just take off and be with friends for the day.  So now I'm home sick taking care of sick kids.  No one ever warned me being an adult was gonna suck so bad some days.  Hope everyone else is having a better day.",31Dec2018,1
6,"Hey. I’m in my early teens and I’ve been going through a lot of mental changes recently. I’m changing my perspective on love, interests, happiness, joy, purpose and friends. 

As I said, I’m in my early teens so there’s a lot of girls from school that I’ve trying to get to like me, but do I really like them? Are they really the ones I wanna live the rest of my life with? No. Sure, they look good and can be funny sometimes, but they’re not my type of partner. So I’ve been trying to ignore them, but for some reason, I’m still jealous when another boy is flirting with the girls. 

I’ve been trying to picture the perfect girl in my head and I’ve gotten a clear picture of the person that I wanna spend the rest of my life with. I have some very specific choices or preferences of this girl, so will I even meet her? If I ever *do* meet this girl, is she going to like me? If she doesn’t like me, what am I going to do? Will I go insane?

Enough about love, I’ve also thought about happiness. What makes me happy is a question I’ve had for a very long time. This sounds cliche, but it’s not money, cars and expensive clothing. It’s love. That’s all I’m asking for.

Every country has their own type of basic girl in their country. And in my country, I hate the basic kind of girls, and there are A LOT of them, so I’ve thought about traveling somewhere. Somewhere other than here

I have a lot of great friends that I can’t live without, but it’s been a while since I’ve honestly laughed at one of their jokes. I don’t know if I’ve got really really good humour or if I’ve got a very specific type of humour. 



I’ve been trying to find myself and find out what type of person I am. In conclusion, love is the most important thing in life and it’s important to find a partner that you not only love because of their looks, but also love them as a friend.


This is how I see it, your partner has be just like one of your friends, but you have to be excited to kiss them on the lips",31Dec2018,1
7,"Took a leap of faith, packed my bags and moved out of state this year. Didn’t have a job lined up at all. Last year, I was a mess. Dropped out of grad school and barely working part time. 

This year was definitely my year. I made incredible new friends, traveled spontaneously, started dating other people, and just started to explore as a young adult. I landed a job within my field and opened doors up to an industry I’m now passionate about. I fucking kicked ass and learned so much about myself in this new city. I got fired from a good job but because of that, I got an even better job at a bigger company starting next year. 

Kick rocks depression! I’ve made a comeback and 2019 is gonna be even better. It feels so good to have bounced back. I hope to encourage anyone in a funk to not give up!!

9,"Everyone ignores me. I wish i could just feel what it would be like to have people actively care about me. I wish people cared about what I said instead of ignoring and disregarding it. I wish every time I posted somewhere it wasn’t either ignored or shit on. I wish people liked me enough to comment nice things on my Facebook posts and photos. I wish people didn’t just delete me for no reason and then ignore me when I ask why because I am genuinely confused. When I am nice and positive, everyone ignores me. But the second I have a complaint or have an opinion about something, I’m suddenly *always* negative and “rude”. I don’t get it. I don’t post any differently than anyone else. Why am I deemed the negative rude one? I am genuinely a nice person but I feel that in order to be happy I need to put up a wall where I am cold and emotionless or else people will just ignore me and treat me like shit. This is what I did to avoid severe major depression while in junior high and high school. 

I distinctly remember in my dance classes as a kid, one girl who I thought I was cool with came up to me and said “you’re annoying. No one likes you” and it broke me. I feel like that cloud has been following me around since then. Everyone must think I’m annoying and no one really likes me. Everyone must have only added me on social media out of obligation at one point because we were on a team or in the same class together. I support everyone else, but none of them support me.

Instead of calling an aid, I just reached over and pulled the blanket over her shoulders. “OH, THANK YOU, GOD, THANK YOU, GOD!” she started saying.

23," 

So, my family has been going through some major drama right now. This has been arguably the worst Christmas ever for me. Just a head's up, i live with my grandparent's, my dad and his sister. Now, my aunt is kind of a drug addict, she is always on pills and stealing from us to help her pill habit. We've tried to get her help, rehab, everything. But nothing ever works. She's 38, pays no rent, no bills and has no job. Not to mention, about 2 months ago, she overdosed and we had to carry her to the hospital.

Anyway, Christmas Eve, my grandfather had enough. She stole a jar of quarters (like, a big water jug half full of quarters). They argued and called each other names, and my grandfather hit her. He punched her right in the nose. I think he broke it. He went in her room and started screaming at her, he threatened to break her phone if she called the police. But anyway, she did call the police, we got back home and the cops were there. They arrested my grandfather and he had to spend Christmas morning in jail. But we bailed him out.

Long story short, even though she stole from him, he's still being charged with assault. Also, he isn't allowed to go back into the house, she filed an order of protection against him. He wants to kick her out, but she has tenant's right and can continue to live there until he files a formal evinction notice.

But the innocent victims, us, the cops also told us to stay out of the house for a few hours since she had been on a power trip. Anyway, we just lollygagged around town for a while. Until she texted us that she'd lock the door to the house. We got there and sure enough, the doors were locked. She had been harassing us through text messaging all day. We called the cops, but they never showed up. My dad, grandmother, and i all had to sleep in the truck. In the dead of winter. It was so cold.

Christmas morning was even worse. We got my grandfather out of jail and took him to a motel. We went back hom and tried knocking on the door again, but it was still locked. At this point, i had enough. I started banging on the door, i was telling her if she didn't unlock the door that i would break it down. She told me we couldn't be there, i tried begging because i had to take a shower and that it was so cold, she didn't listen. So, i threatened to kick her ass if she didn't let us in. My dad and i were arguing at the door with her. But, she eventually did.

And, about 20 minutes later, the police came. She told them that we couldn't be there. Yeah, Christmas morning, she called the cops on us. Anyway, they took our side. They told her she can't lock us out, that she just needs to keep away from us and not harass us. So, this has been a wonderful Christmas.

28,"FTP and LTL, also on mobile so sorry for the formatting. 

So a little backstory. For as long as I can remember, my father and I have been competing through a variety of mediums (pool, badminton, bowling, etc), always with money involved. I've beaten him at quite a few different events but never once in the past 15+ years or so have I ever beaten him in pool. I've probably lost hundreds of dollars to him from this game alone. He's always bragged about being a ""hustler"" and how ""nobody has ever beaten him in pool"". Despite the fact that I've lost plenty of money to him, I loathe how much he boasts about being undefeated. 

But everything changed today. I finally beat my father in pool. I clapped him while he still had three balls on the table. I also won myself a new snowboard, so that's a plus. 

Man, the look of disbelief on his face was priceless. 

TLDR: After years of losing to my dad in pool and losing tons of money, I finally beat him. ",31Dec2018,1

But I’m not happy. I’m stressed even when there’s nothing to stress over. I’m upset even when I’ve had an objectively great day. I’m lonely even though I have plenty of people who love me. 

There are a lot of random instances where I feel like I’m being overdramatic. My parents are mad at my girlfriend, saying she’s rude and that she isn’t allowed staying here anymore. But my girlfriend is upset that they feel this way, and I want both sides to be happy. I have things I do in college that used to make me happy, but now I’m overly stressed about it and want to quit. I changed majors, and now I have no fucking idea what to do. I am stressed about politics and my entire family being at odds with me. I’m annoyed by my bad back for which I’m about to get PT for. On top of this, I’m scared to just make changes and move on; girlfriend wants to move in with me next year in our own apartment, but I’m stressed about telling my parents. I don’t want to be at home anymore though it’s a wonderful place to be. I’m even fucking stressed that my girlfriend’s family gave me more thoughtful gifts for Christmas than my own family did. I’m overly worried about losing friendships with people. I have an interview for a job coming up that has got me concerned. 

It’s all these little, seemingly normal issues in mostly everyone’s life that cause me a great deal of suffering. I draw it up to one conclusion: I am not strong. I am weak. I am ungrateful. I am unmotivated. I don’t deserve the life I have. I’m unhappy yet I have everything most everyone wants.

After I've done the dirty work of getting the girl's number, I wait the appropriate amount of time to contact her, but immediately following the message being sent, I freak out and either turn my phone on silent, airplane mode, turn it off altogether, chuck it under a pillow, or all of the above.  This can last anywhere from ten minutes to two hours, hoping that in that amount of time, the girl will have responded, I wouldn't have replied right away, thus making me seem at least a little less neurotic, and things will have gained some momentum.  At least in the watched pot never boils kind of way.

I've done this since high school and can pinpoint it to the very first time I sent a text to a girl I was crushing on.  It was on a Saturday the week after we went to prom together and I was feeling extremely weighted down by my feelings towards her.  I knew I was gonna have to take the plunge and at least see if she felt the same way.  Ice Cube's ""xXx: State of the Union"" was on F/X while I was crafting my Ode to Virginity on my Motorola Razr.

Goes to show how much of an impression this left on me ten years later. This still goes on, albeit to a much lesser extent.

I've been in therapy since even before it ended, and I'm lucky to have a great support network. I slowly started undoing the trauma that had all of my behavior tied in knots, and finding where my self-esteem had run off to. I started going on dates again on and off over the last couple of months, just relearning what it's like to meet new people without being crippled by residual anxiety and mistrust. I've gotten to a point where I both feel great about myself &amp; am enjoying my independent life.

Aaaaaand of course this was a great time to meet someone I've now been lying awake over for three hours. 

It's 5:30 AM. I woke up and just couldn't fall back asleep. I've fixed a garment that needed a new button. I've unpacked from a trip. I've listened to a good album and had a miniature dance party in my bedroom. I read a story. I tried just lying there for a while. Nothing has done the trick. Still awake. Too excited.

My mind has already run the gamut -- what's the catch? what's wrong with this person? am I just setting myself up for a stupid fall? are they also a secret sociopath? what if they bail on the next date we set? is there any way for me to suggest we hang out earlier than that -- tomorrow, even -- without sounding off-puttingly overeager? -- but...

It's really, reallllllly nice to be able to feel excited about someone else again. Even if nothing comes of this, even if in the light of day it goes nowhere, god it feels good to be able to feel like this again. I mean, the residual paranoia is still there. This is all still terrifying as shit.

But part of me was afraid that in the healing process, and in the defense mechanisms I've developed, I'd somehow lose out on the ability to subconsciously click with anyone again. 

I can be vulnerable again. What comes of it, if anything, remains to be seen, but having mostly recovered from the shit that the past few years has dished out, even if this goes sideways too, I think I can bounce back from that without too much trouble.

It felt very culture vulturesque like she was claiming black men and r&amp;b as belonging her to, like something she bestowed to me. 

She did also tell me once time that she has a better understanding of the black experience than I because she’s dated black men.

52,"This guy has been texting me for six years now. I have made it extremely clear that I’m not interested in dating or being friends or even allowing him to follow me on social media. I used to have run-ins with him and think he once followed me when I was running in my neighborhood, but I recently moved 1200 miles away and I told him I was moving thinking it would get him to back off a bit. But he ended up flipping out on me so I blocked him. I went back home for Christmas and received a text at 11pm from an unknown number asking if I was in TX. Clearly this person knows who I am so I asked who it was and they refused to disclose their name... said it would be “more fun” if they kept it a secret and we met up for a drink. Um no. So this person keeps texting me and I continue to ask who it is and they still won’t say. So I told them I was done with the conversation and they’ll be blocked. About a week and a half ago I received a “hi” message from a random number at 4:45am and again asked who it was, no answer. Instead he pretended to be looking for a Jennifer and claimed she gave him the wrong number, then proceeded to ask me what my name was. Creepy AF. So I blocked him. Also, a few weeks ago I received a call from an unfamiliar number but was from my hometown so I answered and it was someone one the other end with a voice disguising thing and I couldn’t make out what they said. They hung up and when I called them back there was no answer. I am 90% sure that all of these were the same guy and he’s going to continue to find ways to know when I’m in town and contact me. What are my options? I’m not even in the same state anymore and I don’t even know if I can prove this was all done by him. I just have to keep everything at max privacy settings?",31Dec2018,1
54,"I was on the roof of a building. It was snowing and I was in my underwear. I walked up some wooden steps to a room and went inside. It was a mess and very dim. There was a single bulb lighting the room. I plugged in some Christmas lights and the extra light let me notice mold covering the ceiling. There were two beds with a half wall between them. I could clearly tell that one was mine for some reason. The other bed was larger, dirty, and covered in dried paint. There was another door opposite that bed. I touched the larger bed and the door creaked open. Suddenly there was a presence in the room. I assumed it was my subconscious but as soon as I made that connection I got hit with an overwhelming wave of fear. Adrenaline started pumping and I felt incredibly exposed. I woke up. My ears were ringing I could hear my heart beating and there was something that sounded like laughing. I couldn't move. That was two hours ago and I'm still kinda fucked up from it.

I see others having the ability to say good jokes and i cant i get jealous.

I see others can get a girl chase them while i spent 3 years on snapchat talking to 5000 girls and never ever anyone texted me first. I would have to always chase. Its like this even in real life.

I cant even keep a convo going for 5 minutes with a girl. With guys its better but always others get bored of me. I have to try to make them laugh, Because i have nothing left to talk about.

I feel like everyones better and smarter and cooler than me.

64,"This is coming from years of having seen people on subs like /r/relationships say things like “get out now” and “run” whenever a situation of conflict is discussed. 

The first thing I want to say is that commenters will often jump to the root of a problem being that the other party, predominantly the male in the described relationship, is an abuser. I’m not denying that actual instances of abuse take place, and I’m not denying that a margin of the posts made are about actual abuse. But telling a 15, 16 year old girl that because her boyfriend cheated on her that he is a sociopathic abuser is just going to create an unneccesary source of trauma around something she would otherwise be able to move past. I think a big part of this problem is that the people giving advice are in no way equipped to be consoling internet strangers. These are the kind of people who have no first hand experience, and they don’t understand that in every relationship there is friction and pain and when someone hurts someone else and leads to the demise of the relationship it doesn’t instantly mean that they are a bad person. Some people are narcissistic serial abusers. Physical, verbally violent people. Some people make mistakes that aren’t abuse, yet are labeled as abusers for doing things like becoming angry with their significant other. I know people will comment links to posts with actual instances of abuse, which again I am not denying. But I think that this is in the minority of posts.

Second, people telling others to end their relationships with no frame of reference for the situation past what the poster has described. I’m talking about the “run!” Or “divorce!” Comments that inevitably reach the top of the page. People will tell someone to leave their spouse of ten years because of a minor breakdown about work or about kids. As I said, relationships, especially ones with conhabiting individuals, are full of friction. That’s inevitable. Sending people on a search for a perfect relationship devoid of any argument is the product of a commenter having only their own fantasies as experience in giving advice. There are situations in which people should leave their significant others. Cases of abuse, cases of serious flaws in the relationship, or cases of character flaws or infidelity are just some examples. But instead of saying that people should run away from their girlfriend because she got mad after they went to dinner with an ex or because she is bad with money is a huge overreaction. People can work through issues. And even if you are confident that these two people, who you don’t know at all or have ever seen, cannot move past their problems, in your opinion as a veteran internet therapist, instead of saying run, perhaps say “re-evaluate” their relationship. Telling everyone to “get out now” cheapens saying it to someone in an actual case of abuse. 

I don’t know if this will be a controversial opinion, I know it wasn’t worded the best in a lot of ways, and I hope it doesn’t come off as too lofty but I think /r/relationships and like communities have toxic commenters that lead vulnerable people into making mistakes.

68,"My entire life I’ve always been more of a thinking person than an acting person and it’s really starting to harm my self image. I wake up every day now and immediately feel nervous about the day ahead.

Basically, I developed the habit where I do idle things for extremely long times. For example, when I wake up, I often lay in my bed for 2 hours+ if I have nothing else to do that morning just thinking about my day and about how id prefer to just be asleep. When I shower, they typically last for around 30 minutes because I’m thinking about things going on around me and how to feel. My indecisiveness is insane, because I’m a very social person, but I can never decide if I want to actually go out or not because when I do I get anxious around a lot of people and when I don’t go out I get a serious case of FOMO. 

The worst of all is around girls, I get so anxious that I’ve noticed I start getting a red rash around my neck area, and even other people have started to notice. I haven’t had sex in over a year because I get so anxious around girls now that I just avoid it all together because I hate the feeling I get when trying to talk to them. I’m so jealous of other people who can handle social situations like it’s nothing

I felt like my birthday was overshadowed by a international holiday.

1.) It's a good conversation piece. For some reason people react like it's an accomplishment.

2.) You can pretend that the world is counting down and celebrating to your birthday.

3.) A party is always planned. You don't have to do anything!

4.) Older people are more consciousness that day is New Years AND your birthday

72,"I don't know what happened but growing up I used to feel extreme shame over the most trivila things. If I accidentally fell over, I would be consumed by shame and embarrassment I would think about it all day. If I said something dumb in public all I would think of is how many people have overheard me? I was paralysed by fear and anxiety I would sit at home just to feel safe, because if I left my comfort zone anything could trigger and set me off.

Especially masturbating. Growing up in a strict religious household it was hard because you couldn't talk about anything. I didn't know what a period was I found out through the interent, to this day my parents have not told me about sex. I would watch porn and just cry till I slept because I felt like I embarrassed myself in front of God and I've shamed my parents. It was even worse when I reached 17 and hit my sexual peak and I started seeing men differently, I was attracted to real life people. 


Thankfully, I stopped caring and I think it's because over the years the shame and guilt has piled on to the point where it physically paralysed me. I can now look at myself in the mirror without feeling disgusted. No shame or guilt. It's like 'oh well, at least I have a roof over my head and food in my stomach and I can afford an education'. I can do anything without going over it in my head a million times.

73,"Hey Internet,

I'm twenty-three years old, and I think I'm nearsighted. I can't see text on TV very well, which makes playing text-heavy video games hard, and I can't see road signs until I'm about to pass them. (Don't worry; I don't drive!)  So, I'm thinking of going to an eye doctor and maybe getting a pair of glasses. I'm a little bit worried though.

I feel like getting glasses would be a big change to my identity. Like, there are non-glasses-wearers and glasses-wearers, and everyone has known me as the former. I know contacts are a less-noticeable option, but I'd still be a person who has to correct their vision. Plus, they're harder to take care of, and I actually think a stylish pair of glasses looks pretty cool.

Also, I spent and spend much of my life looking at screens. Everyone told me not to spend so much time on the computer, but I didn't really have anything else to do. Now that I might actually need glasses, I'm expecting a lot of told-ya-so's, which, true as they may be, kind of hurt. I'd just like a little more support, you know? ""Oh, you got some glasses? Well, that's great that you can see now!"" or, ""Those new glasses look good on you!"" would be nice.

Maybe I can go without glasses. I don't really *need* them, and it would save me a little emotional hardship.

Now I’ve decided I want to pursue a profession and a lifestyle where other people won’t be waiting on me to do things.  In my engineering job, my boss expects me to show up and work because she is waiting on my outputs to be able to do her job.

I stuck pins to my jeans and wore newsboy caps with pop culture t-shirts and sewed colorful fabric patches over my Converse. Most of the time it was actually kind of cute. 

All that changed when I went to live with different people. I doodled birds on my boring white shoes one time and they flipped out. I had to have approval on anything I got from the store. And it was all so *dull*. If I had asked for some fold-over motorcycle boots or jeans with flowers painted on them, they would have called it trashy. 

I had a few Pink Floyd shirts, but mostly the clothes I got were pretty. I'm not pretty. I don't really want to be pretty, at least not the Christian woman country singer kind. Half the time I looked like someone had put a lovely dog sweater on an irritable stray Shi Tzu. It's just so very, very not me. I have a hard time explaining this. It's like choosing between the gorgeous superhero woman's wardrobe or the wild villain woman's wardrobe. I'd go for the villain woman's clothes every time, not to be edgy or dark, but because it's so much more fun and crazy. (to be honest, I would probably get along better with the villains anyway lol)

Do you think they're looking at the future? Not the future as in time ahead, but the future right now as in timezones ahead. ""Happy New Year!"" my friend posted at 6am. When did New Zealand move further away?

I check the family WhatsApp. There's pictures of my sister's holiday. Giraffes, rhinos, zebra's. Experiences had in a country far away. My brother shares a picture of food, followed by an inside joke I missed out on. My parents are unresponsive; I suspect they're in the kitchen. I can imagine my dad above a big pan of frying oil, as he makes the yearly oliebollen. I can almost see my mom make the side dishes, as she absent-mindedly asks my dad if it's enough garlic before adding another clove or two. 

In less than four hours the clocks there will ring midnight. Fireworks will light up the sky. Toasts will be made, hugs will be given, followed by the obligatory three kisses on the cheeks. ""Happy New Year"" they'll all say. I'll get a message or two, maybe even a phone call or video chat. They'll be buzzed, not yet drunk but not sober. The dogs will be locked in the spare room so they won't run out of the door. Maybe someone will bring up the story of how our old dog escaped on New Years Eve, how Animal Control got him and brought him back home, having fallen in love with him in the hour they've had him there. Maybe not.

I'll smile. The text or call or video call will mean a lot to me. I'll smile and laugh with them, tell them I've still got some hours to go. Jokingly ask them what the future is like. I might mention my friend in New Zealand, who by then will be slowly waking up from her hangover, say that their future seemed great over there. 

For a few moments, I will reflect on my own year. I'll grab a beer, my second or third by then, trying to get into the spirit. I'll text my husband, ask him what his ETA is. I'll ask him how bad the MTA is. Say I'm glad we're not going out, the city must be insane tonight. Somewhere I will add a comment about how even staying and going out in Brooklyn probably would not be much better than Manhattan. 

I'll clean up the table as I fall into the role my parents are playing now. I'll make the oliebollen, because some traditions are worth bringing with you. I'll make some side dishes, some snacks. I'll walk the dog, because she deserves to get rid of her spare energy. 

And I'll be homesick through it all. Homesick for the future I am missing out on. Homesick for the timezone. Homesick for the family I haven't seen in months. Every small tradition that I used to hate will feel like warmth, warmth that I can only vaguely replicate, making it feel like wrapping a blanket around you when the heater is broken. 

My husband will get home. I'll give him a kiss, let him know about the text or call or video call from my family. He'll smile, he'll tell me that next year we will try to visit them - he has seniority at his job, he should be able to get one holiday off. I'll walk to the fridge for another beer, offer him one too.

And we'll make our own traditions. Far from the ones I grew up with, but keeping those close to my heart. I'll tell myself that it's okay to miss the familiar, as long as you don't lose sight of what you've got now.

Maybe it's not all that bad.

This is probably the first year in my life where I'm  happy with what I've accomplished.  Two and a half years ago I dropped out of high school.  I was super depressed and pretty much did nothing for two years straight.  Just sat around watching TV and playing video games, but in the past few months I've gotten my life together and I'm excited to head into 2019.

I got my drivers license this year.  Sure I should've had that done a long time ago but I did it finally and I'm proud that I stuck with it and actually finished.

I got my GED this year.  There was a lot of trouble getting that done with difficulties at the testing center and needing to reschedule, but it's done and I'm proud of myself.

I took the SAT this year.  Probably a small accomplishment to most but it wasn't without difficulty.  I actually scored pretty well too.

And finally I've registered for college.  If everything goes as planned I'll be starting in just over a week.

4th girl, I had to build up a good amount of courage, got my friend to ask one of the girl’s friends for her name. Went up to a full table, told her that her friend told me her name and I thought it was cute. My approach was not reciprocated, I was almost taken back.

83,"2018 has been a shitty year for me for many reasons and I just want to tell them to someone and I guess this is not a bad place to express myself.(excuse my English, it’s not my first language) for context, I’m 19 so here it goes:

- My porn addiction only got worse and worse and it affects my mental health and my studying.

- my mental health hit an all time low (a little bit better now ) I had serious suicidal thoughts this year that I never had. 

- it’s my last year at high school and my grades are only getting worse and I don’t seem to be able to start focus. Every time I get things going and I start sorting myself, within a week or two I end up losing my tempo and getting left behind on many subjects and it only makes me more anxious and sad and unable to enjoy the things I love.

- speaking about the things I love, I love watching movies but this year has been shit in term of that. I can’t get myself to watch movies even though I want to. I only watched 100 films this year maybe that seems like a lot but I consider myself a film buff and I wanted to watch many more. My point is that this year I didn’t do enough of the thing I loved to do.
- my relationship with my family only got worse this year. I don’t even speak to my parents anymore even though I live with them. I hate waking up when they wake up when they are awake I stay in my room because I don’t even want to see them and I don’t like staying in my room.  And this just makes everything else. This probably sounds horrible but I hate my parents and I hate that I hate them.

- No progress in my social life. Still single. Still not very social. Barely go out.

- I set a bunch of goals to myself at the beginning of the year. I don’t even want to open the list because I know I didn’t achieve a single one of them. 

- My chances of studying college in the US are pretty much gone now because I fucked up the SATs. So I have to fucking stay in my country and I fucking hate that.

- this might seem silly but it matters to me. My favorite player left my favorite team ( CR7 and RM) the coach also left and it sucks.

At least I started to listening to artists I didn’t use to listen to this year and they became some of my favorites, Kanye West, Brockhampton and Skylar grey to name a few. And I had a good trip this year that felt great. But other than that, a shit year.


I always had faith that it is going to be better. Every year I say this is the year everything changes but I lost my faith this year and I don’t want to have any fucking expectations for 2019 so I don’t get fucking disappointed again.",31Dec2018,1

Abortion will be made legal. Clinics will be built near bridges or water.

After the abortion is done, the woman is drugged, and thrown into the back of a van. While the van is in motion, driving to the nearest bridge or river, she is gang raped, tortured, and then thrown into 3 garbage bags tied up, and then thrown off the bridge into the river. Best of all, nobody will know that this happens until they get an abortion. Nobody will ever know this happens so they will want abortion. When questioned the government will just say they ran away. Then if the word breaks nobody will want abortion",31Dec2018,1
91,"It's still 6 hours to go till midnight. I've spent the day working and in that, distracting myself from the year that's passed. So much has happened, so many terrible things happened to me this year. But the worst was having lost her still.
As soon as I left work I called her, I wished her a happy new year. She tells me she's happy... I'm not. Every moment of this day's been painful and difficult. I'm yet to enjoy it like I did last year, then again, last year we were together.
The end of the call was marked by a long goodbye, we drew it out, asking eachother to be happy, almost like if it were a grant-able favor. We both knew it wasn't, I guess we just didn't want to admit it through our stubbornness what was obvious. When we hang up nothing will be the same.
Tomorrow, nothing will be the same.
Even now, nothing is as it was last year, it is all bleak.
But new things are coming my way, they're scary, but I know I can take them, I'm afraid, but I have to face them head on.

To you, 
I love you, I always will. But I have to forget you, I have to be able to not look back. At least not with regret, not with longing.
I love you.",31Dec2018,1
92,"So no one was home last night and I normally take one tab. And I’ve done it alone before too. I was feeling brave and took two. It was a mistake. Because I ended wandering out of the house and onto a highway overpass. I’d been having suicidal thoughts for the last month, and the acid kind of amplified that.

I called the suicide hot line. I got put on hold, and idk why but that made me laugh uncontrollably. It was like finding out your last life in a video game was the 1x and there is no 0x.

Before I hung up and was about to jump, I was rerouted to a 911 dispatcher. She asked where I was and I told her. She instructed me on where to go before the officers showed up. I started to freak out and ask if the police were coming and what I should do. She said to keep my hands visible and to face down. I realized that if they saw my hand on my phone I could have died. I went from “I want to kill myself” to “Holy shit so might get shot” in seconds.

Eventually they found me and put me in an ambulance. I talked to a bunch of doctor’s a nurses and they pointed me in the direction of a lot of mental health services and I decided to go stone cold sober for a little while.

The part that I’m confused about is that this all happened while my family was out of town, and nobody even knows it went down. I’m having a hard time accepting that it happened, and I don’t feel comfortable sharing it with them. I wish I did, but my family is so dysfunctional that we have too much to unpack from over the years, and I don’t know where how I’m feeling fits into all of it or how it will be received.

I don’t know who to tell, but I have an undying need to tell someone.",31Dec2018,1
93,"Idk if this is the place to post this but I've been wanting to get it off my chest for a while. 2 years ago today I was laying in my bed scraping things across my skin just to feel something. A lot has happened in those 2 years; I got a boyfriend, I got rid of toxic friends, realized that I don't need a lot of friends I just need good ones and my family expanded. I've been clean for 2 years, and it's amazing that I did it. It seems cheesy but if you are going through it just find someone that truly loves you and wants to help you and tell them what you are doing, because then it's not your dirty little secret and you have someone to rely on. Anyway yeah that's it. ",31Dec2018,1
94,"So with 2018 closing, I am finally going to tell the funniest moment I had all year, since I am forbidden from telling our friends.

On a hot day in August, my hubby was working from home. We are both in our late 30's. I had an awful headache and woke up from a nap at 11am, looking outside my kitchen window to a very interesting sight.

There's my husband talking to the very cute college girl who is our neighbor's daughter from across our large 5 foot tall fence.

She is dressed conservatively and cute. My husband is doing what he always does when nervous - blushing pink.

This is because he is wearing nothing but a towel.

Oh gosh. I know exactly what happened.

I've been telling him this for 2 months. He always goes outside in a towel after the shower and takes the garbage out into the backyard. I keep saying ""One day the neighbors are going to see you half-naked out there and you're gonna be blushing up a storm.""

He's so modest normally, but he just says it's a quick trip outside, who will know, and they are both always at work anyway. Didn't count on their daughter being home from school lol.

He must have gotten caught halfway. However, Denise, their daughter, probably has no idea because the fence is so high.

I gave a devilish little smirk and had an idea.

I very, very quietly went downstairs, opened the basement door and snuck into the backyard, crouching like a ninja, towards my yapping hubby.

In a nice, swift maneuver, I just reached up and YANKED that towel right off his bare ass hahahaaaaa.

He audibly GASPED and reflexively covered his penis with his hands in terror.

""What's wrong?"" Denise asked.

""Uh--n-n-n-nothing. I just felt a breeze.""

I bet you did, naked boy hahahaha.

I snuck back away with his towel and into the house through the basement door and up to the kitchen to admire my handiwork.

There's my husband, nervously stammering and wishing this conversation was over while talking to a pretty young girl.

Buck-ass fucking naked.

She has no idea that across that fence, 2 feet from her, is my husband in his adorable birthday suit.

Only 5'7. Lily-white from the neck down. Not fat, but a nice round belly from a few too many beers. And a nice, very white, plump BUTT jiggling behind him as he nervously switches feet while standing. Covering his shame with his hands.

Finally I couldn't resist, and I opened the backdoor and said ""Hey JAYBIRD!""

The girl said ""Jaybird?"" confused - kids probably don't know that old saying lol.

""Come inside now, I made lunch! You don't wanna catch a cold!"" and laughed.

He looked at me totally in terror. Would he have to expose himself???

Denise said ""I actually have to get inside myself"" and went in her own door as my buck naked husband immediately took off and went streaking into the house like his bare ass was on fire. Little penis and balls flopping comically the whole way to my viewing delight!

One very stinging wet towel WHIP to his naked butt-cheeks and I had my favorite story of the year.

Ladies, did I go too far here?? lol",31Dec2018,1
97,"Basically, I'm a person who desires good social interaction with people but is always just made to be a joke instead. With every group of people that treats me this way, there's one thing in common; they find out about my Jewish last name. 

I was raised Italian-Catholic by my Italian mother. I never really knew my dad but I inherited the last name from him. I never identified as Jewish simply because I don't know that world or that culture in the very least. All the last name has ever done for me is bring me a ton of ridicule. This started in junior high school and continues on now slight past my 30th birthday. It typically starts with a question, ""Are you Jewish?"" and then the jokes begin. The jokes start off pretty benign at first, getting harder and harder. At times, it's even lead to assault. Assault...not because I'm being a shitty person, but because I am easy to assault. I'm the guy that no one will back up, the guy that it's absolutely fine to shit on, the punching bag, the sub-human.

I recently moved from NYC, having been born and raised there, to hopefully live a less aggressive life. I thought maybe Colorado would be better...but my new job has people just shitting on me here. Usually, I'm compared to every Jewish celebrity under the sun, regardless of whether or not I actually look like them and it kind of feels insulting.  

I fucking hate being me, I hate that I am the joke to everyone. It makes me so depressed that I can't just have the same dynamics other people have between one another. People hold off on being my friend or interacting with me just because of this anti-Semitic bullshit. Like it's uncool to hang with a Jew even if that's not something I identify with. I fucking hate all of it.",31Dec2018,1

101,"Obviously it's new years eve and all my siblings are out with their friends, parents are gone doing whatever. I have very few friends and thanks to my crippling social anxiety, when the ask if I want to hang, I just say no I'm busy, even when all I have to do is lye down and cry. I'm just walking around my house and everything seems blurry and whited out and depressing as fuck. I keep falling asleep when I sit down and I dream about someone breaking into my house and then I do something to piss them off enough to shoot me. I want that to happen in real life. I want someone to just kill me in a way that doesn't hurt and is quick. I know I'll never build up the courage to talk to anyone about it, and the thought that I'm just slowly going insane under the thin layer of normalness about me that people see terrifies me. I don't know what to do. I don't feel like hurting myself and I don't know if I want someone else to. I would love to be normal and have good friends, but the thought of how much work would go into that makes me think that it's easier to just lose and get someone to kill me, go jump in a highway or get shot.

106,"I have no idea how to feel. I just feel so sorry for him; he’s being torn away from a family he loved dearly. For the past 2 years my mom has treated him like shit. She has kicked him out numerous times. I guess today was the last of it all. I don’t know the reason behind why she treated him that way or why she is leaving him. He never deserved any of that. He has done everything for us. He treated my sister and I like we were his own. His family treated us so amazing too.

My real father passed away when I was 11 months old. This is the closest I’ve ever had to a father. I honestly can’t stand to have him taken away from my life. Growing up with a single mom, moving from apartment to apartment because she couldn’t afford it working her three jobs was treacherous. I hated everyday showing up to school with the same jeans I wore the prior day. Once he came along it all changed. My mom got her life together, became a regional manager, bought a house together, bought her first car. She did it all, with his help. 

He gave us a whole new world that I thought I would’ve never experienced. If it weren’t for him I wouldn’t be going to college. I wouldn’t have gotten to travel. I wouldn’t have felt love and comfort when I was down.

Yes I love my mom and I will always be by her side... but I fucking hate the decisions she is making right now. It makes me not want to be around her. She isn’t the monster she’s being right now. Makes me wonder if she’s ok... I’m a grown man myself but I’m fucking crying like a newborn. I can’t stop. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore.",31Dec2018,1
108,"This past year has been a roller coaster for me. Ups and it seemed like a lot of downs. But the thing I did notice the most this past year was my friend group changed. I met a ton of awesome people this past year and at the same time I lost contact with a lot more. I worked a job that required me to help people and I met a ton of awesome people who I would talk to daily. But once I quit my job and decided to move on. I noticed all these people were just using me. The ones that kept me around at first, tried to use me later on in the year and when I would say no, they would simply block me. This hurt so much at first because it made me feel so alone. But the more it happened the more it made me not care. On the other hand, I went out and decide to expand my group of friends on my own. I met some awesome people both from reddit and other places. I cared about these people because I actually went out and tried. I do realize that I may have acted wrong or said the wrong thing to some people. And with these people, I wish I had the chance to apologize. I was trying to figure out myself during these times and how to be a good person.  And others, just decided I wasn’t worth their time. But a few decided to stick around and these people have been amazing and I love each and everyone of them. But all this made me realize that for the upcoming year, I’m going to only focus my time on those who want it. And cut ties with those that don’t. I’m also going to improve myself and be happy with who I am. With a lot of hardship, I really feel like good things will come from it. So I’m so excited for next year 😊",31Dec2018,1
109,"People don't even have discussions any more. Its like Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots but with Straw-men. Everybody is a neckbeard or a libtard or conservawhore or whatever the fuck stereotype the internet invents today...

Every group has their list of foregone conclusions, (because it was correct once, so the same idea must be universally true and easily scale to fit any situation,) disagree with one of those and you'll be *classified*.

Don't be a joiner. Be a seeker. A thinker. A pioneer. Wonder, question, accept and consider. Why give up your humanity to ideology and demagoguery when all you gain is the illusion of righteousness? You can play make believe on your own. No need to syphon off someone else's fantasies.

Right now I'm watching NetFux ads roll by. Its screen after screen of people looking serious... About some imaginary shit. WTF. Too many shows look like some kind of revenge fantasy against an imaginary enemy that, surprise, turned out to be all too real... If only everyone hadn't disregarded so-and-so maybe this tragedy could've been avoided. Or then there's the shows admiring violent criminals and showcasing exotic cuisine. I like to imagine those genres will collapse into one another and have dozens of cannibal cooking shows. At least that might be morbidly entertaining.

Suck a dick!
