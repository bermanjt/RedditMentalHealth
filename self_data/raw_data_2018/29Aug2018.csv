1,It seems like wherever I go or how old I get I’m always the unlucky one or the clumsy one and sometimes it feels depressing. Does anyone else feel like they’re constantly fucking up or getting unlucky?,29Aug2018,0
2,"I'm(32f) starting to finally see some good coming my way. Starting a new job, getting a place, and being clean for almost 5 months is just the beginning.  Yea, there are still plenty of things I want to happen but grateful for what has happened so far. Other than being depressed over my relationship or ex relationship for reasons that are crazy to me,  especially when I have been honest and trying to go above and beyond but what can I do.  I Have learned to accept life and what comes cause things always get better.  So happy to be progressing and 138 days CLEAN!!!",29Aug2018,3

4," 

Lately, I feel like high school has been going way to quickly. I am currently in my 10th grade year and I feel like just yesterday I was in 7th. I think what really resonates these emotions is that in my 9th grade year I had gone to quite a crappy school and now that I've switched to a new and great school I feel like I've completely missed out on my 9th grade year. I'm behind in Math, Spanish and science. I'm taking bio while all of my classmates are in chemistry. I guess what I am saying is that I really regret not switching schools earlier, and feel like I could've spent my time in my new school where everything is so much greater.

Sorry for grammar and format, I just had to get this of my mind. Any comments or thoughts are welcome.",29Aug2018,2
5,"So.. a couple days ago i noticed my sister started to shower I'm the hallway bathroom vs the master bedrooms shower where she had always showered. Today I asked why she started using this shower instead and... Guess her response. She said, she couldn't move around in that shower enough. Aka she didn't fit in it.

I have brought up the issue with my parents a buttload of times. They're feeding them so much fucking crap that they're getting so fucking huge. From time to time I'm like (with Dad) you like being cheap huh? Just imagine how much that hospital will cost you when your kids have a heart attack. And ""stop feeding your kids crap. You're going to give them the same shit you have (diabetes)"" he ALWAYS shrugs it off and acts like nothing is wrong. 

When I try to get my siblings to wake the fuck up it's always ""I would rather die than eat healthy and miserable"" oh ya? Does not being able to touch your toes, being out of breath when you walk 5 feet, sweating a bucket, living in your bed etc. Sound fun? Somehow if I insist (both to my father and siblings) according to mom and dad, I'm ""bullying"" them. ""Stop bullying your sisters!!"" Bruh... Lmao legit when my sister told me her reasons for not showering in the other bathroom I just walked away without saying anything because my mother would call it bulling even if I slightly suggested to go take a walk. 

Last Thursday I got kicked out. I was given 3 months to leave. Their reasoning? ""I'm tired of you making our lives sour"" bro.. u serious? 

I'm just not going to do or say shit anymore... They can die from an heart attack for all I care.. my younger sister is in 7th grade and she's 5'10 at 190? Ish? Prob in the 200s. My oldest sister who's  a sophomore in highschool is 5'7 at 180lbs. My older brother who's 6'0 is at 280lbs 

Yepppp... Soo ",29Aug2018,0
6,"I’ve recently been told my mom left me for 3 years when I was a baby, and then came back to my father to have my younger sister. I had never known this. Hearing it absolutely destroyed me. How do I even begin to confront my parents regarding this topic? I’m only 17 now. I am beyond angry ",29Aug2018,2
7,"My wife had an affair with her boss.

I told her I can't and refuse to recover from this.

I'm hurt and lost and alone.

My entire life is built off of us. Everything I like I do with her. I moved to another part of the world for her. My family loves her. How do I tell my young nephews their favorite aunt betrayed them. 

Where do I go? How does anybody possibly start to heal from this. It feels like so much of me just died.",29Aug2018,3

10,"When I was 8 years old my parents divorced for various reason including my diagnosed naricissitic mom sitting at home doing nothing and my dad cheating on her.

My father was always moving for work so my mom won the custody. I had the chance to see him maybe 1 or 2 times a month.I really missed him even if he wasn't the best father.

At the time my sister was 14.Her way of coping was always being out with friends since getting home meant starting a screaming match with my mother. I instead buried myself into food,videogames and the internet. The conditional love I was raised with kind of helped me going through school elementary and middle school without issues.

Fast forward a couple of years(13 years old) and I was starting to lose weight,feel more happy and social. This probably was due to me spending 1 whole year with my father(which I didn't see that much) 's new partner which was,even for a short time,a way better MOM than what I had up until then but he cheated on her too.

Meanwhile I feel into a trap. Losing weight made me feel more accepted and led me to anorexia and bulimia.I was sick,but everyone refused to admit it until I was hospitalized. I can hardly describe how felt.No one was recognizing my pain. Wanting to be left alone,I went back to living with mother(she never seemed to care anyway),stopped talking with my dad and lost a school year. After a few months I decided to go to therapy.Things were hard but started to look a little more brighter. I started talking and seeing my father again but I already knew things were not gonna be the same. After going back to school everything seemed to be going ok.I still lived with my mom even though we didn't talk much.She was going with it as long as I had good grades.

Problem Jumping to 2015(17 years old):I was feeling great,was in good shape,had friends and a part time job. As great as this sounds this is where things started getting hard. One day of summer after coming back home from work I found my mom sitting on the couch as always(she was still getting money from my dad) and for some reason I SNAPPED REALLY BAD. I was mad,angry and everything else.She has never done anything good in her life. After violently screaming I started breaking the furniture in her room.Neighbors were going to call the police but fortunately called my aunt which came and stopped me before anything bad could happen.Later that night I cried for like 4 hours straight realizing what I had done. After that event my mom(both fortunately and unfortunately) didn't kick me out. Things changed tho.She stopped taking care of the house and let herself go to the point where she wouldn't even flush the toilet. So I had to take care of her and think about the house. Her state had somehow infected me and guess what?I lost another school year.

She has now become a lost cause.It’s like a child who always plays the victim card and doesn’t take responsibility of anything. Idk what to do to make her understand to at least take care of something in the house and often leads me to screaming and doing passive aggressive stuff...and those are not impulsive acts...I think about it and it’s the only way she’ll understand. Of course I’m considered the bad guy in her side of the family where everyone is like:”Take care of your mother”

AND WHY THE FUCK WOULD I??! SHE DID NOTHING BUT MADE SUFFER AS A KID ONLY THINKING ABOUT HERSELF

I searched support from my father but came to a really sad realization.He doesn't seem to care unless I am doing good.I always struggled opening up with him.And now money are starting to get even tighter and I can’t even go to the end of the month without asking for a bit more which makes me feel even more shit;The way he talks to me too...he gulits trip me into seeing him even if I don’t find pleasure in it.

There was this one time last month where after years of pretending I was like:”Dad I’m not ok” And he was:”Yeah...it’s common at your age”...

All of this is impairing the relationship with the few peoples in my lifes….I kick everyobdy out and I’m in a constant seek for love and validation and when that doesn’t come I immediatley split on the person. I keep having intrusive thoughts about me being a bad person that nobody wants around. I struggle to seek help.I can't open up to anyone.I don't want to be a burden.I lost everyone's trust.

As of now I'm attending 11th grade and trying to get something done at school. I really want to graduate and achieve my dream of becoming a mathematician. As I'm writing I feel like it shouldn't even matter and that I should suck it all up since is the only way I’ll get out of it but it gets harder and harder everyday.. 

Sometimes I miss being suicidal….at least I knew I had a way out",29Aug2018,3
11,Should I get thanked/rewarded for house-sitting and looking after two dogs for two weeks? I fed the beasts raw chicken carcasses every day and I'm vegan. I was house-sitting for a colleague. I think she thinks she was doing me a favour but I already had a home so there was no gain. I just did it cos she said she had no other options.,29Aug2018,2
12,"i have these days,it’s once a week or something where i simply don’t feel good. not physically as i workout and eat healthy as part of my lifestyle, but mentally i just feel a sence of “what’s the point?” and over all just not feeling happy. If i am not wrong this to normal right? like are brains are a mush of chemistry and some days chemicals flow differently than others? ",29Aug2018,2
13,I just started a public high school after going to a catholic school for K-8 I know some kids but Its the second day of school and I still aren’t friends with anyone am I over exaggerating or is this normal?

16,"constantly reminded of my failures in life, how I was just barely not enough or how much I really dont matter to anyone",29Aug2018,15
17,"I don't have a lot of time, so the short version is I feel like I got a lot of living packed into my life from 18 - 21.  Whenever I talk to people who got locked into careers and/or marriages w/ kids at that age, it's likely talking to people who died a lot earlier before they ever ""peaked"" as hard and figure life isn't about getting quality, but about getting the distance.  It's really depressing, but I can also recognize life is a mess because of this.  If you get a lot when younger you wonder what you're doing with the rest of your life for the ""distance"" portion of it, if you don't get as much when younger you wonder what the fuss is all about and it seems like these people are just punching a clock their entire life.

I have enough life experience now to know that nobody ""wins"", we're all screwed.  It's just depressing knowing some people miss the heightened window, and end up at most being able to buy into a diluted version after the real thing has been available, but they had to pass over it due to other obligations they locked themselves into.  Usually due to social expectations that were thrust upon them.",29Aug2018,6

19,"Pretty much everyone in school can't wait to go to college, and that was me all of freshman year and most of sophomore year. It was mainly because I hadn't made any super close friends, but now I have 2 best friends, and I'm friends with so many more people than I ever thought possible. It's my junior year, but I know the next 2 years will probably be finished before I can blink, considering I feel like freshman year happened yesterday. I'm finally really enjoying school (the workload isn't great, but it's not like it'll get any better in college), and even if I don't like some of my classes, I still have friends that make me want to go to school. There's about a 95% chance I'll be separated from all my friends after high school because we all have very different plans, but I really don't want to lose them as friends. They're some of the closest, truest friends I've ever had and I really hate the idea of not seeing each other. It also doesn't help that one of them wants to live where we are right now for her life, while I want to get as far from here as I can, and my other friend wants to join the military, and eventually move overseas. There's no way we'll be able to see each other, and there's no guarantee that we'll even stay close. I'm happy where I am right now, and I don't want it to end.",29Aug2018,3
20,"I've been having watery diarrhea for the last few years and it didn't bother me until the last six months. I've been having stomach and chest pains that are numbingly painful. I often find that any painkiller makes it a lot worse. So, I smoke a lot of weed to make it feel better. Just yesterday, I was on the toilet for 2-3 hours and my poop was black, shredded coffee grounds. I can't afford to see a doctor",29Aug2018,0
21,"I took a year off when I graduated high school, because I really had no idea what I wanted to do. It was so unpleasant to think about at the time, that I just didn’t. I ended up staying home most of the year, working a small job for a few months, but that’s pretty much it. People, mainly my father, kept pushing me to go to college. 

I felt like I was ready to do go and do work (because I slacked off in high school) but I really don’t think I am. I think I’m just a lazy depressed piece of shit. I don’t care at all about making new friends, I don’t try to talk to new people, I don’t get out of my comfort zone, etc. As soon as I get out of class, I just go back to my dorm and lay in bed until I either go to the gym, get food, or go to sleep. 

I don’t even know what the fuck I’m supposed to do. If college isn’t for me, what is? I’m not interested in anything, I have no passion, no motivation. I’m just a waste of money and space. ",29Aug2018,2
22,"So this started in the summer I told her how I felt and she well didn't feel the same so whatever I try and keep being friends with her my other friend tells me to tell her how much she means to mean, still that did not work. So then we keep talking less and less. Sometimes she'll start texting me I'll try and text her cause I wanna keep being friends. But when she FaceTimes me pisses me off the most cause the only times she does is when she's with her friend and they try to mess with me and it's annoying. She'll say like ""how you doing"" I'll say ""meh"" then like she'll say ""you still like me?"" And I'll say one of two things one ""meh"" or two ""sorta getting over you"" but then they'll try and mess with me. She gave her friend my phone number saying racist ass shit like ""hey (insert my name here) what do you Asians like to eat cause I hear it's dog"" or ""ching chong chingy chingy Chong"" some bullshit like that but it's been getting more annoying over time. I'll say ""can you please stop FaceTiming me"" and she says ""fine"" but not even 1 minute later I get two people FaceTiming me it's her and her friends phone number.

24,"I consider myself to be on the far left of the political spectrum. One of the guiding principles of my life has come from Audre Lorde's *The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House*: basically that it's impossible to reform existing political systems from the inside. However, I've also always held ambitions of running for political office and have a hard time reconciling the two. I feel I could be incredibly effective as an elected official but in order to get elected, I would probably have to cave on some key issues that are incredibly important to me.

I'm on the verge of being appointed to my first political position. I submitted paperwork recently to be appointed as a precinct councilperson in my county a few days ago. Since then, I've been seriously reconsidering my position on running for office. Basically what the question comes down to is whether I should stick to my principles without compromise or  cave a little bit for the chance to affect wider change?",29Aug2018,1

Or because you know you ain't getting what you really want, your heart's deepest desires, what you really want on top of everything because they're too impossible to come to be. Because you know your life is gonna be the same empty, deprived wasteland that hurts you alot and never leaves you feeling great or good, and that's why you can't motivate yourself. I mean, what's another year in school when you're dead inside? What's another humiliation from failing another year when you spent most of your time humiliated?",29Aug2018,1

37,"So I don’t mean this in a sexual way, but I just love the feeling, particularly the feeling afterward.

Every night I strap an electronic collar (Mini Educator) to my leg. This particular collar is a nerve stimulator. On low levels you can barely feel it and it feels like a tingle. On high levels it feels like a burn (doesn’t actually cause burns).

And I strap it to one of my legs and began tapping the button repeatedly. All the muscles in my body tense up. When I release the button, they loosen. I do this for about 10-20 minutes per night, just shocking myself repeatedly. The feeling afterward of pure euphoria, bliss, and calmness is amazing and I fall asleep in minutes.

I get the same feeling from hot water. Like, really hot water. Like if you’ve ever felt water so hot that it feels cold. I like seeing my hand turn dark red and get numb from the pain. And sometimes my hand starts smoking as well. 

If I’m in constant pain for an amount of time (10-20 Minutes in my case) it feels just as good as the feelings you’d get after sexual climax. Except better because the pain from the water or collar is more intense. 

I looked it up a while ago and the blissful, euphoric feeling is due to endorphins released when in pain. Some webpages say the endorphins after pain are similar to feelings when on morphine. And I believe the stronger the pain, the more endorphins are released. Which is probably why it has this Valium-like effect on me.",29Aug2018,2
38,"Even though we had our differences in the past, I am so grateful that she is in my life now. Long story short, I have an illness and the drugs used to treat it cause depression and anhedonia (like most drugs do, thanks Big Pharma...). Also the thought of being sick gets under my skin too. I used to be suicidal over it all, but today I saw that I could never commit suicide, it would literally destroy my mother.



What happened is that I gave her some story I wrote to read, and it was a *little* depressive and first she got angry, but after talking about it I started crying, and she said she can't go to work if I'm crying, it'll be too much pain for her and she would cry at work knowing that I'm crying at home. I never knew she cared that much. I told her ""who cares if I'm crying"" and she said ""well I care, more than you know"", she might be the only one who does, but one person is enough to stop me from ever thinking about suicide again. So thanks mom, thanks for caring about me when noone else does.",29Aug2018,149
39,"Let’s just say there are certain people in my life who, while outwardly I get on fine with them and things are usually okay, I know I’m repressing real contempt for certain aspects of their personality/the nature of the relationship I have with them. I also know they would be very hurt if they knew about it, so it’s not like I can bring up the issue with them. I just really don’t know what to do.",29Aug2018,6
41,"I called my contracting company and officially quit today. I was an assistant. I had been in a miserable office for over 7 years that didn't start off so bad, but got worse, and it was wearing me down, as a person.  I was really miserable being stuck inside when it was nice outside. I hated going to work in the dark and then going home in the dark in winter. I don't think this is how humans are supposed to live. I took about 12 sick days on days that I was too miserable to go to work. I'm so glad I don't have to go back! I'm still in shock about it, but I'm proud that I pulled the plug.

&amp;#x200B;

I have enough saved for 3 comfortable months, but I do plan on setting up passive streams of income to make it last as long as I am still kind of finding out what I want to do. I still have 10k in student loans (no other debt), but I am not going to live just to work to pay this off. Once I get money on my own terms, I will be pay those off and be debt free. The more I research, the more it seems there are clever ways to make money that doesn't involve being stuck in an office for the best part of the day. I'm gonna give it a go! Wish me luck!",29Aug2018,68

I'd say 90% of the time I message them nowadays, they come online instantly but my messages don't get marked as ""Seen"" until hours or sometimes even days later. Like they're making the ""effort"" to let me know I'm on artificial delay. When I call them they don't return them until months later with some crappy excuse. When they're in town they do visit me however. I have to wonder how much of it is disappointment in how I turned out.

43,"You're probably going to read the following and think I'm a lazy bastard, and you're probably right. I'm trying to fix this.

If I have to go to work at 8, I'll set my alarm about three quarters of an hour before I have to get up with snoozes every 5 minutes so I don't fall back into a deeper sleep. This way, I can feel like I slept in every day, and I get up in time every time. This works when I need to be somewhere. But it doesn't when I don't have to be anywhere that day and want to do my own stuff, I prioritize my sleep over what I'm going to do, and justify it with ""I'll be too tired to do anything today"", which is probably bullshit. I've asked other people about this and they just say ""just get up"". I mean, fair enough, but when I first wake up my first and only thought is ""*more sleep*, *more sleep*"", there's nothing really beyond that. Then when I do get up, I think how stupid it was to sleep in, how I need to get up tomorrow morning, I won't do that shit again. I'm just a heavy as fuck sleeper and don't know how to fix that. How do I get rid of that bullshit immediate mentality of justifying more sleep in the morning when my brain is quarter-working? How do I swap out ""I can sleep a little more"" with ""I need to get up"", without doubting it? I try every weekend to set a fuck load of alarms, with warnings ""GET UP NOW"" but I just don't absorb them. I don't know. This all seems so stupid but I just keep falling back into this bullshit pittrap.",29Aug2018,1

I went into a branch and they hooked me up with a card. They told me how to get a replacement etc. The card came 2 weeks later and it STILL had the previous name. I was mad but I understand it. Maybe the name change hadn't gone through to my account. By the time I got it the name had changed on my account so I thought I'd order another one. Today I got that card and...

Nobody's told my sister yet, because she's at work. I'm alone at home, so if she does ring on her way home from work, I might have to be the one to tell her. She lives way down south though, so I doubt she'll be able to come back to see him at short notice.

I needed photos for some documents and thus set off to the photo-taking place which is about 2 kilometers from where i live. I decided to cycle, as there was no way i was being dropped to a place so close. Now i cycle to school daily and have been for the past four years, but recently (around three months ago), after resisting for 4 years, i started to cycle whilst listening to music i.e with earphones plugged in.

So i'm about 200 meters from home when i see my brother on the other side of the road and as i pass him, he shouts at me two come over for a second. I groan, slow the cycle down, and turn the handle bar, without looking over my shoulder.

A motorcycle had hit the cycle at about 2/3 it's length, 2-5 inches behind the seat, it basically hit the wheel of the cycle. I just slowly crawled away, but quickly realized that nothing was broken. My brother and a few other people had run over.

50,"Sometimes when someone shares a feeling with me and I don't think it's a reasonable feeling, I kind of (in a slightly annoyed and maybe condescending tone) tell them how they don't have to feel that way because of xyz reasons. 

For example, my mom told me today that she hated that some other person asked her to share some things with her that my mum worked hard for. My mom was saying ""How dare she ask?"" And I respond with ""It's completely fine for her to ask. It's in her interest. You don't have to say yes obviously but it's not so weird that she asked.""

My mom just nodded and continued talking but I felt kind of bad as soon as I said that. I am not entirely sure why but I think it was because I felt like I was reducing the value of my mum's feelings. 

Is there a way that I can reduce doing that? I also felt like I wanted to apologize right away but I didn't because my mom didn't say it was an issue so I didn't want to randomly apologize for something that didn't outwardly seem like a problem",29Aug2018,7
51,"This is my first time posting something like this but here it goes. Through out my whole life I have been mostly independent. Also a black sheep in my family and anti-social in school. I’ve had a hard time making friends due to the stress at home; I couldn’t think straight and I had too much on my mind to just have small talk with someone so I always felt like some kind of outsider at school. My stepdad molested me and my mom did a lot of drugs (they got a divorce). My aunts hated me because they thought I would be just like my mom and basically cut off all contact with my cousins. I’m an only child so I was very lonely. I’ve tried to kill myself twice but it didn’t work out.

Things are much better now. I live with my bf who has a decent enough job for us to have our own apartment. We have a kitty and we watch anime and play pc games. I love it. I love him. He never yells at me and he basically spoils me. He made life very good for me and I hope to god that I will marry him.

But lately I’ve been feeling down. My mom has been in and out of jobs. She keeps dating meth dealers too. I feel so sorry for her. She is basically homeless and sleeps in her car most the time. She been asking money from me, which is fine but lately it’s been ridiculous amounts. I’m in community college and I work at a fast food place. I can’t keep giving her 500 dollars here and there. I’m never gonna ask my bf for help, we are already living kind of tight.

She cries. She cries a lot and talks about killing herself. I hate her and I love her but I can’t keep dealing with this stress. I don’t have any friends to really talk to this about and I don’t wanna talk to my bf about it cause I know he is stress from work and has his own problem. 

I’m stress from school, from her, and from my shitty job. I’ve been trying to look for a new one but I’m so damn awkward; I come off like I have no personality and I hate it. 

I haven’t talked to a doctor or a therapist yet. I don’t honestly know if I need to. I just feel like I’m constantly stuck in this sadness state. I want to be happy and only worry about my bf and school. 

I don’t know. I just want to vent about how much I hate my life.

53,"I know that sounds a bit ridiculous, but let me explain. 

I cannot stand to hear pretty much any incessant noises, including but not limited to: eating, drinking, chewing, swallowing, coughing, throat clearing, sniffling, keyboards tapping, pens clicking, calculator punching, snoring, basically any form of loud breathing, my cat grooming himself, water dripping, paper being crumpled...you get it. I’m so sensitive to these that my boyfriend tells me that if he clears his throat at night while he’s up watching TV and I’m asleep, that even then I make a noise that sounds like a groan (something that I know I do when I hear these noises). During the day I wear headphones from the time I get to work to the time I go home to avoid hearing these things. 

When I say I can’t stand it, I mean that it makes me extremely angry. I end up clenching my fists so hard that I make noticeable marks on my palms with my fingernails, or clenching my jaw so tight in an attempt not to cry that it really ends up hurting. 

I’ve dealt with this for several years, but it’s been getting worse. It makes me feel crazy, and I snap at my boyfriend every time he makes the smallest noise (god bless him for understanding it’s not personal, but he doesn’t deserve to be afraid to breathe around me). I feel awful and don’t know what to do. 

I’ve taken some measures to try to reduce stress, like getting organized, eating better, exercising. And while I do feel less stressed, I still haven’t been able to get a handle on this issue in particular. 

Anyone dealing/has dealt with this and have any helpful suggestions? Anything at this point is much appreciated.

72,"tl;dr - Wonderful girlfriend left me. We still love each other the same. She comes off as confused to me and I struggle to talk about it with her without hurting her. I'm broken over it. I want her back or for me to understand what has happened through a different lens.

This is going to be a bit rough and I apologize.

2 months ago my perfect girlfriend of 2 years left me out of the blue for reasons I really didn't understand, and still really don't. I met her through a acquaintance's friend at the time. Hit it off instantly. I'll never forget that 10 mile bike ride before I had my car to see her for the first time, only for it to be the catalyst for something so beyond amazing. For 2 years I had the kindest, most loving, caring, funny, and without a doubt most beautiful person imaginable. I knew nothing but love for her. There were no issues, no lies, no doubts. She shared this feeling with me.

Out of nowhere in June she decided she didn't want to be with me anymore. It absolutely destroyed me. I had some other stuff that happened at the time which I was depressed about but I would've never given up and was chugging through it, but then on top of all that, I lost the person who assured me she'd always be there and love me the way she had. Ended up with me almost harming myself before getting stuck in a er not too long after because I didn't eat at all and hardly slept if at all in 3 days. I talked her through that because she didn't understand and blamed herself, which it wasn't her fault. Her story has changed over time about why she left, and it confuses me more and more to the point it's crippled me. From she needed time for school, to she needed time to herself, I understood what she wanted. How could I not want for her to be happy and stuff, but she assured me that was never going to happen, all the way until it did. It feels so beyond helpless and being on the receiving end where I really will never understand because it's her own decisions and life, it makes it frustrating and painful. It's been fucking hell getting to this point. I'm still lost. I still wake up thinking about her and falling asleep to the thought of her. No matter how hard I try, what I do, I still see her as that perfect human being and part of me that I can't not want my life without, because it was so damn great for us and it was something that was always supposed to be there for both of us. Up until the end she used to tell me all the time how I would have to be the one to leave her. I could never do that, we were too happy and everything was wonderful. She's fucking beyond amazing and she doesn't really realize that.

3 months after she left we've still been talking, hanging out, and getting together like nothing happened, outside of our convos about us getting back into a relationship and how shitty of a situation this is. She's starting college only 20 minutes away from where we lived. It's not like we won't see each other, and she knows this. She tells me all the time she still loves me, she's still thinking about us and when we do talk about it I know it's painful for her too. Last weekend she was telling me how she was considering getting back together and how hard it was after we had a few serious conversations. We had a few of those painful convos, and where it hurts me is every other day she's feeling the opposite way about what she wants to do. I've forgiven her for this, I really cannot understand what she's going through at the moment. I can't even really tell her how I feel without hurting her to the point she separates herself from talking to me, I just push her away and hurt us. I feel like I can barely even communicate with her because she takes it so hard and I'm very thorough with how I feel to her. We still have that beyond strong love and care for each other and that importance to each other, like nothing changed. We still talk and act the same, laugh the same, and love each other the same. We are the same to each other as we always have been, a special feeling between us that hasn't changed. Everybody tells me she just seems confused maybe and maybe she'll come around to it. I guess I feel the same. If that's true how do I talk to her about that?

This all has consumed me to a terrible degree. Therapy, ignoring her, moving on in my head and talking to other people and replacing all the time we had with doing other things and friends. How could this person who loves and cares about me so, and wanted the same life with me all the way until the very end, bail on me? I don't know the answer to that, but I do know how I feel. Broken. I feel numb to life at this point. Every day gets harder and harder for some reason. What's happened since then is stuff I've regretted. I immediately turned back to stuff I had previously gotten through, such as shutting myself in and substance abuse, the big thing. When I was thrown into a partial inpatient program, dealing with the guilt of what I had done turned me to abusing some of the meds they gave me. Instead of crying and zoning out while trying to do anything, turned into doing that stuff with the mask of just being off and keeping that stuff on the inside. I stopped early on. That then turned into painkiller abuse, something I struggled with in the past, which went on and off for months until recently when I decided it was enough. 

This all culminated into last night. Nothing has gotten better. I said my goodbyes to her as she was today moving out to school, hung out in my car, and then went out into a little area that is special to me, and thought about a lot. I'm not happy with how college is going for me, I'm not happy with my actions and how I've handled this, or how in general my life has turned out so far. Most of all, I'm not happy with losing a person so important and amazing, and a person who still loves me and cares about me like no other. I can't deal with her being with other people. I can't. I had planned on proposing after how strong of a relationship we had at some point. She wanted that too, perhaps not as soon as I did, but she didn't know I was going to. It was going to be a while before I did anyways, definitely not now. Our lives were ahead of us together, and we were both so happy and ecstatic for that. I'm glad I didn't hurt myself, I really don't think I wanted to in the first place. I was out there for the longest time losing my shit over this and it's at the point I can't. I'm so confused and broken that she left. This wasn't how things were supposed to be. Why does she still love me and not want to be with me?

I'd like to know what I can do to figure this out to make this easier, or what I can tell her to have her understand how this seems to me, how this has effected me, how I feel without pushing her away? What about her? Why did she do this to me if she still loves me the same as she did and cares? Is there anyway to talk to her about this and make her seriously rethink if she really is confused? Does it seem like she is? Why do I love her so much?

75,"... all of a sudden it's ""UGH UGH REPOST, BLA BLA, DO YOU WORK FOR THEM? HAIL CORPORATE BLA BLA BLA"" 

They can't conceive of the possibility that two other people in the world could be redditors, and that they could find the same item ""mildly interesting"" and would think ""hey I want to share that to the community"" within the same ""short"" frame of time (likely because the company just came into being and this is the first time they are putting their products into the stream of commerce).  

No we don't work for the fucking company - PEOPLE DO GENUINELY FIND THINGS INTERESTING OF THEIR OWN VOLITION SOMETIMES, I know it's hard to believe that we aren't all bots.  Just because it's a ""product"" that we find interesting, doesn't all of a sudden mean we're placed fake promoters.   That's unfair, while I'm sure you sit there wearing your favorite brand sneakers and fashion name sweater or whatever product you happen to like.  (My item was infinitely more interesting than a sweater, I assure you). 

This is the kind of bullshit that makes me hate reddit.  The fucking REDDIT REPOST POLICE.  You know those people who are so tied into the redtrix that they are like seasoned librarians of every post, every day, on ever major sub... to the point where they can call out people for finding the same thing interesting as if it were a crime against humanity....and then continue with the attitude and accusation that I should be hung and quartered for not being the first person in the world to find the same item interesting and think to share it to the sub. BIGGER ODDS HAVE BEEN OVERCOME. TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN FICTON. 

I deleted the post after that negative energy, even though it was gaining a little traction - and since there was no other sub I can think of to post this stupid random thing, then I'll just keep it to myself because CLEARLY reddit has ""been there done that"" according to these twats.... which I know is not true, BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE SEES EVERY POST THE FIRST TIME, not everyone logs in every day and reads every post on every popular sub so that they can have some internal self-policing no repost system.   What IS true is that these Reddit Police have no fucking life and spend so much time on reddit that they are the reddit librarians, judges, and juries, in their own minds.  Yadda yadda yadda...

Sorry for the venting, I 'm sure others get sick of this too and I offer commiseration...",29Aug2018,2
