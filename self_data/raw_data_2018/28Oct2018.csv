0,"So i finished college, but the education i followed, i didnt like it. Never liked it. I think it is called Mechatronics in English? After college i decided to work and think about my future. Didnt took long before i decided to go back to school. But man, it is so hard. I decided to follow something completely new for me which is Applied computer science (in English?). 

After 8 weeks the first exams came and what can i say? I failed everything (3 test and 1 more next monday). You know those group project memes where the one person doesnt do anything? That was me. I couldnt do anything because my Java programming skills are like non existent, unlike the others in my class. Then there is the grade for the group project and the individual grade you get. Well I failed hard on my individual grade too, have to re-do it next thursday. 

I usually study 3-5 hours after school and then go to sleep. Have been skipping gym for the past 3 weeks and since school started I messed up my eating schedule and lost like 4-6 kgs. 

Should I quit? I really like the education, but im failing so hard and its just the first quarter of the school year. Sorry for spelling mistakes its really late and this shit has been keeping me awake lately",28Oct2018,1

2,"I feel like i have low IQ. And i’m very much aware of my mind. Which creates conflict. 
It’s not so great for a person who has hundreds of deep questions in mind. It feels horrible. depressing. Frustrating. 
I always have to rely on other people because every time i try to figure something out, it takes me a long time, longer than an average person would take. And i need to make a decision. So i end up having to read someone else’s thoughts. 
Which is not always good because things can be explained in a way that creates conviction for the person listening, but it doesn’t mean it’s the objective truth. I want to logically think by myself. It’s okay to seek help from people but I don’t want to entirely rely on them.
I feel stuck inside my mind. It’s painful.

3,"My now ex-girlfriend and I broke up today after dating a year and a half. Two months ago, we bought a puppy together. I had known that I needed to break up with her for a few weeks, and therefore knew that breaking up with her would mean that I wouldn’t be able to see our puppy again. 

Honestly, I shouldn’t have agreed to get the puppy because I knew I would break up with her at some point. We did, though, and I can’t change that. The puppy became such an amazing part of my life. I love that dog more than I can put into words. I slept with her nearly every night and spent most of my days with her. 

Now here I am, a 22 year old guy, crying in my bed over the loss of my puppy. ",28Oct2018,1
5,"Hello everybody! I'm sorry if the text is quite unfocused or anything because I'm on mobile and my English isn't that good. Let's get to the subject..

Should I go for it? Telling my (16M) crush (17F) that I like her? We're good friends. We get on really well with each other so I don't wanna ruin our friendship by getting friendzoned but at the same time I'm getting tired of keeping it in my heart. Actually I've never had a crush or feelings on anyone before and being rejected would be way too much. In about one month, I will eventually not be able to see her again except some Facebook texting which she usually does a lot with me. Once we start chatting we never stop before reaching the 2 hours mark. Also I've been trying never to be the one who starts sending texts but at the end, she just finds something to text me about and then keep talking. The longest amount of time we've spent without chatting has been 3 days so far. We keep telling each other that we hate each other but I'm not sure about that as everytime I tell a joke (which is something we all do a lot in our group) she's the first one to laugh and the same thing goes with speaking, when I talk she usually pays alot of attention. She also takes every opportunity to mess with me. To be clear I can't/don't wanna be in a relationship with anyone right now but I just wanna tell her and drop all the heavy weight I'm carrying alone. I'm just afraid if she rejects and makes fun of me about it. I will probably not be able to look in her face if she does.

Any help is highly appreciated. I'm tired of this.

10,"A few weeks ago, I published a 20 000 word essay on my blog about why I left Islam. It was essentially to put closure on something that happened to me 3 years ago and gather my thoughts and release my anger.

The post makes an appeal to emotion rather than being extremely rational, it's my story rather than some form of apologetic.

I ask really tough questions on the existance of God, ones that would make a theist seek refuse from the devil. The tone and style is intended for a Muslim to read rather than preach to the choir.

While I broke up with my family a few years ago due to these issues and lost most of my extended family too, a few still talk to me and ask me ""why did you leave Islam?"" I always tell them that I can't describe it in a few sentences, it needs a book.

My magnum opus is written now and I made the realization that they will never be able to ponder upon what I wrote or try to understand what I'm saying. Instead they will come up with shallow defenses for one or two points they happened to read.

I make an appeal to them in the post at the end, but it's in an echo chamber.

They now know that I wrote something, but I chose not to tell them where. Even though I feel relieved for closing the books on a chapter of my life, I can't help but feel regret that those who are close to me will never try to understand me no matter how much I elaborate on it. So I chose not to share it with them.

My family does not know that my blog is active and the post is now 5 articles deep so some scrolling is required.",28Oct2018,1

13,"I have put myself out there many times and every single time I've been walked all over and treated like crap. I've gotten dates here and there and kissed a few of those girls but everything always went south right after. They would lead me on and keep me around as a back up guy and me being stupid thinking things were supposed to be going this way or that the girls actually cared and wanted the same thing. They were all just lying to keep me wrapped around their finger until they could find or be with a guy they wanted, most didn't even want to let me go after that, they wanted me to stick around in their lives even after they were in a relationship.

I don't care what anyone says, that is such a humiliating thing. A girl playing with your emotions while they are giving everything you give them to someone else and then they have the audacity to keep you around. I know I don't deserve anything for being a nice, I just wanted a rejection if they weren't interested instead of being made to look stupid giving them chances and thinking they wanted me because they said it themselves or because they kept coming back to me after ending it over texts a few days later. Mind you I have never been in a relationship and still a virgin. No one is going to believe me when I say I'm nice or selfless to those girls but I know I'm not assertive or cocky and that is why I'm alone, single, and worthless to women.

Women may not want to be with a douchebag but I know they don't give a crap about a guy like me who is trying to get to know them, wants something serious, is available, and just wants to be treated like a human being. If all those girls just rejected me I'd be perfectly fine with it, I would have accepted all those rejections and moved on just like I have all the other times its happened. But they didn't want to reject me and they also didn't want me, I was their joke that they would reach out to when they were bored or needed attention. Again women may not want a douchebag but if it were between me and a guy like that they would take him in a heartbeat. I hate the whole thing people about women being immature and they don't realize who the guys worth being with are until later in life, I've been told I'm the guy women want to settle down with in their 40s and up not be with now in our 20s. This was by two different girls I was close friends with.

When I hear about that or that I should work on myself and someone will eventually show up, it tells me that I'm worthless to them. I get walked all over and treated like crap but they will go through many, many guys that don't care about them until they decide I'm good enough. Watching everyone be with someone and I'm 23 and have nothing to show for it, just a degree and job, it all means nothing to me. My birthday is coming up and I will never be able to have shared my life with someone, I was alone through everything. Fuck I had to watch a girl I cared so much about that treated me like crap be with my now ex friend and their relationship was everything I dreamed of. They both randomly lied to me that nothing was going on between them, she was insanely jealous of me just interacting with women I had to interact with, and he would defend her actions and say that me and her were perfect together and would work out in the end. 

Maybe I'm not good enough, maybe I'm the asshole in all of this and I deserve everything that happened to me. Maybe those guys are better off with those girls than with me. All I know is that women see me as a joke, worthless, pathetic, a piece of crap. I'm working on myself in every way I can to be better for myself and have been for a while but I have reached the point where anything beyond a platonic relationship with a woman is a waste of time. I mean its not like they want me anyways, but if anyone did show up in my life now its too late. All the experiences I wanted can't happen because college and all those moments already happened, I've been alone throughout everything, I had to watch those girls be with guys while I sat in the corner alone. I can't ever believe anything a woman will tell me now, no amount of love or care will be enough, I'll always resent her because of what I've been through and how her life was everything she wanted and I never had anything. I have to work on myself and be better and be alone for 24 years and then a few more decades before ONE person wants me while everyone else has relationships and sex left and right. I wanted to be with a girl in college and I will never get that, I don't want to be with some woman with relationship or sexual experience because I'll never mean anything to her and I've been made fun of for being a virgin by two other girls I was friends with.

The whole love can happen at any age is bullshit, everyone else does whatever they want and I'm supposed to be ok with having ONE chance at 70. Its not the same or what I want. All I know is that I hate my life, myself, and I'm a worthless piece of crap and all those assholes women pick are so much better than me in every way possible. The amount of times girls say they hate those guys and then go right back to them has shown me they dont see them as that bad, but I must be horrible considering how they treat me. I doubt they will ever regret being with all of them, but they would regret giving me a chance, I'm so repulsive and worthless. All of them will be happy with their lives know they got to be with who they wanted when they wanted, and I just have to accept how much a worthless loser I am. I'm not worth anything, I'll never be able to look back at any ex girlfriends or any fun times or moments with them or feel fulfilled by the amount of ex's or girls I slept with. All I can look back on is how much of a joke I was, how I was lead on so many times and I was so stupid, how I had to watch all of them be with other guys especially the one that got with my now ex friend and I'll never be able to get over that. I wish I had never tried, I wish I realized way sooner how worthless I am and kept to myself. I will never be good enough, no woman will ever be good enough or worth being with now, and my life will always be worthless and lonely. Its all just work and sleep from here on out, just making money to take care of myself through retirement.",28Oct2018,1

(This is the original post)

Alright.

I'm here to talk about something that's been bothering me for a long time now.

I    have a crush on this girl. I think it's more than just a crush,    honestly. It's been two years now since I first saw (met?) her. For the   very first time.

Oh god. I said it. I can't go back now.

I will assume the consequences of this act, if there will have any.

And,   to admit it, I'm really scared that nobody  I know, knows about it.   This is why I haven't told anyone. So you,  person who is reading this,   are the first one to know about it.

So    yeah. I'm in high school. Not really, but the equivalent of high school    I guess. I'm not in the US, so yeah. 2 years ago, there was this    wonderful girl in my class. I think that if you look  at her, you'd say    she isn't outstanding, but I don't know why, for me, she is. Not only    physically. I don't know, man... Wow... What an... angel? A beam of   light ? Descending from heaven ? The very few times I talked to her, she   has always been so nice. Like a real angel.  But she's like that with   everyone, I think. I've never seen her angry,  or rude. In class, she's   either talking to her friends or doing her  work. Like a perfect  student  would.  It doesn't seem like it, but she's just so special...  At least  for me.  She really is. It's the kind of person you just look  at and  think to  yourself, I could live with someone like this  forever...  Sometimes I  just think, that if she could feel what I feel  and  understands my  interests, life would be so perfect with her...

Why    does the way I talk right now sounds so weird ? Because it's the  first   time I translate my thoughts into words. And you probably know  that   everyone's thoughts can be weird.

But I love that girl. I really do. I don't think she likes me back, though. Why would she, after all ?

I have so many things to say, yet I don't know where to start.

Alright,    so 2 years ago, I first talked to her for like 5 seconds. Literally. I    was in the library, doing homework, she would just come to me with  her   friend and she said ""Hello!"" and I said Hello back. She and her  friend   started to laugh. And I was like ""Wtf?"" And thought about it  for a   month. But in class, I talked to her a little bit. A little bit.  Let's   say, 1 minute per week ? And that minute I talked to her, It  was about,   what, homework, stuff, I don't know...

But    that one minute I could talk to her always enlightened my day. And I    could think about that minute for a week if I wanted to. That's how  much   I thought about her. When she probably didn't.

At    the beginning of that year, 2 years ago, I didn't want her to think I    was a social reject. I didn't have friends back then. And in my  class,   there was this guy that I was friends with back in elementary  school  and  I guess he was kinda nice. But not that year. The thing is,  the guy   changed. He made new friends, got new interests and started  being  kinda  rude. But I tried to be ""friends"" with him. So every day,  at  lunch, I  would join him and his friends. They were kinda rude tbh.  And  they kinda  bullied me tbh. But it was more credible than just   bullying.  I don't  know how to say it... They would insult me everyday,   saying I'm cringe,  that I was a normie, etc... and  I found out a  year  ago that they were actually talking behind my back  on Discord.  Posting  photoshopped memes of my face, etc.

And    that year, I talked a bit to that girl. But not a lot. Not enough to    know eachother. But in class, I would listen to her talking to her    friends.

That  girl is really into anime   and mangas, and apparently love reading,  japanese culture and stuff   like that. I'm the complete opposite ;  unfortunately, I'm not a weeb...   Not at all.

Oh,  and did I mention that   ""friend"" I started to hate at that point, also  liked anime, and so   talked a lot with my crush. This bothered me a lot.  But from what I   know, it didn't get further than 'just talk about anime  and mangas'.

I   like video games. And  at the time,  I was into Minecraft. But with my   ""friends"" saying  Minecraft is a cancerous game, I stopped playing it.   No joke. I didn't  want my crush to think the same way, if I'd ever  talk  to her about that.

So  yeah, the  year  ended, and I was scared thinking that girl wouldn't be  in my  class the  next year. But over the summer, I kind of got over it.  And I  stopped  talking to my ""friends"". In fact, I never talked to them   again after  that horrible year.

The   next year, 1  year ago, my crush wasn't in my class. And this is why   last year was so  great. I made actual, nice friends, and some of them   were also friends  with my crush, and that's why sometimes I could talk   to my crush, for  like, 1 minute per month (Hey! That's good,  actually.)  And here I was,  in love again.

At   the very end of last  year, before summer break and before the very  last  exams, It was the  first day of the exams' day and I finished my  first  exam. I went  outside and waited for my parents to pick me up.  And I saw   over there,  my friend, talking with my crush. So I took the  chance  (Once, in my  life) and went there. I think it's the first time  I could  have an  actual conversation, although most of that 10 minutes  I mostly  spoke  with my friend. But I tried to be as interesting as  possible. 

I   remember, when they left, I  felt such an empty void inside me, I fell  in love with her once again,  and this time it was stronger than it was   before. It doesn't look  like it, but she's so nice, kind.... And that   smile, that amazing  smile... And her eyes....... Yeah.

A    week after that, when school was over, I saw that she had a Facebook    account. I know that she and her friends aren't really active on    Facebook and more in Instagram, something that I am not into. I sent her   a friend request, after a week of thinking about it. I waited, waited,    and waited... And realized, after a month, that she actually declined   my  friend request. I know it because I can't send it back.

And I thought about it for the rest of summer. What was that? Was that her that declined it ? Does she hates me ? Who knows...

And now... This year.

This    year, we share three classes together. In one of them, She's sitting    right in front of me, and who knows why, but because of that I'm  always   super excited to go to that specific class. Just to get, maybe,  a  chance  to talk to her. I don't talk to her a lot, most of the time  she  just  laughs at one of my stupid jokes about the class or the  teacher or  some  stuff... But still, we ""interact"" more than we did two  years ago.

And  for now, that's about  it. I could say tons of things but the post would  be waay too long. I  don't want to reveal my identity, that would be  horrible. So I'm trying  to keep this as anonymous as possible.

TL;DR   : I've been in love with this girl for two years now, but we don't  talk  a lot, and I don't think she likes me back. I want to make a move  but  at the same time I know I can't. I don't want to be weird,  especially  after 2 years of not talking to her at all.   And I'm  posting this here,  because, I want to know, what is your advice  ? What  should I do ? I  love her and it's killing me, I'm lost...

(UPDATE  : I could add a few things because little things happened in 2 weeks,  but for now I'll just put the original post. Nothing big happened in the  last 2 weeks though. We just got to talk a bit. Anyway, what do you  think of this?)",28Oct2018,1
19,I’m trying to lose weight and am doing my best to calorie count. I was at a bake sale today and got two cookies. I ate one logged it and put the other one away. I wanted to eat that other one but I knew it would put me over my calorie limit and after much mental debate I’m not eating the cookie. I know it’s kinda dumb but I’m proud of myself as I’ve always had control issues with food. ,28Oct2018,1
20,"I'm 28 and have always had a difficult time making friends. The major problem stems from my lack of self-worth and inability to forgive myself for anything, but I do not think I will be able to get over that as I have contracted the absolute worst personality traits from both of my parents. I also have a sleep disorder, which has decimated my capacity for emotional regulation (I'm either OK after a lot of caffeine or suicidally depressed) and also caused me to lose many jobs and be limited to only afternoon/night careers. I'm lucky to have a job that doesn't start until late in the afternoon now, but it's only a year contract and after which I'm uncertain what I'll do.

I've fucked this life up a bit too much for me to see it normalizing, so I've essentially rationed that I have to leave this world imprinting some net positive impact. The only way I can possibly see me doing that is going back to school to work on a problem that is greater than myself and I'm most drawn to the impending food/water crisis. Unfortunately, I lack discipline and that in conjunction with easily getting discouraged is an obvious sign that a master's degree would absolutely ruin me.

My life just feels over at 28. I'm depressed and caught in awful routines, and I'm unable to make friends because of how much I hate myself. I'm seeing a therapist right now, but it doesn't help much. Antidepressants have been ineffective and ruin the little sleep I do get. It's difficult to convince myself not to commit suicide and hopefully start over in a different consciousness.",28Oct2018,1
21,"I'll start this off by saying, I know how bad it sounds. 

My father died in March 2018, at the age of 55, completely out of the blue. My parents were married for 24 years. I am 22 years old. 

Ever since then, my mom has just been wallowing in her unrelenting grief and it's really annoying me. She attends 2 bereavement groups and gets really upset if one gets cancelled or she can't attend one. She says she has ""no idea"" what she's going to do if the group isn't around when the 1 year anniversary of his death comes. I told her she doesn't need that group to live. She has me. 

A lot of times she acts like she's the only one that lost someone, because I'm very calm about the situation. I lost my father, half of who I am as a fucking person, the kindest, funniest, most brilliant soul I will ever have the privilege of knowing. She once told me, ""it's not even as bad for you because you EXPECT your parents to die before you."" Yes, when I'm middle aged. Not when I'm 21. 

I understand that he's gone and not coming back. There is nothing I can do about this. I make so many jokes about him, because that's the kind of man he was. He was never serious, and boundaries for jokes for him didn't exist. 

My mother is an avid reader and always have been, and she's since only been reading books by people with dead husbands. She posts quotes from the books and just reposts from other pages that are so cringy I have to hide them from my feed. You literally cannot even mention his name without her sobbing until she's sick. It makes me annoyed. 

She absolutely refuses to acknowledge all holidays. Dad's dead? No more thanksgiving. No more christmas. No more easter. No more celebrating her own birthday. My own birthday was 10 days ago and she barely acknowledged it. 

I think this is not right. Life doesn't just stop because someone dies. **Especially** my dad. I  feel like if she even knew the first thing about him, is that he would *want* us to celebrate holidays. Hell, he'd probably want us to be a little over the top since he's not there. 

I feel like she's being selfish. She's making decisions for the whole family based on what **she** feels. She recently posted about how she wishes we could just skip the next 6 months. (My dad and her birthdays are both in november.) 

It frustrates me so much, I just want to yell at her, *why can't you just fucking be strong about it? I have a serious mental illness and I'm doing just fine. STOP feeling miserable for yourself all the time.*

How long will this go on? Forever, it seems. I wish I could have more empathy but for some reason I just can't handle her not being able to handle it. ",28Oct2018,1

24,"I asked multiple times. Both of them. I don't have much to say besides I'm really hurt. I just needed to tell someone, anyone this, because these two are the closest people in my life but I am so fucking hurt and angry with them. I don't know what to do. They've already come to terms with their actions because it happened a year ago and they don't think anything is wrong. I am just basking in lonliness and the feeling of betrayal by myself. I've always been able to bottle it up, and be ok, but things are cracking. I haven't slept in a few days and I'm starting to get delirious. When I sleep, I have nightmares of them together.

27,"I'm doing better than I ever have in some parts of my life, but at the same time it seems I've given up hope somewhat about other parts.  Is this depression?  Is this a mid-life crisis?  Am I just figuring things out like everyone else in life?  I don't know.  The good news is I started a professional position about a month ago with a decent salary and benefits.  It's the best salary and benefits I've ever had.  I can see myself retiring from this organization.  I finally have some stability and hope in regards to the future.  

The bad news is that I do not have any friends, companionship, and I sleep a lot.  I sleep more than usual.  Sometimes I sleep 9-10 hours a day.  I've slept as mush as 12 hours in a day. 

What is the solution?  I hope to venture out and find some interests or hobbies in which I can meet others with similar interests.  Perhaps I can meet a friend or someone to date.  I am uncertain if I will actually follow through with this or not.  Why wouldn't I?  I'm not particularly good at socializing.  I've gotten better over the years, but at the same time I've learned to live more and more without friends or a companion.  Will I ever truly be happy?  I hope so.",28Oct2018,1
29,"Just a bit of background. I have been suffering from depression since I was 15 years old. I'm now 31. I've always had a really good handle on it. I know what to do when it starts to get bad, I've never used it as an excuse for any of my behaviour, etc. I think we'd been together a year or so before I even told her as for the longest time, it never bothered all that much.

We've been together now for almost 8 years and since I told her I had depression, I have felt like I have been open and honest with her regarding it. She is an absolutely amazing, strong woman. She has always been there for me. She's good at noticing when I am having bad days and she does what she can to help make things easier (talking to me, hugging me when needed, reassuring me, taking our two daughters out to give me space, etc) During our relationship, my depression and anxiety have still been there but always in the background. We have a good relationship bar the usual fights and strains on marriages, we are best friends, we have built a great life, nice home, I run a business, we have two beautiful girls, we are happy. I have nothing to complain about. 

&amp;#x200B;

During our relationship, my depression has never been anywhere near as bad as it has over the last month and particularly the last two days. I'm not sure what has set it off or why it has been so bad. There have been some problems in our marriage recently but we are working well together and working things out. We are still devoted and a strong partnership. I don't feel it is because of those issues, but I guess the stress has been greater than usual. yesterday afternoon, the black dog really took hold and all I could do was lay down on my bed and cry. I couldn't stand or sit up. I found myself for the first time in over a decade contemplating suicide. I did the usual things to try and calm myself but nothing worked. It was really scary. On the one hand, I was thinking I have this great life, a wife and children who love me but on the other hand, I had just finally had enough of the endless sadness, the relentless crushing feeling in my chest and all the rest that comes along with it. I really couldn't see any end to it and I felt like even if I could, I didn't have the strength to keep fighting it. I just wanted a break from the pain and suicide was the only way I could see that I could achieve that.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife noticed pretty quickly that something was wrong and that this was different to normal. Never had I told her that I had ever had suicidal thoughts. One of the hardest things in my life I have ever done was tell her right there and then that's how I was feeling. I was terrified she was going to be mad at me or think I was being selfish, or whatever, but she wasn't. She literally sat there with me, held my hand, hugged me, listened and talked to me. She did everything she could to understand and try to empathise with me. She was my guardian angel. In the end, I imagined how I would feel if something were to happen to her and she wasn't around anymore. Then I realised that's exactly how her and the girls would feel if something happened to me. Something about that thought, the touch of her hand on my face and the mixed look of sadness and strength in her eyes really pulled me out of it. She laid with me for a while, then helped me up off the bed and danced with me (we never dance). It was an amazing feeling. She was showing me true, unconditional love, just like she always has, but it felt better than usual. Like on a much deeper level? I don't know, it's hard to describe it.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit later I thought about it and realised what a position I had put her in and how it must have made her feel to see me like that. I asked her how she felt and she said she was okay, she just felt sad for me and that she loves me and hopes I stick around for a long, long time. She also said that she would always be at my side to help fight the fight. I then told her I really felt she saved my life. I truly feel I would have likely acted on my thoughts had she not been there and helped me in the way she did. I'm not quite sure how she feels about it. I think though it has affected her much more than she is letting on.

&amp;#x200B;

I really have no idea how I can ever do to repay her for what she has done for me. I don't feel indebted to her in the ""you saved my life so now I am forever at your service"" sense, but I do feel there is no possible way to show the same level of love and respect to her that she showed me in that situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I also really want to talk to her about her thoughts on the whole situation, but I'm worried if I push her to talk me and she doesn't want to, I may just end up really upsetting her. I really don't want to leave it in the hope that she tells me in her own time though as I think she likely won't bring it up and it will affect her negatively in the future. She is absolutely the most amazing woman I have ever known and I am supremely lucky she wants to spend her life with me. She is my soulmate. The last thing I want to do is to cause her any pain or to have her feel even 1% of how I felt.

I really have no idea what I should do. Has anyone else found themselves in this situation?

​

Tl;dr : I was at the lowest point of my life emotionally yesterday, contemplating suicide for the first time during our relationship and my wife was not only there for me but actually pulled me up and gave me strength to keep fighting. I'm worried now though about what effect her seeing me like that has had on her and I don't have any idea how I could ever repay her.",28Oct2018,1

37,"I've been having a real shitty fucking week.


 Every day at work has been stressful because the clients never finish on time, but the nature of my work requires me to take the majority of the responsibility for the assignments. On top of that, I screwed up and gave wrong information in a meeting to a client, and in another meeting promised something I wasn't supposed to promise and got scolded by my boss. Each day contains so much stress because of how much uncertainty there is, both client wise and because I don't feel like I know enough about my field despite being in it for a year. I'm not confident I can meet all the deadlines set for me, but I really need this job to save money for grad school. I dread going to work because I'm so scared I won't be able to finish everything and the work won't stop piling up.



Outside of work I've been working on some creative projects with friends, where I'm de facto leader because no one else wanted to take responsibility. One of them has been extremely passive aggressive because of some miscommunication about who was assigned what, and basically told me to learn how to do their part of the project myself. Another team member hasn't been responding to any of my questions about when they'll get their part done and had been straight up ignoring my messages, even though I consider him one of my closest friends. This is stressing me the fuck out as well; depending on other people fucking sucks. 



On top of that, i had a traumatic experience 2 years ago that has haunted me ever since and have been going to therapy for it, but therapy has been really killing my wallet. My mental health issues are taking a long time to resolve. I haven't even broken even yet in terms of paychecks since I started my job because of how many payments I've had to make in the last 2 months like car insurance, health insurance, etc. I know how essential therapy is for me right now but fuck, why is it all so expensive? 



My family has also been stressing me out beyond belief. My mother, the most emotionally immature and judgmental person I know, has been going into my room and washing my clothes. I know how insane it sounds to be mad over something like that, but I've told her repeatedly to just not touch things in my room. I just don't like it. However, she frequently disrespects and disregards my opinion, thinking that my perspective is silly and that I shouldn't be so gross about my dirty clothes. They've only been in the laundry basket for one week. I'm constantly disrespected as an individual at home because my mother still thinks I'm a child that can't fend for themselves, when in reality it's me that has to take the higher ground every single time because of her extreme pettiness. Why do I have to be the adult in so many of my social relationships?



Lastly, I went to the doctor because I had a rash on my you know what down there, and it turns out it might be herpes. I've only slept with somebody once in the last 3 years. I had a single one night stand and it was one of the most awkward experiences of my life, AND I get fucking herpes from it??? What the fuck, world? I feel so fucking dirty and impure and feel like this could have been so avoidable. 9 times out of 10 I prefer a close, monogamous relationship. But the only time I experiment, I get punished. What the fuck.



Literally, can someone tell me why the fuck all of this is happening to me? I try so fucking hard to be a good person, and people tell me I am during the times I don't believe it myself. I almost always do the responsible thing, am selfless beyond normal levels, and do my best to spread encouragement and positivity. But so many fucking things have been crashing down in front of me lately and it's just been so awful. So, so awful.



Anyway, that's the end of my rant. I'm stressed as fuck from all this bullshit and I just needed to get it out of me. Hope everyone's having a good night.



TLDR almost everything in my life is stressing me out and the world just feels like it's kicking me while I'm down. Some words of encouragement would really help me.",28Oct2018,1

42,"So I’m not usually the type of guy who approaches girls when I’m out cause I get way too nervous and have no idea what the fuck to say. I just find the whole idea awkward as hell. Recently though I’ve tried to push myself a bit, and last night I was fairly drunk and was out for Halloween, and I was out with a friend who told me he was committed to trying to wingman me, so I kinda thought fuck it, why not try at least. So we went out and he basically done his utmost to get me talking to a couple of different girls through the night, but I could tell none of them actually wanted to talk to me and more wanted to talk to him and it just felt awkward and weird so I kinda stopped trying.

I just stood there feeling sorry for myself, watching my friends having fun talking to different girls, while I stood alone and tried to down a drink when some girl came and stood next to me and asked me what the hell my costume was cause she’d spent about 10 minutes trying to figure it out. We got talking for like 15 minutes after that and we were just sitting laughing at random shit, it wasn’t awkward at all and I was fully aware that she was insanely hot. One of her friends even asked if we know each other cause I think it genuinely looked like we were good friends who had known each other for a long time. I was literally about to offer to get her a drink when Dancing Queen came on and one of her friends ran up to her screaming for her to come dance. The girl kinda looked at me a little sadly and was like ‘I’m so sorry but my friend really loves this song, I’ll try come back though!’ I told her it’s cool and there’s a drink in it for her if she comes back. I waited for her to come back but she never did, and one of my friends told me I should go find her but honestly I felt like that would have been a little creepy. I mean it was obvious we both wanted to talk to each other but I felt like that might be pushing it, I dunno.

Either way I spent the rest of my night kicking myself for not doing something more about it and even now the next day I feel like I really should have. It’s rare that any girl approaches me like that and while it’s a big confidence boost and shit, it feels even worse knowing there was a hot girl who was cool as fuck that was probably interested and I missed my chance. I thought about how it’s possible she wasn’t even interested and her friend might have dragged her off to get her away from me but I really don’t think that’s true. You can just kinda tell when there’s a bit of a spark there, she was laughing at literally everything I was saying and I just think neither of us wanted to stop talking to each other at all.

I suppose that’s how it goes sometimes, and it’s stupid to think too much about a girl who I talked to for like 20 minutes at the most, but fuck if I don’t regret not making a move. I don’t think a girl has ever just blatantly approached me like that, and definitely never someone as hot as her. I wish I’d even have thought to get her name or something, but I was so caught up in being excited about talking to her that it completely slipped my mind. I’ll be kicking myself for that one for a little bit for sure.

44,"I had a group presentation yesterday and because of my fuck up, my group was given a lower mark than the rest of my class.

Two people from my group were supposed to present our answers for the 2 questions. And it had to be under 7 mins. I took 6 mins to answer 1 question, leaving my other group mate 1 minute left to answer the other question. So 7 mins up and she didn't manage to finish explaining hers.

The group presentation is only 10% of our final grade for the semester. We got a 6.5/10 while others a 7 - 8.5 but still..

I've never made a huge fuck up like this. It's eating me out and I feel like utter shit. My group mates told me that it's ok but I still feel really bad.

I didn't want to post this anywhere else in case the connection was bunkum or whatever, but I'm genuinely curious if anyone has more info on this. I figure I might hit someone in this generalized sub who might have some ideas:

So Folic Acid is a synthetic form of the B vitamin Folate. In the 90s, based on studies at the time, Folic Acid showed promise in preventing birth defects. So the USPHS and the CDC recommended all pregnant women consume folic acid.

Since then, a genetic mutation called MTHFR has been found in over a quarter of the US population that causes them to metabolize folic acid differently and affects homocystine levels. Homocystine level fluctuation has been shown to affect the severity of autism spectrum disorders in children.

Does this connection seem plausible? There's so many things online like this, that are vague, I just want more info before I ask in a medical sub. Is there another sub that may be better? Like I said it could be bunk, but it could be true. I don't know.

CONFIDENTIAL

The preservation of personal dignity as a wellspring of Muslim behavior.

""FACE"" AMONG THE ARABS

Peter A. Naffsinger

George Washington, American children are told, having cut down his father's favorite cherry tree, showed his sterling character by confessing to the deed. An Arab hearing this story not only fails to see the moral beauty of such behavior but wonders why anyone would ever compromise his integrity by admitting thus his guilt. As to Washington's explanation that ""I cannot tell a lie,"" the Arab asks how a man could rise to the presidency if he were not suave enough to use a well-concocted falsehood as a tactic in emergency behavior.

The values and rationale underlying these reactions are an aspect of ""national character,"" a factor said to be of importance in estimating likely courses of national action and certainly of importance in dealing man to man with individuals. A syndrome of the Arab values can be called the face concept, an understanding of which is essential for a case officer in his interpersonal relationships with peoples stretching across North Africa and from Greece to Japan. Although we are concerned here specifically with Arabs, the same concept is applicable in a broad way to most Muslim groups and to some Far Eastern peoples.

An understanding of the concept will help define an area of potential difficulty in personal relations and give insight into stated and unstated Eastern attitudes. It will explain the extreme difficulty of resurrecting once-fallen political figures and getting them any public acceptance. It will show motivating forces which may be operationally useful, for example in contriving a character defamation.

The high value which the cultural patterns of the East place upon the concept of personal dignity is central to that behavior from which the frustrated American encountering it for the first time is likely to conclude that an Arab is a living non-sequitur or else deliberately perverse. Although there are many demographic and cultural subgroupings of the Eastern peoples-even the Arab may be an agricultural peasant, a nomad of the desert, a seafarer of the Persian Gulf, a sophisticated urbanite, a university student-the ideal of maintaining face has a universality among them, so that a general analysis of the concept will be pertinent, with minor variations, to all. Yet it should be borne in mind that, since cultural groups consist of individual men, there will be individual deviations from the generalizations drawn in the following discussion.

Dignity vs. Objectivity
A society expects from all its members an adherence to its own norms and values. According to the degree to which they do so adhere, people are judged acceptable or not acceptable in that society. For the American, earning social acceptability by maintaining his honor is a matter of equating honor with personal integrity. The American manifests his integrity by an uncompromising willingness to face objective truth and fact. Personal respect and acclaim go to him who makes a ruthless search for facts regardless of how self-damaging the results may be.

The American can apologize for revealed shortcomings and gain respect and prestige with an honest effort to correct his own errors. In our culturally determined scale of values the achieving of impersonal objectivity with regard to facts and truth is thus more important than preserving a man's personal dignity before the world at large. At all times and in all circumstances the American is culturally obliged to reconcile his position and his person with truthfully interpreted reality: witness the fact that the verb ""to rationalize"" usually has for us an ethically negative flavor.

The Arab in his society is likewise expected to show personal integrity in order to be socially acceptable. He, however, manifests his honor and integrity by making a public, outward impression of dignity derived from an ostensible lack of guilt. Even if facts and conditions speak to the contrary, the social veneer of non-guilt must be maintained evident and dominant if he is to achieve the socially demanded face. Dignity and stature are granted only to those who show themselves as flawless; the society of the Arab world has no place or respect for one whose faults or errors come to public knowledge. Blame, fault, or error accruing to an Arab personally brings his immediate fall from social grace and a loss of dignity or face. He therefore feels revulsion and bitterness for anything that tends to compromise him in this way.

Americans and most other Western-bred persons regard it as merely socially inconsiderate or impolite to mention another's errors in public. Management courses teach psychologically graceful ways to correct erring employees without hurting their feelings, suggesting for example ""Maybe it would be better if we did this another way"" instead of a blunt and ego-damaging ""You are doing this all wrong."" The Arab would be quick to grasp the wide divergence between the two approaches. But what in American life is a matter of tact and consideration is to him a highly charged social confrontation with many complexities and subtle ramifications of which the American would never have dreamed.

If, as becomes evident after some exposure to Arab behavior, a lack of guilt is what confers on an Arab the dignity or face by which his personal integrity and social acceptability are measures, there must be further consequences flowing from such a displacement of criteria in the social value system as this seems from the viewpoint of Western culture. If lack of guilt gives social dignity, the Arab must maintain his guiltless appearance at all costs. Facts and circumstances can combine in many different ways to reflect unfavorably upon any man, but the Arab cannot afford to allow accrued facts or logic to impute any flaw or guilt to him personally. In self-defense he must interpret the assembled facts subjectively, deny them outright, or reject as illogical any construction that leads to intimations of personal shortcomings. To the American this defense is non-objective, a distortion of truth, and therefore paradoxically destructive of integrity, unless he can take the Arab point of view and recognize personal face as having a higher value than fact or logic in the society.

There are, it is true, many situations in American and Western society in which this kind of defensive thinking tends to arise; but Westerners are expected to be able to recognize and admit the logical flaws when they are pointed out to them. Severe cases of inability to achieve objectivity are interpreted in American society as manifesting pathological symptoms of neurosis or psychopathic personality. Not so in the Near East. In the dynamics of the Arab social system dignity or face is not compromised for the sake of the lesser values found in fact and logic.

In an oil company installation near the Persian Gulf, an American linguist in the training department, after drafting some exercises to be used in instructing American employees in spoken Arabic, gave them to three bilingual Saudi Arabs working for him to check for syntactic and orthographic correctness before publication. The drafts were all tacitly okayed, returned without change; but after they had been published several glaring errors in the work were discovered. Distressed, the linguist questioned the three Arabs, who reluctantly explained that the inaccuracies had of course been obvious to them but they did not feel it would be right to point them out and thereby cause embarrassment to their boss and good friend!

Here the incompatible American and Arab attitudes reflected well the different dominant criteria of each. The American was interested solely in the objective accuracy of the work, a matter which was of secondary importance to the Arabs. They believed in good faith that they had acted with honor as gentlemen in protecting the linguist's dignity above all other considerations.

If an American family in the Near East uses domestic help from the local populace, it may often happen that a vase, say, is accidentally knocked over and broken during the cleaning of a room. When the housewife comes upon the pieces, perhaps picked up and disposed of, her only minimally tactful ""How did you break the vase?"" will be met with a startled look of surprise, a sheepish grin, and then, after a few hesitating moments of agonized embarrassment, likely the reply, ""Oh I didn't; I would never break anything of yours!""

The housewife's account of the incident to her husband will probably center on the outrage to her Western ethic-- "". . . and after I saw the pieces he had the nerve to stand right there and deny it to my face."" But the servant, though he truly regrets the accident and would not have done anything of the sort on purpose, has by his own lights reacted naturally and properly in repelling the immediate challenge to his dignity. A subtler approach by the housewife, merely taking notice of the debris in the presence of the servant, would probably have elicited from him a discreet explanation of how "". . . the vase fell while I was dusting the furniture"" and thus graciously permitted him to save face.

In matters that may involve him in guilt or blame the Arab's untruths, half-truths, avoidance of reply, or other ploys that jar Westerners do not spring from any perverse desire to deceive; they are facets of the need to maintain that personal dignity and face which in his system of values take precedence.

Public Image vs. Personal Conscience
As the American is taught to respect objectivity and facts, he is also encouraged to reconcile his personal position with the relevant facts in any given situation. From his earliest years he is impressed, by story and example, with the nobility his culture attaches to the act of admitting his guilt or personal failings which have contributed to some acknowledged larger wrong. He is imbued with the conception that it is manly to own up to his guilt straightforwardly, even at the price of self-injury or extreme embarrassment.

So firmly is this idea imposed that every American, except the psychopathic personality, can have intense feelings of personal guilt and may even lie awake nights worrying about wrongs, real or fancied, that he has done to cause hurt to others. He can relieve these guilt feelings by making an apology to the injured party or otherwise rectifying the wrong. The embarrassment entailed in admitting error is of less consequence than the need to alleviate the pangs of guilt.

Christianity emphasizes the personal God within each man, who enforces an ideal of perfection in behaviour and in thought. The sacrifice of the ""only begotten Son"" dramatizes this personal God interested in each individual soul. The Christian is supposed, by prayer or confession, to ask pardon for every instance of failure to reach perfection, and it is not difficult to see how this concept could instill a sense of personal guilt and obligation beyond self. The development of conscience or capacity for feeling guilt in religious life naturally spills over into non-religious contexts in cultures where Christianity is dominant and so is evident in other acts of life.

Offering sharply contrasting principles to these, Islam--religion, social force, and almost complete way of life of the ab Near East-naturally shapes much of the Arabs' cultural attitude. Even the Christian Arabs are immersed in a background of Muslim culture. By definition and profession, Islam is the ""surrendering of the self to the will of Allah,"" and it portrays a God remote, all-pervading, and wholly out of contact with the individual man. In prayers, to be sure, Muslims implore God to do well by them and lead them on the right path. But all of Muslim theology conveys the feeling that God is so all-pervading and at the same time so far above and removed from the individual that all human actions and their consequences are but the sequels of God's doings: the individual is merely an animate pawn. This supremely impersonal God, above and beyond rather than within a person, impresses on the individual no requirement to accept guilt or personal responsibility for anything or to develop a conscience differentiating between intrinsic right and wrong.

Thus when a Westerner tries to show an Arab that he is to blame for something, he never really succeeds in getting the point across. Western personnel at oil installations in Iraq, Syria, and the Persian Gulf area are frustrated in trying to correct mistakes of Arab trainees on industrial equipment. When confronted with having made a wrong move that could have had the most serious of safety or technological consequences, the Arab is unwilling and unable to accept the idea that he should feel either sorry or responsible for his mistake. He dismisses both blame and censure with a casual ""min allah"" -- ""It is from God."" To the remonstrance that it had better not happen again he answers ""inshallah,"" ""If God wills it,"" with exasperating nonchalance. In agent work, where supervision cannot be so close, this indifference to personal responsibility and tendency to atomistic thinking will necessarily be even more troublesome.

To the Arab, all is from Allah, and if Allah does all, the individual cannot be held responsible. Man is required to follow the teachings of the Koran and the Hadith and to perform his religious obligations, but he is not answerable to an inner God, a conscience. Instead of a sense of personal responsibility for his acts, the Arab has a deeply inculcated fear of outside forces; he realizes he must answer for his actions to society. This social sensitivity, together with his all-is-from-Allah fatalism, may in some measure explain why the Arab world knows scarcely any suicides, that common aberration of Christian living in the West. At any rate it explains why he is more interested in the face he presents to society than in exposing the facts of a situation.

The Surrogate
The Arab's need to project his self in a form completely acceptable to the harsh judgments of society renders his face, his dignity mask, a type of surrogate as thought of in the philosophy of Jung, one in which he wraps the very essence of his being. This is another form of that transference of self in complete allegiance which is an easily accomplished maneuver in the Arab world and the entire Near East. In politics the surrogate takes the form of a popular personality who has become the leader. The political surrogate with which the people identify themselves and their very souls must almost undergo deification to be worthy of their complete faith, allegiance, and devotion, and he must necessarily remain free of any conceivable flaw, unblemished in their eyes. At the first sign of failure, faltering, or political error, he immediately loses all allegiance-transferred to some new strong political personality moving in-and suffers his demise without anyone wondering why he was once in such high acclaim. There is a pointed moral here for anyone trying to influence political developments in Muslim countries: once a charismatic leader had been overthrown, it would be most difficult to arouse support or popular following to place him in power again. Promoters of a countercoup would be hawking tainted goods.

A similar surrogate within the individual is the outside mask or face to which the self or ego is transferred by the Arab, along with all his pride and self-esteem. This face presented to society at large then assumes more importance than his real self. The finding of defects or faults in it constitutes an attack on his very being, for there is no alternative surrogate to which the ego can be transferred. Hence the Arab whose integrity or face is challenged and in danger of being found imperfect is in quite a delicate position. He has to go to extremes to keep his social mask intact, thus taking actions completely contrary to the Western ethic and bewildering to the Westerner.

The constant effort to keep up face seems almost paranoiac by Western standards. Entertaining delusions of grandeur, claiming to be persecuted, magnifying faults in others that one wants to hide in oneself, calling constantly for redemption and resurgence of past greatness-all this is behavior typical of paranoia, but it is manifested in every Arabic political newspaper and among individuals in day-to-day social intercourse. It cannot be considered abnormal in the Arab cultural setting. Given the importance of face to the Arab, such behavior must be recognized as a socially practical and accepted method of warding off or refuting any outside attack on his integrity. The Westerner who, recognizing in the Arab the personality traits which in Western culture signify paranoia or inferiority complex, is pleased with himself for being able to ""see through the Arab's attempts at deceit and trickery and his lies"" shows his lack of appreciation of the face concept in the Arab culture. It is the Westerner who has learned always to allow the Arab a graceful way to save himself from implications of guilt when difficulties arise who will make him a friend and avoid many frustrations and impasses in the relationship.

There is a proverb in Chinese which can be roughly translated, ""Point at the chicken to scold the dog."" On its face incomprehensible to the Westerner, it means that if the dog has done something wrong you should berate the chicken in his presence in order to get at the wrong-doer without causing undue embarrassment. The chicken is not embarrassed because everyone knows it was not he who did it, and the dog does not lose face through public shame or direct censure.

This principle was illustrated by an episode which occurred in Teheran but could as easily have come from the Arab world. A small radio had been stolen from-the house of an American employing two Iranian servants, A and B. A was clearly the culprit, but direct accusation would have brought a quick denial and reduced the chances for recovery of the radio. Servant B was consulted; he advised the American housewife to chastize him severely in front of A. She did, and the radio was recovered with a minimum of interpersonal difficulty.

An incident cited by an American sociologist 1 illustrates another kind of situation. An Arab who caught another man in bed with his wife leveled a gun at them, but instead of shooting he offered to let the man off if he would keep the affair secret. The man promised and was let go. Later the Arab divorced his wife quietly, and the incident was considered closed. The double murder that might have been the outcome in Western cultures would have made newspaper headlines, a result diametrically opposed to the Arab's priority considerations. His pledging the wife and cuckolder to secrecy on pain of death guaranteed that no outsiders would learn of the matter and thus saved him an embarrassing loss of face. The quiet divorce rid him of his problem. The emotional distress which other husbands might have felt was for the Arab a problem of secondary importance; he could tell himself that Allah determines all and therefore not to trouble himself with the sequels of any acts. This story illustrates well the principle that the Arab is the reverse of the Westerner in that he feels very strongly the force of public shame in loss of face but is able to slough off the feelings of personal inadequacy which would be acute in a Westerner.

Subjective Fact
In Western cultures a fact is an objective absolute not subject to mutation through human interpretation. But the Arab mentality treats fact and truth as relative, to some extent a projection of the mind for the benefit of the self or ego. With this subjective processing the facts become what the Arab emotionally wants to believe is true. They can thus be made to mesh harmoniously with criteria which stand higher on the value scale because connected with the maintenance of face. Neither facts nor their connotations can stand up against the Arab's facade of personal dignity or be arrayed to form an attack on his surrogate of face.

Many concepts of the philosophy of the ancient Greeks have been discussed, adapted, and adopted by major Arab thinkers, but there is little sign in present-day Arab culture that Greek analytical self-critical philosophy ever entered the Near East. The motto ""Know thyself"" is not quoted by the Arabs; if it were, it would have to have an entirely new meaning. Knowing oneself, to include defining and acknowledging one's weaknesses, would destroy the principle that the surrogate of face or personal dignity must be defended at all costs and ostensible perfection maintained. The concept of self-examination, whether for purposes of self-management or self-improvement, could not be accepted because of its conflict with more honored cultural requirement of blameless dignity. The Arab is likewise quite unacquainted with the idea of examining his conduct to find the sources of his mistakes or misfortunes. If he did engage in such introspection he would be forced to intensify the subjectivity of his factual interpretations in order to avoid findings which might be detrimental to his face. In short, the Arab will not find anything wrong with himself.

Many say that the Arab has no capacity for self-analysis; but this is a rather shallow observation. If he lacked analytical ability, no Bedouin would ever have survived the desert drought problems. It is when analysis impinges upon the prime value of personal dignity that the use of subjective interpretations in order to preclude embarrassing conclusions begins to give outside observers doubts about the Arab's ability to reconcile himself with reality.

During the Israeli invasion of Sinai in October 1956, the Saudi Arabs in the oil fields along the Persian Gulf felt personal concern about the plight of their Egyptian brothers. In one instance some of those at a particular plant were much worried about a news item to the effect that in three days of fighting Israeli troops had captured five thousand Egyptians. They held a powwow, buzzing and chattering about it among themselves. After some time, however, the group broke up and all went away looking relieved and happy. Asked how they had resolved their anxiety, one of the more articulate explained that they had decided Israeli troops could never have captured 5,000 of anything, even sheep, in the Sinai region. Therefore the story was not true, and that ended the matter. All was right with the world again.

A former German army doctor who specialized in psychiatry and the diagnosis of mental disturbances was resident in Damascus during 1953 and 1954. During this time he was denied permission to practice in Syria, with the explanation that although medical doctors were always welcome, there was nothing wrong with Arabs mentally and hence no need for his services.

Knowledgeable Arabs realize that their people and countries fall in some measure short of the progress and development that some other nations have achieved. Unable to find themselves at fault for this, they are naturally led to seek the cause of their troubles in outside sources-the will of Allah, the imperialists, Israel, family and personal obligations, and many real wrongs which have been done them. This saves the collective face from appearing defective and allows those who can accept subjectively interpreted facts to maintain their sense of personal dignity and self-confidence.

The lack of objective self-analysis in the Near East generally permits a type of boasting which is honest in that there is no real discrepancy between an Arab's outward show of, say, fantastic courage and his true feelings. In the absence of analysis he does not realize that he has weaknesses and could not perform accordingly. Unending talk of courageous endeavor and boasting his own virtues in order to give himself faith in his surrogate of face may make the Arab seem insincere to the Westerner; but if the latter challenges his boasts the two are brought to an impasse. The Arab could not be made to recognize his own weakness, and even if he could he would not admit the threat to his dignity.

Some of the secondary schools of the Middle Eastern countries schedule athletic contests with one another, and after each game members of the losing team will get together and discuss the event. Not infrequently they conclude that ""the referee was against us"" instead of acknowledging their own faulty plays or the other team's superiority.

In any situation in which shame or guilt threatens the Arab he will be able to explain away whatever impinges on his personal dignity with an array of facts that are meant to be accepted by the listener and not challenged. Whether the story is believed or not and whether the facts are objective or logical are secondary considerations; it is considered quite unmannerly to embarrass him by challenging his explanations. Many of the stories of Juha and his donkey which abound in Arabic folklore have their point for the Arab not in the happenings, logical or illogical, they portray but rather in the quick wit and inventive genius with which the hero survives each incident.

In many phases of the Arabic cultural setting the Westerner with his fetish for objectivity is decidedly out of place, for a subjective interpretation of facts and truth is most suitable in a milieu where face and personal dignity are the things of prime importance.

In summation, the face concept can be said to have three interrelated aspects. The Arab's extreme effort to show himself blameless, an effort which seems too transparent and unrealistic to Westerners, is the product of the high value his culture puts upon personal dignity, of his feeling answerable for his conduct to society rather than to any divine conscience within himself, and of his sense of the subjectivity of fact.
