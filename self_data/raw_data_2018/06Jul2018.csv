0,"I'm a guy and sometimes I've met other male friends who are super charming, friendly, willing to hang out all the time etc. I get to be close with them and build a good friendship, then I realize that they are just super obsessed with finding a romantic relationship and lonely. When they find someone all of a sudden they stop being such good friends. 

This has happened a few times and it's a common theme. I believe this has happened again recently. 

They aren't actually interested in building good relationships with people they just want to not be lonely/feel that rush.

2,"I've never considered myself a recluse but it seems to be fitting me pretty well. I started drifting away from all but a few very close friends about a year ago and a month ago I moved several hundred miles away from my nearest friend or family member for my first job. No roommates either. Haven't met anyone outside of my coworkers and I don't see them outside of work but I feel just fine so far. 

For a lot of college I threw myself headfirst into the center of as many groups as I could, just wanting to belong. Of course I always felt like a desperate fraud because I based my self-worth on the approval of those other people. Now I've sort of rubberbanded to to other end of the spectrum and it's much calmer here. I feel like the time I spent slowly disengaging from people helped me feel more comfortable being alone. Which now that it's much harder to find people to be with is very very handy. I just need to be sure I don't forget how to make friends.",06Jul2018,3

5,"I will try to make this as short as i can.

I'm from a very poor European country, not starving or anything like that, but here eating at mac is considered high class and H&amp;M are for rich kids, especially when you consider the wage in this country. When i was 2 years old i was diagnosed with asthma. That meant hell for us, because here you have to pay if you don't want to die. We could afford my treatment and the ""tips"" for the doctors because my dad always worked in other countries with better wages. That meant that dad would come only on holidays. When he would be home on holidays, almost all the time he'd be drunk. And that wasn't that bad but when he was drunk he was very violent, both verbally and phisically with my mother.  


Because i had asthma my mother never allowed me to get out of the house because i would get sick, that resulted in me not having a lot of friends and also got me a fat, like very fat, i was obese, my mother thought that it's the best to eat a lot to fight the sickness. The fact that i was fat made me be an very easy target to bullies. When i was like 7 or 8 i got bullied a lot from bigger kids. At the age of 9 the asthma kind of disappeared. And i could get my weight a little bit more to a normal range, but i was still fat  


When i got to 13 i transferred schools because of a teacher that my mother didn't like because she gave a low math grade (deserved). There the bullying got worse. I got beat up everyday, aside from the insults. That made me want to kill myself. I think there i got depressed (never diagnosed). I was imagining hanging myself very often. I started hating hard on people. My mother really added to this by telling me to hang myself on the tree in the backyard and telling me that she should have let me die as a little child and reminding me the large sums of money they paid for me. This was her usual way of dealing with me not behaving or going to the store to buy her cigs (it got to the point where people were telling her that her child started smoking).  


More on my family, my sister got abused about her weight by my mother and she was just a very quiet kid. She grew up to having little to no empathy and being generally  a very cold hearted individual. I was reminded everyday by my mother  that i won't ever be as smart as my sister. So i started to try in school, just to get high enough grades to not hear my parents telling me i'm worthless.  


My father didn't have a big role in my childhood, because he wasn't home more than a month a year and in that time he was drunk most of the time. When i was 11 he kicked me out of the house (on vacation in a foreign country) and wanted to smash my head with a hammer, but my mom stopped him. This happened because mom hid one of his wine bottles.  


Forward to 15, now i had to concentrate on an exam that got me the grade that will choose what highschool i could go to.

 That year was the best year in my life in terms of productivity, i learned english and photoshop, and i got preety good grades, despite a little accident i had ( i thought  that the exam is 3 hours instead of 2 ). I got to the same ""prestigious"" highschool my sister attended for which i had to move to a bigger city and live in a dorm. That summer vacation i lost like 45 pounds. Everything was good.  


From there it only got worse. I managed to get back even fatter. I had huge anxiety outside which resulted in me not going outside for anything other that buying food. My grades were worst that ever, although the first couple months were ok.  


And you know what? In the summer vacation i started losing weight again and worked a bit on myself. I was ready to start fresh.  


Wrong, fat again, almost had to repeat the year, due to failling classes.  


When i started highschool, my mom moved with dad in another country. My dad would always ask me, when he was drunk, what i want to do in the future in order to blame me because i don't know what to do with my life. He also calls me a lot of names. He likes to tell me that i'm a mistake and he believes deep inside that i'm stupid and won't achieve anything. My sister and mother believe that he envies me, because i am quite funny and even charismatic sometimes. I don't know what to add here.  


Back to present,i am 17, i am fat, i hate my life, i'm with a girlfriend i don't really like, have some old friends that i hangout with but always feel alone, don't know why. I got a voice message from my dad like 4 days ago, telling me that i was the result of masturbation and to suck his dick. My mom came home this summer and told me that my dad almost beat her to death. I don't even know what to tell my self. If it doesn't get better i won't see the next year.

8,"I (23M) come from a middle class white family, am the first of three boys. I still live with my parents, despite going to college for 3 years, and dropping out with nothing to show for it, ive been working since then, and after moving to the Home Depot, I’ve starting losing what little I had saved up paying my student/car loans. I’m supposed to go back to school for mathematics this fall, but it might be too late. I do enjoy math for the most part, and I’m also drumming as a hobby. I have a girlfriend (25), and she has two beautiful daughters (3 and 5). But it’s hard to see her at all because our schedules are so off, and it’s taking its toll on us. The best option for her/us is to move into our own place, but If we did, we would lose the babysitter (grandma), and money would be even tighter than it already is. I’ve never felt less prepared for this part of my life, and i feel lost. Side note, this girl is perfect for me, and I will marry her and spend the rest of my life either her and her kids.

9,"I've been considering asking my coworker out for quite a while.
They were hired about a month after I was and since I met them I've had a bit of a crush.

I didn't tell anybody, but eventually people around me started suggesting that I ask them out.
From my cousin and commenting on them, to other coworkers telling me I should just do it.

I was having a good day and was enjoying the sun, so when I saw that they'd gone on their lunch break, I saw it as my opportunity and decided to take it.

I'd been struggling with coming up with the courage to do so now for a while.
I'm a very anxious person with very little confidence in myself and have a slight fear of rejection, so asking them was became a bit awkward rather quickly.
When I started to pose the question, I started stammering until they said ""come on, out with it"".

She said yes to dinner and a movie.

12,"Heavy heavy mention of sexual assault!

I have pretty much turned this account into an account for venting. I do not have anyone to talk to, so this is a perfect platform to talk and vent.

I'm a 17 year old girl. I have always had trouble getting along with people for whatever reason. I didn't have many girlfriends.

When I was 15 almost 16 I was pressured into my first blowjob. I didn't feel much sadness, just confusion.

August 19, 2017 I was raped. I was sober, wearing fuzzy pj pants sleeping over at a friends.

I didn't tell anyone about this until I told one of my only friends, I'll call him C.

C supported me, and I was so happy to have an actual friend. He would talk to me about his problems, and I would invite him to hang out with me sometimes. One day, we were at an abandoned building we would all hang out at my freshman and sophomore year. He tried to hook up with me, and I said no. I was terrified of sex. He didn't understand that, and got angry. I explained that it was not him, and that I can't have sex with anyone. He said ""what's wrong with me"", brought up something I did in the past (which did not effect him at all) and said he doesn't want to be friends with a ""bad person"" It hurt so fucking badly. I was an object. I was worth nothing. I had no friends.

Then in December 2017, I was at a party. I was not too drunk, but still did not want to go home and get in trouble with my parents. My friend H was there. I asked if he knew of anywhere I could spend the night. He said yes, and me and my best friend at the time went over to his house after the party. We were all 3 in bed, but I was targeted. He shoved his hand down my pants and wouldn't take them out even though I pushed and pulled his hands out. I was so embarrassed. I said No. My friend had passed out but I eventually shook her and she knew we had to leave.

That same night I had to go to another persons house until the morning, because my friend had to go home, and I didn;t have a car. I went to S's house. I was doing so bad. I confined in him, he was my friend, or so I thought. After crying for at least an hour I finally passed out. I woke up to him fingering me and having his hand in my bra. I was devastated. My feelings did not matter for anything. I was a sex toy. Nothing else. I was unlovable.

December 22, 2017. My birthday. I had no one to celebrate with. I texted a boy who had been interested in me for a long time.

turns out that boy I would be in an emotionally abusive relationship with until about a week ago.

He would do things like tell me to shut up, call me stupid, get angry for not giving him sex, etc. etc. the list goes on and on. The worst thing is he would call me weak. He made me feel awful about myself. I was an ugly ugly unlovable monster. but I believed, still, that he cared about me because not many people do.

For background of this story, now whenever anyone makes a sexual move on me I freeze up and begin to dissociate. I allow sexual acts to happen even though they hurt me so fucking bad. I just cannot stop it, I believe it's the only thing that I am worth, that will make me able to interact with people.

I went over to him, after we had already been broken up, I needed someone to talk to. He knew my situation and I had just had a bad sexual experience with someone where I did dissociate badly. He knows my situation. Every bit of it. He listened and began to push for sex. I was freaking out. I did not talk but I let him. before the sex (foreplay, I guess?) I sat up and said I feel nothing, I don't feel good. He got frustrated and I said ok. Just get it over with. I started crying halfway through and when he finished I just broke down and lost it. I was kicked out and he got mad at me for making him feel like a rapist.

He is no longer in my life. I miss him, though. I am so fucking lonely. I am never going back to him, I am stronger than that. But right now the only option for me is leaving this earth. I cannot, I cannot do that to my parents. I will tell them this story soon but it will break them into pieces.

Please just help me. I just needed to say my story. Thank you for listening.",06Jul2018,1

14,"This summer I’ve been taking summer classes in college. One of the first classes I took was a guidance class. I didn’t take the class seriously I just kinda took it just to take on classes during the summer.  

During this class we discussed personality types including extroverts and introverts. I learned that extroverts usually get their energy from being around other people while Introverts “refuel” by being alone. 

When I was very young something pretty traumatic happened to me and I changed into the total opposite of what I was. Previously I was the class clown who just kept talking and talking until I was sent to the office lmao anyways, I turned into the angel of every class. I genuinely thought I “enjoyed” being alone. 

Last week of high school I felt something changing. My depression wasn’t t nearly as bad as it had been but I was pretty much in shock, I didn’t know what was going on so everything remained the same for a while. 

Fast forward to today.. I was feeling so tired all day long. I woke up at 5 went to school, worked out and again school. At 5pm I was already dead but I went to the gym again (long story) and I was hanging out with this guy.. well.. all while I was interacting with this guy it’s like I went from being so exhausted to having so much excess energy and I didn’t get it at all... I lifted maybe 3-4x what I usually do.. i didn’t even know I was capable of doing that. For hours after this I was so fucking hyper lmfao. Someone even asked if I was high 😐

I was so confused in the guidance class because we took this personality test based on actual research and it said I was an extrovert. I passed it off as it being crazy but.. 

I’m not sure what to think right now",06Jul2018,1

16,"I'm finding a few patterns in my life as I get older. First, I never seem to be good at making new friends. New acquaintances? Awesome. First impressions? I kill it every time. I'm really approachable, confident, and comfortable in social situations. Everyone seemed to generally like me in college, and I knew a lot of different people from  different activities. It's like I was on the fringe of a lot of different social groups, but none of them ever considered me a part of the group enough to invite me to events or text me. I was almost never invited out by the people I knew, and I spent a lot of time alone. Post college, the few close, solid friends I had (like, 3 people) have all stopped talking to me. We only keep in touch if I initiate it. 

Which brings me to the second pattern I'm noticing: I always seem to care about and love people more than they care about/love me. I go out of my way to make sure the people I care about know how important they are to me, and I do my best to prioritize them and show my interest in their lives. But it feels like what I get back is sporadic lukewarm appreciation at best. Even that is fading away and now that the only people in my circle is my family and partner.

I don't know what to do about this, but it's made me feel really helpless, hopeless, and lonely, especially now that I'm out of college, living across the country, and I don't have a community of people my age around me anymore. Whenever I reach out to a college friend and get no response, it sends me to a dark place and I ask myself: what's wrong with me? Why don't people like me? Why am I so unlovable? I don't know how to feel better about this. ",06Jul2018,15

I'm a horny dude and GDP was one of my go to for a while. It's a big professional porn company where they get girls that have never done porn before and do formulaic and boring videos. But I've uncovered some shit that's scary and I don't know what to believe. So guys you got to help me.

So it started when I found a thread from 2 years ago about a girl named Van Helen who went on GDP and had a terrible experience. She found a modeling ad on craigslist and was flown out to San Diego to do shots. But when she got there, they told her it was adult films. They coerced her into doing porn and intimidated her and didn't let her leave the bedroom.

There were AMAs about it, the girlsdoporn subreddit was enraged, there were articles about more woman having similar experiences, and the fact that the girls look uncomfortable and in pain during the porn videos.

So I thought this all pointed toward GDP being a terrible company that should be brought down, until...

There were some redditors that said that this is all a publicity stunt by GDP. And there was evidence to go along with it. The AMAs by the GDP girls were oddly PRish and didn't seem to be by the girl doing it. The Van Halen post missed details and was wired oddly. Multiple short bios are oddly worded like ""cute girl doesn't want cock but is forced to take it"" And they do this all to get the message of:

These are normal girls who are being forced into sex

But then those redditors could be damage control.

Guys help, do you think Girls Do Porn are actually sleezy people who are practically raping unsuspecting girls, or is it just a stunt to have send the message of these normal girls are being fucked and they don't want it?

In any case, whatever *it* is ruins everything and I'm tired of it. In December I had a horrible breakdown. Yes, seven months ago and I still regularly think about it because I'm terrified of it happening again. All night long my brain just wouldn't stop, I couldn't sleep, I could barely breathe, I couldn't distract myself with anything, I vomited. It as awful. I haven't had an 'episode' as bad as that since then, but I suffer every single day. I'm plagued with intrusive thoughts and I just want to smash my head in sometimes. I don't want to go into a whole spiel about what intrusive thoughts are, so I'll just give the Google definition if you're not familiar: an unwelcome involuntary thought, image, or unpleasant idea that may become an obsession, is upsetting or distressing, and can feel difficult to manage or eliminate. That combined with the anxiety they produce is ruining me. I can't do anything. I can't enjoy anything. Quite literally everything I do is marred by intrusive thoughts and anxiety.

It's so random and goes in cycles. I've had intrusive thoughts to the point of obsession for just about anything you can think of. There's a list of different types and I have them all. Harm. Sexual orientation. Religious. P#dophilia. Somatic. Then there are the random ones, like that time I was solidly convinced I was pregnant despite being a virgin. When one seems to 'go away', it is immediately replaced by another one. Everything and nothing triggers it at the same time, which makes it impossible to distract myself. Some small part of me knows I'm not what my Intrusive Thought Brain wants me to believe, but in the moment I'm convinced and I hate it. I'm not strong enough yet to 'embrace' it as suggested.

I'm just so sick of it. I can't get any help because my dad doesn't believe in mental health and I'm financially reliant on him. He doesn't even know about any of this, actually. I don't want him to either.

Yesterday, I was listening to sad/heartbreak songs and the tears just kept flowing. I was in the shower sobbing, I was doing my make up while wiping my tears away, and then I was on the way to see someone when my eyes watered up. 

Other days I would be dancing to September and when I hear my favourite song I just feel really good and positive. There are songs that make me happy in general and there are songs that make me energetic and ready to head to the gym.

Without music, a lot of these emotions won't even come out. Overall, the sad music connects with me more as sometimes I think of someone or an event that happened before that links to the lyrics. 

I don't know what's the point of this post but I just want to share my appreciation to music. If anyone else are in the same position, please let me know as I'd love to know how you cope up with being emotionless and apathetic.

I think the inability to tell apart enjoyment and addiction is a common problem that I would like to solve but by the nature of the problem my own answer is invalid. Where is the line between simply enjoying something and being addicted? ",06Jul2018,2
44,I (18m) just had my first sexual experience with my gf (18f) of two months and we had a great time. But I'm really scared because I think I got a little bit of pre-ejaculate on my fingers and I don't remember wiping off my fingers before going back to fingering my girl. I've read online that pre-ejaculate can contain sperm and I did masturbate about four hours beforehand. She isn't on birth control because her tiger parents and they dont suspect a thing. What are the chances of pregnancy? Should I be as worried as I am now? What is and what should I do in the worst case scenario? Her parents are the biggest block in trying to do something and I feel like I made a monumental fuckup by trying this and giving myself so much anxiety about this.,06Jul2018,1
45,"I recently moved and I'm still waiting on the trucks with all my shit to get here. It's been about 5 days and I have 5 more to go. All I have is my phone and laptop. I work out everyday for about an hour and been cleaning up the house. When I'm done everything though I usually will go on my laptop, watch YouTube, browse reddit, or maybe facetime a few friends. But during my free time, this is getting a bit repetitive. So what are some productive things to do to distract myself when things like reddit and youtube are the same old shit or just getting boring? What do you do given these circumstances and you're completely alone?

Also just saying, I'm not complaining or bitching by any means. I can keep myself occupied if I really wanted to, but I'm just asking because I want to see what other people do. And should it be something I haven't done before, maybe I could try it.",06Jul2018,2
46,"I always had a ton of friends when I was a kid, and never had trouble meeting people throughout school. I finished grad school in April 2017 and had a good group of friends, though most of them have moved away.

I have a steady, decent-paying career, and I've had a girlfriend for 5 years. I exercise regularly and dress reasonably well, so on paper my life has looked ""good"". I've also paid off my car and all my student loans and have saved up 20k in the past several months. 

Unfortunately I moved across the country to my girlfriend's hometown for this job and I basically have no friends here. I have one friend who I knew from my undergrad who's turned into a bit of a flake, and I have one coworker who I sometimes see outside of work. I've also started playing music with people.

My girlfriend and I had an apartment downtown for a year but we're now living in her parents' basement. I feel embarrassed in this situation and ashamed since it's not like I don't have a job. She's going to grad school back across the country in September but I'll probably stay here until at least January. I feel like I haven't done a great job at my work and I want to get a good reference, so I feel like I need to stay longer. Staying until April would be ideal as I would have done 2 years, but I feel like I'll be completely miserable here once my girlfriend leaves. My girlfriend also wants to get married soon but I'm kind of hesitant right now because I feel like we have different ambitions, and she's gained about 60 pounds since we started dating and I feel like it's going to have really negative health implications (and it already is starting).

I'm partly just stressed out because I move so much. I've moved 13 times in the past 8 years for school, internships, and jobs. I'm tired of doing it and losing all my friends. The area where my girlfriend will be going to school is still 7 hours from my friends and family and very expensive, so we'd probably be moving again. 

I feel like I compromised joining a field I'm not passionate about, and it hasn't paid off at all. I'm living like a NEET with no friends, so what was it all for? My real passion is art and that's what I've been spending virtually all my free time doing, I guess in an ideal world I'd like to save enough money that I can do my art full time or only work part time and spend the rest working on my art.

Is it normal to be this lost at my age? I see lots of media about millennials picking up and moving every year like it's some great thing but I honestly envy all the people that just stayed in my hometown and own houses and have strong social circles and stuff.

47,"Not sure where to put this honestly. 
Hello there!
I don’t often post on reddit but here goes nothing, right?
I think I may have some kind of eating disorder, but I have no idea how to identify it. 
Here is a bit about me first:
- I’m a 20 year old female 
- I am an identical twin and was born very slender 

Basically, for the last seven or eight months now I’ve been having a really bad problem. I’m not sure how it evolved, but basically after having fallen sick I developed this really bad fear of throwing up. Originally it was just because I often got heart burn after taking my medication, but the fear grew. I stopped smoking cigarettes (probably for the better, hey?) and stopped drinking alcohol completely due to this irrational fear, but it’s only gotten worse. 
At one point, I was so worried about throwing up that I didn’t eat. I was worried that anything I ate might be a cause for throwing off. This resulted in me eating - no joke - a couple of chips or a slice of bread a day.  To me, the grumbling of my stomach was a good thing because it meant I had nothing to throw up. Obviously this diet caused ALOT of weight loss, and so I went from being slender to looking anorexic. No hate for anyone suffering from anorexia - it is a real problem and I can’t imagine how hard it would be for anyone going through it. But, yeah. I am certain this isn’t anorexia, but given my thin state I am constantly asked about it regardless. 
I’ll admit I’ve gotten a little better over the past few months. I’ve been eating a little more, however I only ever eat one meal a day still (dinner) because I worry that I’ll get too full otherwise. 
Please help me out here! I’d appreciate advice, feedback, the works. If you have any ideas on where else I might be able to post this that would be greatly appreciated too. 
Take care everyone xx

48,"Hello. I'm doing this all on a throwaway account. I am wondering if I should just move out to a homeless shelter or possibly board with roommates to get out of the hellish cycle that is my life. 

I live in a city in southern Ontario Canada and everyone who I live with either hits me or makes fun of me. For the last 19  years I've tried to convince them that I can be caring and likable if they give me respect but seriously if you knew the things I have been though you will realize that it is impossible for that to happen. 

I heard the homeless shelters in my city are just awful because they do not have enough beds, the beds are often dirty, and if a person is shouting at the top of their lungs while everyone there is the sleeping the workers won't do a thing to stop them. I know nobody who I can stay with for the time being.

I can never seem to find employment because I have no experience and vice versa. So I am poor, and have serious psychological problems and insomnia as a result of the abuse I have faced for the entirety of my life.  

Should I just move in with some roommates while I live off welfare for a while until I can get up on my feet or should I just go to a homeless shelter or the  streets? Please help. 

TL;DR. I live in a abusive home in Ontario, Have no work experience or money, and am an insomniac who needs therapy. How do I get out of this? Please help!",06Jul2018,1

53,"I have been cat called before, older men have tried to talk to me before, but the conversation quickly stops when  I mention my age. Today was different

I was walking coming back from the dog shelter I volunteer at every week. Ear buds in, listening to music, texting.

I hear something and turn around, the guy was telling me to come forward. I look at him in his bright red car. ""you know where Walgreens is"" he asks. I give him directions, as best as I could. I was a little distracted and scared. Of course my parents always tell me to ignore strangers, but what can I say. I love adventure and danger! 

Suddenly he cuts me off ""you know what, can you just get in my car and show me, I see you have been walking for a while, I can buy you something and drive you home after."" I laugh, shyly. I hate me nervous laugh.  ""no thank you!"" I say. I'm ashamed to say that of I hadn't just told my mom that I would be home in 3 minutes I probably would have said something else. 

""well you're cute and sexy, can I have your number"" 

Again, I declined. 

""How old are you?"" he asked as he got out of his car. I should have walked away a while ago. I saw him clearly now, a foot taller than me (I'm 5'0) probably around 28. ""I'm only 14, sorry""

I quickly realized my mistake, I was actually 15, but I didn't correct myself. It was a small fib, maybe he would stop talking to me now.

He stepped closer and looked me up and down  ""you sure don't look like it""

I'm not even sure what he was looking at. I was in a oversized t-shirt, leggings, and an oversized backpack was on me covering my butt.

I stepped back. ""sorry that I couldn't help you"" and then walked away.

He quickly got in his car, turned around and asked me again  if he could pick me up or of I smoked. This time I didn't answer.


I saw him a few more times on my way home, and he kept asking questions. I took an alternate route so that he wouldn't know the exact location of my house.

I was meant to go out tonight with friends. Someone (very kindly) even gave me a lift to the venue but I just couldn’t go in. I don’t know why. I think it’s because I feel like I don’t belong, or maybe it’s an anxiety thing? I decided to turn tail and go home, where I started crying as soon as I hit my bed for no reason. Currently, I’m in my pyjamas while my friends are enjoying themselves but I don’t think I regret my decision. I hate disappointing them but it would have been a bad night if I felt like this.

58,"So ever since I was a child I would always feel left out I would always be the one who is blamed for everything and I don't know why Eventhough Im the smart one at home and the one who does everything literally... btw Im 15 and I have 2 sisters and 3 brothers.

For starters when my younger brother got diabetes a few years back I was blamed for it turned out it was hereditary plus HOW AM I THE ONE AT FAULT?????

Also whenever my parents fight my mother keeps telling me its my fault... Same thing happens when my younger brothers fight. 

And yes she hits me ONLY Sometimes for stupid things too. 2 weeks ago I fought with my brother (he's 12) and he started hitting me I mean I did fight him back but guess what my mother entered the room and kept hitting me to the point where I wasn't even crying everything happened so fast and I guess I was just shocked I mean I really wanted to cry but I couldn't .. she hit me with her hands she pulled my hair and kept moving me around I fell to the floor and she kept kicking me I tried to run away but she kept threatening me .And there was no one home so there was no point in screaming. Oh and I forgot to mention that she hit me with my computer to the point where the screen broke same thing with my phone. I had scratches and bruises all over my body I even got my first panic attack I couldn't breathe for the next 30 minutes after she left.

She even had the nerve to call me to her room later that day and made me apologize ( apologize because her blood pressure was high because of me) Whenever I enter her room \`I just remember what happened and my mood flips.

Almost a year ago My parents were having problems and I would go EVERY SINGLE DAY to her room and check oh her and just try to cheer her up and guess what she would do she would find something to scold me about EVERY SINGLE DAY SRSLY and no I don't know why I kept going in there.

I remember when I was young she used to bite me... ( she dosent do that anymore but I think I was 7-9 at the time)

My birthday was 2 weeks ago and I guess I expected my parents to get me something since they always get my siblings something.. I mean my mother bought my older sister 3 pairs of designer shoes and the year before a set of jewelry from boucheron consisting of earrings a ring and a necklace and the year before a necklace from vancleef and it was limited. I mean its not like were poor were the opposite I mean look at what they got my sister for example. And what did they get me? NOTHING I really thought they'd get me something this year I was even saving up to get my mother something on her birthday but since she didn't I mean what the point she dosent really deserve it.

My parents call me names after I told them about how I feel a few times and they make jokes about it so do my siblings I tried telling my father how depressed I am and told him that it was because of my mother and asked him to take me to a therapist but he thinks that they'll make me crazy.. and thought that traveling would make me feel better but nothing really changed.

Im arab and from Dubai \`I can't really leave the house until I get married I guess I honestly don't know (my parents aren't really strict). Also Im out of the country now and I fought with my sister and keep in mind I said nothing the whole time she just told me to open the ac and I told her that I just don't feel like doing that I mean im asleep and she woke up kept shouting at me calling me names and threatened to hit me ( she always does and I hit her back and my parents still shout at me only even though when I don't and hit her back and THEYRE WATCHING)and when I told her that Id tell my father she laughed I guess everyone knows they'll do nothing to her. 

later today we were at the lobby and my mother kept scolding me infront of a lot of people I tried hiding my face I mean I was embarrassed but there was no point she even threatened to hit me infront of them. and they dare to ask me why im always angry why I haven't been laughing anymore when im home.

My younger siblings started hitting me on purpose and disrespecting me knowing my parents won't do anything to them. ITS ALWAYS MY FAULT I GUESS.

Ive thought about calling the police and telling them about how she hits me but they'll probably just fine her and everything will go back to how it was. Plus im afraid my siblings will hate for me it.. And don't know what will happen to me if I did.

My summer vacation started 3 weeks ago and I didn't leave the house since not even once I just have no one to go out with plus I don't really feel like  going out im just way too lazy.

68,"I used to be severely socially awkward, I've always been behind my peers in the terms of maturity.  
I was in special Ed most my life due to combination of ADD inattentive/ dyslexia, but looking back, it was mostly due to the panic attacks i would have, and my complete inability to 'read' others. I didn't understand sarcasm, and fell for the mean kids pranks often, I ended up being overly defensive, believing it was better to assume noone was actually being sincere, that everyone was trying to trick me, or was just being kind and taking pity on me as I was such a nuisance. 

I've gone through therapy (didn't help, but worth the try)  
I've had to relearn how to communicate with others, I'm very social now.  
It's sunken in over the past few years now that's I've 'caught up' mentally/emotionally that I'm actually fairly well liked. 

While I'm still a bit odd, it's often seen in a positive light, I'm 'energetic, enthusiastic, creative'

People *know me* even though I'm totally oblivious to them. (still an issue I need to work on, but an improvement)  
I've come to accept myself, my shortcomings and my past issues, but the fact that I had a late start is creeping up on me.  
Up until now I had the mindset that I was ok being 'alone,' I've had a few steady friends for the past couple years (This is a first!!) and they seem intent on remaining friends for a very long time.  
But romance has never really been even a topic I'd think about til a few years back.  
I didn't feel any sexual attraction until I was out of highschool, but again, I figured that being happy and single was the best option, yet now I'm realizing that it's bothering me in a big way.

The best age for childbearing is the late 20's, and in a month that will be gone.

I never wanted to have kids, always wanted to adopt and foster, but I know how many men actually prefer their own children. I never thought I'd be ok getting pregnant and such, but I guess I am.

I don't want to sound like I'm bragging, but I'm cute. I know I'm cute, apparently I've always been cute and it's likely that fact that got me through life while I was an unaware idiot. Harder to pick on some weirdo when she's pretty. And I actually pass for being much younger, noone other than family and 2 friends know I'm turning 30, everyone else thinks I'm turning 25.  
Time is running out on the prime time for family forming!  
Yes, it's possible and increasingly common for this to happen later in life, but I can't argue with the data behind this!  
How can I find someone to start a family with when I'm so inexperienced? I mean, practically speaking?  
And I'm super picky too! If I just wanted a steady, reliable, well employed man to support me and our children, I could have that , but I refuse to do sex stuff with someone I feel no desire for.  
Essentially I hate the fact that I'm late to the game, and I'm a newb.  
Also I hate my body for not responding to others as it should be (or at least how we are told it is supposed to)  
He can be a *great guy*, perfect in every way except he's not my type, but that's the problem.  
Then there's my age, I like younger men, but even though many will say they'd date older girls, the truth is they are hesitant. Besides, something must be wrong with her if she's 30 and only now dating.  
I need to learn how to take selfies and get on dating sites or something.  
Oh, and a lot of guys are turned off by my education, I often lie about that too with strangers, I'm going to school for ""social work"", not Cellular and Molecular biology with a minor in chemical engineering.  
Sad how that will allow conversations to continue where they'd usually end.  
I know lying is bad, but frankly, you gotta get in the door before anything else.

I'm a bad person right?  
Should I fully give up and begin devoting my life to the future, aka start the process of adoption/fostering. If I do, then the window to possible partners will shrink to a very small fraction,  I can bet on never pairing up with someone while I still find them appealing.  
Or should I keep exploring my options? take those selfies and get out there?  
I feel like if I never try, I'll never know, but if it ends up resulting in the same end, solitude, then isn't it better to start raising kids sooner? I mean, there are kids that need help NOW.  

TLDR  
clocks ticking, formally severely socially awkward late bloomer can't come to terms with her own crappy preferences and is running out of time to find a boyfriend who'd actually exist. Debating throwing in the towel early in order to save lives through being a foster parent sooner rather than later, but this would sabotage all chances of finding a cute boyfriend, let alone a future husband.
