He always makes me do all kinds of stuff around the house and outside, and I ask my friends if they work like I do, but they don’t even do the damn dishes! 

Anyway, now that I’m soon 16 he said over the summer I will be working 8 hours, 4 days a week, whole summer. (Which isn’t bad, 3 days off) He said I will be doing hard maintenance/cleaning jobs. I’m nervous and want to know if anybody knows how it’s like.

7," I was on my way to school late walking I would usually take the bus so I had to walk through a ghetto ass neighborhood and I was walking minding my own business when some old head sitting on his porch told me to get on before I get my ass beat so I started chopping because I know a few homies who got they ass beat just for being at one of their friends house who lives there and shit. So I turn a corner and see about 3 kids on bikes and big homie on the bike start asking where I'm from and shit so I turn back and start running, they catch up to me and all 3 hop off and start beating my ass but we're on the side of a semi-busy rode so a cop pulls up right onto the corner of the street  hops out and at this point im standing up talking crazy saying I'm gonna kill them and some other shit. The cop didn't even try to chase the kids and he said that I'm a danger to others and myself so he Baker acted me and they held me up in the looney bin for 3 days, that was some bullshit.

14,"I'm 30 years old and I'm at home because I say I want to help my parents now that they've retired. But really it's because I can't afford the student loan debt I took on from going to law school so living rent-free is helping me save up to pay that off. Also I wracked up a $20,000 tax bill from running a small business. I wanted to do it by the book and I thought I was smart enough because I had gone to law school but I fucked myself over. 

Instead of going on to be a lawyer I instead I put on events for companies so that they can raise millions of dollars. I don't get a cut of it. 

How the hell did I end up here?

Maybe it's the drugs?

I lost what could have been 11 million dollars if I hadn't spent it on drugs that I had kept it with bitcoin back when I bought it in 2013. I technically didn't lose anything. If anything, I did end up selling some coins and gaining a small profit. But that's one sunken fallacy that will stick with me forever. 

I was a pig in my early to mid 20s. Screwing any girl I could. Fucking around. Hell I did that just a year or two ago.

I might be addicted to sex.

I masturbate frequently. At least now it's less frequently now that I play games to pass my non-work time.

I'm addicted to games. There's one I've been playing for 500 hours in the last 91 days which means I average 5.4 hours every day for the last 3 months. 8 hours of work. comes out to 13.4 hours total per day of just work and this game. That's 10.6 hours left to sleep , eat, commute, etc. Thankfully I can just roll out of bed and work from my desk. All I need for my job is a computer and a phone.

You'd think that'd be liberating until you realize where you are.

I have dropped from being a high achieving, straight edge student to a complete and absolute slob, drug addict and alcoholic.

Getting crossfaded and playing video games and watching cute girls on twitch talk about games is my favorite past time. I sometimes stay up until 4 AM doing it. Definitely all morning if it's a weekend.

There are times when I have to stay up until the next day to tire myself out because I haven't moved from my chair the entire day so that I can reset my sleep schedule by passing out at 9 PM. That way I can wake up at a reasonable hour to do some work.

I live at home with my parents and I tell everyone else that it's to help them transition into retirement but I really fucking hate my parents for how they treated me when I was younger and how they treated each other. To make a defenseless child go through that. But I'm back at home to live rent free and also directly confront the source of my childhood angst now that I'm in my 30s.

I need to find a more productive hobby.

That hobby should be something that adds value to my life.

Because I feel valuable. That's why I try. That's why I think I should try.

I need to contribute more to society. And not be so selfish. I need to think about other people and consider their feelings.

it's easy to hide. To not let yourself get hurt.

I feel hurt.

From my parents' years of abuse. And yelling at each other. My father beating the hell out of my mother. Beating the hell out of me.

I remember running away from home once because it was so bad. I didn't make it very far because I ended up in a cul de sac and my father chased me down.

I've cut myself before from all the years of physical and psychological abuse.

So now that I'm at home, I've told my father to go fuck himself and I will go an entire week without saying a word to my mother.

My father currently lives in the half finished shed we're converting to a 2 bedroom place so that we can airbnb or rent it out. He has a tendency to not finish things so I'm not sure if it'll ever come together. 

I tell myself to make myself feel better that if we need to hire a legitimate construction company to help him out I'm saving for it and I'll delay my $200,000 student loan bill out a little bit. At least I have the earning potential to pay it off. My parents made no more than $20,000 each year according to their taxes and somehow raised several kids. Well not somehow. They invested everything into their children so they have no savings. So they can't afford anything but the bare necessities. But I'm not sure if I actually will follow through and help them out, again out of spite.

While they're putting a roof over my head.

My grandmothers are aging and dying and I'm not visiting them or saying anything to them out of spite of my parents. 

Maybe I'm afraid.

I'm afraid because if I let myself care about others, they may betray me and hurt me. And I don't know how to deal with that pain.

How do I deal with that pain?

That pain is dealt with by, currently, everything I said about earlier. Drugs. Sex. Masturbation. Games. Porn. Anything to distract me.

I need to be more motivated than just running away from my pain.

I need to be motivated by higher meaning. Higher goals. 

I need to be someone amazing. 

I'm going to kick ass at life.

I am amazing.

I HAVE DONE A LOT OF GREAT STUFF IN MY LIFE. SO I KNOW I'M CAPABLE. NOW I MUST DO.

STARTING THIS WEEK. I WILL BE POSITIVE ABOUT MY JOB AGAIN.

I WILL FIND A WAY. I HAVE DEALT WITH CHALLENGES HARDER THAN THIS. 

I'VE ALREADY TAKEN POSITIVE STEPS TO FEEL BETTER AT MY JOB. THIS IS GOOD FOR ME.

I WILL SAY HI TO MY MOTHER IN THE MORNING INSTEAD OF PRETENDING TO BE ASLEEP OR ON THE PHONE. I WILL GREET HER BY LOOKING HER IN THE EYES AND SMILING AT HER.

I WILL CHECK ON MY FATHER. 

THERE ARE GREAT SIGNS THAT THESE CHANGES CAN HAPPEN. AND THEN I WILL BE HAPPIER.

AND WHEN I CONTRIBUTE TO THOSE AROUND ME, I AM BETTER.

WHEN I ADD VALUE TO SOCIETY, I AM BETTER.

THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD DO.",19Jan2018,16

21,"I’ve really been struggling to be productive at work. I enjoy the people I work with. The work isn’t overly stressful. I have the skills needed to complete my job. It’s not hard work, but it’s not brain-numbingly easy either. It’s one thing to have a crappy job/career and hate it, but I even mildly enjoy my work. I can’t figure out why I can’t focus. I always want to distract myself from working. I thought it might be a “phone addiction”, but I find new way to distract myself even if I leave my phone at home. 

I think that I want to be productive at work and even outside of work, but my actions don’t match that desire. I can’t figure out what I actually want and why it seems so hard to do what I think would be good. 

I’ve been really depressed and anxious in the past, and I’m even on medication for that now, but I don’t feel that way about my current situation. It more that I just feel blah about work. I’m usually pretty good about being introspective, but I can’t figure out what’s up with this. Maybe it’s just bad habits and it need to force myself to focus, but that’s obviously very difficult. 

I’m turning 30 this year, married with a daughter. My wife is amazing and I’m not failing too horridly as a father :). I really love getting time with my family, but I usually feel pretty tired at home :/. That might be the depression.

22,"Tall bias is pretty widespread and most people are pretty open about it. Tall people are believed to be healthier, more intelligent, richer and more educated, less violent, and more trustworthy. Moreover tallness is deemed by society to be a superior physical trait in itself. Being tall makes you superior to short people. That is what people believe. So much so, that there is even a pay gap that cannot be fully accounted for by correlating factors. Tall people are offered higher salaries because they are deemed more competent. Politicians who are shorter than average, get ridiculed. A politician being an inch shorter than their opponent is apparently a valid argument for why that politician is less suitable for office. And do not get me wrong here. I am not talking about short men. I am talking about short people. Although short women might seem more attractive in some cultures, they suffer even more than short men in the workplace and struggle to command respect from anyone.

Why is this bias so open and so widely accepted? Is this not akin to believing that white people are better than black people? Except in the latter case, society stopped allowing such nonsense, but when it comes to tall vs short, it is all still perfectly allowed. Even the most progressive of folks will have no qualms about openly asserting that a tall person is just better because they are tall. 

Growing up, I thought this was something only kids thought. Adults would never think such nonsense, right? I could not be more wrong. If you get annoyed or you point out the nonsense, people will tell you it is just a joke, but deep down they really believe that they are superior to shorter people.

23,"I'm just so done. I'm working at a so called ""progressive"" for-profit organization. It prides itself on working with and raising money for good causes. But the problem is that it has terrible labor practices and doesn't practice what it preaches. I'm getting paid 29k/yr, and I'm expected to work ""at least 50 hrs/wk m-f and weekends as needed to get the job done"". And then they have the audacity to say ""well, we're going to require you to work 5 1/2 days per week now instead, and you won't get extra pay for it""

They won't give me a vacation until I'm 11 months into employment at my current position. And I only get 2 weeks. Which I doubt they will let me take.

They changed the pay policy mid week on me, and screwed me out of a day of pay because ""you took a personal day on tuesday! Even though you were gonna work the weekend, we wanna pay you less so we're gonna not pay you""

They want me to move to do ""field work"", but don't actually want to pay me to move. They want me to move out of pocket and pay for literally everything when I get there.

They wanted to promote me, but when I had the audacity to ask for a raise they went to the next person.

They don't pay our lower management enough either - if the lower management doesn't meet specific metrics, which are sometimes totally out of their control, then they won't be getting paid for their management work and only the minimum wage.

God damn. Fuck this organization. And it's not like I can just change jobs, either - it has given me almost zero transferrable skills.

And because of the hours, I can barely find enough time to apply for a job, or get educated, or anything else really. I'm supposed to devote everything to this shitty company. And for what? Someone else's bottom line?

28,"Mitch McConnell promised certain things to certain Republicans to get their vote on the tax bill that never materialized. The White House is trying to go straight to SCOTUS to get DACA ruled unconstitutional. Why should anyone believe Republicans when they say they will help get DACA resolved if Democrats vote for their DACA-less bill? We shouldn't.


There was a bill that addressed both these issues that would pass Congress. Donald Trump said he would sign it, then abruptly and recklessly changed course, torpedoing the work done and offering no insight to what he would sign. This same man said that we need a ""good government shutdown."" This falls squarely on the shoulders of Donald Trump and his Republican supporters.

The Republicans' continuing resolution is a scam to mass deport people to countries they have no connection to while hanging the health of children in the balance, and in the midst of all of this Donald Trump is trying to decide whether or not he should cancel his gala at his private resort.

Tell your reps not to vote for anything that doesn't have CHIP ***and*** DACA. They are not in conflict, they are not bargaining chips. They are essential programs for the United States.

32,"Per the title, I'm 20 years old, male, living in a studio apartment in Chicago. I've lived here for 6+ years now. At this time, my life is not going anywhere in particular. Living paycheck to paycheck, as most are. Not attending school currently. 

I need a change. A fresh start somewhere else. I am making this thread for two reasons. 1) To receive advice, hear about people's experiences and apply it to my own life. 2) To potentially help others who are in similar circumstances and maybe are looking for a fresh start. 

What I'm looking for is experiences and thoughts from people, both in the U.S. and internationally, on how best to start somewhere new and build a life. What has worked for you? What hasn't? If you've moved around, why? What pitfalls or obstacles did you run into? 

My lease runs out in March of 2019. Upon the expiration, I plan on packing up and starting over somewhere else. That gives me a little over a year to put my nose to the grindstone and save up for whatever may be in store for me.  I'm not opposed to moving out of the U.S. if I believe it's the right fit. I'd prefer to be somewhere near a city as I don't have a car and currently can't afford one. The Chicago transit system has been very beneficial to me in this regard. Owning a bike has helped as well. I realize I may very well need a car in the near future so I'm prepared to save for one if necessary. How much would I need? Obviously I'm not looking for anything fancy, decent-to-good gas mileage is all I care for. 

Currently I work in a fine-dining restaurant but the hours are spotty. So far it is enough to pay my living expenses and have some leftover. I am seeking a second job so that I may put that towards savings needed for my move. I attended post-secondary school for a semester but, due to various circumstances, it did not pan out well so far and I have not gone back since. I was pursuing English (and have considered Education) at the time, which I may still want to do but I'm aware that it may not be the most lucrative pursuit.  Math is not my strong suit and while I've briefly considered CS, I do not think I have the mind for it. I've read a little bit about trades but I'd like to avoid working my body into the ground when I'm older. The only think I'm really good at is writing and I haven't the faintest idea what it is I'd ever write about, should I go down that route. 

I'm looking for cities with a relatively low (affordable) cost of living, a somewhat thriving culture to make connections in and grow as a person, and opportunities to educate myself and/or work somewhere I can translate to other places if need be.

37,"[This is a rant. I don't feel like talking about this to anyone I know so shouting into the Reddit void seems like a good idea]

After a series of disappointing events, I think I've grown a backbone and stood up for myself + developed better boundaries + understood what I want from a relationship + learnt to give my trust less easily and to better people + reflected about my own issues. I was emotional unavailable, had low self-esteem, low-key anxiety and depression, was always overthinking and catastrophising, and compromising my own preferences and values to ""keep"" people.

I'm proud of myself that I stayed strong over this week of no-contact with the boy I lost my virginity to, whom I met 2+ years ago (I'm 21) and with whom I've been spending a lot of time hanging out and having casual sex for a year without formally committing to an arrangement because ""he doesn't like labels"". 2 months ago, I met his family. Last week, he told me out of the blue that we should stop having sex, because it ""complicates our friendship"". It was a very lazy break, and I realised that the whole time he was being quite manipulative and deceptive, taking advantage of the fact that I was less experienced, and that I trusted him. He coerced me into having unprotected sex with him (my first). He was generally coercive in the relationship and although it opened me up to trying may new things I wouldn't have done otherwise, I wouldn't trust him anymore now, and I'm glad nothing really bad happened during our time together.

However, I would still like to stay friends with this person, because on some levels, he has been a very supportive and healing presence in my life, and we've made lovely memories. On hindsight, I was not the best friend/partner either, because I clearly wasn't ready, which was also why I didn't talk about commitment even though I was falling for him (not surprisingly, since it was my First Time). I've gotten over the anger and the hurt, and am wondering when would be the best time to reach out. It's this delicious complexity of human relationships that I'm beginning to experience for the first time. What is friendship (ride or die), what is companionship (compromise), what is love (Ti voglio un mondo di bene), what is romance (adventures), what is lust (desire and jealousy), and what is peace (knowing that all of these are necessary, but people prioritise them differently at different points of their lives).

I found out from another friend that he has a new girlfriend. I wonder why he didn't tell me about that when he said he wanted to stop having sex. They also got together before we stopped having sex: would that have been cheating? I know it has nothing to do with me, but even as a friend I have to decide how much I can trust him. Should I talk to him about this?

Anyway, I yearn for finally having beautiful, FULLY consensual sex, something I never really experienced from this past year of sexual exploration (with this boy and one night stands - all but one I wouldn't have continued with had I realised that I could say NO at ANY point). I've been stood up, stood others up, been STOLEN from, gotten an STD (a mild one fortunately, but we might all have Herpes and HPV so the cosmic background anxiety is still there), gotten tantrums when I said no, been groped, been yelled at, but also been told that I'm kind, intelligent, pretty, etc.

I've learnt that I take a loooooooooong time to really feel comfortable with someone. And I've decided that that's okay!

I'll still go with serendipity in making friends. But the ones I really like, I shall put in the effort to keep.

After everything gone downhill for me lost all motivation, discipline, and lost friends, girl I was engaged to cheated, etc. So I moved to Hawaii. With no support, slept on the street for a month straight. Got a job my third day in Honolulu. Anyways I was roughing it out. My dad who I haven’t seen for 15 years calls me and tells me to come and that’ll he will yeah me how to drive and I can return to Hawaii but the thing is I got no passport and he lives in Mexico. So I just gone by his word and flew to Arizona and crossed over with nothing but my ID and social. Anyways I learned how to drive, great! Now he’s telling me all these things that are chipping away at my self image. Get into arguments with him on the daily, He gone so far as to tell me he can call a rehabilitation to put me in. Keep in mind I’m not a drug addict or alcoholic that’s just not my thing. I told him he couldn’t do that, he said he could. Apparently different laws, and he can. I’m not a Mexican citizen. All I want is to go back home and grind as hard as I fucking can! I want to kick ball again, join the military, start up a business. But I can’t bring stuck here.

I seem to be afflicted by this mentality of ""If it's not good/great don't do it at all"" like that saying of ""miss 100% of the shots you never take""

This is kind of weird, somewhat real concern though (data ownership)

Like I could build my own web technologies but it takes time (do I actually build it) but then you could just use readily made services such as Evernote, Trello, online Portfolios where you can just drop in your work, rather than having an old one that may hurt you in that it is not accurate/representative of your current abilities.

It is an ego thing and data concern (using third party services they own your data in some sense since you're using their services). Though they say in their ToS the essence of ""we respect your privacy, your data is yours, we won't look at it""

42,"Hello,

I've posted in r/AskDocs but received no replies, so I'm trying here now.

I have a problem: My toes itch. A month ago, I slammed my left foot into a table, possibly breaking two of my toes. A week ago, all the toes on my left foot started itching like crazy. Yesterday, the toes on my right foot started to itch horribly as well. I don't know if my toe injury has anything to do with the itching; perhaps it's coincidental.

In addition to itching, my toes are also red, slightly swollen, and shiny. I thought I might have athlete's foot, but I'm not sure. It's only my toes that itch, not between them, and I don't have scaly skin. They seem to itch at random times but especially at night. The worst time of all is when I take a hot shower. When the water hits my toes, they start itching so bad I almost want to get out of the shower. (I really like showers.)

Here's a picture of my toes (I know they're hideous and dirty [they usually aren't this bad], but please ignore how horrible they are for now--I'm really self-conscious about them): https://imgur.com/7uBrRno

I was thinking that maybe it might be something else though. There's this thing called chilblains, and some of my symptoms seem to match. They only started to itch when it got really cold a week ago. I think it's supposed to happen when your fingers/toes go from cold to hot suddenly, like when taking a hot shower. My fingers are also acting up a bit. I have a few red patches on them that itch/hurt a little (more the latter). My left pinky seems slightly swollen and harder to bend. My hands are *always* ice-cold during the winter, so I'm sure they've gone from cold to hot/hot to cold too.

Could I have athlete's foot, chilblains or something else? Does anyone have experience with this conditions? Would you mind explaining your own symptoms in-depth so I can compare mine?

I would go to a doctor, but… I can't. I don't have insurance, I'm poor and I'm absolutely terrified. I mean, I've got a lot of weird emotional baggage when it comes to going to doctors. I don't even know where I'd start to explain my doctor issues if you'd asked me. So, just assume that I absolutely will not go to a doctor unless I've got a fatal illness, and frankly, I might not even go then.

43,"The thing people forgot about age is financial intelligence. 

People grew so accustom to the culture of consumerism, they forgot the 1st thing being a consumer. 

Don't consume things out of you means. In this case, don't spend money you don't have.  

Being in a credit card debt without actual financial intelligence and wisdom of the issue can easily snowball the debt. 

The initial debt was 6,000 with 10-15% interest. Then suddenly he found an opportunity to combine the debt to one with 8% interest rate. Guess what? if you don't properly read the clause, it directly increase the interest to 28% with numerous extra fees. 

Make matters worse is that he paid the minimum amount which literally increase the debt.

All and all, they need 15,000 to settle all the extra debts and financial problems that snowballed along the way. 

Stress and depress, now they seek the family fund to pay their debts. 15,000 worth of funds that were earmarked for other investment we plan this year. 

My parents will most likely want to give this 15,000 to them. Give not loan. 

Basically taking away our money for their irresponsibility.

I Googled how to get it back, but it seems the best options were Google Photos trash (which is empty) or recovery software (which didn't seem to help. I guess installing anything screwed up my chances, plus this is an internal storage only phone).

Apparently, iOS has a ""recently deleted"" thing, but Google's requires a Wi-fi connection. WHY!? And why isn't there an ""are you sure"" dialog anywhere before deleting things!?",19Jan2018,0
