3,"Last week I got really drunk, I met a random guy sitting at the bar and he kept buying me drinks.  I’m a pretty tough looking guy and generally people want me on their side. I think that’s the reason why this guys spent hundreds on me. He would buy ma shot after shot of whiskey and beer.  He wasn’t gay cause we were talking about the girls in the bar.  Well as the night progresses I’m now hammered and hammered off whiskey.  The details are blurry but I got in a fight with five guys. Can’t recall who instigated it but I’ll put my money on me.  Well I held my ground pretty good considering my state and I was against five guys.  I can recall connecting good a few times and dropping some guys but there was one guy who knew how to fight and he inflicted the most damage. I remember taking multiple rights to my left eye and ear.  Don’t remember how the fight ended but I guess we all had enough and went our separate ways.  Next morning I wake up in a very expensive hotel (350 a night) and not really sure how I got there. It has a jacuzzi in the room so I take one then chill on the bed cause I figure I got to check out at 11 and I got an hour to kill.  I hear someone at the door I figure is house keeping but it’s the dude who I was hanging out with all night. He tells me how crazy I am and he wants to go for more drinks when the bars open. I’m still kinda drunk at the point and figure whatever why not I don’t feel very hungover just still drunk.  My left eye is closed shut and I look like I just got ran over by a truck.  Well we end up getting more beers and more shots and the guy even buys me sun glasses and gives me his sweater cause mines full of blood so I don’t have to like a huge wreck. We go for some food eventually then I tell him I need to go home cause I’m sore and tired as fuck.  I get home near evening and my eye is finally opening up. Enough so I can see out of it but it’s kinda blurry.  It’s like this for the next two days. When it finally gets better and I can open it more but now half of the white in my eye is blood red.  It looks kind of badass honestly so I really don’t care I figure it’ll go away with time.  Ok but here’s why I’m writing this. I have a interest in aliens and I truly believe that they exist and even intervene in our lives.  While I’m recovering I basically do nothing for the next few days but lay in bed watching shit. I come across ‘The Mothman prophecies’ on Netflix and decide to watch it. I’ve seen this movie multiple times before and have always enjoyed the concept behind it and the fact it’s based on true events.  In the movie a young man sees this mothman and after gets a red, blood shot eye just like I have, almost identical. I found this kinda strange and unnerving considering the plot of the movie. I’ll tell you the fate of this young man wasn’t good.  On week goes by and my eye is just as red as it was initially. It is Friday and I have the day off and a movie I’ve been very interested in has come out. The movie is ‘hereditary’.  A 100% rating on rotten tomatoes and numerous reviews stating how scary is was got me interested. I go see the movie alone at 130pm cause I figure the theatre will be pretty much empty and I don’t want to hear people’s chatter and consumption of food.  It worked out cause there was only a handful of people in the theatre who were pretty much non existent through out. SPOILER. At the end of the movie the son gets a red eye just like mine. Same bloodshot eyes covering half the white of the eye. I almost couldn’t believe it when I saw it.  It’s like I’m being told that my time is coming.  That a force brought me to watch the mothman prophecies and hereditarily to show me I’m about to die. The red eye is a death sentence. One month ago I bought a 600cc Kawasaki ninja and definitely drive it like I stole it. I can’t help it though. I’ve always been a thrill seeker to push the limits. I believe I will die as a result of driving this bike recklessly yet I can’t bring myself to stop riding it. I have the mark of death. Might as well embrace it right? ",10Jun2018,1
4,"Sorry if this comes off as a rant but here goes...

I really loathe when viewers complain about antagonists doing bad things but protagonist gets a free pass.

Context: In one show, protagonist lost his father and does some bad things. One character said ""what would your father think of your behavior?"" and protag punches him. It wasnt even an insult the dwad father. All he did was criticize the protag's actions. Viewers say he deserved it but i dont think it was that bad.

Whereas in another show antagonist lost his father and protagonist made some snarky remarks about it. Antag tries to lash out at him and viewers get upset. ""It was just an insult. He shouldnt took it too seriously"". That is just hypocritical. Make him anything but the protagonist, and he'll be that one character that everyone wants killed off in a horrible way. 

I feel like i'm the only sane viewer who can see through when a protag is being a jerk. 95&amp;#37; viewers would be blinded by the fact that he's so attractive or because he's the main character.",10Jun2018,0

9,"my roommate thought she could scare me into illegally evicting me though bullying and threats to call the cops. even though i've paid my rent and haven't caused any disturbance or threat, today she decided she was too overwhelmed at my recent psych eval (i'm fine, just really fucking depressed lmao) and her losing her job, which i guess in her mind meant that my mere presence was threatening her safety? idk.

still, she knows i am scared of cops due to being trans, queer, and autistic - all of which are factors that have contributed to many senseless deaths at the hands of the police for reasons that both confuse and infuriate me. 

i cried and pleaded with her not to do it. and she eventually conceded that she would give me a whole day to move (thanks?), and if i didn't she'd call them. but she lied. she called them while i got lunch and imagine my fucking surprise to see two armed cops waiting outside my building, along with her and her 6'2'' 200 lb beefy cousins who have been also been trying to intimidate me. 

anyway, none of that even mattered because the cops still sided with me. they affirmed i have a right to stay and that they can't force me to leave, as this is a civil and not criminal matter. i stood my ground, stayed calm, and trusted that i did nothing wrong. meanwhile, she was shaking like a leaf and kept babbling nonsense. but i guess that confrontation did knock some sense into her cuz she decided to stay with her cousins for the night to figure out their next move or whatever. you'd think that would involve her, idk, getting all this in writing? ironically, i still haven't been served with a formal notice to leave yet. she wasted her entire day on this stupid decision to call the cops who didn't help her at all.

it's been a few hours since that confrontation, and i feel like i won the battle today, but there's still a war coming. i can relax a little. but there's still that gnawing fear about what would have happened to me if i wasn't calm enough or if i said the wrong thing while the cops were there. i honestly don't know how she can sleep at night knowing she put my life at risk.

she hurt me in the worst possible way today.

10,"And online bullying to boot. Granted from an old friend, and honestly the insults directed at me were true of my past self. It was very out of the blue, and though i didnt expect them to know it, i feel like ive changed a bit since then. They added me again on facebook the day before the slew of texts meant to hurt me, and i felt it was odd since we'd grown so apart. However i apologized for the way i used to act (obviously a blanket apology isnt right for a years long complicated friendship, but this was a short convo.) And said if they wanted to be friends again it was welcome. They responded casually and nice. It felt cool to have an old friend pop back, but hardly a day later that changed. It was very weird, a sudden rude text, me being confused and apologizing again because i understand hard feelings. But that ramped it up and it became an oddly high school-ish knock down. Again, some true but of my past self. We both made mistakes, you know? 

I dont know. It feels like im stuck in a very anxious place i used to be in alot when i wasnt acting with true integrity. Knowing im not proud and feeling like i never would be, because i would never escape my past. I have alot of learning and growing to do still.

27,"So, I'm temporarily living with my parents so that I can pay student loans back quicker. My parents have made me feel very welcomed and have said they like me being around more often. The problem is that whenever my mom talks to me lately, I can't help but be in an irritable mood toward her. It's like every single thing she says, I can't relate to at all, or I have the complete opposite opinion. I don't know how to fake it anymore. 

For example, in public she is hypercritical of other people. Last night we went to a concert together. She pointed out how a woman's tattoo looked like a bruise and that she can't understand people who have tattoos. I said ""everyone likes different things,"" and she insisted that there was something wrong with their state of mind. She whispered how the woman next to us reminded her of a relative of ours who is extremely stoic and inexpressive. She then wanted to point out how the man in front of us, ""hasn't shut up since we got here,"" but that she wished my dad (her husband) was more of a talker. Her phone was out 70% of the time because she had to record the entire show. I think it was annoying the people next to her so I made a comment to her to turn her brightness down. Then she took her shoes off because she said her feet were sweaty, and put her feet on the back of the chair in front of her (luckily it was stadium seating so the row in front of us was also below us), right by these peoples' heads. She also insisted on sneaking water and candy inside the theater even though the sign said no food or drink. Then she left her water bottle as we walked out. As we were walking to her car, we passed a very overweight man, and after we passed him she said quietly, ""like that has to be uncomfortable."" Why must she make a negative comment about everyone? I don't encourage it by agreeing or feeding into it, but she still doesn't take the hint. 

She doesn't follow social rules and has a complete lack of social awareness. I believe she has Adult ADHD and we just have the most separate opinions about literally everything. But at the same time I feel guilty for not being nicer to her, and feel like there's a better way I could respond to her comments and quirkiness. I love her, she's my mom, but I don't know how to reset my attitude toward her and I want to have a good relationship with her. 

Any advice? Thank you! ",10Jun2018,2

* I wish I could feel how I look like. Everytime I look at the mirror, I look incredibly smug and arrogant and self confident. I feel the opposite. I wish I knew I wasn't faking it because it seems so believable, why is my bravado not becoming real?

30,"Today I am grateful. I was given a chance by the universe to prove myself when my ex-boyfriend sent me a break up e-mail. After having been in 4 years of nonstop-serial dating, everything was split into two eras at that moment: Before Relationship, and After Relationship. 


When I woke up this morning terrified and petrified by the loneliness that felt like it would suffocate me, I looked to searching “lonely” in reddit’s search bar. If you are lonely, the internet is a beautiful place to hear the echoes of your own experience reverberate through communities and individuals. Fear, isolation, desperation, sadness: Someone was feeling this some time today somewhere else, or 74 days ago, or 2 years ago. For some reason that felt really, really comforting.


I do not appreciate these negative feelings. I always remind myself that my problems are first-world, and for some reason it has helped me. I adjust my focus, and the blurred becomes clear. I’m sleeping in a friend’s room, someone who cares enough about me that watching dogs in a park or taking a brisk walk and all the pretty city places that could keep me distracted from feeling too in the dark. And I am grateful, even if I wake up feeling lonely and shaky and homeless. 


Other people have been home, but now I am finding home in myself making it more home. It is hard. I had to haul the emotional furniture up a few flights of stairs by myself and arrange it. It is still such a big, daunting space that seems unfillable, but goddamnit I’ll fill it. 


Today I am grateful. I will go home to a family I love. I will clean my room and I will read a book. I will try not to feel like the space around me both threatens to steal my breath and implode around me at the same time. Every day that ends with a “y” is a chance at redemption. I’m so scared. But today, it is a Brave New World, and I want to be brave.

31,"I was watching New Girl the other day. The Jaipur Aviv episode where Jess goes above and beyond to do something nice for Nick. For those who never watched the show: Nick is her ex and roommate. And also the guy she is still very much in love with, even though he's now with somebody else. Jess tells her friend Cece that she can't express her feelings for Nick through her romance hole, so she needs to express them through her friendship hole. It's a reference to Bugs Bunny. If Elmer Fudd puts water in Bugs Bunny's hole, it's gonna shoot out some other hole where Elmer Fudd least expects it. 

Ridiculous as this metaphor may sound, it made me think about one of my own friendships. If I can even call it that. And somehow I felt like it would be good for me if I properly worded the situation. I don't feel comfortable telling any of my friends (yet), because it's a bit odd and I haven't even made up my mind. So here goes. 

There's this guy I work with, let's call him Thomas. I've only known him for a year, but he quickly became one of my favourite people. He's ridiculously funny and charming. He's super friendly and loves to chat with strangers. As a result, people recognise him just about everywhere too. He's also very sweet and considerate, and not afraid to show his sensitive side. Thomas is the kind of guy whose attention everybody craves. The one you always invite to come along, because you know everything will be a lot more fun with him there. 

With a lot of ifs, and in another lifetime, Thomas and I could have been more than just friends. Most importantly: if he wasn't quite a bit younger than me. But also if we didn't work together, because I'm his senior and that would just be a no go. And if I was physically attracted to him, which I'm absolutely not. Lots of 'ifs' short: my 'romance hole' for Thomas is closed off with concrete. No amount of water is ever going to break through there. I'm remarkably sure I don't want it to, so it doesn't feel like a loss. But it's also just never going to happen. Too many ifs. And he certainly doesn't like me 'that way' either, even though he is a bit of a flirt. Regardless, something is still there. A seed of potential that's never going to grow. Perhaps that seed is just the tiny bit of tension that's at the base of every girl\-guy friendship. I wouldn't know for sure. But maybe because of that seed, my 'friendship hole' (thanks New Girl, this isn't odd at all) is overflowing.  

I work on a couple of projects with Thomas, and we're on the road together a lot. We also hang out often outside of work, but always with other people. We go out on Fridays and do stuff like movie nights or sport events. I have the best conversations with him about just about anything. From talking about our weekends to philosophical discussions about life. Despite his 'sensitive side', Thomas is just very much a 'young guy'. Everything is just so easy for him. Or so it seems. He doesn't take life or his responsibilities too seriously. And he certainly isn't going to make a big deal about things like our possible friendship. I'm the complete opposite. I didn't grow up with a shitload of friends. The few friends I do have, were pretty hard to come by, so I value them a lot. 

Part of me wishes Thomas and I could really be friends. Not just coworkers that hang out a lot. Even that is probably not going to happen. Still, sometimes I feel a little pathetic. Mostly because I give way more than I receive. I could probably come up with a nice hole metaphor for this one as well. He has a gazillion friendship holes, and I just have a handful. So whatever I have to offer in attention is divided between just a few people, while his is spread more thinly. Don't get me wrong, he often includes me in whatever he's up to, and he actively seeks out my company. But he's that way with so many people, it feels like it's just 'basic Thomas'. 

I guess this is what unrequited friendship feels like. Like I said, it's not that Thomas doesn't reciprocate my friendly affection at all, but it's just on a totally different level. And I don't really know how to deal with it. I don't want to lose what I do have. And I'm scared to push it further, because I don't want to make things odd between us. When I think about it, being friends with him just seems weird. Some of the romantic 'ifs' apply here as well, and I can't really get a non\-awkward picture in my head of what our friendship would be like. It's not an option to stop being 'friendly coworkers' with him, as he's a fundamental part of the group of coworkers I hang out with. It's something I have to resolve within myself. I just wish I knew how.

Me and my girlfriend had a big argument and that left our partnership in tatters. I already apologized and we both agreed to move past it but things are just not the same. Right now, our chemistry is non-existent. These past few weeks, I've been trying to reconnect with her but it is hard. We hung out just yesterday and she seemed happy talking with my friends but with me it's so different. It's more dry and awkward. 

I hate it. It kills me from the inside out because I like her so much. There's so much more to it but long story short, my heart has never dealt with so much emotional stress.

37,"So I don't really know the point of this post, I guess to ask for some advice. 

I started college in September in Denmark, moved from Croatia. I was supposed to get a job to finance myself cos my mom is in debt and it seemed to be great idea to go abroad and try to get a high paying job (finance myself, and help my mom), and join a well respected college. The college was something I expected to satisfy me, but it wasn't. Nothing went as planned which is what happens in life, but it just kept piling up. I was unable to secure a job, and after starting well in my courses, the government voted on cutting funds for international courses and my course was under that directive. So I stopped going since they explicitly told me that I couldn't transfer to some other course. I was to apply like the rest of the folk in September. I devoted my time to getting a job, and nothing came of it ( I was not fluent in the language and/or didn't hit it off with the hiring managers). I spent 8 months there without a job and 3 months without going to classes. Close to the end I decided I will take the state test again to try to get into better colleges. I devoted 10-11 hours of my day to studying that, and then I went home in late april. Now I'm home and I found a job trying to secure some money for Autumn. The problem is I have total burnout syndrome. I have no will, no motivation, I'm tired all of the time even with regular sleep. Anything that requires mental work leaves me drained after 10 minutes. How do I get back to studying? How do I stop this cycle? I'm tired of being depressed and I want a change, but I'm unable to find the solution myself. 



TL;DR - Went abroad to study and work, courses got cancelled, couldn't find job. Decided (studying 10-11h a day to take the states test again to try for a new college. Now completely drained after coming back home and getting a job. ",10Jun2018,1

I want to tell him how I feel but I don’t want there to be an ultimatum on his end as I feel he may not want a friendship at all if he knows that I might have developed real feelings for him.

42,"**tw: suicide** 

She was saying how she thought it was a little odd that they all chose hanging as their means of killing themselves. That though she doesn't believe in conspiracy theories, it just seems like hanging would be a good way of committing murder and then covering it up. She mentioned how pills would probably be her method of choice if she was to ever consider it.

I couldn't bring myself to tell her I kinda get it, because I've thought about it. Pills are too risky, you can take too little or too much and end up in the hospital if someone finds you still alive. Also, certain pills would be just as slow or painful. Shooting yourself is difficult too because 1) you have to have a gun and 2) you have to aim and properly shoot to kill so there's a lot of ambiguity as well. Cutting yourself to death so that you bleed out would be fine but for a lot of people it's still too painful to inflict harm upon themselves even if they are tying to die. So I understand the hanging thing. It's a quick method where you only have to make a split second decision to take the floor out from under you. And then you can't really go back on it. You can't accidentally take too little pills, or shoot somewhere non\-fatal, or not cut yourself deep enough. It's just one and done. 

I'm not going to commit suicide but it was just a few thoughts I had regarding this ""coincidence"". I was too scared she would worry if I explained this to her directly but I also understand why these people would choose to do it this way. ",10Jun2018,9

44,"I appreciate and support the idea now of how suffering from anxiety, depression, and other forms of mental illness must be de-stigmatized so more people can be understood and helped to live better lives. However, in the current context , I think constantly talking about it the way may be perpetuating a pernicious myth. This is the idea that if a person who committed suicide just had the right medication, or the right support system, or the right therapist, or if the world just gave them a break they would have lived. I really do not think it is that simple. 

When I heard that David Foster Wallace had committed suicide I was genuinely devastated. Apparently he wasn’t just one of my favorite writers, but one I had sort of built a fantasy friendship with in my head and I felt the loss somewhat like that of friend and not just a celebrity I admired. I thought about all those things I mentioned above - why didn’t he reach out and get treatment? Why didn’t he have enough of a support system? How could no one know this was going to happen? Then I found out the real story. 

DFW had suffered from depression all his adult life and had, indeed, been on medication. His medication stopped working and no others would help, nor would any other treatments he tried. After a year of suffering, unable to sleep or eat properly, he took his own life. His wife, his family and friends, were all aware of his suffering and tried to help and support him in every way they could. If he was a patient with a physical illness that was depriving him of the ability to eat and sleep, if he was wasting away, miserable and in pain, would we have judged the situation the same way? I know I didn’t at the time. But finding out the whole story made me realize that, for some people, life itself is just an agony they cannot sustain. I think depression can be a serious illness as refractory to treatment as many others, it’s not always just a matter of taking a pill, talking to a shrink, opening up to those close to you, and having them support you. I am not sure that every act of suicide is one of selfishness or insanity. ",10Jun2018,47

My girlfriend on the other hand has had many boyfriends, and I'm fine with that. The past is the past after all. But when she starts talking about her exes, or when she says something hinting at my relative inexperience, it just kills me inside. I've never brought this up with her, and I probably never will, but I just feel so worthless whenever these things get brought up. In the back of my mind, I know that this such a trivial issue, but when my girlfriend says things like ""if you hadn't met me you would probably still be a virgin lol"" or when she talks about how her friends are surprised that we're still together after 10 months because she has so many boyfriends and how they consider her a slut (obv joking but still), it just spoils my mood for the next few hours.

So yesterday when we hung out with out friends he went outside to go to the bathroom and I followed him to talk about this in private. 

So we talked a bit and then his girlfirend of almost 4 years came outside as well and we talked about having a threesome. I thought about having a threesome with them before but I never expected them to have these thoughts and feelings aswell. I sometimes get flirty and pretty close with his girlfriend but he tells me doesnt get jealous because of that but he would be jealous if anyone else did that.

Im scared of it, they'e been fucking for almost 4 years now and they know what they like and I think I would be out of place in a threesome Im also worried about how our relation is going to change after that

49,"Need to get this off my chest even though it just happened. This is not the type of thing that I feel like I can really talk to my friends about.


I'm on a tour of Europe vacation trip with my parents. I'm 24 and they wanted me to come along for company and partially because they'd be horribly inept at navigating without my advice. We had just finished an 8 hour long train ride into a relatively small German city and were looking for dinner.


When I say small, I mean in comparison to other major European towns, this is dinky. The streets were almost completely barren. The first restaurant we came across was a small Italian restaurant with a few people eating outside. It was a little warm outside and my parents didn't want to walk anymore so we chose this place. 


Nobody else was inside the restaurant besides us. The staff was polite and professional. It was a little warm but not unreasonable. Basically everything went well until my mom's salad arrived.


Immediately she starts talking out loud about how the chicken is salty and how horrid it is. I tell her to keep her voice down because the waiter is at his counter like 10 minutes away. She barely touched the salad for the remainder of the dinner. Starts drinking wine and being obnoxious, demanding another glass ""more wine!"" with no please or thank you. She wants to reach over and eat the pasta and lasagna that me and my dad got respectively. To add on, complaining about sweating with other customers in the vicinity.


I repeatedly told her to stop but this was just awful. There is no excuse. My mom was that horrible customer today.


The kicker that sealed the deal was that other customers were coming in to dine and the waiter was attending to their party. As he was occupied my mom yelled out ""Sir! Sir! Sir!"" three times. He ignored her and finished with the other group first. He then walked over and didn't even say anything. His face said it for him, just a ""what the fuck do you want?"" kinda look. I'm about to say ""Can we get the bill, please?"" And my mom just loudly says ""All done!""


He saw the barely touched salad and the mess at her spot, mouth gaping, he picked up the food and brought it back before returning to the other customers.


After like 10 minutes of sitting my she gets up and says she'll wait outside while it's cooler. I scoot closer to my dad's seat and we just start talking about what just happened and how this is not ok. I'm really saying that this is what people do for their career, you can't treat them like that.


At this point, the restaurant has gone from empty to nearly full. At this point I realize that everyone is dressed in classy outfits and I'm just wearing a t-shirt and shorts. I begin to realize this isn't just a nice, local restaurant, this is the real deal.


And so we wait for this bill that never comes. This waiter stays busy and only glanced at me and my father a couple times. I feel like I'm dying inside. After 30 minutes, it starts to rain and we stop waiting and go up to the desk. My dad says that his wife is outside in the rain and he needs to pay. The other waiter calls the original back over from a table.


We pay him and the guy just says, ""You know, people wait weeks for reservations here,"" and then leaves.


That was what did me in. The stab at my chest, I guess. Yeah, he was going to make us wait all night as a ""fuck you."" That was a dick move on his part, but at the same time I feel the blame is mostly here with us. Obviously.


So we walk back to the hotel in the pouring rain without an umbrella. A real fitting end to this shitty day. I go off on my mom for being rude and say that we wouldn't be in this situation if not for her awful behavior. She says I'm too polite and never should have sat for that long. My dad is feeling neutral about the whole thing.


Now we sit in the hotel room. I'm drying off from the rain and we're not talking to each other. A further fracture in the relationship with my parents. I don't know how my mom is feeling, and I bet that waiter feels like he got us back good, but I just feel like taking a swan dive out of the hotel window right now. I simultaneously feel apologetic and angry, while also thinking this is totally deserved. I'm 24, I wasn't going to pass up on Europe, but this should be my wake up call when we return.


TL;DR: My mom was an obnoxious customer at a fancy restaurant and pissed off the waiter. We ended up sitting for an extra half hour before having to walk back to the hotel in the rain. We're not talking to each other and I feel so bad all around.

51,"I’ve always got myself down about my attractiveness. Through all my teenage years I’ve been pretty unattractive, didn’t put in any effort to change it, and always just hated how things never seemed to work out for me. In the last couple of years I’ve put more of an effort in, and I’ve definitely got further with girls and got kinda flirty with some girls, but it’s always just playful and never goes beyond that. I’ve made out with one girl in my life where it wasn’t a joke, and even then we were both insanely drunk.

So I’m on vacation with my parents, and in my deep boredom I downloaded Tinder, planning to delete it when I get back home. I don’t use it back home because I don’t want to run into any female friends on it, I live in a small town and my friends would find the idea of me looking for love fucking hilarious. But on vacation nobody will ever know I downloaded it. I just wanted to see if even one person would find me interesting enough to swipe right. So I went for it. I made it clear I’m on vacation and And within about an hour and a half I had a fucking match. And she’s not a bot. She’s a real girl who probably thought I was attractive enough to want to talk to.

It’s such a simple thing, but it means a lot to me and it’s given me a huge confidence boost. Feels good man. I think I really just need to put myself out there more and stop thinking nobody could ever go for me.",10Jun2018,264

53,"For the past two years I've been taking a break from college because I was failing too many classes. I wasn't on academic probation or anything, but there's no point of going to college if I keep on having to retake classes. It's sort of a waste of time. I want to figure out why I keep on doing so poorly in college before I go back.

Before every semester in college, I resolved to do better, to study harder, and to really excel academically. But every semester, I failed to keep up with the workload. I'm not that smart, but I'm definitely not dumb either, and I'm confident that I'm smart enough to at least get a bachelor's degree, but I keep doing so poorly in college. Over these past couple years, I've been doing a lot of thinking and trying to figure out why I can't perform well academically. I really struggle with writing essays. At first I thought I was bad at writing, but now that I think about it, I think the problem is that I really had trouble with keeping up with reading assignments. Because most essays that are assigned in college relate to the coursework, so since I had trouble keeping up with the reading assignments, it was hard for me to come up with stuff to write about and relate it back to the course. I enjoy reading in my free time, but I go at my own pace and sometimes find it hard to stay focused. When I read, I like to make sure I fully understand what I read, so I kind of take my time. If I try to skim read, it seems like I just forget everything I read. 

So right now I'm quitting caffeine and soda, and only drinking water. I know caffeine is not that unhealthy, but studies show it actually doesn't make people who are already addicted to it more alert or have any beneficial effects, it just alleviates the withdrawal symptoms. A study showed that people who drink caffeine are no more alert than people who don't drink caffeine at all. I also think eating too much carbohydrates is unhealthy. The problem is that I hate cooking and most food at restaurants and grocery stores is loaded with carbs.

Anyone have any advice? I'm really hoping that quitting caffeine and cutting back on carbohydrates will improve my ability to focus, but I'm not entirely sure that it will.",10Jun2018,1
54,"I'll try to keep it as short as I can but i want to give enough context so you understand where I'm coming from. i'm 29M, she's a 29F.

Context: Friends since 5th grade. Became best friends when she got preggo in HS. Dude was POS. They broke up. We fell in love in college. Had a great relationship for 5\-6 years. Started having life issues and issues between us so we broke but agreed on remaining friends.

She ended up moving to FL with her sister cause things at home weren't great for her and her daughter (big reason we broke up). She started dating this guy within a month of moving there and lied to me about it in a pretty shitty way.

I was butthurt and texted my mean ""how could yous"" but never heard back. About a year later I heard she got engaged. I felt bad because I didn't want those to be my ""last words"" to her, so I sent an email when I heard she was engaged and said congratulations / I'm sorry / good luck in life shit. Never heard back but I was okay with that.

Fast forward years to a couple of days ago. A facebook memories thing comes up and links me to her graduation pictures that i took and forgot about. These were pretty much her only good graduation pictures, I remember them being way better than hers and the ones her parents took because she had a really shitty camera phone at the time.

I'd feel bad deleting because them because I remember it was a sore point in our relationship and deleting would make me feel petty. We didn't take any pictures together and it made me feel insecure that she never bothered to get a graduation picture with her boyfriend.

I still think that's type fucked up but I'm also not mad anymore. This was legit 6 years ago and I don't hold grudges.

I guess the best way to explain it is that it'd feel similar to throwing away an awesome sandwich you don't want, instead of giving it to the hungry homeless guy outside because annoyed you the previous week.

In my head, graduating was something important to us because as kids to immigrants, we were both the first generation to go to college and graduate. I actually think she's the only one from her family to graduate, which she did while raising a kid and being a great mom.

Social media creeping tells me she actually has two kids with her husband now. The only contact I've had was the email I mentioned and didn't get a response to. The only other time we had something resembling contact was when she accidentally followed (and quickly unfollowed) me on Instagram while creeping my profile. (lol) It happened almost a year ago, probably in like September 17.

I'd feel like a dick deleting them because it could mean a lot to her or her or her kids. I know its just a couple of pictures but I remember when I was young, I always loved looking at pictures of my parents when they were younger. Something like a graduation is very symbolic.

So I don't know what to do. I don't feel appropriate reaching out, the fact that she has never responded or reached out to me has made it pretty clear that she probably doesn't want to talk to me. On the other hand, she's thought about me enough to at least creep my socials. I don't want to delete them because i'd feel like it's petty, but I also feel weird holding onto them for many different reasons.

if you see this shit and this story sounds familiar, hmu I got your grad pix and i feel awkward holding onto them.

58,"First of all, let me say that nothing in this post is probably news to anyone. Second, there's really no point other than to express my own disappointment and sadness. Consider that my disclaimer of self-awareness. Third, the below contains talks of politics, but this is not meant to be a politically charged post, so I really don't care to hear about anyone's self-righteous political ramblings in the comments. If you really just can't help yourself and choose to go on some political tirade, just know this post is about you. 

I recently got into a bit of an argument with an old friend. She's fallen pretty deep into the SJW crowd. She brings up something politically charged pretty much every time I talk to her now, so this time, she mentioned that she excluded all white men on her Tinder profile. When I asked her why, she gave me her usual spiel about how all white men are scum and how they victimize everyone. The thing of it is is that she wasn't always like this. But one day, she happened to find Tumblr. I remember about a year or so after she'd found it, I came over one day and she would hardly acknowledge me because she was so absorbed in the endless scrolling of all ""die cis scum"" venom. Over time, all of her personal pain mingled with all of those toxins she took in over the years, and now it seems to me she's just devolved into little more than a bitter, resentful political Gollum. She can't seem to operate anymore without calling anyone who has a slight disagreement with her a fascist. 

On the opposite end of the spectrum, my dad seems to have fallen into a very sketchy political crowd on the right. He's always had kind of an ""edgy"" sense of humor, and I think he's always scored kinda low on the ""open to the unfamiliar"" scale, so when he got onto the social media bandwagon, he (as we all tend to do) started following similar types of people. Over time, his network grew into this bizarre, over-the-top, 4chan-esque cespool. I considered my dad a perfectly rational guy, and he usually has a pretty good nose for bullshit, but more and more I see him boil up with nothing but fear and contempt. He never takes his eyes off his Twitter feed, and it's become obvious what it's done to him. Now he goes on and on about Muslims and wacky ideas of globalist Jewish conspiracies and how Trump is so obviously the going to save us all from it and bring us into the new golden age. He's ready and willing to not only berate but seek out opportunities to berate anyone that disagrees with him, because he couldn't possibly be wrong about his conspiracy theories that I'm sure are heavily sourced with facts from his Twitter feed. 

It's just sad to watch. The internet has brought the worst parts of fear-mongering to the forefront, and people become addicted to their own growing paranoia. It's sad to watch people fall into insanity and lose themselves until all that's left is an agent to some shitty political machine. Maybe it's nothing new and I'm just now waking up to it, but it seems to me that politics has become indiscernible from religion.

I’m a female in my early 20s, an artsy and androgynous kinda type. My life doesn’t “suck” by any means, and I know there’s tons of people out there who have it way worse than I do— But shit, I just really fucking hate my life and am constantly stressed. I want to go to therapy, but I don’t have insurance and can’t really afford it (especially can’t justify dishing out money on therapy when I’m so fucking in debt). 

I owe SO MUCH fucking money, considering my age and the factor that I don’t even have student loans or anything like that. (Tbh I wish I had student loans, at least I’d be getting to go to college but that’s a whole different thing) I feel like I’m drowning in debt, with no foreseeable way out. My car is about to get repo’d and I’ll have no way to get around, or the money for a new one. After living on my own from age 18 to now, my current boyfriend and I had to move back to our hometown to live with his parents for a few months to “get back on our feet”, but we’re making even less money than we were where we lived previously so it’s not changing our situation at all (past me feeling miserable about losing the every sense of independence I have). 

I can’t see myself getting out of here anytime soon, or ever progressing further in my work life. I “don’t have any marketable skills” (direct quote from my father), or a college degree, and I’m just so secluded and weird that I never seem to connect with people enough to REALLY progress in any of my work environments. 

I’ve been depressed as shit for around 8 years, been smoking/vaping like a freight train for the past 6, struggling with a slight drinking problem for the past 3-4. I wanna drop the nicotine habit so bad, but I think part of it is a fidgety thing because I’m also a pretty intense nail biter.

 I’m always trying out new hobbies/activities but get pissed off when I’m not instantly great at them, even though I know that practice is key with everything I just want so badly to be good at SOMETHING so I get disheartened/distracted and drop things super quick.

My relationship isn’t “bad”, my boyfriend is a loving ray of sunshine but he never understands where I’m coming from if I try to talk out how I’m feeling or he gets too upset. To add to it, I also never have been much of a deep sharer. My brain is just constantly going and running through all kinds of crazy shit, and I don’t even know how to express myself to other humans IRL. 

I don’t have many friends, because I struggle so hard with connecting. I was fostering-to-adopt a dog awhile back and she made me so happy and I felt so good knowing I was needed to take care of her— But after a few months, she ended up being extremely unpredictably aggressive, and put one of my friends in the hospital and even bit my boyfriend who she snuggled with every day. I want to try again and maybe get a puppy for my mental health, but I know I can’t fucking do that because of my money situation and the factor that I’m about to be without a car too. 

I’ve never been able to see myself growing old, and never been one to fantasize about the future because I’ve just never been able to see myself even reaching 30. Shit, when I was a kid, I didn’t even think I’d make it to my twenties. 

All in all, I’m just really really fucking depressed and don’t know how to get away from it or how to get my life going in a good direction. Really any advice/encouraging words, sense camaraderie from anyone who feels the same lostness/lack of connection/etc would be helpful.",10Jun2018,3
60,"It is generally of robust, satisfying proportion, features subtle ribbing that provides sturdiness and enhanced sensation, has smooth, sliding skin which reduces friction and provides excellent mouthfeel, and is visually interesting with its many veins, skin folds, and a glans with a shape that suggests sleekness and a color that changes to demonstrate the intensity of lust.

However, it is certainly not the best. It is firmly in third place.

In first obviously comes the horse. I won't go into great detail on horse cocks, as they are already quite popular even with the non\-zoophilic general public. The size, the shape, and the power of the animal a horse cock is attached to are all part of a sexual mystique that has been well explored in many cultures throughout history.

There is one other kind of animal, however, that has us solidly beat, even though it has no such following. I speak of the spectacular, over\-the\-top sensuality of the amazing ""red rocket"" possessed by canines. We ignore this one, perhaps, because dogs are generally much closer to the majority of us than horses. There is no reason to romanticize the mundane, as we do for the equine penis, and we are often quite scared of our dogs' sexuality, since we do have to live with them instead of just looking at them in a field we're driving by. By acknowledging that it's at all there, we are forced to deal with it in a fashion other than having the vet remove it, and we are usually more worried about what that means for us than what it means for them.

Nonetheless, dog penises are wonderful, a fact which deserves to be recognized even if the vast majority of us will never experience one firsthand.

The first thing that anyone will notice about a dog's erection is the color. ""Florid"" is the best word I can think of to describe this beautiful display. From angry, fire engine red, through every possible shade of pink, with some extraordinary specimens additionally featuring deep purple and glistening white, an erect dog's penis rewards the viewer's eyes with the full spectrum of colors that our culture associates with the urgent desire of lust. As it comes out of its sheath, its palette seems to beg to return to a warm and cozy place inside the body of another.

Its form and functionality are similarly titillating. The pointed, very slightly flared tip allows for easy entry without being completely smooth, and while perhaps not as visually exciting as the glans of a human, certainly gets the job done comfortably and efficiently. The size when fully erect tends to be very impressive in proportion to its owner, often being much thicker and somewhat longer than the average human penis. However, most people aren't fully aware of that, because of another handy trick the canine dick can perform.

When the action begins, it's much smaller. Very thin, and a bit shorter. Once it's in, or played with sufficiently, it inflates to its full, throbbing size, allowing for the receptive partner to adjust more comfortably. No inflatable dildo I've ever seen has such a wide range of widths as does our best friends' tackle. They usually just seem to start at ""too big"" and get ""slightly bigger."" A dog's penis is much more friendly, allowing even the novice to enjoyably accommodate something really fat and juicy.

And juicy it certainly is! One of the best things about wolf wang is the precum. There is so much! And unlike ours, which merely drools when we get close to the end, theirs begins squirting almost constantly, nearly as soon as the fun begins. The result is a satisfyingly messy taste sensation that is truly without compare. On the other end, this also serves a practical purpose, contributing greatly to the fact that a dog penis is self\-lubricating, a trait I'm sure we've all wished we could share at some point.

Of course, no discussion of dog dicks would be complete without a mention of the crown jewel, the one thing that most strikingly sets them apart from us: the bulbus glandis. Ranging in size from a rather small plum to near that of a softball, the swollen base of a canine's cock is both an invitation and a challenge. Do you want to take the knot? Can you? Once you have, of course, there is the dizzying feeling of being dominated, not by your partner, but by your own desires. Trapped there on the floor for up to twenty minutes, one must simply wait and enjoy the feeling of being so consumed with lustful passion that the fear and shame of being caught seem immaterial. When you are tied, it is inescapable that a part of your identity is firmly outside of the mainstream's comfort zone. A piece of your soul is there, wrapped tightly around that dog's twitching, squirting dick just as surely as your pussy or ass is.

The thing that draws many to such interests is the fact that this is a perfectly symbolic microcosm for all of our sexuality. In our culture, even purely vanilla sex is often made to feel ""naughty."" The most banal and benign aspects of sexuality are couched in terms that make us feel a little wrong to want it, even in the strictly defined contexts where it's not supposed to be. In that moment when you accept the knot, and make yourself incapable of defense against whatever might occur should your door suddenly open, you have decided that you're not going to play that game anymore. The world may say you're a filthy slut; you're happy to be one, if that means enjoying yourself to the fullest with your most loyal companion.

Overall, it is simply a fact that your dog's dick is better than yours in nearly every way that matters. It's alright to feel a little jealous, but I think it would be nice if we as a culture could recognize this more openly, similarly to how we do for horses. Happiness in this strange and beautiful world in which we live lies in fully appreciating all of nature's marvels, and nature has certainly made the canine penis marvelous.",10Jun2018,0
