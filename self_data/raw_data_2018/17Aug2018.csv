0,"This is a very long post about my attachment to the relationship of Aang and Katara from Avatar: The Last Airbender. In the second half of the post, I talk about how recently rewatching the show has made me think about how my own life and reality holds up to the (real, but unattainable, as I see it) Avatar world.

**Adoration Since Early Days**

I have treasured the relationship between Aang and Katara from Avatar: The Last Airbender for a long, long time. And ""treasured"" is no exaggeration.

I watched the series for the first time over a series of long car rides with my family when I was in 5th grade or so (I’m in college now). I didn't think about the show a lot outside of those car trips, but as I started to see the relationship of Aang and Katara develop (from its state in season 1: the story of a worldly, free-spirited boy going on adventures with his crush, a determined girl with big hopes for the future and a desire to see the world herself) into an interaction of Aang's perspective of ""she comforts me, I want to protect her, I'm saving the world *for* her"" and Katara's perspective of ""he makes me laugh, I need to protect him, I care about him"" that develops in the second season and intensifies in the third season, I got drawn in. I *adored* the romantic moments between Aang and Katara (and I still do). When I watched them, I wanted them to last forever. And after watching the big kiss at the end, I was so, so happy for them. I would imagine them being together. But, as I said, this only at first happened on long car trips.

For a couple years, I didn’t really think about or watch Avatar. Then, some time in middle school, I rewatched the show. Again, when I watched, I treasured and reveled in the moments between Aang and Katara just as I had before.

**Quick Digression About Why Avatar: The Last Airbender is Amazing**

Of course, the rest of the show is amazing, too, or I wouldn’t keep watching it! I think it is necessary for the show to excel in exactly the ways that it does *for* Aang and Katara’s story to be so amazing. Let me digress for a little bit from my own story to answer the question, “how does the show excel”? I think the sense of adventure and freedom is very resonant, and emotional depth and quality of the characters is masterful. Bending is also just pretty frickin’ cool, let’s be honest. Ultimately, I think Avatar’s success comes from a hard to pin down sense of human authenticity that *makes* you want to continue thinking about the world of the show. But it’s not just quite an essence of “humanity” that is captured. There’s a little more to it. I think that the show actually could still be as amazing if the writers had never conceived of the “bending of the elements” concept. What the “bending” concept does lend to the show is the notion of a savior. If everyone in Avatar fought with swords, as long as Aang was still some prodigiously skilled prophetic savior, his actions would still be charged with the same mysticism and hope. His actions would still remain significant; they would still have a large impact on his reality. So: what Avatar has going for it is a distilled essence of humanity and a sense of the protagonist’s importance to the world. (Sorry, this has been a long digression, but I do refer to bits of it later.)

**Late Middle School and High School**

So, back to my story. After the last of my rewatches in middle school, I started wanting more. What happens after Sozin’s Comet (the last episode)? I wanted to see Aang and Katara’s relationship continue, most of all. I wanted to see them happy together. So for a while, I read a lot of fanfiction. Lots of Kataang fluff, and lots of “Book 4” type post-war fanfics. After a while, I just got tired of it, and so I stopped. I forgot about Avatar again for a long time, and didn’t rewatch again until the summer before 11th grade (I think). After enjoying the show again, I even wrote my *own* short Kataang fanfic. (It’s actually pretty good, I think, and I get chills when I read it back to myself today). And of course, the cycle keeps repeating. Watch the show, read some fanfics, forget about it.

**And It Still Is With Me :)**

Now, I’m in college. And while this is already a very long post, I’m starting to get to the main point. While I do have my breaks from the show, I eventually do come back to it, and I still *love* the show and I still ADORE Kataang. I have been thinking about Avatar: The Last Airbender in pretty much the same way *since fifth grade*. And I’m not saying this is a bad thing. I am really grateful for my attachment to ATLA. It’s something I value in my life, even if I take breaks from it. I’m proud that some of my strongest original feelings for this show, from way back in elementary school, have stuck with me, because that I’m not sure many other people can say that. There are specific moments in the show (not all romantic) that never fail to give me chills: like when, after being shot by Azula, Aang briefly wakes up from Katara’s healing, stares into her eyes, and smiles. I’m glad to have held onto some of my strongest feelings for the show, because that makes me unique, as cliché as that sounds.

Until two weeks ago, when, in my latest rewatch, I started getting to the part of the show where the romance between Aang and Katara starts to pick up, I haven’t really thought about Avatar for two years. As I said, the show’s involvement in my life really does wax and wane in cycles. A lot has changed for me in these past two years. I’ve started to think a lot about the way I think, and what I think about. To a large degree, this is motivated by my own fair share of involvement in romance and heartbreak in the past year. It’s made me think a lot about how I think about love, and how my thoughts about love have changed over time, which is what I’ve been taking forever to get to.

**How I Think About Love**

I think I've made it clear that I love Kataang. And I do. I *love* the way they love each other. Thinking about such a perfect couple will inevitably lead to some anguish, but recently, thinking about Kataang has given me more anguish than ever.

I used to believe in “true love”, or “perfect love.” I used to believe that everyone can attain what Aang and Katara have- that the people who don’t have it just haven’t been looking. I even maintained this belief throughout my first heartbreak in middle school. But starting a couple years ago or so, I unconsciously revised my view on “true love” so that it was something I felt was more attainable: I developed the view that, sure, there are lots of people out there I could probably have a great relationship with, but choosing a person and working your stuff out with that specific person is how “destiny” happens. After you make a commitment to a person- that is when that person becomes more than just one from many. Now, after my recent rewatch, I find this view wholly unsatisfying. I can’t get past the fact that *you choose* the one. What if they break up with you? Do you just pretend “Oh, I was kidding! It wasn’t *really* them, they weren’t *really* the one,” and then pretend the next one is “it”? In my own relationships, I haven’t entered with any unrealistic expectations or tried to project up my ideals about Kataang, or “the one” onto them (as I said, the involvement of Avatar in my life is cyclic). I find that when I get in a relationship, I just get caught up in it and believe in the relationship itself, if that makes sense (not that that’s healthy or anything, lol). My dissatisfaction for this more moderate, probably commonheld view on love has been replaced with something much more depressing:

In the Avatar world, Aang and Katara literally are perfect for each other. I can’t imagine either of them with anyone else (possibly I could see Katara “getting by” and being relatively happy with someone else, but not being as fulfilled as she is with Aang. And I definitely couldn’t imagine Aang with anyone else).

And yes, it’s true that the world they live in is fictional and fabricated, but, as I talked about before, the writers imbue the show with a sense of “human spirit” that makes me deeply believe that “perfect” *can* exist for humans in the abstract. So it *can* exist for people in the real world. But, how is this depressing? Well, it *can* exist for people. It’s *possible* for everyone, but that the circumstances of the world only rarely allow for even the existence of a “perfect” other in the world. So there’s one dice roll for the *existence* of a perfect other, and then there’s meeting them/finding them/making it happen, which is another dice roll. Furthermore, even if there is “a one” for me (there probably isn’t), me and them could never be like Aang and Katara because, while I try to be a good person, I’m not as pure hearted as either of them- they’re literally out there saving the world, but I’m not involved enough in opposing the crazy shit happening in my country. Even if I were, I’m not some mystical hero like Aang… I don’t have nearly as much influence over world events as he does. Also, neither of them compare their romantic lives to an “ideal romantic life” like I do. They don’t watch Avatar and adore a story- they live the story! I'm not saying that any relationship of mine needs to be like Aang and Katara's. I just know that if I want to participate in the kind of trust that Aang and Katara do, I'd have to tell my significant other about the kinds of stuff in this post. I think and overanalyze, so how can I possibly have a relationship where I share intimate parts of myself with someone else and not have them be creeped out?

**Ideas Are Real**

There is a bit of a bright side to all this. Earlier, in that one digression about “what makes Avatar so great,” I mentioned that Avatar is the kind of stuff you *want* to believe in. I’m of the opinion that any idea you have in your head is *a reality* of some sort. If something is thought of, it exists, in a sense.

I believe in a very literal interpretation of this quote from Dumbledore: “Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”

So I choose to believe in Avatar: The Last Airbender, any especially well written fanfics I find that seem like they could be canon, and my own headcanon.

If you read all of this, thank you.

I know a lot of the stuff I wrote sounds kind of psychotic and demented, but rest assured that I don’t dwell on this stuff all the time. I mean sure, my thoughts about Avatar are always at least dormant. But now, you’re catching me out my latest rewatch. Then again, I also don’t want to downplay what I wrote. I do think these things, it just doesn’t take me as long to think them in my head as it does to write them down.

**My Fanfic**

It's very short (probably shorter than this Reddit post), and I hope you enjoy it.

**Now what do you guys think? Have any of you experienced anything similar?**",17Aug2018,1
1," The last few hours has been a discussion and reflection on the different degrees and general pathologies of humanity. It's been a comparison of the kind of lives we lead, hope to lead, and lifelong pitfalls of thought and behavior people fall into. It's been a conversation that causes me a headache, and then a half hour goes by, and I start to feel a sense of overwhelming calm for both having got it out, and realizing again, that for all of the pathology and pain, the vast majority of it isn't mine.

One question me and Byron both asked ourselves was, “How did I get here?” Why, as people who can openly discuss bending people and exercising power, why aren't we just the most ridiculous and malicious and selfish people on the planet? Why doesn't he just invent some story to take kids away from objectively terrible people who just quite don't meet the criterion the State needs? Why don't I pull every lever of retaliatory power to bend addicts over my knee and punish them for their bullshit?

Or what about other realms of our lives? Why would I retreat into a mode of passive actor with regard to seeking sexual activity or adopt the modes and means of acquiring money I persistently regard as morally corrupt and naive? Aren't I a loose cannon who's too blunt and judgmental? Why not put on a million faces, like the perfect politician, and weave my way between the cracks of what look like gaping wounds in different groups and people I meet? Why don't I take every opportunity to squeeze all that I can from anyone, all the time, because I can, or because I can presumably make anything justified or simply lie about it?

What's demonstrated in that last paragraph is a kind of “mission creep” in the mind of someone who holds no regard for who I am or how I got there. The person who sees you as capable of having no high ground, in fact, doesn't have their own. The person who fears your questions and responds to inquiry with resentment, cedes the capacity for truth, therefore you are untruthful. The person who adopts the vagaries and accusations of a moment, abandons long-term goals and the responsibility of daily devotion, therefore you are devoid of inherent sanctity and forever non-specific no matter your language. The person with the most feeling, and the testimony of the mob, renders you emotionless, or incorrectly and not allowed to express your emotions, and so very, very alone. This is the tried and true method at the base of every rationalization. I know you are, but what am I?

I titled this blog The Devil His Due, because I always feel like that devil on people's shoulders. I can bring up the topic, or make the joke, or provide a suggestion, and then that suggestion lingers. You then proceed to spend your entire life avoiding the question, pretending you didn't laugh at the joke, or hold no sympathy for the suggestion as you physically fight back the tendency to agree. You'll marvel at the capacity to get in your head and stay there, while forgoing the exact tool you're perfectly capable of employing to find yourself in equal parts my head as I am yours. You could just try thinking.

When you start thinking, that's when you discover where you are or where you're going. The reason writing is thinking, is because you can't get each word without going over it first. No sentence is determined until the end. No “justifying” sentiment comes without the lines before and after it and hopefully paragraphs after those. How broken do you have to be to think that, of all people, I'm a liar, in a forthright manner? I can lie. We all can. We all do. But what do you understand, can you understand, are you ever willing or able to understand, why I don't want or need to? Can you recognize the difference between when you're lying and not? Because, remember, when you can't, I'm therefore reduced to the one who not only must be lying, but is doing so deliberately and maliciously. Not like you, no no, so innocent and on accident, but forever armed with the truth regardless.

This is a timeless pattern. This is why I need to take my potential judgments of people and angry feelings and lay them out. Why? Because I'm not actually filled with hatred. I have a brain that can provoke headaches and reacts with a level of anxiety I don't particularly care for, but I also have the contrast of my whole adult life with what I grew up with. I used to have several month long headaches from living under the general unresolved questions and stress of my domineering household. It was day and night to my mental health to be able to have a space I didn't regard as hostile and didn't cause me physical pain once I was able to leave.

Here we get to that painful irony of my being, and being that hot little devil on your shoulder and in your ear. My words cause pain. The ones meant to be painful cause pain. The one's that aren't, cause pain. The ones I regard as the “truest” or the best approximation of my feelings, those hurt the most and for the longest. I arrive at words today that have in some way been forming my entire life. That's truths that suck ass. That's descriptions of behaviors I'm not insanely proud of. That's motivations and misunderstandings I've let carry me through an ongoing mesh of complicated relationships, risks, and decisions. The only thing that has a prayer of making sense of it all is my individual sense of responsibility. I can't rely on your endorsement alone. I can't believe your words, let alone mine, as the absolute best and most reliable for all things at all times. I'm required to practice and reinforce unremitting doubt.

Doubt is not denial. Doubt is painful. Doubt needs to be rooted in something or you disassociate from all reality. Doubt that gets out of hand literally makes you insane, as anyone sacrificed to acid might attest. But doubt is also an effort and choice and exercise. Incidental doubt is fear. Fear is not what you need to practice, doubt is. Decrying the earth is flat is fear that you really are stupid as fuck and have no grasp of reality. Doubting the earth is flat is presenting information that can actually contend with all of the evidence otherwise. Healthy doubt is knowing there is no remaining argument and conceding the Earth is round, and moving on to doubt the next thing. In order to respect the example, one must imagine a child who's only as good as the information it's been presented. One should probably regard most people as children first and in a similar manner.

But then you get old. You don't have an excuse, barring mental deficiency. You need to start believing things for good reasons. You need to carry yourself and your words as if they have an impact. You need to build relationships on those kind of foundations as if your life depends on it. Because it does. Modernity helps mask this because the intellectual work has been done for us. You were born into clean water, you don't have a visceral memory of someone dying by drinking the wrong kind. You were born into a world where there is an organization that responds to emergencies, you don't have to adopt a whole host of self-preservation techniques or die. The world becomes a loose-knit game of interpretation, because no one's making it the right kind of painful. It's a pain either imposed, or one you can adopt in manageable pieces.

Pain itself then becomes pathologized. Instead of something that can be incidentally used incorrectly, it's wrong by default. “He made me uncomfortable!” The rallying cry of #metoo. Maybe you didn't know? Guys are insecure idiots with no idea too. They're uncomfortable. No guy, never, is going to carry the kind of vitriol for his being that is currently insisted upon without you exacerbating the problem. Guys respond to challenges with another challenge, or a breakdown. Broken men do crazy shit. And a physical or psychological challenging pissing match is not the way to improve the relationship between men and women.

So let's say I'm the devil. Let's run with the thesis that I'm as bad as it gets, cast out of God's kingdom. Relishing the souls he sends me after I've plagued them with sin and tempted them to sign away, for eternity no less, any right to their being for some fleeting delight. Okay, I accept. But the difference between me and you who might make that proposition, is that I don't give you the rest of my being or story. The last 3 sentences I typed before this immediately showed how quickly metaphors breakdown when you attempt to rationalize mythical beasts, so you get this instead, and we'll move on.

People blame me for expecting them to converse. Think about that. They think it's a “problem” that I should expect you to be honest in spite of the pain or difficulty of a conversation. They'll tell me to censor myself in descriptions of things I apparently did to someone, and am both remorseful and confused by the dialogue that surrounds it. They'll tell me you seem and ask what are you trying to say? Trying? Clearly, I'm trying to say literally everything I am. In fact, I'm saying it! I didn't try to tell you that, I did. Why isn't that enough? Why don't you know how to say, instead of try to say? I don't understand the question and I don't see the reason. Well, there was no real question, and the reason has to do with feeling something negatively about the words, not taking them in and recognizing what they say or responding to them.

This is why science feels like a threat to the faithful. They don't get it, they just know it doesn't feel good to think they're monkeys. This is why you can tell me what kind of person I seem like, but would never in a million years consider quoting me with something I actively chose to say. This is why you can get away with asking me questions that deserve an immediate answer and “taking responsibility” posture, but mine can go ignored. This is why relationships breakdown, and stay broken, because “you've changed” could never be, “I was never willing to listen to nor accept who you are.” You can't recognize the difference between an excuse and explanation. You don't have a concept of honesty. You don't have reasons, nor practice, how to be healthily skeptical or honest in your own life, therefore, no one is or can be. You justify, so they're unjustified.

I don't do that. I report to you your own words. I ask questions when I'm confused. I hold up your literal contradictions in thought next to each other because you've habituated not seeing them. That's painful, and you didn't ask for it. You only ask for it alone, in secret. You don't want to have an open public discussion because you know, not even deep down, that you haven't thought about it like you should. And if you did, you'd have to give the devil his due. He worked for your soul. He didn't recognize it as individually sovereign and held in the first place. The only reason you signed it away was because he was right.

My tone is so damming because I don't want a headache every day for months. My questions arise from the process, not because I thought, “This is going to be the best thing to fuck up your day.” It's a question because I don't know the answer. It's a question because presumably you don't know either, but you're acting like you do. Unlike you, I don't know how to resolve questions that go ignored. I don't know how to function even remotely healthily or orient myself in the sea of douche-bags unless I figure out my voice and behavior that isn't under constant assault to be molded by every pathology. I want to say something like, “Of course I'm a murderer, and rapist, and thief, and have anger issues, and would lie to save my ass, and on and on and on,” because that's true independent of everything, of everyone, about everyone. The rule is fuck, have kids, and die. That rule doesn't care about laws, or civility, or “civilization,” or the dreamiest love story or the most hopeful statistic.

You know how many of my well-meaning “intelligent” friends with their wedding pictures and good enough jobs and goals have had kids? NONE. You know how many children exist between the families I supervise for their neglect and abuses daily? No less than 2 each. There is no case to be made that we are anything but the hastily and mindlessly collected sum of our more often than not fuck-ups and animal instincts held together by some ingenious mental fuckery and self-delusion that pragmatically functions as preservation. That doesn't mean it doesn't need to get vastly better. That doesn't mean bad behavior is justified, or even inevitable, but it does mean you have a LONG long way to go on the road to “better,” if you can't even have the conversation or recognize more than one feeling-laden reason behind how someone or something functions in the world.

If you don't seek the failure point, you are the failure point. That's the new means of evolution. Active adapting to the new information. I was a lovesick child in high school. I learned the biology behind it, and said “open-relationship.” I learned the logic and utility of “enforced monogamy” and found the room to cut out “general monogamy” or my feelings as they pertain to sex verses trusting someone with my thoughts and intentions. I disavow language without the underlying ethic and without dismissing the effect of “love.” I eschew marriage with the capacity to respect and feel good for people who find ways to make it work for them. I concede there are problems and gray areas related to boys and girls and how they fuck, especially drunk, without condemning men and masculinity, nor denying someone their perception or story of feeling unsafe or violated. I don't give a fuck about the outdoors and will still look at your pictures and climb the mountain with you. I can have a point of view; I can have a well-researched and extremely thoughtful and painful point of view, and I can still wish endlessly, until the day I die, that you will fight it and change it and give me better reasons than the ones I discover while writing.

But I do the work. I take the risk. I face my behavior. I want the feedback because I use it to change. You don't, so you don't provide feedback, face your behavior, take risks or work, therefore, that must not be what I'm doing or capable of. I don't feel I understand your behavior, I'm turning you into a blog so you can be dismissed. A blog isn't an honest exploration and coping mechanism, I justify justify justify and preach preach preach and never find a way not to be “negative.” You see, I didn't think these thoughts, or spend a few hours on persistently aggravating ideas, I'm attacking you. Because if you were to write about me, or the negative influences in your life, you'd be attacking, lashing, because you're on the defensive. No one taught you the difference between explore and defend, pick apart and attack, doubt and afraid, honest and “truly feeling,” so it all just feels like a whir of incoherent ranting.

News flash, it's because that's what you sound like. We all do, but some of us are actually trying not to. Some of us invite the devil in to talk, because he can't make us sign away our soul. I'll never feel bad when I'm telling you that's precisely what you're doing. I'll feel pity. I'll feel hopeless. But I'll feel those things for you, not about me. Isn't that what we should be doing with feelings? Feeling for people, not about them? Shouldn't we be conjuring, or de-escalating, what we should feel? Aren't feelings impressively wrong, most of the time, so they should be as deliberate as we can craft them? Shouldn't they inform instead of dictate? Are you only hearing this as me advocating for abolishing all feelings? Are you even willing or capable of conceiving of me as having feelings that are well-earned and combated with? You certainly don't act like it unless they can be reduced to a reason to fight. You certainly don't include them in your “good-natured” tear downs of my intentions or awareness.

Ultimately, I get to know and behave like I don't hate you, in spite of all the good reasons to do so, because I don't hate you. You're disappointing, daily. You're bigger and whiter shells than I'll ever be. You'll keep reminding me of people who live at the logical extremes of your behavior that I'm paid to exploit. And I'll keep writing, and trying, and inviting, and claiming not to be a proper martyr as I die a little each day inside in service to my “naive idealism” that merely keeps me oriented towards trying to do better, do more, and finish the work. It hurts less than looking for your soul.",17Aug2018,4
2,"The room he is in is cold and rotted away are the wood boards that are warped twisted and cracked. The paint in this room is a dull light blue tint that now looks like a faded white. There is a small table and a faded green cot in the corner of this room. There is only one window in this room and it faces east, facing the gloomy grey skies with black clouds almost. The trees are dead, long been dead and in rows one after the other touching branch to branch a sadness that looms forever frozen their expressions.

He stares out the window with sadness and reflections of what he used to see, but there is no color in the sky or any color left at all. The grey like a blanket over a bed covers everything. The small table in the room is only big enough for 2 but on it is the rifle and 2 bullets he has left. He looks away from the window to look at the rifle, he walks over to it and grabs it and walks to his cot.  In that moment he takes out a picture of his wife, sobbing as the cold wind swims through the cracks of the walls. She is beautiful with brown hair and brown eyes, and a smile that will always love him. He clutches his last photo of her and with the other hand he clutches the rifle.

6,"Long, so please bear with me: 

I just joined because I can be anonymous here, and I could REALLY use some advice. 

I have always had low self-esteem due to being bullied all my life. This has seriously affected me as an adult to the point that I truly feel I'm ugly and worthless.

I am now 36. I got married at 19 to an amazing 22 year-old guy who almost 100% of the time made me feel so special and amazing, although he did occasionally get more than a little angry with me, though never violent. We had our first child, a daughter, when I was 22. Everything was good until we moved in with his parents, who, by the way, pretty much hated me because I'm of a different race. We separated when I was about 6 months pregnant, and I found out it was twins shortly after. Our twins were born a few weeks after our daughter turned 2. A boy and a girl. We knew our son was going to be born with birth defects, and were fine with it. He passed away at 5 weeks old. 10 years ago, my husband was in a serious work accident that almost killed him. We were again separated at the time, but got back together shortly after. We split up and got back together a few more times, and our youngest child, who was definitely a surprise, will be 8 this month. We split up again in 2014 with plans to get back together in 2015, but he had a massive stroke and had to re-learn to walk and talk. Once again, we were going to get back together for good but his mom, who has been a thorn in my side since day one, is too much for me and I can't do it. My kids currently live with their dad and grandparents and I haven't seen them since last November. 

Here's my dilemma. 

I got a job (finally!) 2 1/2 years ago. About 3 months or so into the new job, a co-worker started to show interest in me. I was staying with a male friend and didn't really reciprocate the same feelings right away. A month or so later, we started hanging out after work and on weekends, and officially started dating a couple months after that. Here's the thing. He's older than me, like around 25 years older.....I'm fine with it. He's a different race. Again, I'm fine with that. His divorce was finalized about 4 months after we started dating, and HE STILLS LIVES IN THE HOUSE THAT HIS EX-WIFE AND DAUGHTER LIVE IN, though he stays in his son's room while he's away at college. I have asked him why he's still living there and according to him it's basically because his ex lets him live there for free as long as he does work around the house. I have told him that I'd like for us to get a place together and am willing to move wherever he wants to go. 

I feel like he is always choosing her over me. We have been together for over a year. He has flaked on me quite a few times on our ""date days"", and he used to give me flowers and tell me he loved me, as well as tell me he thought I was hot or cute or sexy or whatever, but now he barely treats me like a girlfriend, doesn't touch me other than when we're being intimate, doesn't compliment me or tell me he loves me, didn't acknowledge my birthday, no longer gives me flowers or presents, and gets EXTREMELY angry if I even MENTION his ex, and I don't even say anything insulting about her.  I have told him how I feel and how I would like for him to act like a better boyfriend and  treat me the way I deserve to be treated. 

How can you love someone who doesn't love you back? It's heartbreaking. What can I do? I don't want to break up. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you. ",17Aug2018,2

So I’m 22 almost 23, I have a good job in the mortgage industry. I actually just got a promotion and should be making around six figures, I get tons of praise from work and from friends and family. I have a pretty big family it seems like I can get lost in it sometimes honestly. I also have a girlfriend thats very supportive and loving and her family is great too they all love me as well. Thats the thing though I get a lot of love and support, I just don’t get any from myself. I always feel self conscious of myself I always doubt myself and I always feel like I just don’t belong here. I feel that even though a lot of people are here for me that if I were to just disappear tomorrow nobody would care, its kind of like that happy on the outside but dead on the inside kind of thing where Im always just upset with myself and sometimes purely hate being me. I just don’t understand why, I cant think of anything from when I was a child til now that would make me feel this way, but I just do. Idk maybe I just needed to get it off my chest and realize how dumb this sounds, I don’t really talk to anyone about my feelings, quite the opposite all my social interactions I’m always the goofy one making jokes and making sure everyones having a good time, when on the inside at the end of the day I always end up just feeling really shitty.

I have some friends who are a bit older than me (4-8 years older) that I know through a weekly thing I do. And they just are the best, and I can't tell if I like them or I *like* them and that's as specific as I'll be.

I'm going out more, I have a better job, I'm finally cleaning my room regularly, I got a car, I found love, I've scheduled more road trips, I bought new shoes, I'm making music, etc etc etc!!! Fuck!

Someone told me that before I can be happy with someone, I needed to be happy with myself. And now, I'm finally there. I'm content with who I am, I've got my issues and imperfections, but I am happy with who I am as a person.

We exchanged numbers and eventually went on a date. It went very well and he actually kissed me! I hadn't been kissed in years, it was amazing. We went on another date, and have plans for tomorrow, too! I'm so excited, I just felt the need to tell someone since I can't really talk to my ex about it.

25,"I was a total skeptic, having used ""Advantage II"" by Bayer for years, and obviously it works, but it definitely ""sickens"" them a little bit, because its mode of action is very aggressive. If your cat or dogs licks the Advantage treatment directly it puts them into harms way, and the advantage has been known to cause skin burns. Also Serresto collar for dogs works but only after a while and after the flea is on your dog. 

I discovered that rubbing coconut oil directly onto your cat or dog will not only instantly kill all fleas, but that as your cat or dog licks off the oil which is completely 100% safe, the oil goes into their bloodstream and their ""smell"" tbecomes absolutely awful to fleas and ticks and fleas and ticks want NOTHING to do with your pet, meanwhile they are odorless to you. Additionally the coconut Oil will **absorb into your pets fur and skin** and it will not leave streaking on your furniture or anything horrible that you might think. 

The best thing you can do for your cat or dog during flea season is Coconut Oil. Take it from a skeptic who was using Bayer advantage 2 for years. This WORKS. (Cold pressed, unrefined!) (do not get fractioned oil - coconut oil's method of action is lauric acid which is removed in fractioned oil)

But I need to learn how to be able to code to do that but I tried learning and why is it so _boring_ and unrelated, I've tried just driving in learning what I need to get by but I know _pracrically nadah_ to even make any progress so a foundation is a must

28,"Back in high school, my grandmother convinced me to get a joint bank account with her. 
So, I did-- BIGGEST FUCKING MISTAKE OF MY LIFE!!!

Everything was going fine, until I started to get letters in the mail, saying that my account has been overdrawn. 

My grandmother, basically left the account with a dollar and some change, and her automatic insurance payments were still being made, which led to the account with a negative balance. 

She knew about it, but didn't do anything. 

I got a final letter in the mail, warning me that if the overdrawn fees weren't paid off by such and such date, that the account would be closed and I'd get an ""unsatisfactory"" on my bank history, and that it could affect opening accounts with other banks. 


I told her about it again(she was getting letters too) and she said she would take care of it. 


The day came when it was do or die. She still didn't so shit, even though she said she was. I was going to pay it off, but my mom told me not too, and now I am regretting ever listening to her. 

I am 21 now, and I would like to open up my own account and eventually start building up my credit. 

I was doing a little bit research online, and came across an article talking about  chexsystems and banking accounts. I then looked more into chexsystems and now I am terrified.

Tomorrow(well, today) I was going to contact the bank to see if I can pay off the dept and get the ""unsatisfactory"" removed from my history, but after looking at what was said about the chexsystem-- it appears, even if I do pay off what is owed, the fact that my account was overdrawn and closed will remain on my chexsystem report for five years. I am afraid that it will hurt my chances of being eligible for a credit card(to build up my credit) or opening a saving/checking account with other banks. 


I was wondering how fucked am I?
Do you think banks will be willing to take a chance with me after looking at my banking history? 
Will I still be able to build up my credit score?
Or would I have to wait five years?

We are looking for people who are willing to complete a [short 10 minute online questionnaire ](https://preparednessforemploymentscale.com?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=pes-pd+-+aug+2018)about readiness for employment. It's designed for people with personality disorders, however anyone can complete it, as we are just trying to find out whether we are asking the right questions at the moment! In other words, people with and without mental health difficulties can take part. We hope the questionnaire will be able to highlight areas of employment support for the person in returning to work.

For everyone who takes part, the study will donate £1 on their behalf to their choice of three mental health charities(Young Minds: Child &amp; Adolescent Mental Health, Mental Health Foundation, or Rethink). So far we have had 370 people complete it, which means we have raised £370! We are hoping to raise over £1000 to mental health charities :)

If you are interested, [please click here](https://preparednessforemploymentscale.com?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=pes-pd+-+aug+2018) to find out more about the study and to complete the questionnaire!

42,"To start of this wasn't today but in fact yesterday so it's relatively new on my mind and names will be changes slightly. At some points I may have referred to Willy as Killum and John as Jinn.

It began with my friend (Willy, 18) getting his girlfriend's (Kim, 17) friend (Elsa, 17) to begin texting with me and everything was looking fine as we were due to meet a couple of days after Sailsa and I began speaking but with the added addition of another friend (John,17). So the days went past and eventually we got to the point of travelling from Lasgow To Sellshill to meet up with Elsa,Kim and the added addition of Lowlie(she was there the whole time but unimportant to the story to keep mentioning). So we got there and I admit I was rather shy and never even noticed the Elsa was there waiting at the bus stop when we arrived as I just walked past without saying anything to this girl I've been speaking to and sat with John at the opposite side of the wall with John. I never attempted to speak to Elsa and let them walk ahead with me and John followed behind which was probably the start of my many ""mistakes"".

We ventured to a park while behind Willy, Elsa, John while still staying behind as we were new to this area. We arrived at the park and me and John mostly did our own thing but I'd get the occasional ""Edem, do you want to speak to Elsa"" or Willy giving me a look to begin conversation but I was in the belief that she never wanted to speak or she'd initiate a conversation. While at the park me and Elsa would occasionally run into each other like me and John went on a swing with John in the middle and I on the left side with Elsa eventually joining us at the opposite side from me (near John). We decided we'd go to a different area and play Basketball and we continued another walk with John and I at the back. We arrived at this school and went into play Basketball but I mostly sat around watching from the sideline while John and Willy were playing while the girls were sitting in the middle. After a while I was looking opposite of the court then out of nowhere Elsa came up and hugged me from behind and I just stood there awkwardly as I didn't know what to do but then Willy told me to turn around and hug her back but It took me a while to do that and when I did so it was rather awkward for me since we've been lucky to have a full sentence out of each other so far.

We began walking to Kim' house and Kim said that Elsa feels cold and needed one of our jumpers and I took that personally as a joke as it felt a bit too cliched to be after my jumper and just continued to walk with John. Suddenly me and John got the greatest idea to switch Jumpers and glasses as a joke taking the piss out of ourselves but this seemed to irritate Elsa which was later brought to me by Willy. Elsa had to leave had to go home after that while the rest of us arrived at Kim'. I'll spare out the details of waiting inside shelter until the rain stopped and going to Mcdonalds. Eventually we arrived at the first park which was located near Elsa' house and they went to try and get her out even though she wasn't allowed to go back out and they asked me to go there and apolligise for my mishaps of not giving her my jumper, not hugging her back straight away and lastly not talking to her even though I thought it was obvious she wasn't interested in me. So I agreed then instantly changed my mind as i never wanted to show up to her house when I've just met her and never wanted any drama infront of everyone so me and John layed on the swing for half an hour just uttering useless stuff and joking about. Eventually everyone arrived (Including Elsa) but I never wanted to say anything as I never new the position I was in and just stood at the top of a climbing frame talking to John and getting the occasional why are you being so awkward from Kim and potentially Elsa but I never knew how to reply.

We began to walk to yet another park with all our hands interlinked and hopping along with Killum connected to Kim, Kim to Elsa, Elsa to John and John to myself. We did this our whole way to the park and eventually arrived. It began raining but and everyone went to a giant swing similar to earlier but John and myself decided to go onto a zipline but while we walked across the park to it and whilst jumping a fence Elsa called us awkward. John and I got to the zipline and began taking turns until I had the wonderful idea that both us should try and fit on this tiny thing at once. So we both climbed to the platform and John sat on the zipline while I tried to jump on him from infront to begin our descent but I never quite made it and my legs trailed the whole time but somehow managed to stay on while while everyone else was laughing. We attempted it again but successfully and then the jumper instance popped up and I decided that I'll do it this time as she must be serious and took off Johns jumper and gave John my wallet while I held my phone. So I went along and gave Elsa the jumper but didn't have a clue what to say after she said thanks so now only in my top in the rain and freezing I went over to John again for our Zipline session. We went back to the main park and I got in this spinning bowl while john pushed me and was told to put my legs in by Elsa which increased the speed tenfold and I eventually climbed out sumbling and john tried to catch me but it was too late as I already fell. Everyone was laughing and soon began the beginning of the end. John had a message from one of Kim' friends who he previously spoke to but stopped as ""I'm not looking for a relationship at the moment"" which in turn meant I want to go the the gym, do well in my Cyber Security course(Copied me in that) and play games. The message said ""Pull?x"" and proceeded to burst out laughing. We got to the point that the girls figured out and Elsa managed to snatch John' phone and began running around the park with it until eventually putting it down her bra so John couldn't get it. John came up with the wonderful idea to exchange my wallet what was still in my hoodie which he was wearing for his phone and then Elsa proceeded to run away with it only to eventually put it down her bra. Chasing consisted for at least 10 minutes or so as I needed my wallet to get back home. Eventually she had the wondrous idea of me searching for it but I wasn't comfortable ""searching"" someone I had just met that day. This continued until we arrived at the bus stop to go home and the girls joined us. It consisted of jokes about who has it and her shaking it about in her bra until eventually she began running away again. i caught up and she told me to get it and we waited there for a minuted or two until I eventually pinched my wallet out. We walked back to the bus stop and the girls left. Willy and John told me not to get mad but apparently Elsa likes John and then it proceeded to be quiet until we got on the bus and I started making jokes about it. The bus stopped far from mines but I decided to walk home alone and reminisce about the great yet weird day I had.

Honestly I don't have a clue what to think about yesterday and from my point of view since the beginning speaking to Elsa must have been a joke from them to start with but overall it was a fun and shocking day.",17Aug2018,1

He said he was a methadone user, former heroin addict, and the doctor gave him something called naloxone.

Eventually when I was called in to see the doctor I heard a shattering noise.  Ran out to the waiting area to see an expensive elephant decoration shattered across the floor as this guy is continuing to thrash around screaming.  A minute or two later the doc, receptionist, and a few other waiting patients moved him to the front door (small office) where he was apparently banging his head on the bench.

My girlfriend was coming to pick me up and saw the paramedics and police checking him out.  She told me that's classic opioid withdrawal.

Wow.  I have never seen a grown man in so much pain, being that vulnerable.  He seemed like he didn't want to hurt anyone but was having a freakout.  I have never had that personal of an experience of what opioids can do.  :/

Honestly I legitimately feel for the guy.  Said he didn't know how he got there, was begging for an ambulance.",17Aug2018,13
46,"# Your mind is a fortress. It is only as strong as it is understood.

You are the product of your past experiences. Every event in your life has led up to this moment. More recent events lie accessible in your conscious mind. This could be what you ate for breakfast, the events of a TV show, or the words from the previous sentence. Beneath your conscious mind, therein lies a subconscious mind. Your subconscious mind is where all your life experiences collect and define who you are today.

Some experiences are more impacting than others. For instance, you are more likely to be affected for a prolonged period of time by the passing of a family member than you are by the time you spilled milk on your pants. The experience of death has more weight on the subconscious. Now, collect all the weighted experiences in your life and you have who you are today.

If you are deeply affected by a negative experience in your life, you must not ignore it! You must face the pain head on. The pain you feel is your mind's reaction to what it believes to be danger. You must neutralize the experience by learning how to avoid it all together. The mind cannot be at peace until it knows how to avoid the pain in the future. If you do not face your pains, they will take a toll on you. In compensation of the pain, the mind’s chemistry changes, potentially leaving a lasting physical distortion of its structure.

You can conquer these pains through introspection. This is the process of looking inward, and analyzing how and why you are who you are. I believe introspection is best done through writing. The writing process provokes articulate contemplation of your thoughts. When you write, you analyze each component of a situation, better helping you understand what truly matters.

That being said, I believe the best form of writing is question driven. In posing yourself a question, you do not necessarily have an answer. You are challenged to analyze your thoughts and to uncover the truth behind the motivation of your actions.

After speaking with a handful of community members, I have found that many of us have mutual sufferings. As such, I have thought long and hard about questions to summon your inner demons, giving you a chance to face them head on. Below you will find 9 questions that are designed to guide you toward successful written introspection.

These questions are best answered without any distractions. **Allocate sacrosanct time for answering them**. These questions should not all be answered in one sitting. Instead, answer one question a day. By leaving the questions to simmer in your mind, you will have time to ponder the truth of your situation. For this reason, sleeping on the question is of great importance. This will allow you to write your response in greater detail. The more detail you write, the more you will gain from this exercise.

From performing this exercise, myself, I have found there to be 6 benefits if done properly:

1. Escape from burdens of the past
2. Understand who I am
3. Understand how my life has defined who I currently am
4. Understand what I want from in life so I can plan the future
5. Become healthier both physically and mentally
6. Improved relationships with family and friends

Collectively, as a community, our experiences are near infinite. As such, you may find there to be more benefits than those that I found.

As you write, do not merely think. You want to have images reel in your mind. Visualize your responses. For instance, question #2 asks you “*Who do I want to be?*”. As you respond, visualize the type of person you want to become. Imagine this person’s appearance and, from a third-person perspective, watching this person interact with the world.

For each of these questions, answer the *why*. For instance, the first question: ‘*Who am I?*’ Answer the question then explain *why* this is your answer. Use the sub-questions to guide your response.

I have prepared a question response template for you. You can find it [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/pp4vws8bd1nm8m3/Question+Response+Template.docx).

# 1. Who am I?

**Motivation: Before you can change yourself, you must first know who you are.**

1. Am I afraid to be *me*?
2. Am I an *actor* in social interactions?
3. Is something holding me back? If so, what?
4. Do I feel inadequate?

# 6. Is part of me stuck in the past?

**Motivation: If you had a bad experience in the past, your mind cannot be at peace until you understand how to prevent that experience from happening again.**

1. Is this experience more than a year and a half old? *(If so, part of you is stuck in the past!)*
2. Have I forgiven myself for past mistakes?
3. Have I forgiven others for their past mistakes against me? *(Remember: Forgiveness helps the forgiver to move on.)*
4. What can I learn from this experience?
5. What steps can I take to live in the present moment?

# 7. What are my 3 biggest failures?

**Motivation: Failure is a prime source of growth. You must understand how you failed so you grow to not fail again.**

1. Am I afraid of the future?
2. Am I afraid of failure?
3. Am I afraid of success?
4. Do I run from my fears?
5. What am I afraid of?
6. What steps must I take to overcome my fears?

# 9. How do I want to be remembered?

2. Do I live everyday as if it were my last?
3. How will I be remembered if I died today?

**Never stop asking why.**

51,"Let me preface this by saying I'm usually a happy guy. I'd like to say I have good outlooks on life, I seek help when needed, and help others when I can. But these last 2 months... damn. I broke my leg, and I mean BROKE it, 2 months ago had surgery. Recovery has and continues to be slow. About a month ago my step dad died of cancer after a long 2 year battle. I miss him terribly. 5 days after his death my fiancée fell down the stairs while sleep walking, resulting in multiple broken bones and a pretty gnarly concussion. The event scared the hell out of me, but she is ok.

All in all things are looking up, but now I've returned to work after being on medical leave. I work at an insurance agency calling on clients to try and sell them more policies, I.e. If they just have car insurance, try to sell them home as well. It's uninspiring to say the least. 

I try to keep a mentality of ""things could be worse"" and ""you are not your job"" and ""darkness before the dawn"" but damn. I have suffered from PTSD my whole life due to childhood trauma and I am familiar with what's going on... it feels like my soul is receding. My fiancée has been a wreck too, the concussion has her emotions all over the place. I have a hard time seeking comfort from her when she needs me right now. 

Furthermore my mother is having a hard time, obviously. My sisters alcoholism has really gotten bad, I worry she will kill herself. I broke my leg on one of our two vacations, and our second vacation we had to cancel. Something has got to give. Something has got to change. But I feel like I'm stuck in an endless roundabout with no exit. I'm staring at my work screen right now wishing I was anywhere but here.

55,"Firstly I'd like to say, i just stumbled into here by a complete accident but... Around this time, I feel like... It was a good moment to. 

Secondly, the title. I... really don't know.

And Thirdly, I don't really... know where to put my words, what subreddit, what place to look what place ... to do anything. 

I've been a long-time lurker, and just... sort of finally tried to step a bit further in. If that makes sense, anyways. I'll start moving this along, sorry about that.

In truth, I don't know what I'm going through. But I do know that I'm... hurting. It's not a physical pain, but it does hurt my heart. I don't mean to sound dramatic but it's that kind of emotion and sort of mental connection with things that I always seem to get and I can feel it straining, bleeding. As it were. 

Sorry, I'm just... sort of.. writing as things come. I've been having a few rough days as of late and sorta just.. keeps piling up. I'm sorry. I'll get to the gist of it, stop rambling.

Sorry

\--

As I said, I in truth don't know what's going on with me. As of late, things have been, at least to me, difficult. A lot of the people I've spoken to, that I consider my friends have all been having me feel... Unimportant. Ignored. I guess.  A lot of the things I'll say will go unnoticed or just not responded to, but someone else could say the same thing and get a conversation out of it. People always want to do things when it doesn't include me, or just, I'm just.. plainly.. never included into anything. No one really wants me to join. 

For a month or two now, I've been trying to get into the swing of my new job. It's a pretty okay foot-in-the-door kind of gig, a nice... breath of life into me considering I needed it to start finally paying off my student loans. Only drawback was, it's a 10 hour overnight shift. So I've been trying to really get into the swing of that, to really... figure how things work and at the same time, try and cast my attention to this group of friends but... It seems that I've... been benched, or just.. sidelined as a person to them.

I write, for a roleplay character. I would like to think she's a likable kind of lot I've set up. People say they like her, they try to interact with her, and things and maybe for a few single instances, things happen, but then... they're overtaken by someone else's ""new thing!™ "" and whatever I've had is... just gone. Like the thing didn't even matter to them in the slightest. That whole joke 'meme' of ""Friendship over with X, new best friend is Y"" kind of deal... Just another instance of like, from view the connection i've had with people completely just... tossed. 

Whether it be, writing characters for roleplay or even just simple conversation. I'm not really... ""connected"". No one really talks to me. And it was something I put away for a bit because my friend, or rather, the closest to me now tried to disprove that, and for a little bit I believed them. I really did. But then it came back. Came back by the meaning of just... I stopped believing it. I kept feeling like I was ignored again and again and it just sort of... kept breaking me. I don't know, is that something to understand?  
Guess another bit of insight, I'm... a 'leader' in a community, leader in quotations. I'm an admin, and just... I try to be as approachable as they come, friendly, active, cheerful, but just... I'm very much forgotten in things. At least, that's what it seems to me. Enough to the point where I sometimes feel like I'm always on the back foot, brushed aside to be dealt with later, no one wants to try and... simply just... Hang out. 

And while... one could say, there's people trying to talk to me, there are, but, they... don't give me room for much... if... anything. One-liner conversations, rhetorics masked as threads... that sort of thing. 

Everyone, to me, seem like they've put some distance between them and Me, and... I don't know why. I've never figured, and... to be truthful, it's the most hurt I've ever felt. Hell, even my own... SO.. is distant to me as of late, We're an LDR so there's a joke to be had. Cruel... I- ... there's nothing I can do about it. They've stated that, as a fact.

Sorry about the words.

I help lead a loving community that's been full of smiles, laughs and have truly been supportive to others. But even as that exists... So close and yet... so far. I've never felt so alone. 

Anyway, sorry about that. I didn't really mean to be dramatic in any of this... at all. ",17Aug2018,1
57,"I am in my 30s and for the last few years I have not enjoyed celebrating my birthday. It just feels like a reminder that I am getting older, there is no joy in it for me. When I get a birthday card it just makes me feel sad. 

I have told my family that I don't want to celebrate my birthday anymore because it makes me sad, but they ignore my request. I now dread my birthday and try to spend it away from my family, turn off my phone, etc so that I don't feel that way.

All I want is to not be made to feel sad on my birthday.

- Become a PhD student.

- run 7 5Ks, 3 10k, 4 half marathons. All with mile times in the low 9minute range and 5Ks in the 8 min range.

- Do a proper overhead squat in CrossFit

- I wouldn’t have recovered from Binge Eating Disorder (3 months no binge)

- Found Love &amp; Heartbreak

- Made one of the best friends ever

- Discovered I can sing.

- Shared my cooking skills

- Faced my fear and do standup.

- Be okay with being a work in progress.

My boyfriend is going to uni kinda far away and is paying for tuition, rent, etc. all on his own.

Does anyone have any experience sending/receiving packages for (actual) poor college students? Forgot to mention his school is in a different country (same continent thankfully) so there are probably some limitations to what I can send (like a gas card).

**The ideas I have so far** are tissues, coffee, travel mug/flask, healthy trail mix, ""cheap and healthy"" cookbook I already own, pomodoro timer for studying, ""healthy"" candy (think Whole Foods), and notebook/pens. Of course I will also send personal things like letters, pictures, etc.

63,"I was born into a comfortable upper-middle class Brazilian family. My parents were immigrants, and I'm first generation American. My life was full of potential. 

In the late 90's, my father died and left my mother and I with nothing but a mortgage. My mother lost our home, and our car to repossession/foreclosure. I, then, grew up in poverty. 

My mother also had a nonsensical parenting philosophy. I had full autonomy of myself since birth. I ate what I wanted, slept when I wanted, went to school when I wanted and because of this parenting philosophy, did hard drugs and was exposed to sex and sexual assault at as young as 12. I dropped out of highschool, but went on to almost graduate with an associate's in Mathematics. But I didn't graduate. I did, however, cultivate a powerful love for math.

I've grown a lot, been through a lot, and accepted responsibility for a lot. And through all of this, I've been living paycheck to paycheck, working at low wage restaurant jobs... the only kind of employment I was qualified to do. I did wind up working my way up to management positions after about a decade of restaurant hopping. But, I'm low level management and still being paid well under $13.00/hr.

Well, about a month ago, I began to look for a second low-wage restaurant job, to try and make more money so I can meet my goals. While searching, I stumbled upon an Assistant Director position at a math based learning center. I submitted my application, turned to my partner and said 'I will cry tears of joy for three days straight if I get this job.'

65,"Long story short, this friend has always been on the struggle side of life. Has not had stable employment in a decade probably, dropped out or was kicked out of every school past high school, was a piece of shit and verbally abusive in a relationship with a mutual friend, and stole product from two friends running their own business, because he felt justified in doing so. I wrote off this stuff as ""hey nobody is perfect."" We've lived in different states for a few years now so the separation sort of made it easy to overlook certain things.

Basically every time we spoke for the last year or so, it's been him complaining about his life, and essentially my role as friend would be to attempt to pull him out of his darkness and try and remind him of what he's got in his life. Needless to say that sort of friendship is exhausting. 

Today though, he started saying some vile, racist shit (white culture is superior, if black people took over the country everything would be shit, if you don't believe me go ride your bike through the ghetto, etc.) I basically tried to angle the conversation in a way that he could see how racist he was being, and he basically said ""if this is racist then so be it."" I draw the line at this sort of thing, none of my friends are racist in any way. 

Of course you don't want to ride your bike or have your car break down in a crime ridden area...but I've spent plenty of time in places like NC or WV where you don't want to be caught with your pants down in predominantly white areas either, and to me, yeah if you are in a high crime area you don't want to have a flat tire! The fact that they are black or white or latino shouldn't matter at all. And of course he said a bunch of shit about Africa and how ""Africans"" need to ""get their shit together.""

A couple of days later a different tech shows up and takes the TV apart only to realize the wrong part was sent. Fuck, okay whatever this is really frustrating. He says he'll be back in a few days and I tell him that's no good I'm going on vacation and I ask if they can just take the TV for repair on bring it back when I get back, he says that's not possible but he can come the day after we get back, excellent I think. That was today. He called me a couple of hours ago to say they lost the part and that it will be a few more days. Like I have a life and job, by the time to TV is actually fixed, if this part is in fact the problem, it will have been over a month.

70,"In many ways I've been in the process of shedding my previous skin, the skin of generations past.   


That skin taught me to think of and treat women differently. The word ""lesser"" was never used, but it was implied in so many different and subtle ways that it was all but regarded in my mind as a ""fact of the world"". Something to take for granted and not to trouble myself too much with. It seemed to me that our roles were not to question the state of the world, but rather to just move along and enjoy the sights while we're here. Because after all, this is just how the world is, right?   


But really, after much introspection and self-reflection, it just feels to me like a long history of men being prideful and celebrating their own accomplishments as if they're more important than the accomplishments of our life-mandating, equally important, other halves, women. It seems like it's been men seeking to preserve our own victories, our own glories, and our own achievements for fear of not being ""relevant"" in the grand scheme of things. For fear of our own mortality, or rather, our lack of immortality. Another way of saying it is; Men seek self-preservation for fear of our own insecurities.    


The end result of behaving based on fear of our own insecurities is that I believe we men, for the most part of recorded millennia, have propped ourselves up over women due to these insecurities.   


I'm not fond of self-preservation at the expense of others like this. And that to me is what it feels like has been happening when it comes to the relationship between men and women, and it's been going on like this for a VERY long time.   


I also further believe that it has a long history of being done in the name of ""protecting"" women, or ""providing"" for women. This being due to man's physical strength, or more recently, the amount of income he can provide in comparison to her. For this, I think back to more brutal times when perhaps this protection and provision was a little more valuable to both genders. But when it comes to protection, I need to ask, what is it that we men believe women need protecting from in this domesticated man-made world, besides men ourselves?   


And that's what I believe is one of the final pieces of the puzzle of man and woman. I believe that men fear other men when it comes to women. Especially if they consider the women ""their"" women. Much like I feel when I'm around my beloved and we're around other men. (Oh, how I would love to rid myself of these outdated feelings!)   


But what then is it that we really fear? Is it other men? In my opinion, yes, but not exactly. I feel we fear that we see ourselves, our actions, our intentions, in these other men. In other words, we fear our own self-reflections.  


I've written to myself before, ""How could other men NOT value my beloved, as highly as I do!""... And just for the record, since we're here, I want to tell you that I now hope that they do value her as greatly as I do. And I hope that this happens for her constantly! She deserves it!   


However, as I say this, I must also admit that sadly I fear I have not been able to fully master my own insecurities yet. I'm not sure it's possible for me no matter how hard I try or what ideals I strive for. As it's still too much for me to be within physically proximity of my beloved whilst not receiving reciprocation for my seemingly unending and perpetual feelings for her. And to me it's now inevitable that if I'm around her while in this fragile and insecure state, a state of rejection, that it's a severe and devastating detriment to my own self-love. And I'm not yet ready to give up my self-love! I've only just found it!  


So, I believe that a part of this great puzzle, the puzzle of man and woman, is that man fears his own self-reflection in others. But I don't believe that we always fear it. In fact I often feel we celebrate finding ourselves in others. And it's one of the best ways we can truly connect with one another! However, whether we're fearing it or celebrating it, I do believe that we often presume that others would feel similar to ourselves as we ourselves do.  


Further, I believe that the fear of these self-reflections most often occur when it comes to things outside ourselves that we perceive to exist in scarcity. If things are abundant we have no need for fear of sharing. However, if things are scarce, it's been my experience that we seek to enjoy them privately for fear of loss. For fear of self-preservation of our own personal joys, our own experiences. And what could be more scarce than an utterly unique individual whom we absolutely love and adore above all else? So, I think this fear of our own self-reflections, the fear of losing something of great scarcity to another, is one of the the root driving forces for much of the ""evil"" that's been, and is currently being inflicted upon this world.  


Also, I would like to say that I don't think that this is applicable to just men... I think it's applicable to men AND women. Because it's clear to me that women also fear the power of other women when it comes to ""their"" men.  


Digging deeper, I believe there's an even greater fear tied into all of this. The fear of facing your reflection only to discover that your reflection is perceived as ""better"" than yourself. The fear that those who we've chosen to value above all others, the loves of our lives, will find more value in these supposed ""imposter-self-reflections"" than in our very selves.  


I believe we fear the self-doubt this brings. We fear the rejection from those whom we love. Which is in a way a rejection of a supposed form of immortality, the ""right to reproduce."" So it's my belief that we've been too often behaving in fear, and are more often than not ruled by these very feelings of our own insecurities.   


And to reiterate, this has never been more apparent to me than when it comes to valuing things which we perceive to have great scarcity. As I stated above, it's when we perceive that something is scarce that I believe we all suddenly no longer have the intrinsic and empathetic desire to share it with others. This is when I believe individuals start treating scarce things in their lives as if they're ""theirs"" instead of as a shared resource, or ""ours.""   


Which brings me to the final point of this observation. Since when should anybody, man or woman, ever have the right to call another ""theirs"" in the first place. This strange feeling of ownership over each other may actually be the true root of the problem. The. The proble.... The problem of the problem of the problem of he problem of he Puzzle of Man and Woman.   


Actually, I've heard this form of ownership termed slightly differently before and I mentioned it briefly above. I've heard it known as one's ""right to reproduce."" Which, I'd like to point out is, AGAIN, another act of self-preservation. Or in even more other words, I believe it's just another attempt at achieving some feeble form of immortality. The insecurity of all insecurities.   


I think we can all safely agree that we would never ourselves like to be owned by another. Perhaps temporarily it could be fun! But never indefinitely. Further, I even feel that it may be just as wrong to fully ""give"" yourself to just ONE other. It's still your freedom. It's you, it's literally all you have. To give yourself away indefinitely also seems just as wrong. Even if you believe it was your choice to begin with.   


But remember that these thoughts come from someone who's been thoroughly well versed in the art of accepting rejection. Someone who's comfortable walking the realm of unreciprocated feelings. Someone who's not felt the warm coupling embrace of love in some time. So in other words, I'm currently not enchanted by love's bedazzling spell. But I surely do recall the feelings of it. The desire to become one whole flesh. To truly unite. To love as greatly and as deeply as possible. To truly give one another to each other fully.   


Perhaps this is the big joke on humanity. ""God's"" great source of laughter, especially when it comes to men and women. In order for life to succeed in the face of such ever present entropy life needs to cast it's most powerful spell upon us. The spell of the desire for one's own self-preservation, one's immortality. Immortality even at the expense of the freedoms others.  


Pursuing this dream, this spell, wandering about ever-seeking our own immortality, our supposed conquering of our own insecurities about our own mortality seems like it should be considered a noble and just one, does it not? It seems and feels like it's intrinsically what we're supposed to do, right? It seems like it's what life wants from us. Nay, it feels like that's what life demands from us!   


Life seems to say, go forth and preserve yourselves at whatever the cost in order for your own form of life to continue. But therein lies the problem. I believe too often than not, in the pursuit of our own immortality, in our hasty scurry from our own insecurities, we forget the simplest of behaviors. The simplest of our own true desires. The desires spoken by each of our own childlike guiding voice that I believe we all have access to. The soft and gentle part of each of ourselves that whispers that age old rule, the golden one, ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.""  


To conclude, I believe that a life lived deliberately is a life lived well. So I am actively trying to deliberately embrace my own insecurities while casting off my own desires for self-preservation each and every single day. I like the thought of trying to embrace each other's differences and practicing celebrating with each other each of our many uniquenesses. Our variety. Our very own form of life's beautiful expression of itself. I like this as opposed to thinking of each other as better or lesser self-reflections of each other.   


My whole life it's seemed that at every possible corner, every moment you give someone a chance, there's an individual or group of individuals that are ready and waiting and are more than willing to hawk their own personal wares as to what they perceive is the uncontested and most obvious ""best"" or correct way to live. It comes in the form of religion, or national patriotism, or a career path, or a group of friends, or a genre of music, or how to spend your free time. It doesn't really matter. The point is that they all seem to believe that for whatever reason, their way is the most correct way. The best way. The ONE way.   


Well I too believe that there is ""one"" best way to live, and that this ""one"" way is as unique to each individual as is their very own thumbprint. I believe there are as many right ways to be as there are birds, bees, rivers, streams, leaves, and trees. I'd like to believe that if we all remember to treat each other as we ourselves would like to be treated that there would be a significant difference in in the amount of suffering in this world.   


Imagine if life itself were actively taught as an artform. Where there were no better or lesser ways to live, only different ways. I feel that if we deliberately practice living life in this way we'll all have been contributors to the greatest tapestry ever painted. And that's a beautiful thing in and of itself, don't you think?

71,"but no one really gives any helpful advice on how to do this. 

I've read tons from Jung, Zen, Taoism, Stoicism, literature, self-help, and come away with nothing. I've gone on big trips, seen and experienced messed up shit, and still know nothing. I feel like nothing. I am very tired of this constant feeling confusion and anxiety and helplessness. I understand you can't ever really act honestly if you don't know yourself, but. how do you know yourself? nothing makes sense. the only thing that makes any sense to me is drinking, chain smoking, and finding some way to die. 25 years of this shit and I've just gone in circles.

for those of you who know yourselves, feel peace, or are at least on the journey, how do you do it?",17Aug2018,15
73,"Today I returned home after being away the entire month. I planned all day to hang out with a friend and go out to drink with her. We talked in the morning and decided to talk again later at night. She said she is probably going out with her friends and that I can join them but that nothing is decided yet and that when she’ll know where we are going and when she’ll talk to me. 
I was very excited all day to finally see her and hang out after a rough month, and stayed awake waiting for my cue to go. 
Two hours later I see an Instagram story of her and her friends at a bar. 
When I asked her why she didn’t talk to me like she promised, she said she forgot. 
I feel devastated. I waited all day to go out with her and she just forgets me... I feel like a burden now, like she’s doing me a favor by even talking to me. 
How am I supposed to feel? I don’t have any close friends and I felt so lonely for the past 2 years. I thought I finally made a friend and she stabs me in the back. I’m tired of this feeling. I don’t know what to do. I don’t understand what’s wrong with me...",17Aug2018,1

75,"I do not seek help about fixing this problem since it just happens a while later again, even after working, even with multiple PC's these error happens often.

Rant:

FUCKING SHITTY SHIT STORE, I LIKE PLAY ANYWHERE AND I WANT MICROSOFT TO SUCCEED WITH THIS BUT THEY'RE SO FUCKING INCOMPETENT.

IT'S FUCKING RIDICULES THERE STILL CAN BE DOWNLOAD AND INSTALLING PROBLEMS IN THIS AGE OF PC's.


This stuff have worked for so many years, Http web downloads and Steam have never failed without the server failing, yet for some reason Windows Store struggles doing such an simple task that has so much research on it as we have done it for years with no problems.

It's like they hired people with no knowledge about PC's at all and made them design this, but not just do their programmer do a horrible job at this, the management heck even the CEO's should be fired for not doing anything about this huge disaster.

Everyone I know have had download and install problems with ""Apps"" on Windows Store, sometimes you're lucky and it works, some time some updates comes and it all brakes again. It doesn't matter how many Windows PC's you have, they will get these problems too, and don't even think about fixing it since it's such closed system there isn't much that can get fixed by the user, and even if you are lucky and get it to work it will break soon after again.

To think these people who work on this have succeed at getting a great education and earns thousands of dollars, is almost a big fucking joke I mean it's not even the programmers who are to blame for this it's the management or CEO's, even a fucking uneducated Red Neck in the middle of bumfuck town could have enough neroens in his brain to rub together and come to the conclusion that the store is a fucking joke and everyone who works with it either need to get fired or it needs to have tons of money invest in it. That fucking red neck could do a better job than these highly educated rich fuckers with their high degree in their Ivory towers.",17Aug2018,4
